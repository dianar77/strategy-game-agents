If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:\n   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>\n\nINITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:\n- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources\n- Focus heavily on ore and wheat hexes for your initial settlements\n- Place settlements on intersections of complementary resources (ore/wheat or wood/brick)\n- Between your two settlements, secure at least one good source of each critical resource: ore, wheat, and sheep\n- If you must sacrifice a resource, make it brick (unless a brick-port is available)\n- Place initial roads toward valuable future expansion areas or resource-rich areas\n- Consider ports that match resources you expect to produce in abundance (especially sheep)\n- Avoid placing settlements that will be trapped with no expansion opportunities\n\nDEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY (PRIMARY PATH TO VICTORY):\n- Buy development cards whenever you have excess sheep/wheat/ore\n- Development cards provide hidden victory points and tactical advantages\n- Use knights strategically to protect your high-producing hexes from the robber\n- Save knight cards for when your high-production hexes are blocked by the robber\n- Time monopoly cards for when opponents likely have accumulated resources you need\n- Use Year of Plenty cards to complete crucial builds when you're short specific resources\n- Aggressively pursue largest army (2 VP) if you've already played 2 or more knights\n- Aim to secure 3-4 victory point cards throughout the game for a surprise win\n- Keep your victory points hidden until you can win in a single turn\n\nRESOURCE MANAGEMENT:\n- Early-game: Secure minimal expansion to reach critical resource spots or ports\n- Mid-game: Focus heavily on ore and wheat to upgrade settlements to cities\n- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each potential build (cities give best return)\n- Target 2-3 cities before extensive road building, unless going for longest road\n- Avoid accumulating 7+ resources before dice rolls\n- Never make trades that directly help opponents score immediate points\n- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades\n\nROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:\n- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning\n- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't easily access\n- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build\n- Avoid placing the robber where it equally hurts all players - be strategic\n- Don't place the robber on resources you're deficient in - this reduces trading options\n- Consider the timing of knight cards - save them for critical moments\n\nPATH TO VICTORY PLANNING:\n- Primary Win Path: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 10 VP\n- Alternative Win Path: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + victory point cards (4 VP) = 10 VP\n- Always track your potential hidden victory points vs. visible points\n- If you have development cards giving you hidden points, focus on resource gathering\n- When you're close to 10 points, calculate whether to reveal victory points immediately\n- Keep track of your opponent's visible points AND potential hidden points\n- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns\n\nEXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:\n- Build roads only when they lead to valuable settlement locations\n- Prioritize settlements that increase your resource diversity or production probability\n- Secure key ports that complement your resource production\n- Block opponents' critical expansion paths\n- Calculate whether longest road (2 VP) is worth the resource investment\n- For each settlement expansion, evaluate whether the resources gained justify the cost\n\nBEFORE MAKING A DECISION:\n1. Is there a faster path to 10 victory points?\n2. Are development cards a more efficient way to get victory points right now?\n3. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?\n4. Will this action help or hinder your opponent's strategy?\n5. Do you have enough resources to execute your plan for the next few turns?\n\nBoard Understanding Guide:\n- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers\n- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile\n- \ud83d\udd0d marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex\n- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section\n- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy\n- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)",

Build 3-4 total settlements in strong positions \n2. Upgrade 2-3 settlements to cities (4-6 VP total)\n3. Secure longest road (2 VP) OR largest army (2 VP)\n4. Reach 10 VP through a combination of settlements, cities, and special cards\n\nPATH TO VICTORY (ALTERNATIVE):\n1. Focus heavily on ore/wheat production\n2. Build 2 cities (4 VP) and maintain 2 settlements (2 VP)\n3. Buy strategic development cards for hidden VPs and knights\n4. Win with combination of cities, settlements, and largest army\n\nBEFORE MAKING A DECISION:\n1. Analyze the board state, including all players' visible points and potential hidden points\n2. Consider whether your move helps your victory path or hinders opponents\n3. Calculate the most resource-efficient build that advances your position\n4.

High-probability production (total pip count)\n  2. Access to resources you currently lack\n  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, securing future expansion)\n  4. Proximity to useful ports\n- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing\n- Longest road (2 VP) requires strategic planning - only pursue if you already have 4+ roads built\n\nROBBER STRATEGY:\n- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning\n- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily\n- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build\n- When someone has 8+ points, ALWAYS target them with the robber regardless of other factors\n- If you're being targeted by the robber, consider using knight cards immediately to protect production\n\nTURN-BY-TURN PLANNING:\n1. Start each turn by assessing your current VP and opponents' VPs (both visible and potential hidden points)\n2. Identify your build priority for this turn: settlement, city, road, or development card?\n3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for your priority build\n4. If you can't build your priority item, determine if trading or buying a development card is better\n5. Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card or trade for needed resources\n6. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly\n\nWINNING PATHS:\n1. CITY-FOCUSED PATH: 3-4 cities (6-8 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 9-11 VP\n2. BALANCED PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 VP card = 10 VP\n3. DEVELOPMENT PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP\n\nNEVER SAY NO TO FREE VPs:\n- Always account for the 2 VP from longest road and largest army in your plans\n- These special cards are EASY to lose if you're not defending them\n- Invest in roads/knights to maintain your lead if these VPs are part of your strategy\n- Be alert for opponents trying to steal these bonus points\n\nBoard Understanding Guide:\n- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers\n- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile\n- \ud83d\udd0d marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex\n- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section\n- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy\n- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)",

If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:\n   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>\n\nINITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRUCIAL):\n- HIGHEST PRIORITY: Target the BEST ORE and WHEAT hexes with high probability numbers (6, 8, 5, 9)\n- Place settlements on intersections with MAXIMUM \"PIP COUNT\" (probability dots on the number tokens)\n- Initial settlements should be on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options\n- Aim for RESOURCE DIVERSITY between your two settlements (try to cover all 5 resources)\n- Place on at least ONE good ORE hex and ONE good WHEAT hex between your two settlements\n- Never place both settlements on the SAME RESOURCE - diversify your income!\n- Initial roads should point toward valuable expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center\n- Evaluate settlements by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential\n- Avoid placements that will be blocked or trapped by opponents\n- Plan ahead to maximize the value of your FIRST TWO cities (initial settlements)\n\nDOMINANT CITY-FOCUSED STRATEGY:\n- EARLY GAME (1-5 turns): Build ONE additional settlement to secure critical resources you lack\n- MID GAME (6-15 turns): UPGRADE TO CITIES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE - this is your primary goal!\n- NEVER trade away ore or wheat unless you're getting ore or wheat in return\n- Aim for 2+ CITIES by mid-game (doubles resource production at key locations)\n- ONE CITY PRODUCING DOUBLES YOUR INCOME - prioritize upgrading over new settlements\n- Buy development cards when excess sheep/wheat/ore are available\n- Only build roads to reach essential new settlement spots\n- Be willing to trade away brick/wood/sheep to get ore/wheat for cities\n- Calculate city ROI - upgrading early yields more resources over the game's duration\n\nWINNING PATH:\n1. Primary Goal: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army/longest road (2 VP) = 10 VP\n2. Alternative: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP\n3. Track potential hidden VP (development cards) - hide your true score until you can win\n4. Focus on quality over quantity - cities > settlements for resource production\n\nDEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:\n- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore (especially sheep)\n- Save knights to protect your high-value hexes from the robber\n- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city build\n- Use Monopoly after high-probability rolls (target ore or wheat)\n- Knights also help secure Largest Army (2 VP) - need 3+ knights played\n- Keep track of VP cards drawn (max 5 in the deck)\n- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn\n\nEXPANSION PRIORITIES:\n- Build settlements ONLY when they provide critical missing resources\n- When choosing between multiple settlement locations, prioritize:\n  1. High-probability production (maximum pip count)\n  2. Access to resources you lack (especially ore/wheat)\n  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, access to ports)\n- Build roads WITH PURPOSE - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location\n- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win before committing resources\n- Consider port access if you're lacking specific resources\n\nRESOURCE MANAGEMENT:\n- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible\n- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency\n- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for cities\n- If resource-starved, expand to secure that resource rather than trading at poor rates\n- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, consider a development card\n\nROBBER STRATEGY:\n- Place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning\n- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily\n- When stealing, prioritize players with resources you need for your next city build\n- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes\n- Target hexes that affect multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact\n\nTURN-BY-TURN THINKING:\n1. Assess your current VP and opponents' VP (both visible and hidden)\n2. Identify your build priority: CITIES FIRST, then settlements only for critical resources\n3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for city upgrades\n4. If you can't build your priority item, trading or buying a development card may be better than roads\n5.
