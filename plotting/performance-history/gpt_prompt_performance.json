Secure wood and brick for efficient road-building. Expand strategically toward critical nodes and ensure open spots for settlements.\n2. Avoid prematurely competing for Longest Road; instead, plan a sudden, decisive push mid- to late-game. Position yourself for a unified road network.\n\n**City Upgrades**:\n1. Focus on upgrading settlements to cities early by converting sheep/brick/wood excess via trades or ports. This boosts resource production exponentially.\n2. Strike a balance between settlement expansion and city-building to maintain resource diversity.\n\n**Development Cards**:\n1. Leverage cards tactically to create flexibility (e.g., monopoly for critical resources, or knights to target critical opponents).\n2. Prioritize Largest Army and hidden VP cards to close victory point gaps stealthily.\n3. Play actionable cards a turn ahead when anticipating key moves.\n\n**Trading Strategy**:\n1. Use ports for impactful trades, minimizing inefficiencies. Optimize trades toward missing resources for city upgrades.\n2. Engage opponents strategically: Offer mutually beneficial trades to accelerate progress while limiting their gains.\n\n**Robber Placement**:\n1. Target cities and settlements on high-production hexes of the strongest opponent (e.g., highest current VP count).\n2. Avoid retaliatory targeting unless strategically necessary.

Prioritize intersections with high-production hex values (e.g., 6, 8) that also offer diversity in resources (wood, brick, wheat, ore).\n2. Ensure access to ore and wheat early to accelerate city-building goals. Avoid placements overly dependent on sheep.\n3.

Start with at least one settlement placement enabling road construction (wood and brick availability) and another focusing on wheat and ore for cities.\n2. Build roads toward additional resource-rich locations or strategic ports. Block opponent expansion where possible.\n3. Upgrade settlements on high-production tiles into cities as soon as possible. Cities greatly increase resource output, focusing production toward future upgrades and trades.\n\n### **Mid-to-Late Game City and Development Card Focus:**\n1. Trade aggressively for wheat and ore to ensure early upgrades to cities. Delay expansion until 1-2 cities have been built.\n2. Purchase development cards (e.g., Knights) to bolster defense, secure Largest Army (2 victory points), or use action cards (e.g., Monopoly, Road Building) to shift the game state.\n3. Use Monopoly strategically to gain key resources in abundance during critical turns.\n\n### **Trading Strategy:**\n1. Use ports efficiently to convert surplus resources into missing materials. However, prioritize 2:1 trades for maximum efficiency over 3:1 trades.\n2. Trade with other players carefully to avoid helping them disproportionately. Aim for trades that advance your cities, settlements, or VP goals directly.\n\n### **Optimal Robber and Knight Usage:**\n1. Place the robber onto critical tiles that slow opponents with high VP scores or rare resource access. Avoid provoking unnecessary retaliation.\n2. Knights should be used to shift the robber defensively and work toward securing Largest Army. Position the robber after Knight use to benefit resource production.\n\n### **Longest Road Consideration:**\n1. Expand your road network toward open nodes to secure key locations for settlements and ports, creating potential for Longest Road.\n2.

Ensure placements disrupt their strategy without provoking unnecessary retaliation.\n- Reposition the robber using Knights to maximize resource acquisition and safeguard your tiles from revenge targeting.\n\n**Road & Longest Road Considerations:**\n- Build roads strategically to secure key nodes, expand settlement options, and block opponents effectively.\n- Avoid competing for Longest Road early at the detriment of wheat and ore acquisition for city-building.\n- Contest Longest Road only if it complements settlement expansion and adds decisive VP in the late game.\n\n**Execution Flow:**\n1. Focus on actions that maximize wheat and ore intake for city-building (e.g., trades, robber usage, port strategies).\n2. Prioritize city upgrades over settlement expansions for exponential scaling.\n3. Use Development Cards (especially Knights and Monopoly) tactically to disrupt opponents and advance VP goals.\n4. Play proactively through port utilization and targeted robber placements to control resource flow and keep opponents from scaling effectively.\n5.

    "prompt_used": "You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.\n\nRules:\n1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions\n2. Your aim is to WIN. That means 10 victory points.\n3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \\boxed{5}\n4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number\n5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:\n   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>\n6. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively\n7. Think about the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action\n\nBoard Understanding Guide:\n- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers\n- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile\n- \ud83d\udd0d marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex\n- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section\n- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy\n- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)\n\n**Strategic Guidelines for Victory:**\n\n**Early Settlement Placement:**\n- Prioritize placements with wheat and ore as these are essential for city-building in the early game. Aim for intersections with high probabilities (e.g., tiles marked 6, 8, or 9).\n- If faced with trade-offs, prioritize wheat and ore over wood or brick for road-building. Use trades strategically to acquire the missing resources.\n- Ensure one of your settlements provides access to sheep to enable Development Card purchases.\n\n**City-Building Focus:**\n- Transition to cities early by prioritizing wheat and ore acquisition through resource trades, robber usage, or ports.\n- Avoid stockpiling low-impact resources like excess brick and wood, as these delay city upgrades.\n- City-building yields exponential resource gains and should be prioritized before additional settlement expansions.\n\n**Trading & Port Usage:**\n- Trade aggressively to secure missing resources (typically wheat and ore) for settlements and cities. Avoid trades that overly benefit opponents.\n- Leverage ports for efficient 2:1 trades, especially when you overproduce low-value resources. Ports can compensate for imbalanced resource production.\n\n**Development Card Utility:**\n- Prioritize Knights early to secure Largest Army and mitigate robber impacts. Larger Army offers 2 Victory Points.\n- Use Monopoly cards strategically to disrupt opponents and secure critical resources (ore, wheat) during decisive turns.\n- VP Development cards should complement cities and Largest Army as your end-game strategy.\n\n**Robber Placement:**\n- Target competitors producing critical resources (e.g., ore/wheat) or leading in Victory Points. Ensure placements disrupt their strategy without provoking unnecessary retaliation.\n- Reposition the robber using Knights to maximize resource acquisition and safeguard your tiles from revenge targeting.\n\n**Road & Longest Road Considerations:**\n- Build roads strategically to secure key nodes, expand settlement options, and block opponents effectively.\n- Avoid competing for Longest Road early at the detriment of wheat and ore acquisition for city-building.\n- Contest Longest Road only if it complements settlement expansion and adds decisive VP in the late game.\n\n**Execution Flow:**\n1. Focus on actions that maximize wheat and ore intake for city-building (e.g., trades, robber usage, port strategies).\n2. Prioritize city upgrades over settlement expansions for exponential scaling.\n3. Use Development Cards (especially Knights and Monopoly) tactically to disrupt opponents and advance VP goals.\n4. Play proactively through port utilization and targeted robber placements to control resource flow and keep opponents from scaling effectively.\n5.
