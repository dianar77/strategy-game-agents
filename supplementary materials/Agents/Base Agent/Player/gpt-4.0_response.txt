To decide the best location for the initial settlement as BLUE, we should focus on nodes that offer access to diverse resources and numbers with high probabilities (e.g., 6, 8, 5, 9). Additionally, we should consider blocking or avoiding proximity to RED's settlement at node 22. Taking these factors into account, a favorable position is node 20, adjacent to tiles that produce SHEEP, ORE, and WOOD, with numbers 6, 11, and 6 respectively.

The action corresponding to node 20 has the index number:

\boxed{19}
