To determine the best action for the BLUE player, let's analyze the game state step by step:

1. **Resource Diversity and Strategic Placement:**
   - The RED player has already placed a settlement at node 15, which produces 🧱BRICK, 🐑SHEEP, and 🌲WOOD.
   - The initial settlement should ideally provide access to a diverse set of resources and strategic road placement options.

2. **Available Resources and Nodes:**
   - We need to look for nodes that provide access to a variety of resources and are not blocked by the robber.
   - Nodes that provide access to multiple resource types and have strategic road placement options are preferable.

3. **Analyzing Potential Nodes:**
   - **Node 0:** Provides access to 🌲WOOD, 🧱BRICK, and 🌾WHEAT.
   - **Node 1:** Provides access to 🌲WOOD, 🧱BRICK, and 🌾WHEAT.
   - **Node 2:** Provides access to 🌲WOOD, 🧱BRICK, and 🌾WHEAT.
