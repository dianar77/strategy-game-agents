# Initial Settlement Placement Analysis

I need to choose the best location for my first settlement. This is a critical decision that will determine what resources I'll have access to initially. Let me analyze this carefully.

## Key Factors to Consider:
1. Access to diverse resources (ideally all 5)
2. High probability dice numbers (6, 8, 5, 9)
3. Potential for expansion
4. Proximity to ports
5. Avoiding blocking myself in

## Analyzing Best Spots:
Let me look at some promising intersections where multiple hexes meet:

### Node 17:
- Connected to 🌲4 (low prob), ⛏️8 (good prob), 🌲9 (good prob)
- Two wood sources but missing brick for roads, wheat & sheep

### Node 37:
- Near 🌲4, 🧱8, 🌲9
- Good brick and wood access for early roads
- On the 🐑 2:1 port path

### Node 3:
- Connected to 🐑5, 🌾10, ⛏️3
- Good wheat (10), decent sheep (5), but weak ore (3)
- Access to multiple resources

### Node 4:
- Connected to 🐑5, 🌾10, ⛏️8
- Very good probabilities (5, 8, 10)
- Good mix of sheep, wheat, and ore

### Node 0:
- Connected to 🌾10, 🐑2, 🌾10
- Double wheat (10) is valuable, but sheep (2) is low probability
- Limited resource diversity

### Node 15:
- Connected to 🐑5, ⛏️8, 🌲4
- Good mix with decent probabilities
- Access to wood, ore, and sheep

### Node 34:
- Connected to 🧱8, 🏜️-, 🌲9
- Good wood (9) and brick (8) for roads
- Desert tile means only two producing resources

## Best Options:
After careful analysis, I believe the strongest positions are:

1. **Node 4**: Excellent probabilities (5, 8, 10) with diverse resources (sheep, wheat, ore)
2. **Node 15**: Good mix with decent probabilities (5, 8, 4) and diverse resources (sheep, ore, wood)
3. **Node 37**: Good brick and wood access (8, 9, 4) for early roads

For my first settlement, I want access to high-probability diverse resources. Node 4 gives me sheep, wheat and ore with excellent probabilities, which will support development cards and cities later.

<plan>
1. Place initial settlement at node 4 for high-probability diverse resources
2. Second settlement will target brick and wood access for roads
3. Early focus on development cards with ore and sheep
4. Aim for largest army or opportunistic expansion based on resource flow
</plan>

\boxed{4}
