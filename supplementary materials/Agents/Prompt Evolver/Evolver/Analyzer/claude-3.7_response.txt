  Args:
    new_text: You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your goal is to analyze the game state thoroughly and make the optimal decision to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Second priority: Ensure access to ore and wheat for city development
- Aim to cover all five resources between your two settlements, or secure access to useful ports
- Place roads strategically toward future expansion opportunities, not toward the center
- Avoid placing settlements that will be "trapped" with no room to expand
- Consider starting near a port that matches resources you expect to have in abundance
- Look for spots where complementary resources (like brick/wood or ore/wheat) are adjacent

MID-GAME RESOURCE PRIORITIES:
- Early-game: Secure brick and wood for settlements and roads to expand production
- Mid-game: Focus on ore and wheat for city upgrades (3 VP for 5 resources is optimal)
- Always calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each building option (cities are most efficient)
- Track resource scarcity and use this for trading leverage
- Never trade resources that help opponents achieve immediate victory point gains

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Development cards are most valuable when:
  * You need hidden victory points to surprise opponents
  * You need knights to break up longest road or secure largest army
  * You need monopoly/year of plenty to complete a crucial build
- Try to maintain largest army (2 VP) if you've already invested in multiple knights
- Save knights for defensive purposes if you're producing valuable resources

EXPANSION STRATEGY:
- Prioritize settlements that increase your resource diversity
- Target valuable ports that complement your production
- Block opponents' expansion when it threatens your strategy
- Build roads only with a clear settlement location in mind
- Calculate whether longest road (2 VP) is worth the resource investment

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Consider the timing of knight cards - save them for critical moments
- If possible, coordinate robber placement to disrupt multiple strong opponents

TRADING TACTICS:
- Never accept 1:1 trades unless absolutely necessary for an immediate win
- Offer favorable trades early game to build goodwill; be ruthless late-game
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting bad player trades
- Track which resources opponents need and use that for leverage
- When trading with the bank, ensure the gained resource completes a build

ENDGAME STRATEGY:
- In the late game, hide your victory point potential (keep development cards hidden)
- Calculate the fastest path to 10 VP and focus exclusively on that path
- Misdirect opponents about your strategy when possible
- Prepare contingency plans if your primary strategy is blocked
- Be aware of the exact number of remaining development cards

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- üîç marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

Before finalizing your action, check:
1. Is there a more efficient path to victory points?
2. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
3. Does this move help or hinder opponents?
4. Are you properly diversified against dice probability?================================= Tool Message =================================

Based on my analysis of the game logs and research, I've made several significant improvements to the prompt for PromptRefiningLLMPlayer_C:

### Key Improvements Made:

1. **Enhanced Initial Placement Strategy**
   - Added specific prioritization of high-probability numbers (6 & 8)
   - Emphasized the importance of avoiding "trapped" settlements with no expansion potential
   - Added guidance on complementary resource adjacency

2. **Resource Management**
   - Structured clear resource priorities for different game phases
   - Added VP-to-resource ratio calculation guidance
   - Emphasized the importance of tracking resource scarcity as a trading leverage

3. **Development Card Strategy**
   - Added specific scenarios when development cards are most valuable
   - Included guidance on knight card usage and timing
   - Added strategy for largest army acquisition

4. **Robber Placement Strategy**
   - Added sophisticated targeting criteria based on opponent strength
   - Included considerations for resource disruption
   - Added guidance on strategic knight card deployment

5. **Trading Tactics**
   - Provided clearer guidelines on acceptable trade ratios
   - Added specific recommendations about port trading vs. player trades
   - Emphasized the importance of tracking opponent needs

6. **Expansion and Endgame Strategy**
   - Added concrete guidance on settlement prioritization
   - Included advice on hiding victory point potential in the late game
   - Added contingency planning recommendation

The current performance shows our player is winning 2 out of 5 games, with an average of 7.2 victory points, while AlphaBetaPlayer wins 3 out of 5 with 9.0 victory points on average. The analysis of game logs revealed that our player:

1. Frequently made suboptimal initial placements
2. Didn't effectively leverage development card strategy
3. Made inefficient trading decisions
4. Didn't focus enough on city development (crucial for victory point efficiency)

The new prompt addresses all these weaknesses with specific, actionable guidance. It balances short-term thinking with long-term strategy, and ensures the player considers both offensive moves (building toward victory) and defensive tactics (blocking opponents).

The most significant improvement is the structured phase-based thinking, helping the LLM understand which resources and building types to prioritize at different stages of the game. This should substantially improve our player's decision-making and competitive performance against AlphaBetaPlayer.Evolve Counter: 8
