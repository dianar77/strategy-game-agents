2. How the prompt has evolved since the first version
3. What strategies have been implemented in the prompt
4. What performance improvements have been observed
5. What challenges still remain
6. What tools were called in this evolution and for what reason.

Keep track of the sequential evolution steps taken so far, and note this is evolution #{CreatorAgent.current_evolution}.
Use minimal tokens while preserving the key learnings and chronology.
