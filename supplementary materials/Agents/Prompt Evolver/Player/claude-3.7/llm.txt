PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist with expert development card planning. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Focus heavily on ore and wheat hexes for your initial settlements
- Place settlements on intersections of complementary resources (ore/wheat or wood/brick)
- Between your two settlements, secure at least one good source of each critical resource: ore, wheat, and sheep
- If you must sacrifice a resource, make it brick (unless a brick-port is available)
- Place initial roads toward valuable future expansion areas or resource-rich areas
- Consider ports that match resources you expect to produce in abundance (especially sheep)
- Avoid placing settlements that will be trapped with no expansion opportunities

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY (PRIMARY PATH TO VICTORY):
- Buy development cards whenever you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Development cards provide hidden victory points and tactical advantages
- Use knights strategically to protect your high-producing hexes from the robber
- Save knight cards for when your high-production hexes are blocked by the robber
- Time monopoly cards for when opponents likely have accumulated resources you need
- Use Year of Plenty cards to complete crucial builds when you're short specific resources
- Aggressively pursue largest army (2 VP) if you've already played 2 or more knights
- Aim to secure 3-4 victory point cards throughout the game for a surprise win
- Keep your victory points hidden until you can win in a single turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Early-game: Secure minimal expansion to reach critical resource spots or ports
- Mid-game: Focus heavily on ore and wheat to upgrade settlements to cities
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each potential build (cities give best return)
- Target 2-3 cities before extensive road building, unless going for longest road
- Avoid accumulating 7+ resources before dice rolls
- Never make trades that directly help opponents score immediate points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Avoid placing the robber where it equally hurts all players - be strategic
- Don't place the robber on resources you're deficient in - this reduces trading options
- Consider the timing of knight cards - save them for critical moments

PATH TO VICTORY PLANNING:
- Primary Win Path: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 10 VP
- Alternative Win Path: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + victory point cards (4 VP) = 10 VP
- Always track your potential hidden victory points vs. visible points
- If you have development cards giving you hidden points, focus on resource gathering
- When you're close to 10 points, calculate whether to reveal victory points immediately
- Keep track of your opponent's visible points AND potential hidden points
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads only when they lead to valuable settlement locations
- Prioritize settlements that increase your resource diversity or production probability
- Secure key ports that complement your resource production
- Block opponents' critical expansion paths
- Calculate whether longest road (2 VP) is worth the resource investment
- For each settlement expansion, evaluate whether the resources gained justify the cost

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Is there a faster path to 10 victory points?
2. Are development cards a more efficient way to get victory points right now?
3. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
4. Will this action help or hinder your opponent's strategy?
5. Do you have enough resources to execute your plan for the next few turns?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

RESPONSE:
I need to analyze the available options for my initial settlement placement carefully, focusing on high-probability numbers and resource diversity.

Looking at the board:
- Red has already placed a settlement at node 1, connecting to three resources: ore (10), brick (6), and wheat (4)
- I need to evaluate the resource values and combinations for each available node

First, let me identify the key resources and their probabilities:
- Ore (10) - Medium probability
- Wheat (4 and 3) - Lower probability 
- Brick (6) - High probability
- Sheep (5) - Medium probability
- Wood (9) - Low-medium probability
- Desert with robber (no production)

Let me analyze the most promising nodes:

Node 16: Connects to wheat (3) and wood (9)
- Access to two different resources, but not high-probability numbers

Node 3: Connects to desert (blocked by robber), ore (10), and sheep (5)
- Good access to ore and sheep with decent probabilities
- The desert hex provides no resources but is currently blocked by the robber

Node 4: Connects to ore (10), sheep (5), and wood (9)
- Excellent diversity with three different resources
- Medium-probability numbers (5, 9, 10)

Node 5: Connects to ore (10) and wood (9)
- Only two resources, though ore is valuable

Node 9: Connects to desert (blocked by robber) and brick (6)
- High-probability brick (6) is valuable early-game
- But only one productive resource

Node 12: Connects to desert (blocked by robber) and sheep (5)
- Limited resource access

Looking at my strategy priorities:
1. Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) - brick (6) is available
2. Focus on ore and wheat - ore (10) is available
3. Secure complementary resources - ore/wheat or wood/brick combinations
4. Between settlements, secure ore, wheat, and sheep - currently evaluating first settlement

Node 4 offers the best resource diversity (ore, sheep, and wood) with reasonable probability numbers (10, 5, 9). This gives me three different resources on a single settlement, which is optimal for early game resource collection.

For my development card strategy, securing ore (for cities and development cards) and sheep (for development cards) early is valuable. Node 4 provides both.

<plan>
1. Place initial settlement at node 4 to secure ore, sheep, and wood
2. For second settlement, prioritize wheat access and high probability numbers
3. Focus on development card strategy by collecting ore/wheat/sheep
4. Aim for 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 10 VP
</plan>

Based on this analysis, I choose:

\boxed{1}
