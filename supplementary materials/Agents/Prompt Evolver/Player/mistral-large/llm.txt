PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN. That means 10 victory points.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \\boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>
6. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively
7. Think about the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

### Early Game Placement Strategy
- Aim for a diverse set of resources and strategic road placement.

### Mid-Game Resource Management
- Focus on acquiring necessary resources and engaging in trades with other players.

### Late-Game Victory Point Optimization
- Prioritize settlements and cities in high victory point locations and use development cards strategically.

### Effective Trading and Negotiation
- Actively seek trades with other players using reciprocity and goodwill.

### Development Card Usage
- Use development cards strategically and keep some hidden.

### Robber Placement Strategy
- Focus on disrupting the leading player's resource production.

❓ Select action by number (0-53):


Based on this information, which action number do you choose? Think step by step about your options, then put the final action number in a box like \boxed{1}.
RESPONSE:
To make the best decision for the initial settlement placement, we need to consider the following factors:

1. **Resource Diversity**: Ensure that the initial settlements provide a diverse set of resources.
2. **High-Probability Numbers**: Place settlements on tiles with high-probability dice numbers (5, 6, 8, 9, 10) to maximize resource production.
3. **Port Access**: Consider nodes that are close to ports for better trading opportunities.
4. **Future Expansion**: Think about how the placement will facilitate future road and settlement expansions.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify High-Probability Tiles**:
   - 🌲5 at (1, -2, 1)
   - 🌲5 at (2, -2, 0)
   - 🌲8 at (-1, 1, 0)
   - 🌲8 at (2, -1, -1)
   - 🌾6 at (-2, 0, 2)
   - 🌾6 at (0, -1, 1)
   - 🐑10 at (0, -2, 2)
   - 🐑11 at (-2, 2, 0)
   - ⛏️6 at (-1, -1, 2)
   - ⛏️11 at (-2, 2, 0)

2. **Resource Diversity**:
   - We need to ensure that our initial settlements provide a mix of wood, brick, wheat, sheep, and ore.

3. **Port Access**:
   - Nodes close to ports: 28, 29 (2:1 Wood), 32, 33 (2:1 Ore), 38, 39 (2:1 Wheat), 40, 44 (2:1 Sheep), 45, 47 (2:1 Brick).

4. **Potential Initial Settlements**:
   - **Node 8**: Access to 🌲5 (1, -2, 1) and 🌲5 (2, -2, 0). Good for wood production.
   - **Node 11**: Access to ⛏️6 (-1, -1, 2) and 🐑10 (0, -2, 2). Good for ore and sheep production.
   - **Node 13**: Access to ⛏️6 (-1, -1, 2) and 🌾6 (-2, 0, 2). Good for ore and wheat production.
   - **Node 14**: Access to 🌾6 (-2, 0, 2) and 🐑11 (-1, 0, 1). Good for wheat and sheep production.
   - **Node 20**: Access to 🌾4 (1, 0, -1) and 🌾12 (-2, 1, 1). Good for wheat production.
   - **Node 23**: Access to 🌾4 (1, 0, -1) and ⛏️3 (1, 1, -2). Good for wheat and ore production.

### Strategic Plan:
<plan>Build initial settlements at nodes that provide diverse resources and are close to ports. Aim for nodes 8 and 13 for the first two settlements to cover wood, ore, and wheat. Then, plan roads towards nodes that provide brick and sheep.</plan>

### Final Decision:
Given the analysis, the best option for the initial settlement is at node 8, which provides access to two high-probability wood tiles and is close to the 2:1 Wood port.

$\boxed{8}$
