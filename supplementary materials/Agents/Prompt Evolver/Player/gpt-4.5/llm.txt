PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN. That means 10 victory points.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>
6. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively
7. Think about the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action

Strategies to Employ:
- Prioritize settlement placements that maximize both resource diversity and numbers with high probabilities (e.g., tiles with 6 or 8). Ensure access to at least one wood-brick pair for early road building and a wheat-ore pair for city upgrades.
- Aim for early control of scarce resources to monopolize their trade value. Strategically trade and build to secure critical resources (e.g., brick if scarce).
- Use resource scarcity to your advantage when trading; make trades that favor your needs while pressuring opponents.
- Place robber strategically: target opponents with high victory points and effective production without creating alliances against you. Prefer targeting only one player at a time and consider placing it on rare resources they depend on.
- Focus on building towards ports early for better trading efficiency (2:1 or 3:1 trades), particularly for resources you overproduce.
- Balance road expansion and resource production to secure critical nodes or block opponents effectively.

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

❓ Select action by number (0-53):


Based on this information, which action number do you choose? Think step by step about your options, then put the final action number in a box like \boxed{1}.
RESPONSE:
### Step 1: Evaluate Starting Strategies for Settlements
The first settlement placement is critical, as it sets the tone for resource production and growth. There are several key goals to consider:
1. **Resource Diversity:** Gain access to wood, brick, wheat, ore, and sheep. Ideally, we want at least 3-4 different resources from the start.
2. **High Probability Numbers:** Prioritize tiles with numbers like 6 and 8, since they are rolled more often (higher probability).
3. **Strategic Ports:** Consider locations that allow expansion towards valuable 2:1 or 3:1 ports.
4. **Early Growth Resources:** Given that roads and settlements require wood and brick, it's advantageous to secure these resources early.
5. **Control of Scarce Resources:** Pick a node that aligns with resources that appear on fewer tiles (e.g., brick or ore in some cases).

---

### Step 2: Analyze the Board for Resource Distribution
From the grid:
- **Brick 🧱:** Appears on only 3 tiles: (2, 11, 12). Brick is a scarce resource, so controlling it is crucial. The best brick hex is **2** (high probability).
- **Wood 🌲:** Appears on 4 tiles: (3, 9, 10, 5). The best wood hexes are **9** and **10** (high probability).
- **Wheat 🌾:** Appears on 4 tiles: (9, 8, 4, 8). The best wheat hex is **8**.
- **Ore ⛏️:** Appears on 3 tiles: (6, 10, 4). The best ore hex is **6** (rolled most often).
- **Sheep 🐑:** Appears on 4 tiles: (11, 6, 3, 5). Priority hexes are **6** (highest numbers).

---

### Step 3: Identify Nodes with Strong Resource Access
We will evaluate the potential nodes for resource diversity and probability:

#### Option 1: Node 7
- **Nearby Tiles**: Ore (6), Wheat (8), Wood (9)
- **Numbers on Tiles**: 6, 8, 9 = Total Probability: **12/36**
- **Resources Covered**: Wheat, Ore, Wood
- **Strengths**: Great for ore-wheat-wood combination needed for cities; high-probability tiles.
- **Port Access**: Can expand westward to **Sheep Port** at node 25.

#### Option 2: Node 10
- **Nearby Tiles**: Brick (2), Wheat (9), Ore (4)
- **Numbers on Tiles**: 2, 9, 4 = Total Probability: **7/36**
- **Resources Covered**: Brick, Wheat, Ore
- **Strengths**: Access to scarce **brick**. Balanced for initial roads/settlements and cities.
- **Port Access**: Can expand eastward to **Wheat Port** at node 28.

#### Option 3: Node 13
- **Nearby Tiles**: Wheat (8), Wood (3), Brick (11)
- **Numbers on Tiles**: 8, 3, 11 = Total Probability: **9/36**
- **Resources Covered**: Wood, Wheat, Brick
- **Strengths**: Balanced for building roads and settlements early. Lower-probability tiles than options above.
- **Port Access**: Near **Ore Port** at node 39.

#### Option 4: Node 23
- **Nearby Tiles**: Wood (9), Sheep (11), Ore (10)
- **Numbers on Tiles**: 9, 11, 10 = Total Probability: **10/36**
- **Resources Covered**: Wood, Sheep, Ore
- **Strengths**: Balanced production. Close to **Wood Port** and **General Port** for expansion.
- **Port Access**: Easy access to **Wood Port** at node 48.

---

### Step 4: Choose the Best Option
After consideration:
- **Node 7** is the strongest starting node because it provides exceptional access to high-probability tiles (6, 8, 9) and three critical resources: ore, wheat, and wood.
- We can focus on expanding to a **Sheep Port** (25, 26) or other valuable nodes in the midgame.

<plan>Secure node 7 for initial settlement to prioritize strong resource tiles (6, 8, 9). Expand west to the Sheep Port (nodes 25-26), then build towards a city.</plan>

\boxed{7}
