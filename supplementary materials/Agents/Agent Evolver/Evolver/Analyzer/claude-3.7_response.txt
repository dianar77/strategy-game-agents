ANALYSIS:

FooPlayer Scores:
- WINS: 0
- AVG VP: 2.0
- AVG SETTLES: 2.0
- AVG CITIES: 0.0
- AVG ROAD: 0.0
- AVG ARMY: 0.0
- AVG DEV VP: 0.0

Game Output Analysis:
- The game output shows "Choosing First Action on Default" message being logged repeatedly, indicating that the player is always choosing the first available action without any strategic consideration
- This debug message comes from line 21 in foo_player.py: `print("Choosing First Action on Default")`
- There are no syntax errors in the code

Player Implementation Issues:
- "Choosing First Action on Default" appears hundreds of times, indicating the player has a very basic implementation with no decision-making logic
- The player is simply selecting the first available action (playable_actions[0]) regardless of what it is
- The player is not implementing any strategy or evaluating different possible actions
- This explains the poor performance (0 wins, only 2 VP on average - likely just from initial settlements)
- No error messages, but the implementation lacks any strategic depth

END ANALYSIS.
