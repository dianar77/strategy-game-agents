**CHOSEN AGENT:** CODER

**AGENT OBJECTIVE:**

Please implement the following code in `foo_player.py`. This code updates the `decide` method to prioritize building settlements, which is crucial for gaining victory points and expanding territory.

```python
import os
from catanatron import Player
from catanatron.game import Game
from catanatron.models.player import Color
from catanatron.models.actions import ActionType

class FooPlayer(Player):
    def __init__(self, name=None):
        super().__init__(Color.BLUE, name)

    def decide(self, game, playable_actions):
        # Should return one of the playable_actions.

        # Args:
        #     game (Game): complete game state. read-only.
        #     playable_actions (Iterable[Action]): options to choose from
        # Return:
        #     action (Action): Chosen element of playable_actions

        # ===== YOUR CODE HERE =====
        for action in playable_actions:
            if action.action_type == ActionType.BUILD_SETTLEMENT:
                return action
        # If no preferred action is found, fall back to the first action
        return playable_actions[0]
        # ===== END YOUR CODE =====
```

### Explanation:

- **Iterate Through Actions**: The `for` loop iterates through all playable actions.
- **Prioritize Building Settlements**: The `if` statement checks if the action type is `BUILD_SETTLEMENT`. If so, it returns that action.
- **Fallback**: If no `BUILD_SETTLEMENT` action is available, it falls back to returning the first action.

This implementation ensures that the player prioritizes building settlements, which is a fundamental step towards increasing victory points and potentially securing a win.

CODER

- Updated the `decide` method to prioritize building settlements.
    - Iterate through all playable actions.
    - Check if the action type is `BUILD_SETTLEMENT`.
    - If a `BUILD_SETTLEMENT` action is found, return that action.
    - If no `BUILD_SETTLEMENT` action is available, fall back to returning the first action.
- Added print statements to debug the output of the code.
    - Print "Choosing to build a settlement" when a `BUILD_SETTLEMENT` action is chosen.
    - Print "Choosing First Action on Default" when falling back to the first action.
- Removed the old print statement that was used for debugging the previous implementation.

ANALYZER OBJECTIVE:

If there is no syntax errors, I want you to return
    - The Scores of the foo_player.py player from the game_results json file
    - Short analysis of the game output (return anything interseting that was printed)
    - EMPHASIZE any errors, warnings, or signs of player implementation error in the game_output.txt file 

If there is a syntax error, I want you to return
    - The error message from the game_output.txt file
    - The exact line number of the error if possible
    - The exact line of code that caused the error if possible
