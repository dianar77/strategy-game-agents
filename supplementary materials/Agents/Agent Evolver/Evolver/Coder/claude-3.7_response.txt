MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Develop a foo_player.py that implements basic Catan strategy principles, focusing on resource acquisition and expansion, with incremental improvements over 5 iterations.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Create an initial version of foo_player.py that moves beyond the default "choose first action" approach by implementing basic action evaluation logic.

CHOSEN AGENT: CODER

AGENT OBJECTIVE: Create a basic implementation of the foo_player.py file that evaluates and prioritizes actions rather than simply choosing the first available action. Based on the research, implement the following:

1. Create a FooPlayer class that extends the Player class
2. Implement a decide() function that evaluates actions based on simple heuristics instead of just choosing the first action
3. Add logic to prioritize actions in this general order:
   - BUILD_CITY (highest priority)
   - BUILD_SETTLEMENT
   - BUILD_ROAD (especially if can lead to new settlements)
   - BUY_DEVELOPMENT_CARD
   - Other actions (lowest priority)
4. Implement a simple evaluate_action() function that assigns scores to different action types
5. Include necessary imports and documentation

Here's the template to follow:

```python
from catanatron.models.player import Player
from catanatron.models.actions import ActionType
import random

class FooPlayer(Player):
    def __init__(self, color):
        super().__init__(color)
        self.name = "FooPlayer"
    
    def decide(self, game, playable_actions):
        """
        Decide which action to play based on simple heuristics.
        """
        if len(playable_actions) == 1:
            return playable_actions[0]
        
        # Evaluate each action and find the best one
        best_action = None
        best_score = float('-inf')
        
        for action in playable_actions:
            score = self.evaluate_action(game, action)
            if score > best_score:
                best_score = score
                best_action = action
        
        return best_action
    
    def evaluate_action(self, game, action):
        """
        Assign a score to an action based on its type and impact.
        Higher score means better action.
        """
        # Basic action type priorities
        if action.action_type == ActionType.BUILD_CITY:
            return 100
        elif action.action_type == ActionType.BUILD_SETTLEMENT:
            return 50
        elif action.action_type == ActionType.BUILD_ROAD:
            return 20
        elif action.action_type == ActionType.BUY_DEVELOPMENT_CARD:
            return 15
        elif action.action_type == ActionType.PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD:
            return 10
        elif action.action_type == ActionType.END_TURN:
            return -10  # Low priority, only if nothing better to do
        
        # Default score for other actions
        return 0
```

Please implement this code in the foo_player.py file and ensure it runs without errors.

CODER

I've updated the foo_player.py file with a basic action evaluation strategy. Here's a summary of the changes made:

## Key Changes:
- Added proper imports, including `ActionType` from catanatron.models.actions for action type evaluation
- Updated the FooPlayer initialization to set the name properly
- Implemented a smart `decide()` method that evaluates each possible action instead of simply selecting the first one
- Created a new `evaluate_action()` method that assigns different scores to different types of actions
- Added debugging print statements to show what actions are being selected and why
- Introduced a scoring system that prioritizes actions that build toward victory points

## Prioritization Logic:
- BUILD_CITY (100 points): Highest priority since cities provide 2 VPs and double resource production
- BUILD_SETTLEMENT (50 points): High priority as they provide VPs and new resource sources
- ROLL (30 points): Rolling dice is necessary to progress the game
- BUILD_ROAD (20 points): Roads don't give VPs but enable expansion to new settlements
- BUY_DEVELOPMENT_CARD (15 points): Can provide VPs or special abilities
- PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD (10 points): Helps get largest army
- MOVE_ROBBER (5 points): Strategic value in blocking opponents
- MARITIME_TRADE (3 points): Trading is useful but lower priority than building
- END_TURN (-10 points): Lowest priority, only chosen when nothing else is available

## Enhancements for Next Iterations:
- I'd like to improve the evaluation of building locations - some settlement spots are much more valuable than others
- We need to factor in resource availability - sometimes it's better to save resources for a future turn
- Consider opponent positions when placing the robber
- Add logic for deciding which development cards to play and when
- Introduce resource-based trading strategy

For the next iteration, I recommend focusing on adding location-specific evaluation for settlements and cities, as this would significantly improve the player's strategic positioning.
