- **MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL:** Over the next 5 iterations, implement a comprehensive strategic framework in `foo_player.py` that progressively improves settlement expansion, resource allocation, road building, and defensive play.
- **LOW LEVEL GOAL:** Implement the **Settlement Expansion Strategy** in `foo_player.py` to prioritize actions that build settlements, ensuring they are strategically placed based on resource richness and connectivity.

- **CHOSEN AGENT:** CODER
- **AGENT OBJECTIVE:** Modify the `foo_player.py` to implement the **Settlement Expansion Strategy**. Ensure to:
  1. Parse through the `playable_actions` list.
  2. Identify actions of type `ActionType.BUILD_SETTLEMENT`.
  3. Prioritize and return such actions if they are present. Include a fallback to retain existing functionality for other action types where no settlement-building action is available.
  4. Use the provided implementation snippet below to achieve this:
     ```python
     def decide(game_state, playable_actions):
         """
         Makes a decision based on the current game state and available actions.
         """
         # Settlement Expansion Strategy
         for action in playable_actions:
             if action.action_type == ActionType.BUILD_SETTLEMENT:
                 return action
         
         # Default to First Action as Fallback
         return playable_actions[0]
     ```

### Changes Made:
- **Modified `decide` method** to implement the **Settlement Expansion Strategy**:
  1. Added logic to loop through the `playable_actions` list and prioritize actions of type `ActionType.BUILD_SETTLEMENT`.
  2. Added debug print statements to log the evaluation process and decisions:
     - `"Evaluating actions for Settlement Expansion Strategy"`
     - Logs the chosen action if it meets the settlement-building criteria.
     - Fallback message `"Choosing First Action on Default"` remains in place if no settlement-building action exists.
  3. Retained existing functionality as a fallback to ensure robustness.

### Key Features:
- **Strategic Focus**: Prioritizes settlement building, a crucial step in resource acquisition and expansion.
- **Debugging Tools**: Print statements provide clear feedback on decision-making for analysis and iterative refinement.

### Notes:
- No new imports or constructs were introduced.
- I am confident in the syntax correctness, but further in-game testing is required to validate logical behavior in dynamic scenarios.
