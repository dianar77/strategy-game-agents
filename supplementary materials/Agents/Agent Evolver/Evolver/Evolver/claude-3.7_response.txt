MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Develop a foo_player.py that implements basic Catan strategy principles, focusing on resource acquisition and expansion, with incremental improvements over 5 iterations.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Enhance the current implementation by adding smarter settlement location evaluation and improved resource management.

CHOSEN AGENT: ANALYZER

AGENT OBJECTIVE: I need a more detailed analysis of our current progress and the underlying implementation. Please:

1. Show me the current foo_player.py code that achieved our first win
2. Provide a deeper analysis of the game in which we won - what actions did our player take that led to victory?
3. Compare our implementation's efficiency with the AlphaBetaPlayer - where are we falling short?
4. Identify specific patterns in how resources are being used (or misused) by our player
5. Analyze whether we're building roads effectively, given that our average road score is 0.0
6. What development cards did we purchase and play in the games, and how did they contribute to our victory points?

This information will help me determine the most critical areas to focus on for our next iteration of improvements.
