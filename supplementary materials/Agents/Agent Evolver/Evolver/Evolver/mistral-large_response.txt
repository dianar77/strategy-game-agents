**MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL:** Over the next 5 iterations, enhance the decision-making logic of `foo_player.py` to increase the average victory points (AVG VP) to at least 5.0 and achieve at least 1 win by implementing more sophisticated strategies.

**LOW LEVEL GOAL:** For the next iteration, implement a more nuanced strategy that considers multiple types of actions, such as building roads and cities, in addition to settlements. This should help the player make more informed decisions and improve overall performance.

**CHOSEN AGENT:** STRATEGIZER

**AGENT OBJECTIVE:** Please suggest a more advanced strategy that considers multiple types of actions, such as building roads and cities, in addition to settlements. The strategy should aim to improve the player's performance by increasing the average victory points and potentially securing a win. Provide clear and concise instructions on how to implement this strategy in the `foo_player.py` file.
