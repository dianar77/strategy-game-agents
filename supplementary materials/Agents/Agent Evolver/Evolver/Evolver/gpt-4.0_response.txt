================================ Human Message =================================

- **MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL:** Overhaul `foo_player.py` to align its decision-making with improved resource utilization, dynamic prioritization of scoring opportunities, and adaptive fallback mechanisms. These enhancements aim to boost settlements, city upgrades, and development card purchases over the next iterations to improve scoring performance.
- **LOW LEVEL GOAL:** Implement surplus resource handling logic and an initial prioritization function to dynamically choose high-value actions. Replace static fallback logic with a heuristic-ranking mechanism that scores trade, settlement, road, and city-building actions in the immediate iteration.

- **CHOSEN AGENT:** CODER
- **AGENT OBJECTIVE:** Refactor `foo_player.py` to implement the following logic:
  1. **Surplus Resource Handling**:
     - Add a new function, `evaluate_trade_surplus`, to analyze the current player's resources and identify any surplus resources for maritime or domestic trades.
     - Integrate the function into decision-making to prioritize converting surplus resources into useful resources that align with building or development card goals.
  2. **Prioritize High-Value Actions**:
     - Add a `prioritize_high_value_actions` function to dynamically rank settlement, city, and road-building actions. Use the priority sequence: city > settlement > road, selecting the highest-priority feasible action.
     - Integrate this logic into the current decision-making workflow ahead of any fallback actions.
  3. **Fallback Mechanism Update**:
     - Replace "First Action on Default" with a heuristic-based ranking system for playable actions. Use weighted scores for settlement, city-building, trading, and development as per the strategy recommendation.

Provide detailed implementation, ensuring comments and debugging statements are included to track trade evaluations, action prioritizations, and fallback decisions in runtime logs.
