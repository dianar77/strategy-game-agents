**MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL:** Over the next 5 iterations, refine the decision-making logic of `foo_player.py` to increase the average victory points (AVG VP) to at least 5.0 and achieve at least 1 win by implementing more adaptive and context-aware strategies.

**LOW LEVEL GOAL:** For the next iteration, enhance the current strategy to consider the game state and the potential outcomes of different actions. This should help the player make more informed and adaptive decisions, improving overall performance.

**CHOSEN AGENT:** RESEARCHER

**AGENT OBJECTIVE:** Please investigate and provide information on the following:

1. **Game State Functions**: What are the state functions that can be called to get information about the game state in Catanatron? Specifically, we need functions that provide information about the player's resources, the board state, and the opponents' statuses.
2. **Action Outcomes**: How can we simulate or predict the outcomes of different actions in the game? Are there any functions or methods that allow us to evaluate the potential results of an action before making a decision?

This information will help us implement a more adaptive strategy that considers the game state and the potential outcomes of different actions.

### Game State Functions

To get information about the game state in Catanatron, you can use the following functions from the `state_functions.py` file:

1. **Player's Resources**:
   - `get_player_freqdeck(state, color)`: Returns a 'freqdeck' of a player's resource hand.
   - `player_num_resource_cards(state, color, card=None)`: Returns the number of resource cards a player has. If `card` is specified, it returns the number of that specific resource.

2. **Board State**:
   - `get_player_buildings(state, color_param, building_type_param)`: Returns the buildings of a player by type.
   - `get_longest_road_color(state)`: Returns the color of the player with the longest road.
   - `get_longest_road_length(state, color)`: Returns the length of the longest road for a player.
   - `get_largest_army(state)`: Returns the color of the player with the largest army and the number of knights played.

3. **Opponents' Statuses**:
   - `get_enemy_colors(colors, player_color)`: Returns the colors of the enemy players.
   - `get_actual_victory_points(state, color)`: Returns the actual victory points of a player.
   - `get_visible_victory_points(state, color)`: Returns the visible victory points of a player.

### Action Outcomes

To simulate or predict the outcomes of different actions in the game, you can use the `Game` class from the `game.py` file. The `Game` class allows you to create a copy of the game state and apply actions to see their outcomes without affecting the actual game state.

1. **Simulating Actions**:
   - `game.copy()`: Creates a copy of the game that can be modified without affecting the original game.
   - `game.execute(action, validate_action=True)`: Applies an action to the game state. You can use this method on the copied game to see the outcome of an action.

2. **Example Workflow**:
   ```python
   # Create a copy of the game
   game_copy = game.copy()

   # Define an action to simulate
   action = Action(color=player_color, action_type=ActionType.BUILD_SETTLEMENT, value=node_id)

   # Apply the action to the copied game
   game_copy.execute(action)

   # Inspect the game state after the action
   new_state = game_copy.state
   ```

### Additional Tools

- **Reading Local Files**: You can use the `read_local_file` tool to read the content of specific files in the Catanatron directory.
- **Web Search**: You can use the `web_search_tool_call` tool to perform web searches if needed.
