MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Develop a foo_player.py that implements basic Catan strategy principles, focusing on resource acquisition and expansion, with incremental improvements over 5 iterations.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Create an initial version of foo_player.py that moves beyond the default "choose first action" approach by implementing basic action evaluation logic.

CHOSEN AGENT: RESEARCHER

AGENT OBJECTIVE: I need to understand the fundamental components needed to build a more effective Catan player. Please provide me with:

1. A summary of the available Action types in the Catanatron minigame
2. The key state functions I can call to get information about the game state (e.g., resources, board position)
3. Any examples of how to evaluate actions in the game
4. What basic functions or methods should be implemented in a foo_player.py file to create a competitive player
5. How the opponent player (AlphaBetaPlayer) works at a high level

This information will help me establish a foundation for our initial player implementation, which will move beyond simply choosing the first available action.

# Understanding the Fundamentals for Building a Competitive Catan Player

## 1. Available Action Types in Catanatron Minigame

The Catanatron minigame includes the following action types (from `enums.py`):

### Building/Resource Actions:
- `BUILD_ROAD` - Build a road at an edge location
- `BUILD_SETTLEMENT` - Build a settlement at a node location
- `BUILD_CITY` - Upgrade a settlement to a city
- `BUY_DEVELOPMENT_CARD` - Purchase a development card

### Game Flow Actions:
- `ROLL` - Roll the dice
- `END_TURN` - End the current player's turn
- `DISCARD` - Discard cards when a 7 is rolled
- `MOVE_ROBBER` - Move the robber to a new tile and potentially steal from another player

### Development Card Actions:
- `PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD` - Play a Knight development card
- `PLAY_YEAR_OF_PLENTY` - Play Year of Plenty development card
- `PLAY_MONOPOLY` - Play Monopoly development card
- `PLAY_ROAD_BUILDING` - Play Road Building development card

### Trade Actions:
- `MARITIME_TRADE` - Trade with the bank/ports
- `OFFER_TRADE`, `ACCEPT_TRADE`, `REJECT_TRADE`, `CONFIRM_TRADE`, `CANCEL_TRADE` - Player-to-player trading

## 2. Key State Functions

The following state functions are essential for accessing game information:

### Resource Information:
- `get_player_freqdeck(state, color)` - Get a player's resource hand as a frequency array
- `player_num_resource_cards(state, color, card=None)` - Count resources in a player's hand
- `player_resource_freqdeck_contains(state, color, freqdeck)` - Check if player has specific resources

### Building Information:
- `get_player_buildings(state, color, building_type)` - Get a player's buildings of a specific type
- `build_settlement(state, color, node_id, is_free)` - Build a settlement and update game state
- `build_road(state, color, edge, is_free)` - Build a road and update game state
- `build_city(state, color, node_id)` - Build a city and update game state

### Victory Point Information:
- `get_visible_victory_points(state, color)` - Get visible victory points
- `get_actual_victory_points(state, color)` - Get actual victory points (including hidden ones)

### Development Card Information:
- `get_dev_cards_in_hand(state, color, dev_card=None)` - Get development cards in hand
- `get_played_dev_cards(state, color, dev_card=None)` - Get played development cards
- `player_can_play_dev(state, color, dev_card)` - Check if player can play a specific development card

### Game Status:
- `player_has_rolled(state, color)` - Check if player has rolled
- `get_longest_road_color(state)` - Get the color with the longest road
- `get_largest_army(state)` - Get the color with the largest army

## 3. Action Evaluation Examples

The codebase includes several examples of action evaluation:

### Example 1: VictoryPointPlayer
From `search.py`:
```python
def decide(self, game: Game, playable_actions):
    if len(playable_actions) == 1:
        return playable_actions[0]

    best_value = float("-inf")
    best_actions = []
    for action in playable_actions:
        game_copy = game.copy()
        game_copy.execute(action)

        key = player_key(game_copy.state, self.color)
        value = game_copy.state.player_state[f"{key}_ACTUAL_VICTORY_POINTS"]
        if value == best_value:
            best_actions.append(action)
        if value > best_value:
            best_value = value
            best_actions = [action]

    return random.choice(best_actions)
```

### Example 2: WeightedRandomPlayer
From `weighted_random.py`:
```python
WEIGHTS_BY_ACTION_TYPE = {
    ActionType.BUILD_CITY: 10000,
    ActionType.BUILD_SETTLEMENT: 1000,
    ActionType.BUY_DEVELOPMENT_CARD: 100,
}

def decide(self, game, playable_actions):
    bloated_actions = []
    for action in playable_actions:
        weight = WEIGHTS_BY_ACTION_TYPE.get(action.action_type, 1)
        bloated_actions.extend([action] * weight)

    return random.choice(bloated_actions)
``` 

## 4. Essential Functions for a Competitive Player

To create a competitive `foo_player.py`, these functions should be implemented:

1. **Player Class Definition**:
   ```python
   from catanatron.models.player import Player
   
   class FooPlayer(Player):
       def __init__(self, color):
           super().__init__(color)
   ```

2. **Decision Function**:
   ```python
   def decide(self, game, playable_actions):
       # Logic to select the best action
       return best_action
   ```

3. **Action Evaluation Function**:
   ```python
   def evaluate_action(self, game, action):
       # Create a copy of the game to simulate the action
       game_copy = game.copy()
       game_copy.execute(action)
       
       # Return a score based on various factors
       return score
   ```

4. **Resource Valuation**:
   ```python
   def value_of_resources(self, game_state, color):
       # Determine the value of each resource based on current game state
       return resource_values
   ```

5. **Building Location Evaluation**:
   ```python
   def evaluate_building_spot(self, game, node_id):
       # Evaluate the value of a building location
       return location_value
   ```

## 5. AlphaBetaPlayer Overview

According to the search results, the AlphaBetaPlayer:

1. Uses alpha-beta search with a hand-crafted value function
2. Has a search depth of 2, which performs better than a depth of 3
3. Is considered the strongest bot in the Catanatron system, winning 80% of games against ValueFunctionPlayer in 1v1 matchups
4. Can be extended by inheriting from it and setting better weights for the value function

The AlphaBetaPlayer likely:
- Uses minimax with alpha-beta pruning to search possible moves
- Evaluates game states with a weighted value function that considers resources, building placement, development cards, and victory points
- Simulates opponent moves to choose the best actions
- Balances immediate gains with long-term strategic positioning

The player implements the standard `decide(game, playable_actions)` method from the Player interface, but uses alpha-beta search to evaluate multiple steps ahead and select the best action based on the expected future state values.
