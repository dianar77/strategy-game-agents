Scenarios:
    Within the first 5 Evolutions, if The performance history shows that the player consistentaly does not compile (score stays at 0) or cannot get a score better than default (score stays at 2), Repond With
        Try the following code snippet to get the player to compile and get simple results:
        for action in playable_actions:
            "if action.action_type == ActionType.BUILD_SETTLEMENT:
                return action"

    If The performance history contains a previous version of {FOO_TARGET_FILENAME} that is more successful then the recent iterations, 
        Call read_older_foo_file tool to get the code of the previous {FOO_TARGET_FILENAME}
        Either return the entire contents of the file, or just your analysis of the differences

    If the performance history shows no signs of player improving over the last 3 successful evolutions (game ran successfully)
