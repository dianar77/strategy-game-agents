MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Develop a foo_player.py that implements basic Catan strategy principles, focusing on resource acquisition and expansion, with incremental improvements over 5 iterations.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Enhance resource management and city building strategy to close the gap with AlphaBetaPlayer.

CHOSEN AGENT: STRATEGIZER

AGENT OBJECTIVE: Based on our performance analysis, I need strategic insights to improve our player in key areas where we're underperforming compared to AlphaBetaPlayer. Specifically:

1. Resource Management Strategy: What strategies should we implement for better resource management? How can we prioritize resources that lead to cities (ore, wheat) versus early-game resources (brick, wood)?

2. City Building Strategy: What approach should we take to build more cities? We're averaging only 0.7 cities compared to AlphaBetaPlayer's 3.1 cities.

3. Road Network Planning: What strategies exist for more efficient road networks that lead to valuable settlement locations? Our road bonus rate is only 0.2 compared to AlphaBetaPlayer's 0.8.

4. Defensive Robber Placement: How should we strategically place the robber to slow down our opponent's progress?

5. Development Card Timing: When should we prioritize buying development cards versus saving resources for building?

For each strategy, please provide concrete approaches we could implement in our code. Focus especially on resource management and city building since these appear to be our biggest weaknesses compared to AlphaBetaPlayer.

# Catan Strategy Optimization for FooPlayer

Based on the game results analysis, FooPlayer is significantly underperforming compared to AlphaBetaPlayer in several key areas. Here are strategic recommendations to address the identified weaknesses:

## 1. Resource Management Strategy

1. **Resource Prioritization Algorithm**:
   - Implement a resource value scoring system based on current game phase
   - Early Game: Prioritize brick/wood (2:2 ratio) for expansion
   - Mid-Game: Transition to ore/wheat (3:2 ratio) for city building
   - Calculate resource scarcity on the board and prioritize settlements near scarce resources

2. **Resource Target Ratios**:
   - For city-building focus: Equal amounts of ore and wheat
   - For development card strategy: Balance ore, wheat, and sheep (2:2:1 ratio)
   - For expansion: Equal amounts of brick and wood

3. **Port-Based Strategy**:
   - Prioritize securing a 3:1 port early if resource distribution is uneven
   - Target 2:1 ports for resources you have in abundance

## 2. City Building Strategy

1. **Production Pivot Point**:
   - After establishing 2 settlements, immediately focus on upgrading to cities before additional expansion
   - Target upgrading settlements with highest ore/wheat production first
   - Calculate and maintain "city resource threshold" - minimum amount of ore/wheat needed before spending on other buildings

2. **City Planning Algorithm**:
   - Score each settlement for city-upgrade priority based on:
     - Resource production value (especially ore/wheat)
     - Vulnerability to robber placement
     - Strategic value (access to ports, blocking opportunities)

3. **Resource Stockpiling Logic**:
   - Implement "city savings account" - reserve ore/wheat when reaching 3+ of these resources
   - Only spend from this reserve for emergency situations

## 3. Road Network Planning

1. **Expansion Path Planning**:
   - Evaluate all potential road paths based on:
     - Distance to high-value settlement locations
     - Ability to block opponent expansion
     - Connection to ports or resource-rich areas

2. **Defensive Road Building**:
   - Identify critical paths that opponents might target
   - Place blocking roads to secure expansion routes
   - Calculate "road race" probability and only compete when win chance is high

3. **Settlement Target Mapping**:
   - Pre-calculate the most valuable potential settlement locations
   - Build roads specifically to reach these high-value targets
   - Avoid roads that lead to low-probability expansion opportunities

## 4. Defensive Robber Placement

1. **Opponent Resource Tracking**:
   - Track resources collected by opponents through dice rolls
   - Place robber on hexes that disrupt opponent's resource accumulation strategy

2. **Strategic Robber Algorithm**:
   - Target hexes that:
     - Produce resources you already have (to create scarcity and increase trade value)
     - Disrupt opponent's city-building capability (ore/wheat hexes)
     - Block opponent's highest-producing hex

3. **Knight Timing Strategy**:
   - Save knight cards for critical moments:
     - When opponent is about to build a city
     - When you need to move robber from your high-production hex
     - When close to achieving largest army bonus

## 5. Development Card Timing

1. **Development Card Strategy**:
   - Buy development cards after upgrading 1-2 settlements to cities
   - Target development cards when:
     - You need specific resources (road building cards when brick/wood scarce)
     - You're approaching 7-8 victory points (victory point cards for surprise win)
     - You need knight cards to disrupt opponent progress

2. **Card Type Probability Calculation**:
   - Consider the probability of drawing each card type
   - Adjust strategy based on remaining development cards in the deck

3. **Resource Balance Decision Tree**:
   - When holding ore/wheat/sheep, calculate expected value of:
     - Building city (2 ore + 3 wheat)
     - Buying development card (1 ore + 1 wheat + 1 sheep)
     - Trading for expansion (brick/wood)
   - Choose highest expected value path

Implementation in the evaluate_action method should weigh these strategies based on game state, with progressive adjustment as the game advances from early to late stages.
