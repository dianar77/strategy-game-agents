ANALYZER OBJECTIVE:

If there is no syntax errors, I want you to return
    - The Scores of the foo_player.py player from the game_results json file
    - Short analysis of the game output (return anything interseting that was printed)
    - EMPHASIZE any errors, warnings, or signs of player implementation error in the game_output.txt file 

If there is a syntax error, I want you to return
    - The error message from the game_output.txt file
    - The exact line number of the error if possible
    - The exact line of code that caused the error if possible

Keep the Response as concise as possible

After Running The New foo_player.py Player, Here is my analysis and findings:

### Scores of FooPlayer:
- Wins: 0
- Average Victory Points (VP): 2.0
- Average Settlements: 2.0
- Average Cities: 0.0
- Average Roads: 0.0
- Average Largest Army: 0.0
- Average Development VP: 0.0

### Short Analysis of Game Output:
- The phrase "Choosing First Action on Default" repeated throughout the log suggests that the implementation is defaulting to selecting the first action without strategy. 
- Results indicate poor performance compared to the opponent, with no victories achieved in the 3-game session. 

### Errors, Warnings, or Signs of Implementation Issues:
- **Implementation Warning**: The log shows "Choosing First Action on Default" continuously, indicating that the `decide` method is not leveraging the LLM integration (`self.llm.query_llm`) for decision-making.
- **Gameplay Warning**: The score disparity (2 VP versus 10 VP for the opponent) and the lack of progression in Cities, Roads, and Largest Army metrics highlight a lack of strategy execution.

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Improve the performance of the `FooPlayer.py` by introducing intelligent strategy logic that leverages the LLM for decision-making. Specifically, aim for a minimum win count of 1 within the next 5 iterations while improving VP, settlements, and measurable gameplay metrics.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Address the issue of the `decide` method defaulting to selecting the first action. Integrate the LLM's `query_llm` functionality to intelligently evaluate actions based on state and strategy.

CHOSEN AGENT: CODER

AGENT OBJECTIVE: 
The current implementation of `FooPlayer` is defaulting to selecting the first action, as evidenced by the repeated log message "Choosing First Action on Default." Modify the `decide` method to leverage the `self.llm.query_llm` functionality for decision-making. Specifically:

1. Replace the current first-action default with an implementation that:
   a. Obtains a list of possible actions from the game state.
   b. Queries the LLM (`self.llm.query_llm`) for the evaluation of these actions.
   c. Selects the most intelligent action based on the LLM's evaluation.

2. Ensure the decision logic is robust and includes handling scenarios such as:
   - No valid actions available.
   - LLM providing ambiguous or conflicting guidance (fallback mechanisms).

3. Include clear comments and logging to observe how the LLM is influencing decision-making.

Once done, provide the modified code to be tested.================================ Human Message =================================

CODER

### Changes Made:
1. **Replaced Default Action Selection**:
   - Removed the hardcoded `return playable_actions[0]` that selected the first action by default.

2. **Integrated LLM Decision-Making in `decide`**:
   - Constructed a comprehensive prompt using the `_build_prompt` function to provide the LLM with game state and available actions.
   - Queried the LLM using `self.llm.query_llm(prompt)`.
   - Parsed the LLM's response using the `_parse_llm_response` function to select the most appropriate action from the available options.

3. **Added New Helper Methods**:
   - `_build_prompt`: Constructs a prompt by including the current game state and the list of playable actions.
   - `_parse_llm_response`: Interprets the LLM's response to match it with one of the playable actions. If no match is found, defaults to the first action.

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Included error handling for cases where the LLM query fails or returns an ambiguous response. In such cases, the method defaults to selecting the first action.
   - Added logging to show the LLM's response (`print(f"LLM Response: {llm_response}")`) and fallback mechanisms.

5. **Logging and Debugging**:
   - Added print statements for better debugging and observation:
     - Log when no playable actions are available.
     - Log the LLM's raw response.
     - Log if the response is ambiguous or invalid, and the fallback action is selected.

### Notes for the Next Iteration:
- **Prompt Details**: The current `_build_prompt` function makes a basic serialization of the game state and actions. If the LLM struggles to prioritize or understand the game details, refining this prompt may be necessary.
- **LLM Error Responses**: If runtime timing issues with `query_llm` arise (e.g., long delays or failures), adjustment of query limits or timeouts may be needed.

### Testing Recommendations:
- Test how the LLM chooses actions in various scenarios to verify that the parsing logic aligns with actual gameplay.
- Monitor logs (`LLM Response: ...`) for unexpected behaviors or ambiguous responses.

================================== Ai Message ==================================

After Running The New foo_player.py Player, Here is my analysis and findings:

### Scores of FooPlayer:
- Wins: 0
- Average Victory Points (VP): 2.0
- Average Settlements: 2.0
- Average Cities: 0.0
- Average Roads: 0.0
- Average Largest Army: 0.0
- Average Development VP: 0.0

### Short Analysis of Game Output:
- The phrase "Choosing First Action on Default" repeated throughout the log suggests that the implementation is defaulting to selecting the first action without strategy. 
- Results indicate poor performance compared to the opponent, with no victories achieved in the 3-game session. 

### Errors, Warnings, or Signs of Implementation Issues:
- **Implementation Warning**: The log shows "Choosing First Action on Default" continuously, indicating that the `decide` method is not leveraging the LLM integration (`self.llm.query_llm`) for decision-making.
- **Gameplay Warning**: The score disparity (2 VP versus 10 VP for the opponent) and the lack of progression in Cities, Roads, and Largest Army metrics highlight a lack of strategy execution.

represented as:  
```python
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)
```  

Rolling the dice will allow resource generation for yourself and possibly other players, depending on settlements on hexes with the rolled numbers. After rolling, additional actions (such as building, trading, or playing development cards) will become available, which can help you strategize towards maximizing Victory Points (VP). 

Let me know if additional actions appear, and I can continue assisting based on the updated game state!
LLM Response: Based on the actions available and prioritizing maximizing Victory Points (VP) and strategic advancement, the best action to take here would be to:

**Action:** `BUY_DEVELOPMENT_CARD`

### Why?
- **Buying a Development Card** can increase VP directly (e.g., if you draw a Victory Point card) or indirectly by gaining resources with Monopoly, protection with Knight cards, or utility with Road Building or Year of Plenty.
- Development Cards provide flexibility and unpredictability, giving you leverage over opponents.
- Given there are no building options (e.g., settlement or city construction), buying a Development Card is the most proactive action to develop your position and VP potential.

### Why not `END_TURN`?
- Ending your turn is a neutral choice, effectively postponing action. Unless resources or opponents prevent meaningful progress, it's usually better to spend resources toward VP or strategic development.

Take the action: **BUY_DEVELOPMENT_CARD**!
LLM response ambiguous or invalid. Defaulting to first action.
LLM Response: Based on the given game state, the only available action is:

`Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)`

Strategically, rolling the dice is the next necessary step in the game because it is mandatory to advance the turn before moving onto other more impactful decisions. Rolling the dice triggers resource production for all players based on their settlements and cities, potentially granting the Blue player resources critical for future actions like building settlements, cities, roads, or purchasing development cards.

**Best Action:**
`Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)`

Let’s roll the dice and proceed.
LLM Response: Based on the two options available, here's the breakdown:

1. **End Turn**: This action ends your turn without taking any further action. This can sometimes be the optimal choice if there are no resource-based moves or actions to improve your situation.

2. **Buy a Development Card**: Buying a development card typically costs 1 sheep, 1 wheat, and 1 ore. Development cards often give you access to potential Victory Points (e.g., Victory Point cards), resource advantages (e.g., Year of Plenty, Road Building), or other strategic benefits (e.g., Knight cards for the Largest Army bonus).

### Recommendation: **Buy a Development Card**

If you have the resources to purchase the development card, this is likely the better strategic move for maximizing your Victory Points and strategic options. 

- Development cards often contribute directly to Victory Points or improve your board position, offering more ways to exert control.
- Even if you don't immediately gain a Victory Point card, a Knight card could help you toward the Largest Army VP bonuses, or utility cards can improve your resource situation.

After buying the development card, reassess the board state to determine your long-term strategy before concluding your turn.

___
If, however, this wasn’t feasible resources-consumption crossed.
LLM response ambiguous or invalid. Defaulting to first action.
LLM Response: Based on the current game state you’ve provided, it seems that the only available action is:

- **Action(color=<Color.BLUE>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL>, value=None)**

In Catan games, the **ROLL** action is typically required at the beginning of a turn to determine resource production based on the dice roll result and the placement of settlements and cities. Since this action is mandatory in most cases to progress the game, it is likely the best (and possibly the only) action you can take right now.

Strategic considerations:
- Rolling the dice starts the resource collection phase, which is essential for advancing your position in the game (e.g., gaining resources to build settlements, roads, cities, or develop cards).
- Once you roll, assess the resources you receive and think ahead about how you can use them to achieve your goals (e.g., expanding your settlement network, upgrading settlements to cities, or achieving the Longest Road or Largest Army bonus for additional VP).

**Recommendation: Take the action to ROLL**. Once the dice are rolled, re-evaluate the game state to determine your next strategic move.
LLM response ambiguous or invalid. Defaulting to first action.
LLM Response: To decide the best action in this Catanatron game scenario, we need to analyze the available actions based on maximizing Victory Points (VP) and achieving strategic goals. Key factors include:

1. **Targeting Opponents:** Moving the robber to hexes that affect the leading opponent (e.g., someone with the highest VP) or those holding valuable resources can weaken their position.
2. **Maximizing Impact:** Selecting a hex that blocks productive resource tiles, such as Wheat, Brick, or Ore, since these resources are crucial for building settlements, cities, and gaining development cards.
3. **Extracting Resources:** Actions that involve stealing from an opponent (if <Color.RED: 'RED'> is a strong competitor) are highly favorable because they provide additional resources.

Analyzing the actions:
- Actions targeting <Color.RED: 'RED'> are opportunities to weaken them and potentially steal resources. Focus on these action values:
  - `value=((1, -1, 0), <Color.RED: 'RED'>, None)`
  - `value=((0, -1, 1), <Color.RED: 'RED'>, None)`
  - `value=((-1, 0, 1), <Color.RED: 'RED'>, None)`
  - ... (other similar actions)

Strategic Moves:
- If <Color.RED: 'RED'> is the leading opponent, blocking productive hexes they rely on is ideal.
- Additionally, stealing resources from them provides an extra edge.

**Best Action:**
Without the context of board layout or resource importance, the most generally beneficial action is one that targets <Color.RED: 'RED'> and steals their resources. Therefore:

`Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MOVE_ROBBER: 'MOVE_ROBBER'>, value=((1, -1, 0), <Color.RED: 'RED'>, None))`

This action blocks a hex and steals from <Color.RED: 'RED'>, potentially weakening their position while strengthening yours.
LLM Response: To choose the best action in the game of Catan, we want to maximize Victory Points while achieving strategic goals such as expanding road networks, connecting settlements, blocking opponents, and securing good resource access.

Since the game state is not fully detailed here—e.g., the current board setup, existing structures, and specific strategic aspects—I'll analyze the provided road-building options based on general strategic guidelines.

### Criteria for Choosing Roads:
1. **Expand your network**: Building roads should move you toward expanding settlements or connecting an existing settlement to prime spots for future development.
2. **Block opponents**: Roads might block an opponent's expansion toward resourceful areas.
3. **Create a Longest Road opportunity**: If Longest Road is a realistic goal, aim to extend your road network in a continuous and strategic way.
4. **Future settlement planning**: Look for good settlement spots at the intersection of strong resource tiles (high-probability numbers and variety of resources).

### Analysis of Options:
Here are the available roads and considerations:
1. **(19, 20)** - Building a road here may indicate expansion toward a specific area or position on the board. Without more context, it's unclear if this helps strategic settlement goals.
2. **(2, 3)** - This road could be expanding toward a useful area. If (2, 3) opens up opportunities for a new settlement on a triple-resource junction or port, it could be valuable.
3. **(2, 9)** - Like the above, this may provide access to resources or block an opponent. The value depends on what settlement opportunities or advantage this creates.
4. **(0, 5)** - This option might secure another area for settlement expansion or block an opponent in the process.
5. **(20, 22)** - Extending here could help with Longest Road or settlement goals. This depends on current board connectivity.
6. **(1, 6)** - Similar to the others, this might extend toward expansion or settlement.

### Recommended Action:
Without a complete game state, the **best action** would be to build a road that significantly improves your ability to expand settlements or achieve Longest Road. Based on general principles, extend toward useful intersections or block opponents from critical spots.

Assuming we need to prioritize expansion for settlements, I recommend:  
**Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(2, 3))**

If (2, 3) opens up a strong settlement position or blocks an opponent effectively, it aligns well with maximizing VP and achieving strategic goals.

If additional game state information is available (e.g., known player locations, resource tiles, or existing roads), then the recommendation could change. Let me know if you have more details!
LLM Response: Given the current game state in which the only available action is:

```
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)
```

The best and only possible move is to **end your turn**.

This action ensures that gameplay continues and passes control to the next player. Since no other actions are presented, there is no additional decision-making to optimize Victory Points (VP) or achieve other strategic goals at this moment.

Action to take:
```
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)
```
LLM Response: Based on the provided information, the best action is:

**Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)**

**Reasoning:**
- Rolling the dice is necessary to generate resources, which are the foundation for building settlements, roads, cities, and development cards—important for maximizing Victory Points (VP).
- It is the only available action, so rolling the dice continues the progression in the game and aligns with the strategic goals of resource optimization and subsequent VP generation.

Let me know if you have specific strategy questions or want guidance after rolling the dice!
LLM Response: Based on the available actions you provided, the only actionable choice is:

**End Turn**  
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Since there are no other options presented, the best action is to end the turn and allow the game to progress. By ending your turn, you are following the flow of the game and enabling yourself to reevaluate strategy and options when new moves become available in subsequent turns.

Let me know if more information or updated actions become available, and I can assist with further strategic guidance!
LLM Response: The game state provided doesn't reveal the specific details of the board, your resources, or strategic position, which are crucial to making the optimal decision. However, based on the available action:

### Action to choose:
**`Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)`**

### Explanation:
Since the only option available is to roll the dice, this is the action you must take. Rolling the dice will distribute resources to players based on the number rolled and the placements on the board. After rolling, you'll have a better understanding of the resources available to you and the next possible actions.

Taking this action aligns with advancing the game state toward further strategic opportunities to maximize Victory Points (VP).
LLM Response: To make the best decision, let's analyze the options:

1. **END_TURN**: This action simply ends the turn without accomplishing anything further. It's usually a fallback if no other actions contribute toward progress.

2. **MARITIME_TRADE Actions**: Trading 4 WHEAT for one resource (SHEEP, WOOD, BRICK, or ORE) has strategic value if the traded resource helps advance Victory Points (VP), such as building roads, settlements, cities, or purchasing development cards. 

### Considerations:
- **SHEEP** is typically required for building settlements and some development cards.
- **WOOD and BRICK** are essential for building roads or settlements.
- **ORE** is vital for upgrading settlements into cities and purchasing development cards (which offer VP and useful benefits like Knights and Progress Cards).

Without a detailed view of your current resources, it's hard to give absolute advice. However, the relative strategic values suggest the following priority:

1. If you can trade for **ORE**, this is the best option for upgrading to a city or purchasing a development card, both of which directly increase VP.
2. If you are close to building a **road** or **settlement**, prioritize either **WOOD** or **BRICK** to achieve this goal.
3. If neither scenario applies, consider **SHEEP**, as it can help with settlements or development cards.

Given that ORE is pivotal in almost all advanced gameplay scenarios, my recommendation would be:

### Recommended Action:
**Maritime Trade for ORE**  
`Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'ORE'))`

This maximizes your potential to increase VP through cities or development cards.
LLM Response: Given the current game state and the list of possible actions (specifically just one action, which is `END_TURN`), we don't have further moves available in this turn. Therefore, the best and only action is to proceed with:

**Action**: `END_TURN`

This will hand over the turn to the next player. Make sure to evaluate your strategy on the upcoming turns based on resource production, trade opportunities, development cards, and settlement or road placement to maximize Victory Points.
LLM response ambiguous or invalid. Defaulting to first action.
LLM Response: Based on the provided game state, the only action available is:

**Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)**

Rolling the dice is a mandatory step in Catan and serves to generate resources for yourself and other players depending on the placement of settlements and cities. Since rolling the dice is the only option, you should take this action.

### Best Action:
**Take the ROLL action:**
```python
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)
```

### Strategic Considerations After Rolling:
1. **Resource Distribution**: Identify which resources were generated and determine how they align with your current strategic goals (e.g., building settlements, roads, cities, or purchasing Development Cards).
2. **Resource Trading**: After the roll and distribution, consider trading with opponents or using ports if needed to achieve specific objectives.
3. **Next Steps**: Look ahead to maximize your Victory Points (VP). This could include expanding settlements, upgrading to cities, securing Longest Road, or purchasing Development Cards for potential hidden VPs (e.g., Victory Point cards).

Once the dice are rolled, let me know the updated game state to evaluate your next best actions! 🎲
LLM Response: To determine the best action among the provided options, let's analyze the potential benefits for maximizing Victory Points (VP) and achieving strategic goals.

### Explanation:
1. **END_TURN**: Ending the turn immediately is typically a low-opportunity action unless there are no other viable actions to make progress. Given that there are options available for maritime trade, ending the turn wouldn't advance your position.

2. **MARITIME_TRADE (WOOD for another resource)**:
   - You seem to have an abundance of **WOOD** (4 pieces can be traded). Trading it for a different resource has the potential to help you:
     - Build settlements (requires BRICK, WHEAT, WOOD, SHEEP).
     - Upgrade to cities (requires WHEAT, ORE).
     - Build roads (requires WOOD, BRICK).
     - Buy development cards (requires WHEAT, SHEEP, ORE).
   
   Thus, trading WOOD for a resource you're lacking is a strong strategic move. To choose the best trade, consider the game's strategic goals:
   - **SHEEP, BRICK, WHEAT, ORE** are all candidates, but selecting the right one depends on your current goals and shortages.

3. **Strategic Goals to Maximize VP**:
   - If you're aiming to expand your settlements, prioritize resources like BRICK (for roads/settlements) or WHEAT (for settlements and cities).
   - If you're close to upgrading a settlement to a city, prioritize WHEAT or ORE.
   - If you're pursuing development cards, prioritize SHEEP and ORE.

### Recommendation:
Since the exact details of your current resource inventory and goals are not provided, the **best general choice** would be to:
   - Trade 4 WOOD for **BRICK** if you're planning to expand (build roads/settlements).
   - Trade 4 WOOD for **WHEAT** if you're aiming for a city or need it for settlements.

If you're unsure of your goals or need a balanced choice, **4 WOOD for WHEAT** is often a versatile and strategic option.

Lastly, **DO NOT END TURN** without taking action, as it's better to optimize your resource conversion while you have the opportunity.
LLM response ambiguous or invalid. Defaulting to first action.

After Running The New foo_player.py Player, Here is my analysis and findings:

### Scores of FooPlayer:
- Wins: 0  
- Average Victory Points (VP): 3.33  
- Average Settlements: 2.33  
- Average Cities: 0.33  
- Average Roads: 0.0  
- Average Largest Army: 0.0  
- Average Development VP: 0.33  

### Short Analysis of Game Output:
- The LLM consistently failed to provide valid or actionable responses: "LLM response ambiguous or invalid. Defaulting to first action."
- FooPlayer defaulted to the first available action in all scenarios instead of executing strategic decisions.
- The performance difference is stark: FooPlayer had no wins and significantly lower VP compared to AlphaBetaPlayer.

### Errors, Warnings, or Signs of Implementation Issues:
- **LLM Integration Issue**: LLM responses are not being parsed correctly or are poorly generated, leading to fallback actions ("Defaulting to first action").
- **Decision-Making Deficiency**: The lack of strategic outcomes (e.g., 0 roads, 0 Largest Army) suggests serious shortcomings in action planning and execution.
- **Repeated Logs**: Multiple instances of ambiguous LLM responses point to insufficient prompt design or response parsing mechanism in `_parse_llm_response`.

After Running The New foo_player.py Player, Here is my analysis and findings:

### Scores of FooPlayer:
- Wins: 0
- Average Victory Points (VP): 2.0
- Average Settlements: 2.0
- Average Cities: 0.0
- Average Roads: 0.0
- Average Largest Army: 0.0
- Average Development VP: 0.0

### Short Analysis of Game Output:
- The phrase "Choosing First Action on Default" repeated throughout the log suggests that the implementation is defaulting to selecting the first action without strategy. 
- Results indicate poor performance compared to the opponent, with no victories achieved in the 3-game session. 

### Errors, Warnings, or Signs of Implementation Issues:
- **Implementation Warning**: The log shows "Choosing First Action on Default" continuously, indicating that the `decide` method is not leveraging the LLM integration (`self.llm.query_llm`) for decision-making.
- **Gameplay Warning**: The score disparity (2 VP versus 10 VP for the opponent) and the lack of progression in Cities, Roads, and Largest Army metrics highlight a lack of strategy execution.

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Improve the performance of the `FooPlayer.py` by introducing intelligent strategy logic that leverages the LLM for decision-making. Specifically, aim for a minimum win count of 1 within the next 5 iterations while improving VP, settlements, and measurable gameplay metrics.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Address the issue of the `decide` method defaulting to selecting the first action. Integrate the LLM's `query_llm` functionality to intelligently evaluate actions based on state and strategy.

CHOSEN AGENT: CODER

AGENT OBJECTIVE: 
The current implementation of `FooPlayer` is defaulting to selecting the first action, as evidenced by the repeated log message "Choosing First Action on Default." Modify the `decide` method to leverage the `self.llm.query_llm` functionality for decision-making. Specifically:

1. Replace the current first-action default with an implementation that:
   a. Obtains a list of possible actions from the game state.
   b. Queries the LLM (`self.llm.query_llm`) for the evaluation of these actions.
   c. Selects the most intelligent action based on the LLM's evaluation.

2. Ensure the decision logic is robust and includes handling scenarios such as:
   - No valid actions available.
   - LLM providing ambiguous or conflicting guidance (fallback mechanisms).

3. Include clear comments and logging to observe how the LLM is influencing decision-making.

Once done, provide the modified code to be tested.================================ Human Message =================================

CODER

### Changes Made:
1. **Replaced Default Action Selection**:
   - Removed the hardcoded `return playable_actions[0]` that selected the first action by default.

2. **Integrated LLM Decision-Making in `decide`**:
   - Constructed a comprehensive prompt using the `_build_prompt` function to provide the LLM with game state and available actions.
   - Queried the LLM using `self.llm.query_llm(prompt)`.
   - Parsed the LLM's response using the `_parse_llm_response` function to select the most appropriate action from the available options.

3. **Added New Helper Methods**:
   - `_build_prompt`: Constructs a prompt by including the current game state and the list of playable actions.
   - `_parse_llm_response`: Interprets the LLM's response to match it with one of the playable actions. If no match is found, defaults to the first action.

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Included error handling for cases where the LLM query fails or returns an ambiguous response. In such cases, the method defaults to selecting the first action.
   - Added logging to show the LLM's response (`print(f"LLM Response: {llm_response}")`) and fallback mechanisms.

5. **Logging and Debugging**:
   - Added print statements for better debugging and observation:
     - Log when no playable actions are available.
     - Log the LLM's raw response.
     - Log if the response is ambiguous or invalid, and the fallback action is selected.

### Notes for the Next Iteration:
- **Prompt Details**: The current `_build_prompt` function makes a basic serialization of the game state and actions. If the LLM struggles to prioritize or understand the game details, refining this prompt may be necessary.
- **LLM Error Responses**: If runtime timing issues with `query_llm` arise (e.g., long delays or failures), adjustment of query limits or timeouts may be needed.

### Testing Recommendations:
- Test how the LLM chooses actions in various scenarios to verify that the parsing logic aligns with actual gameplay.
- Monitor logs (`LLM Response: ...`) for unexpected behaviors or ambiguous responses.

CHOSEN AGENT: STRATEGIZER

AGENT OBJECTIVE: 
The LLM responses are ambiguous or invalid, causing the FooPlayer to revert to default fallback actions. This suggests that the strategy design or LLM integration is insufficiently aligned with achieving optimal gameplay outcomes. 

Please provide 5 new strategy options that could address these key deficiencies:
1. How to design prompts to make the LLM understand the game state and prioritize optimal actions more effectively.
2. Ideas for alternative fallback mechanisms if the LLM fails to provide valid responses.
3. Strategies to temporarily compete with AlphaBetaPlayer while testing LLM refinement, using deterministic or semi-deterministic rules.
4. Methods of integrating game-specific heuristics to guide the LLM's responses.
5. Suggestions for benchmarking the LLM's decision-making quality against predefined rule-based logic. 

================================== Ai Message ==================================

STRATEGY:

### 1. Designing Effective Prompts
The LLM query prompt construction should be more specific and structured to guide LLM decision-making effectively:
- **Segmented Contextual Prompting**: Break down the game state into key elements like resource availability, victory point progression, and opponent analysis. Use explicit headers, such as:
  ```
  Current Game State:
  - Player Stats: {resources}, {road_length}, {settlements}, {cities}, etc.
  - Opponent Stats: {resource_blockades}, {army_strength}, etc.
  - Goal: Maximize VP by using optimal actions considering available resources and the board state.
  ```
- **Action Explanation Request**: Explicitly require the LLM to provide a rationale for its decision:
  ```
  Respond with the optimal action and briefly justify your reasoning (e.g., maximizing resource gain or blocking opponent's road expansion).
  Example response structure:
  Action: {Chosen Action}
  Justification: {Rationale for Decision}
  ```

---

### 2. Alternative Fallback Mechanisms
Introduce enhanced fallback strategies when LLM returns invalid or ambiguous responses:
- **Priority Filtering**: Analyze the playable actions and prioritize the highest-value action types based on static strategic criteria:
  ```python
  if ActionType.BUILD_CITY in [action.action_type for action in playable_actions]:
      return next(action for action in playable_actions if action.action_type == ActionType.BUILD_CITY)
  ```
- **Deterministic Action Flow**: Create a ranked hierarchy of action preferences:
  1. Build City
  2. Build Settlement
  3. Build Road
  4. End Turn
  When the LLM fails, actions are chosen following this hierarchy.

---

### 3. Strategies to Compete With AlphaBetaPlayer During Testing
To reduce dependency on the LLM when aiming for immediate competitiveness:
- **Simplistic Economic Strategy**: Implement deterministic rules to prioritize resource gathering and expansion, focusing on settlement and city building to optimize resource production.
- **Blocking Mechanism**: Develop routines to block high-value paths or settlement spots for opponents while maintaining growth.
- **Pre-defined Decision Trees**: Temporarily hard-code a simple decision tree for strategy execution, emphasizing actions like:
  - If Victory Points >= threshold, prioritize defensive moves.
  - Else, expand aggressively towards high VP goals.

---

### 4. Integrating Game-Specific Heuristics to Guide the LLM
Provide the LLM with board knowledge by embedding heuristic calculations into the prompt:
- **Heuristic Scoring in Prompts**: Add metrics like road potential, resource diversity, and opponent growth advantage:
  ```
  Heuristic Scores:
  - Settlement Value: {calculated_value}
  - City Upgrade Value: {calculated_value}
  - Road Extension Value: {calculated_value}
  Prioritize the action with the highest heuristic score.
  ```
- **Guided Options List**: For each action, append a descriptive note:
  ```
  Here are the actions ranked by value:
  - Action A (Heuristic Value: 15.2): This blocks Player 2's longest road and increases your resource income.
  - Action B (Heuristic Value: 14.5): Upgrades a settlement to a city for 2 VP gain.
  ```

---

### 5. Benchmarking LLM Performance Against Rule-Based Logic
Establish a structured evaluation method to measure LLM's decision performance:
- **Simulated Competitive Runs**: Pair LLM-based FooPlayer with deterministic or AlphaBetaPlayer and track metrics (wins, VPs, strategic goals).
- **Monte Carlo Testing**: Run thousands of simulations where the LLM's actions are compared against a preset rule engine's results to assess decision quality in various scenarios.
- **Action Matching**: Create a dataset of optimal moves in given scenarios (based on historical game trends or AlphaBetaPlayer’s performances) to compare how often LLM decisions align with the "ground truth."
- **Score Weighting Metrics**:
  - Victory Point Contribution: Percentage of decisions that lead directly to VP gain.
  - Opponent Blocking: Success rate in disrupting opponent strategies.
  - Resource Utilization: Effective use of collected resources to maximize VP.

### Next Steps:
If necessary, prioritize implementing improved fallback mechanisms and basic decision trees first to ensure immediate competitiveness. Gradually integrate advanced decision-making systems via guided prompts and heuristic evaluations as LLM refinement continues.

After Running The New foo_player.py Player, Here is my analysis and findings:

### Scores of FooPlayer:
- Wins: 0
- Average Victory Points (VP): 2.0
- Average Settlements: 2.0
- Average Cities: 0.0
- Average Roads: 0.0
- Average Largest Army: 0.0
- Average Development VP: 0.0

### Short Analysis of Game Output:
- The phrase "Choosing First Action on Default" repeated throughout the log suggests that the implementation is defaulting to selecting the first action without strategy. 
- Results indicate poor performance compared to the opponent, with no victories achieved in the 3-game session. 

### Errors, Warnings, or Signs of Implementation Issues:
- **Implementation Warning**: The log shows "Choosing First Action on Default" continuously, indicating that the `decide` method is not leveraging the LLM integration (`self.llm.query_llm`) for decision-making.
- **Gameplay Warning**: The score disparity (2 VP versus 10 VP for the opponent) and the lack of progression in Cities, Roads, and Largest Army metrics highlight a lack of strategy execution.

Let me know if you need anything else!================================== Ai Message ==================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Improve the performance of the `FooPlayer.py` by introducing intelligent strategy logic that leverages the LLM for decision-making. Specifically, aim for a minimum win count of 1 within the next 5 iterations while improving VP, settlements, and measurable gameplay metrics.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Address the issue of the `decide` method defaulting to selecting the first action. Integrate the LLM's `query_llm` functionality to intelligently evaluate actions based on state and strategy.

CHOSEN AGENT: CODER

AGENT OBJECTIVE: 
The current implementation of `FooPlayer` is defaulting to selecting the first action, as evidenced by the repeated log message "Choosing First Action on Default." Modify the `decide` method to leverage the `self.llm.query_llm` functionality for decision-making. Specifically:

1. Replace the current first-action default with an implementation that:
   a. Obtains a list of possible actions from the game state.
   b. Queries the LLM (`self.llm.query_llm`) for the evaluation of these actions.
   c. Selects the most intelligent action based on the LLM's evaluation.

2. Ensure the decision logic is robust and includes handling scenarios such as:
   - No valid actions available.
   - LLM providing ambiguous or conflicting guidance (fallback mechanisms).

3. Include clear comments and logging to observe how the LLM is influencing decision-making.

Once done, provide the modified code to be tested.================================ Human Message =================================

CODER

### Changes Made:
1. **Replaced Default Action Selection**:
   - Removed the hardcoded `return playable_actions[0]` that selected the first action by default.

2. **Integrated LLM Decision-Making in `decide`**:
   - Constructed a comprehensive prompt using the `_build_prompt` function to provide the LLM with game state and available actions.
   - Queried the LLM using `self.llm.query_llm(prompt)`.
   - Parsed the LLM's response using the `_parse_llm_response` function to select the most appropriate action from the available options.

3. **Added New Helper Methods**:
   - `_build_prompt`: Constructs a prompt by including the current game state and the list of playable actions.
   - `_parse_llm_response`: Interprets the LLM's response to match it with one of the playable actions. If no match is found, defaults to the first action.

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Included error handling for cases where the LLM query fails or returns an ambiguous response. In such cases, the method defaults to selecting the first action.
   - Added logging to show the LLM's response (`print(f"LLM Response: {llm_response}")`) and fallback mechanisms.

5. **Logging and Debugging**:
   - Added print statements for better debugging and observation:
     - Log when no playable actions are available.
     - Log the LLM's raw response.
     - Log if the response is ambiguous or invalid, and the fallback action is selected.

### Notes for the Next Iteration:
- **Prompt Details**: The current `_build_prompt` function makes a basic serialization of the game state and actions. If the LLM struggles to prioritize or understand the game details, refining this prompt may be necessary.
- **LLM Error Responses**: If runtime timing issues with `query_llm` arise (e.g., long delays or failures), adjustment of query limits or timeouts may be needed.

### Testing Recommendations:
- Test how the LLM chooses actions in various scenarios to verify that the parsing logic aligns with actual gameplay.
- Monitor logs (`LLM Response: ...`) for unexpected behaviors or ambiguous responses.

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Develop a robust strategy execution mechanism that effectively leverages the LLM for decision-making. The aim is to improve FooPlayer's win count and strategic metrics, including roads, cities, and army contributions, while ensuring VP increases consistently over the iterations.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Address the LLM integration issue by refining the prompt construction in `_build_prompt` and improving the parsing logic in `_parse_llm_response`. Ensure valid and actionable responses are obtained and utilized for strategic decision-making.

CHOSEN AGENT: STRATEGIZER

AGENT OBJECTIVE: 
The LLM responses are ambiguous or invalid, causing the FooPlayer to revert to default fallback actions. This suggests that the strategy design or LLM integration is insufficiently aligned with achieving optimal gameplay outcomes. 

Please provide 5 new strategy options that could address these key deficiencies:
1. How to design prompts to make the LLM understand the game state and prioritize optimal actions more effectively.
2. Ideas for alternative fallback mechanisms if the LLM fails to provide valid responses.
3. Strategies to temporarily compete with AlphaBetaPlayer while testing LLM refinement, using deterministic or semi-deterministic rules.
4. Methods of integrating game-specific heuristics to guide the LLM's responses.
5. Suggestions for benchmarking the LLM's decision-making quality against predefined rule-based logic.================================ Human Message =================================

STRATEGY:

### 1. Designing Effective Prompts
The LLM query prompt construction should be more specific and structured to guide LLM decision-making effectively:
- **Segmented Contextual Prompting**: Break down the game state into key elements like resource availability, victory point progression, and opponent analysis. Use explicit headers, such as:
  ```
  Current Game State:
  - Player Stats: {resources}, {road_length}, {settlements}, {cities}, etc.
  - Opponent Stats: {resource_blockades}, {army_strength}, etc.
  - Goal: Maximize VP by using optimal actions considering available resources and the board state.
  ```
- **Action Explanation Request**: Explicitly require the LLM to provide a rationale for its decision:
  ```
  Respond with the optimal action and briefly justify your reasoning (e.g., maximizing resource gain or blocking opponent's road expansion).
  Example response structure:
  Action: {Chosen Action}
  Justification: {Rationale for Decision}
  ```

---

### 2. Alternative Fallback Mechanisms
Introduce enhanced fallback strategies when LLM returns invalid or ambiguous responses:
- **Priority Filtering**: Analyze the playable actions and prioritize the highest-value action types based on static strategic criteria:
  ```python
  if ActionType.BUILD_CITY in [action.action_type for action in playable_actions]:
      return next(action for action in playable_actions if action.action_type == ActionType.BUILD_CITY)
  ```
- **Deterministic Action Flow**: Create a ranked hierarchy of action preferences:
  1. Build City
  2. Build Settlement
  3. Build Road
  4. End Turn
  When the LLM fails, actions are chosen following this hierarchy.

---

### 3. Strategies to Compete With AlphaBetaPlayer During Testing
To reduce dependency on the LLM when aiming for immediate competitiveness:
- **Simplistic Economic Strategy**: Implement deterministic rules to prioritize resource gathering and expansion, focusing on settlement and city building to optimize resource production.
- **Blocking Mechanism**: Develop routines to block high-value paths or settlement spots for opponents while maintaining growth.
- **Pre-defined Decision Trees**: Temporarily hard-code a simple decision tree for strategy execution, emphasizing actions like:
  - If Victory Points >= threshold, prioritize defensive moves.
  - Else, expand aggressively towards high VP goals.

---

### 4. Integrating Game-Specific Heuristics to Guide the LLM
Provide the LLM with board knowledge by embedding heuristic calculations into the prompt:
- **Heuristic Scoring in Prompts**: Add metrics like road potential, resource diversity, and opponent growth advantage:
  ```
  Heuristic Scores:
  - Settlement Value: {calculated_value}
  - City Upgrade Value: {calculated_value}
  - Road Extension Value: {calculated_value}
  Prioritize the action with the highest heuristic score.
  ```
- **Guided Options List**: For each action, append a descriptive note:
  ```
  Here are the actions ranked by value:
  - Action A (Heuristic Value: 15.2): This blocks Player 2's longest road and increases your resource income.
  - Action B (Heuristic Value: 14.5): Upgrades a settlement to a city for 2 VP gain.
  ```

---

### 5. Benchmarking LLM Performance Against Rule-Based Logic
Establish a structured evaluation method to measure LLM's decision performance:
- **Simulated Competitive Runs**: Pair LLM-based FooPlayer with deterministic or AlphaBetaPlayer and track metrics (wins, VPs, strategic goals).
- **Monte Carlo Testing**: Run thousands of simulations where the LLM's actions are compared against a preset rule engine's results to assess decision quality in various scenarios.
- **Action Matching**: Create a dataset of optimal moves in given scenarios (based on historical game trends or AlphaBetaPlayer’s performances) to compare how often LLM decisions align with the "ground truth."
- **Score Weighting Metrics**:
  - Victory Point Contribution: Percentage of decisions that lead directly to VP gain.
  - Opponent Blocking: Success rate in disrupting opponent strategies.
  - Resource Utilization: Effective use of collected resources to maximize VP.

END STRATEGY.================================== Ai Message ==================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Transition FooPlayer into a competitive player over the next 5 iterations by leveraging enhanced strategy, including heuristic reinforcement, refined LLM prompts, and deterministic fallback mechanisms, and targeting measurable improvements in average VP and win rates.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Implement **segmented contextual prompting** and heuristic-enhanced decision-making into the LLM integration (as per Strategy 1 and 4). Additionally, integrate a **ranked action hierarchy** as a fallback mechanism (Strategy 2).

CHOSEN AGENT: CODER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:  
Modify the `decide` method of `FooPlayer.py` to achieve the following:

1. **Refined LLM Prompt**: 
   - Update the `_build_prompt` function to use **segmented contextual prompting**. Include headers that describe the game state, available resources, and strategic goals. Example structure:
     ```
     Current Game State:
     - Player Stats: {resources}, {settlements}, {cities}, VP: {victory_points}
     - Opponent Stats: {opponent resources/blockades}, etc.
     Goal: Maximize VP while taking advantage of the current game state.
     Available Actions: {list of formatted playable actions}
     Respond with:
     Action: {Selected optimal action}
     Justification: {Reasoning behind the action choice}
     ```

2. **Heuristic Context Integration**:
   - In the `_build_prompt` method, compute heuristic scores (e.g., settlement value, city upgrade value, road extension value) for each action. Integrate these scores into the prompt to help the LLM make better decisions.

3. **Fallback Mechanism**:
   - Enhance `_parse_llm_response` to implement a **ranked action hierarchy** fallback mechanism when the LLM output is invalid or ambiguous. Example hierarchy:
     - Priority Order: Build City > Build Settlement > Build Road > End Turn.
     - If a valid option matching the LLM response is not found, return the first valid action in this priority order.

4. **Logging**:
   - Improve logging to capture the heuristic scores, the LLM prompt, its raw response, and the fallback decision (when necessary) for post-game analysis.

  - Victory Point Contribution: Percentage of decisions that lead directly to VP gain.
  - Opponent Blocking: Success rate in disrupting opponent strategies.
  - Resource Utilization: Effective use of collected resources to maximize VP.
  
---

### Next Steps:
If necessary, prioritize implementing improved fallback mechanisms and basic decision trees first to ensure immediate competitiveness. Gradually integrate advanced decision-making systems via guided prompts and heuristic evaluations as LLM refinement continues.

END STRATEGY.================================== Ai Message ==================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Transition FooPlayer into a competitive player over the next 5 iterations by leveraging enhanced strategy, including heuristic reinforcement, refined LLM prompts, and deterministic fallback mechanisms, and targeting measurable improvements in average VP and win rates.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Implement **segmented contextual prompting** and heuristic-enhanced decision-making into the LLM integration (as per Strategy 1 and 4). Additionally, integrate a **ranked action hierarchy** as a fallback mechanism (Strategy 2).

CHOSEN AGENT: CODER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:  
Modify the `decide` method of `FooPlayer.py` to achieve the following:

1. **Refined LLM Prompt**: 
   - Update the `_build_prompt` function to use **segmented contextual prompting**. Include headers that describe the game state, available resources, and strategic goals. Example structure:
     ```
     Current Game State:
     - Player Stats: {resources}, {settlements}, {cities}, VP: {victory_points}
     - Opponent Stats: {opponent resources/blockades}, etc.
     Goal: Maximize VP while taking advantage of the current game state.
     Available Actions: {list of formatted playable actions}
     Respond with:
     Action: {Selected optimal action}
     Justification: {Reasoning behind the action choice}
     ```

2. **Heuristic Context Integration**:
   - In the `_build_prompt` method, compute heuristic scores (e.g., settlement value, city upgrade value, road extension value) for each action. Integrate these scores into the prompt to help the LLM make better decisions.

3. **Fallback Mechanism**:
   - Enhance `_parse_llm_response` to implement a **ranked action hierarchy** fallback mechanism when the LLM output is invalid or ambiguous. Example hierarchy:
     - Priority Order: Build City > Build Settlement > Build Road > End Turn.
     - If a valid option matching the LLM response is not found, return the first valid action in this priority order.

4. **Logging**:
   - Improve logging to capture the heuristic scores, the LLM prompt, its raw response, and the fallback decision (when necessary) for post-game analysis.

Once complete, test the updated `FooPlayer.py`, run games, and report the results.================================ Human Message =================================

CODER

### Changes Made:
1. **Refined LLM Prompt Construction**:
   - Enhanced the `_build_prompt` function to use **segmented contextual prompting** with detailed headers for game state, player stats, opponent stats, and available actions.
   - Integrated **heuristic scores** for each action into the prompt to guide the LLM decision-making.

2. **Heuristic Computation Method**:
   - Added a `_compute_heuristic_scores` helper method to assign heuristic values to each action based on action type (e.g., city-building prioritized over road-building).

3. **Improved Parsing Logic**:
   - Enhanced `_parse_llm_response` to return a matching action from the LLM response, or delegate to the fallback mechanism if no match is found.

4. **Ranked Fallback Mechanism**:
   - Implemented `_fallback_action` to evaluate actions in a priority order: Build City > Build Settlement > Build Road > End Turn.
   - Default to the first action only when no prioritized options exist.

5. **Logging**:
   - Added print statements throughout to capture key debugging information:
     - The LLM prompt.
     - Heuristic scores of actions.
     - The LLM's raw response.
     - Logs for fallback mechanism use.

6. **Error Handling Enhancements**:
   - Integrated robust exception handling in the `decide` method for LLM failures, with clear logging of fallbacks.

### Notes for the Next Iteration:
- Tune the **heuristic scores** if the LLM's decisions align poorly with optimal strategies.
- Monitor how well the LLM responds to the enhanced prompt structure during testing.
- Evaluate the fallback mechanism's efficiency in comparison to the LLM's responses.

### Testing Recommendations:
- Focus on scenarios requiring diverse strategic goals (e.g., blocking opponent moves, building towards Largest Army).
- Analyze logs for patterns in ambiguous or ineffective LLM responses, and refine prompts or fallback heuristics accordingly.

================================== Ai Message ==================================

After Running The New foo_player.py Player, Here is my analysis and findings:

### Scores of FooPlayer:
- Wins: 0
- Average Victory Points (VP): 2.0
- Average Settlements: 2.0
- Average Cities: 0.0
- Average Roads: 0.0
- Average Largest Army: 0.0
- Average Development VP: 0.0

### Short Analysis of Game Output:
- The phrase "Choosing First Action on Default" repeated throughout the log suggests that the implementation is defaulting to selecting the first action without strategy. 
- Results indicate poor performance compared to the opponent, with no victories achieved in the 3-game session. 

### Errors, Warnings, or Signs of Implementation Issues:
- **Implementation Warning**: The log shows "Choosing First Action on Default" continuously, indicating that the `decide` method is not leveraging the LLM integration (`self.llm.query_llm`) for decision-making.
- **Gameplay Warning**: The score disparity (2 VP versus 10 VP for the opponent) and the lack of progression in Cities, Roads, and Largest Army metrics highlight a lack of strategy execution.

- Average Cities: 0.33  
- Average Roads: 0.0  
- Average Largest Army: 0.0  
- Average Development VP: 0.33  

### Short Analysis of Game Output:
- The LLM consistently failed to provide valid or actionable responses: "LLM response ambiguous or invalid. Defaulting to first action."
- FooPlayer defaulted to the first available action in all scenarios instead of executing strategic decisions.
- The performance difference is stark: FooPlayer had no wins and significantly lower VP compared to AlphaBetaPlayer.

### Errors, Warnings, or Signs of Implementation Issues:
- **LLM Integration Issue**: LLM responses are not being parsed correctly or are poorly generated, leading to fallback actions ("Defaulting to first action").
- **Decision-Making Deficiency**: The lack of strategic outcomes (e.g., 0 roads, 0 Largest Army) suggests serious shortcomings in action planning and execution.
- **Repeated Logs**: Multiple instances of ambiguous LLM responses point to insufficient prompt design or response parsing mechanism in `_parse_llm_response`.

    - Short analysis of the game output (return anything interseting that was printed)
    - EMPHASIZE any errors, warnings, or signs of player implementation error in the game_output.txt file 

If there is a syntax error, I want you to return
    - The error message from the game_output.txt file
    - The exact line number of the error if possible
    - The exact line of code that caused the error if possible

Keep the Response as concise as possible

After Running The New foo_player.py Player, Here is my analysis and findings:

### Syntax Error Details:
- **Error Message**: `AttributeError: 'Game' object has no attribute 'get_player_resources'`
- **Exact Line Number**: Line 84 in `foo_player.py`
- **Exact Line of Code**: `resources=str(game.get_player_resources(Color.BLUE)),  # Example method to get resources`

### Root Cause:
The method `get_player_resources` is being called on the `Game` object, but it does not exist in the `Game` class, leading to an `AttributeError`. This indicates a mismatch between the game's API and the implementation in `foo_player.py`.

### Impact:
The syntax error prevents the game from running, and thus no game results were recorded for this evolution.

After Running The New foo_player.py Player, Here is my analysis and findings:

### Scores of FooPlayer:
- Wins: 0
- Average Victory Points (VP): 2.0
- Average Settlements: 2.0
- Average Cities: 0.0
- Average Roads: 0.0
- Average Largest Army: 0.0
- Average Development VP: 0.0

### Short Analysis of Game Output:
- The phrase "Choosing First Action on Default" repeated throughout the log suggests that the implementation is defaulting to selecting the first action without strategy. 
- Results indicate poor performance compared to the opponent, with no victories achieved in the 3-game session. 

### Errors, Warnings, or Signs of Implementation Issues:
- **Implementation Warning**: The log shows "Choosing First Action on Default" continuously, indicating that the `decide` method is not leveraging the LLM integration (`self.llm.query_llm`) for decision-making.
- **Gameplay Warning**: The score disparity (2 VP versus 10 VP for the opponent) and the lack of progression in Cities, Roads, and Largest Army metrics highlight a lack of strategy execution.

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Improve the performance of the `FooPlayer.py` by introducing intelligent strategy logic that leverages the LLM for decision-making. Specifically, aim for a minimum win count of 1 within the next 5 iterations while improving VP, settlements, and measurable gameplay metrics.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Address the issue of the `decide` method defaulting to selecting the first action. Integrate the LLM's `query_llm` functionality to intelligently evaluate actions based on state and strategy.

CHOSEN AGENT: CODER

AGENT OBJECTIVE: 
The current implementation of `FooPlayer` is defaulting to selecting the first action, as evidenced by the repeated log message "Choosing First Action on Default." Modify the `decide` method to leverage the `self.llm.query_llm` functionality for decision-making. Specifically:

1. Replace the current first-action default with an implementation that:
   a. Obtains a list of possible actions from the game state.
   b. Queries the LLM (`self.llm.query_llm`) for the evaluation of these actions.
   c. Selects the most intelligent action based on the LLM's evaluation.

2. Ensure the decision logic is robust and includes handling scenarios such as:
   - No valid actions available.
   - LLM providing ambiguous or conflicting guidance (fallback mechanisms).

3. Include clear comments and logging to observe how the LLM is influencing decision-making.

Once done, provide the modified code to be tested.================================ Human Message =================================

CODER

### Changes Made:
1. **Replaced Default Action Selection**:
   - Removed the hardcoded `return playable_actions[0]` that selected the first action by default.

2. **Integrated LLM Decision-Making in `decide`**:
   - Constructed a comprehensive prompt using the `_build_prompt` function to provide the LLM with game state and available actions.
   - Queried the LLM using `self.llm.query_llm(prompt)`.
   - Parsed the LLM's response using the `_parse_llm_response` function to select the most appropriate action from the available options.

3. **Added New Helper Methods**:
   - `_build_prompt`: Constructs a prompt by including the current game state and the list of playable actions.
   - `_parse_llm_response`: Interprets the LLM's response to match it with one of the playable actions. If no match is found, defaults to the first action.

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Included error handling for cases where the LLM query fails or returns an ambiguous response. In such cases, the method defaults to selecting the first action.
   - Added logging to show the LLM's response (`print(f"LLM Response: {llm_response}")`) and fallback mechanisms.

5. **Logging and Debugging**:
   - Added print statements for better debugging and observation:
     - Log when no playable actions are available.
     - Log the LLM's raw response.
     - Log if the response is ambiguous or invalid, and the fallback action is selected.

### Notes for the Next Iteration:
- **Prompt Details**: The current `_build_prompt` function makes a basic serialization of the game state and actions. If the LLM struggles to prioritize or understand the game details, refining this prompt may be necessary.
- **LLM Error Responses**: If runtime timing issues with `query_llm` arise (e.g., long delays or failures), adjustment of query limits or timeouts may be needed.

### Testing Recommendations:
- Test how the LLM chooses actions in various scenarios to verify that the parsing logic aligns with actual gameplay.
- Monitor logs (`LLM Response: ...`) for unexpected behaviors or ambiguous responses.

After Running The New foo_player.py Player, Here is my analysis and findings:

### Scores of FooPlayer:
- Wins: 0  
- Average Victory Points (VP): 3.33  
- Average Settlements: 2.33  
- Average Cities: 0.33  
- Average Roads: 0.0  
- Average Largest Army: 0.0  
- Average Development VP: 0.33  

### Short Analysis of Game Output:
- The LLM consistently failed to provide valid or actionable responses: "LLM response ambiguous or invalid. Defaulting to first action."
- FooPlayer defaulted to the first available action in all scenarios instead of executing strategic decisions.
- The performance difference is stark: FooPlayer had no wins and significantly lower VP compared to AlphaBetaPlayer.

### Errors, Warnings, or Signs of Implementation Issues:
- **LLM Integration Issue**: LLM responses are not being parsed correctly or are poorly generated, leading to fallback actions ("Defaulting to first action").
- **Decision-Making Deficiency**: The lack of strategic outcomes (e.g., 0 roads, 0 Largest Army) suggests serious shortcomings in action planning and execution.
- **Repeated Logs**: Multiple instances of ambiguous LLM responses point to insufficient prompt design or response parsing mechanism in `_parse_llm_response`.

Let me know if you need anything else!================================== Ai Message ==================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Develop a robust strategy execution mechanism that effectively leverages the LLM for decision-making. The aim is to improve FooPlayer's win count and strategic metrics, including roads, cities, and army contributions, while ensuring VP increases consistently over the iterations.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Address the LLM integration issue by refining the prompt construction in `_build_prompt` and improving the parsing logic in `_parse_llm_response`. Ensure valid and actionable responses are obtained and utilized for strategic decision-making.

CHOSEN AGENT: STRATEGIZER

AGENT OBJECTIVE: 
The LLM responses are ambiguous or invalid, causing the FooPlayer to revert to default fallback actions. This suggests that the strategy design or LLM integration is insufficiently aligned with achieving optimal gameplay outcomes. 

Please provide 5 new strategy options that could address these key deficiencies:
1. How to design prompts to make the LLM understand the game state and prioritize optimal actions more effectively.
2. Ideas for alternative fallback mechanisms if the LLM fails to provide valid responses.
3. Strategies to temporarily compete with AlphaBetaPlayer while testing LLM refinement, using deterministic or semi-deterministic rules.
4. Methods of integrating game-specific heuristics to guide the LLM's responses.
5. Suggestions for benchmarking the LLM's decision-making quality against predefined rule-based logic.================================ Human Message =================================

STRATEGY:

### 1. Designing Effective Prompts
The LLM query prompt construction should be more specific and structured to guide LLM decision-making effectively:
- **Segmented Contextual Prompting**: Break down the game state into key elements like resource availability, victory point progression, and opponent analysis. Use explicit headers, such as:
  ```
  Current Game State:
  - Player Stats: {resources}, {road_length}, {settlements}, {cities}, etc.
  - Opponent Stats: {resource_blockades}, {army_strength}, etc.
  - Goal: Maximize VP by using optimal actions considering available resources and the board state.
  ```
- **Action Explanation Request**: Explicitly require the LLM to provide a rationale for its decision:
  ```
  Respond with the optimal action and briefly justify your reasoning (e.g., maximizing resource gain or blocking opponent's road expansion).
  Example response structure:
  Action: {Chosen Action}
  Justification: {Rationale for Decision}
  ```

---

### 2. Alternative Fallback Mechanisms
Introduce enhanced fallback strategies when LLM returns invalid or ambiguous responses:
- **Priority Filtering**: Analyze the playable actions and prioritize the highest-value action types based on static strategic criteria:
  ```python
  if ActionType.BUILD_CITY in [action.action_type for action in playable_actions]:
      return next(action for action in playable_actions if action.action_type == ActionType.BUILD_CITY)
  ```
- **Deterministic Action Flow**: Create a ranked hierarchy of action preferences:
  1. Build City
  2. Build Settlement
  3. Build Road
  4. End Turn
  When the LLM fails, actions are chosen following this hierarchy.

---

### 3. Strategies to Compete With AlphaBetaPlayer During Testing
To reduce dependency on the LLM when aiming for immediate competitiveness:
- **Simplistic Economic Strategy**: Implement deterministic rules to prioritize resource gathering and expansion, focusing on settlement and city building to optimize resource production.
- **Blocking Mechanism**: Develop routines to block high-value paths or settlement spots for opponents while maintaining growth.
- **Pre-defined Decision Trees**: Temporarily hard-code a simple decision tree for strategy execution, emphasizing actions like:
  - If Victory Points >= threshold, prioritize defensive moves.
  - Else, expand aggressively towards high VP goals.

---

### 4. Integrating Game-Specific Heuristics to Guide the LLM
Provide the LLM with board knowledge by embedding heuristic calculations into the prompt:
- **Heuristic Scoring in Prompts**: Add metrics like road potential, resource diversity, and opponent growth advantage:
  ```
  Heuristic Scores:
  - Settlement Value: {calculated_value}
  - City Upgrade Value: {calculated_value}
  - Road Extension Value: {calculated_value}
  Prioritize the action with the highest heuristic score.
  ```
- **Guided Options List**: For each action, append a descriptive note:
  ```
  Here are the actions ranked by value:
  - Action A (Heuristic Value: 15.2): This blocks Player 2's longest road and increases your resource income.
  - Action B (Heuristic Value: 14.5): Upgrades a settlement to a city for 2 VP gain.
  ```

---

### 5. Benchmarking LLM Performance Against Rule-Based Logic
Establish a structured evaluation method to measure LLM's decision performance:
- **Simulated Competitive Runs**: Pair LLM-based FooPlayer with deterministic or AlphaBetaPlayer and track metrics (wins, VPs, strategic goals).
- **Monte Carlo Testing**: Run thousands of simulations where the LLM's actions are compared against a preset rule engine's results to assess decision quality in various scenarios.
- **Action Matching**: Create a dataset of optimal moves in given scenarios (based on historical game trends or AlphaBetaPlayer’s performances) to compare how often LLM decisions align with the "ground truth."
- **Score Weighting Metrics**:
  - Victory Point Contribution: Percentage of decisions that lead directly to VP gain.
  - Opponent Blocking: Success rate in disrupting opponent strategies.
  - Resource Utilization: Effective use of collected resources to maximize VP.
  
---

### Next Steps:
If necessary, prioritize implementing improved fallback mechanisms and basic decision trees first to ensure immediate competitiveness. Gradually integrate advanced decision-making systems via guided prompts and heuristic evaluations as LLM refinement continues.

END STRATEGY.================================== Ai Message ==================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Transition FooPlayer into a competitive player over the next 5 iterations by leveraging enhanced strategy, including heuristic reinforcement, refined LLM prompts, and deterministic fallback mechanisms, and targeting measurable improvements in average VP and win rates.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Implement **segmented contextual prompting** and heuristic-enhanced decision-making into the LLM integration (as per Strategy 1 and 4). Additionally, integrate a **ranked action hierarchy** as a fallback mechanism (Strategy 2).

CHOSEN AGENT: CODER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:  
Modify the `decide` method of `FooPlayer.py` to achieve the following:

1. **Refined LLM Prompt**: 
   - Update the `_build_prompt` function to use **segmented contextual prompting**. Include headers that describe the game state, available resources, and strategic goals. Example structure:
     ```
     Current Game State:
     - Player Stats: {resources}, {settlements}, {cities}, VP: {victory_points}
     - Opponent Stats: {opponent resources/blockades}, etc.
     Goal: Maximize VP while taking advantage of the current game state.
     Available Actions: {list of formatted playable actions}
     Respond with:
     Action: {Selected optimal action}
     Justification: {Reasoning behind the action choice}
     ```

2. **Heuristic Context Integration**:
   - In the `_build_prompt` method, compute heuristic scores (e.g., settlement value, city upgrade value, road extension value) for each action. Integrate these scores into the prompt to help the LLM make better decisions.

3. **Fallback Mechanism**:
   - Enhance `_parse_llm_response` to implement a **ranked action hierarchy** fallback mechanism when the LLM output is invalid or ambiguous. Example hierarchy:
     - Priority Order: Build City > Build Settlement > Build Road > End Turn.
     - If a valid option matching the LLM response is not found, return the first valid action in this priority order.

4. **Logging**:
   - Improve logging to capture the heuristic scores, the LLM prompt, its raw response, and the fallback decision (when necessary) for post-game analysis.

Once complete, test the updated `FooPlayer.py`, run games, and report the results.================================ Human Message =================================

CODER

### Changes Made:
1. **Refined LLM Prompt Construction**:
   - Enhanced the `_build_prompt` function to use **segmented contextual prompting** with detailed headers for game state, player stats, opponent stats, and available actions.
   - Integrated **heuristic scores** for each action into the prompt to guide the LLM decision-making.

2. **Heuristic Computation Method**:
   - Added a `_compute_heuristic_scores` helper method to assign heuristic values to each action based on action type (e.g., city-building prioritized over road-building).

3. **Improved Parsing Logic**:
   - Enhanced `_parse_llm_response` to return a matching action from the LLM response, or delegate to the fallback mechanism if no match is found.

4. **Ranked Fallback Mechanism**:
   - Implemented `_fallback_action` to evaluate actions in a priority order: Build City > Build Settlement > Build Road > End Turn.
   - Default to the first action only when no prioritized options exist.

5. **Logging**:
   - Added print statements throughout to capture key debugging information:
     - The LLM prompt.
     - Heuristic scores of actions.
     - The LLM's raw response.
     - Logs for fallback mechanism use.

6. **Error Handling Enhancements**:
   - Integrated robust exception handling in the `decide` method for LLM failures, with clear logging of fallbacks.

### Notes for the Next Iteration:
- Tune the **heuristic scores** if the LLM's decisions align poorly with optimal strategies.
- Monitor how well the LLM responds to the enhanced prompt structure during testing.
- Evaluate the fallback mechanism's efficiency in comparison to the LLM's responses.

### Testing Recommendations:
- Focus on scenarios requiring diverse strategic goals (e.g., blocking opponent moves, building towards Largest Army).
- Analyze logs for patterns in ambiguous or ineffective LLM responses, and refine prompts or fallback heuristics accordingly.

AttributeError: 'Game' object has no attribute 'get_player_resources'================================ Human Message =================================

After Running The New foo_player.py Player, Here is my analysis and findings:

### Syntax Error Details:
- **Error Message**: `AttributeError: 'Game' object has no attribute 'get_player_resources'`
- **Exact Line Number**: Line 84 in `foo_player.py`
- **Exact Line of Code**: `resources=str(game.get_player_resources(Color.BLUE)),  # Example method to get resources`

### Root Cause:
The method `get_player_resources` is being called on the `Game` object, but it does not exist in the `Game` class, leading to an `AttributeError`. This indicates a mismatch between the game's API and the implementation in `foo_player.py`.

### Impact:
The syntax error prevents the game from running, and thus no game results were recorded for this evolution.

Let me know if you need anything else!================================== Ai Message ==================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Refactor FooPlayer to work seamlessly with the Catanatron API while continuing to enhance strategic decision-making via heuristic integration and LLM refinement. Achieve compatibility and avoid critical runtime errors in the next evolution to allow for testing and evaluation.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Resolve the `AttributeError` by ensuring that `foo_player.py` uses valid methods from the Catanatron `Game` class for retrieving player resources and other game state data. Validate the compatibility of all API calls in the `_build_prompt` method.

CHOSEN AGENT: RESEARCHER

AGENT OBJECTIVE: 
Identify the correct way to access the following game state information from the Catanatron API:
1. Player resources (e.g., wood, brick, grain, etc.) for a specific color (e.g., `Color.BLUE`).
2. Obtain other player and game statistics that might be relevant for building the LLM prompt (e.g., settlements, cities, roads, VP).
3. Provide a list of valid Game API methods and properties that could be helpful for efficiently querying such state details.

Ensure that the information provided directly addresses the API compatibility issues in `foo_player.py`.================================ Human Message =================================

RESEARCH:

#### Key Information on Accessing Game State Using Catanatron API

**1. Accessing Player Resources**
To retrieve resources (e.g., wood, brick, grain, etc.) for a specific player:
- Use the `get_player_freqdeck(state, color)` function, which provides the player's resource frequency deck.
  ```python
  from catanatron.state_functions import get_player_freqdeck
  player_resources = get_player_freqdeck(state, Color.BLUE)
  ```
- `player_num_resource_cards(state, color, resource)` can query the count for specific resources:
  ```python
  from catanatron.state_functions import player_num_resource_cards
  wood_count = player_num_resource_cards(state, Color.BLUE, "WOOD")
  ```

**2. Accessing Player and Game Statistics**
For settlements, cities, roads, and VP:
- **Settlements**: Use `get_player_buildings(state, color, "SETTLEMENT")` to retrieve settlement IDs of a player:
  ```python
  from catanatron.state_functions import get_player_buildings
  settlements = get_player_buildings(state, Color.BLUE, "SETTLEMENT")
  ```
- **Cities**: Similarly invoke `get_player_buildings(state, color, "CITY")` for city IDs:
  ```python
  cities = get_player_buildings(state, Color.BLUE, "CITY")
  ```
- **Roads Available**: Check roads available using state data:
  ```python
  player_key = player_key(state, Color.BLUE)
  roads_available = state.player_state[f"{player_key}_ROADS_AVAILABLE"]
  ```
- **Victory Points**: Victory points can be checked via:
  ```python
  victory_points = state.player_state[f"{player_key}_ACTUAL_VICTORY_POINTS"]
  ```

**3. General Game State Statistics**
The class `Game` contains the main API-level functions for interacting with game state, including:
- `play_tick()` to advance the game state.
- `winning_color()` to retrieve the player currently winning the game.
- `state.playable_actions` to list the valid actions at the current step.

```python
winning_player = game.winning_color()
playable_options = game.state.playable_actions
```

#### List of Useful Methods and Properties in Game API:
Valid methods within the `Game` class and associated functions:
- `get_player_freqdeck(state, color)` – Retrieves player's resources.
- `player_num_resource_cards(state, color, resource)` – Gets the count for specific resources.
- `player_key(state, color)` – Returns string key for player state.
- `get_player_buildings(state, color, building_type)` – Retrieves player's settlements/cities.
- `state.playable_actions` – Provides the currently executable actions.
- `game.play_tick()` – Advances game state one step.
- `game.winning_color()` – Returns the winning color/player.
- `state.colors` – Lists the colors in the game.

**References:**
1. `catanatron_core/catanatron/game.py` - Contains the Game class and `play_tick`, `winning_color`, `state.playable_actions`.
2. `catanatron_core/catanatron/models/player.py` - Includes player model and decision-making classes.
3. `catanatron_core/catanatron/models/enums.py` - Defines resources, colors, and action types.
4. `catanatron_core/catanatron/models/actions.py` - Includes `get_player_freqdeck`, `player_num_resource_cards`, and `get_player_buildings`.

After Running The New foo_player.py Player, Here is my analysis and findings:

### Scores of FooPlayer:
- Wins: 0
- Average Victory Points (VP): 2.0
- Average Settlements: 2.0
- Average Cities: 0.0
- Average Roads: 0.0
- Average Largest Army: 0.0
- Average Development VP: 0.0

### Short Analysis of Game Output:
- The phrase "Choosing First Action on Default" repeated throughout the log suggests that the implementation is defaulting to selecting the first action without strategy. 
- Results indicate poor performance compared to the opponent, with no victories achieved in the 3-game session. 

### Errors, Warnings, or Signs of Implementation Issues:
- **Implementation Warning**: The log shows "Choosing First Action on Default" continuously, indicating that the `decide` method is not leveraging the LLM integration (`self.llm.query_llm`) for decision-making.
- **Gameplay Warning**: The score disparity (2 VP versus 10 VP for the opponent) and the lack of progression in Cities, Roads, and Largest Army metrics highlight a lack of strategy execution.

Let me know if you need anything else!================================== Ai Message ==================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Improve the performance of the `FooPlayer.py` by introducing intelligent strategy logic that leverages the LLM for decision-making. Specifically, aim for a minimum win count of 1 within the next 5 iterations while improving VP, settlements, and measurable gameplay metrics.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Address the issue of the `decide` method defaulting to selecting the first action. Integrate the LLM's `query_llm` functionality to intelligently evaluate actions based on state and strategy.

CHOSEN AGENT: CODER

AGENT OBJECTIVE: 
The current implementation of `FooPlayer` is defaulting to selecting the first action, as evidenced by the repeated log message "Choosing First Action on Default." Modify the `decide` method to leverage the `self.llm.query_llm` functionality for decision-making. Specifically:

1. Replace the current first-action default with an implementation that:
   a. Obtains a list of possible actions from the game state.
   b. Queries the LLM (`self.llm.query_llm`) for the evaluation of these actions.
   c. Selects the most intelligent action based on the LLM's evaluation.

2. Ensure the decision logic is robust and includes handling scenarios such as:
   - No valid actions available.
   - LLM providing ambiguous or conflicting guidance (fallback mechanisms).

3. Include clear comments and logging to observe how the LLM is influencing decision-making.

Once done, provide the modified code to be tested.================================ Human Message =================================

CODER

### Changes Made:
1. **Replaced Default Action Selection**:
   - Removed the hardcoded `return playable_actions[0]` that selected the first action by default.

2. **Integrated LLM Decision-Making in `decide`**:
   - Constructed a comprehensive prompt using the `_build_prompt` function to provide the LLM with game state and available actions.
   - Queried the LLM using `self.llm.query_llm(prompt)`.
   - Parsed the LLM's response using the `_parse_llm_response` function to select the most appropriate action from the available options.

3. **Added New Helper Methods**:
   - `_build_prompt`: Constructs a prompt by including the current game state and the list of playable actions.
   - `_parse_llm_response`: Interprets the LLM's response to match it with one of the playable actions. If no match is found, defaults to the first action.

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Included error handling for cases where the LLM query fails or returns an ambiguous response. In such cases, the method defaults to selecting the first action.
   - Added logging to show the LLM's response (`print(f"LLM Response: {llm_response}")`) and fallback mechanisms.

5. **Logging and Debugging**:
   - Added print statements for better debugging and observation:
     - Log when no playable actions are available.
     - Log the LLM's raw response.
     - Log if the response is ambiguous or invalid, and the fallback action is selected.

### Notes for the Next Iteration:
- **Prompt Details**: The current `_build_prompt` function makes a basic serialization of the game state and actions. If the LLM struggles to prioritize or understand the game details, refining this prompt may be necessary.
- **LLM Error Responses**: If runtime timing issues with `query_llm` arise (e.g., long delays or failures), adjustment of query limits or timeouts may be needed.

### Testing Recommendations:
- Test how the LLM chooses actions in various scenarios to verify that the parsing logic aligns with actual gameplay.
- Monitor logs (`LLM Response: ...`) for unexpected behaviors or ambiguous responses.

After Running The New foo_player.py Player, Here is my analysis and findings:

### Scores of FooPlayer:
- Wins: 0  
- Average Victory Points (VP): 3.33  
- Average Settlements: 2.33  
- Average Cities: 0.33  
- Average Roads: 0.0  
- Average Largest Army: 0.0  
- Average Development VP: 0.33  

### Short Analysis of Game Output:
- The LLM consistently failed to provide valid or actionable responses: "LLM response ambiguous or invalid. Defaulting to first action."
- FooPlayer defaulted to the first available action in all scenarios instead of executing strategic decisions.
- The performance difference is stark: FooPlayer had no wins and significantly lower VP compared to AlphaBetaPlayer.

### Errors, Warnings, or Signs of Implementation Issues:
- **LLM Integration Issue**: LLM responses are not being parsed correctly or are poorly generated, leading to fallback actions ("Defaulting to first action").
- **Decision-Making Deficiency**: The lack of strategic outcomes (e.g., 0 roads, 0 Largest Army) suggests serious shortcomings in action planning and execution.
- **Repeated Logs**: Multiple instances of ambiguous LLM responses point to insufficient prompt design or response parsing mechanism in `_parse_llm_response`.

Let me know if you need anything else!================================== Ai Message ==================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Develop a robust strategy execution mechanism that effectively leverages the LLM for decision-making. The aim is to improve FooPlayer's win count and strategic metrics, including roads, cities, and army contributions, while ensuring VP increases consistently over the iterations.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Address the LLM integration issue by refining the prompt construction in `_build_prompt` and improving the parsing logic in `_parse_llm_response`. Ensure valid and actionable responses are obtained and utilized for strategic decision-making.

CHOSEN AGENT: STRATEGIZER

AGENT OBJECTIVE: 
The LLM responses are ambiguous or invalid, causing the FooPlayer to revert to default fallback actions. This suggests that the strategy design or LLM integration is insufficiently aligned with achieving optimal gameplay outcomes. 

Please provide 5 new strategy options that could address these key deficiencies:
1. How to design prompts to make the LLM understand the game state and prioritize optimal actions more effectively.
2. Ideas for alternative fallback mechanisms if the LLM fails to provide valid responses.
3. Strategies to temporarily compete with AlphaBetaPlayer while testing LLM refinement, using deterministic or semi-deterministic rules.
4. Methods of integrating game-specific heuristics to guide the LLM's responses.
5. Suggestions for benchmarking the LLM's decision-making quality against predefined rule-based logic.================================ Human Message =================================

STRATEGY:

### 1. Designing Effective Prompts
The LLM query prompt construction should be more specific and structured to guide LLM decision-making effectively:
- **Segmented Contextual Prompting**: Break down the game state into key elements like resource availability, victory point progression, and opponent analysis. Use explicit headers, such as:
  ```
  Current Game State:
  - Player Stats: {resources}, {road_length}, {settlements}, {cities}, etc.
  - Opponent Stats: {resource_blockades}, {army_strength}, etc.
  - Goal: Maximize VP by using optimal actions considering available resources and the board state.
  ```
- **Action Explanation Request**: Explicitly require the LLM to provide a rationale for its decision:
  ```
  Respond with the optimal action and briefly justify your reasoning (e.g., maximizing resource gain or blocking opponent's road expansion).
  Example response structure:
  Action: {Chosen Action}
  Justification: {Rationale for Decision}
  ```

---

### 2. Alternative Fallback Mechanisms
Introduce enhanced fallback strategies when LLM returns invalid or ambiguous responses:
- **Priority Filtering**: Analyze the playable actions and prioritize the highest-value action types based on static strategic criteria:
  ```python
  if ActionType.BUILD_CITY in [action.action_type for action in playable_actions]:
      return next(action for action in playable_actions if action.action_type == ActionType.BUILD_CITY)
  ```
- **Deterministic Action Flow**: Create a ranked hierarchy of action preferences:
  1. Build City
  2. Build Settlement
  3. Build Road
  4. End Turn
  When the LLM fails, actions are chosen following this hierarchy.

---

### 3. Strategies to Compete With AlphaBetaPlayer During Testing
To reduce dependency on the LLM when aiming for immediate competitiveness:
- **Simplistic Economic Strategy**: Implement deterministic rules to prioritize resource gathering and expansion, focusing on settlement and city building to optimize resource production.
- **Blocking Mechanism**: Develop routines to block high-value paths or settlement spots for opponents while maintaining growth.
- **Pre-defined Decision Trees**: Temporarily hard-code a simple decision tree for strategy execution, emphasizing actions like:
  - If Victory Points >= threshold, prioritize defensive moves.
  - Else, expand aggressively towards high VP goals.

---

### 4. Integrating Game-Specific Heuristics to Guide the LLM
Provide the LLM with board knowledge by embedding heuristic calculations into the prompt:
- **Heuristic Scoring in Prompts**: Add metrics like road potential, resource diversity, and opponent growth advantage:
  ```
  Heuristic Scores:
  - Settlement Value: {calculated_value}
  - City Upgrade Value: {calculated_value}
  - Road Extension Value: {calculated_value}
  Prioritize the action with the highest heuristic score.
  ```
- **Guided Options List**: For each action, append a descriptive note:
  ```
  Here are the actions ranked by value:
  - Action A (Heuristic Value: 15.2): This blocks Player 2's longest road and increases your resource income.
  - Action B (Heuristic Value: 14.5): Upgrades a settlement to a city for 2 VP gain.
  ```

---

### 5. Benchmarking LLM Performance Against Rule-Based Logic
Establish a structured evaluation method to measure LLM's decision performance:
- **Simulated Competitive Runs**: Pair LLM-based FooPlayer with deterministic or AlphaBetaPlayer and track metrics (wins, VPs, strategic goals).
- **Monte Carlo Testing**: Run thousands of simulations where the LLM's actions are compared against a preset rule engine's results to assess decision quality in various scenarios.
- **Action Matching**: Create a dataset of optimal moves in given scenarios (based on historical game trends or AlphaBetaPlayer’s performances) to compare how often LLM decisions align with the "ground truth."
- **Score Weighting Metrics**:
  - Victory Point Contribution: Percentage of decisions that lead directly to VP gain.
  - Opponent Blocking: Success rate in disrupting opponent strategies.
  - Resource Utilization: Effective use of collected resources to maximize VP.
  
---

### Next Steps:
If necessary, prioritize implementing improved fallback mechanisms and basic decision trees first to ensure immediate competitiveness. Gradually integrate advanced decision-making systems via guided prompts and heuristic evaluations as LLM refinement continues.

END STRATEGY.================================== Ai Message ==================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Transition FooPlayer into a competitive player over the next 5 iterations by leveraging enhanced strategy, including heuristic reinforcement, refined LLM prompts, and deterministic fallback mechanisms, and targeting measurable improvements in average VP and win rates.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Implement **segmented contextual prompting** and heuristic-enhanced decision-making into the LLM integration (as per Strategy 1 and 4). Additionally, integrate a **ranked action hierarchy** as a fallback mechanism (Strategy 2).

CHOSEN AGENT: CODER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:  
Modify the `decide` method of `FooPlayer.py` to achieve the following:

1. **Refined LLM Prompt**: 
   - Update the `_build_prompt` function to use **segmented contextual prompting**. Include headers that describe the game state, available resources, and strategic goals. Example structure:
     ```
     Current Game State:
     - Player Stats: {resources}, {settlements}, {cities}, VP: {victory_points}
     - Opponent Stats: {opponent resources/blockades}, etc.
     Goal: Maximize VP while taking advantage of the current game state.
     Available Actions: {list of formatted playable actions}
     Respond with:
     Action: {Selected optimal action}
     Justification: {Reasoning behind the action choice}
     ```

2. **Heuristic Context Integration**:
   - In the `_build_prompt` method, compute heuristic scores (e.g., settlement value, city upgrade value, road extension value) for each action. Integrate these scores into the prompt to help the LLM make better decisions.

3. **Fallback Mechanism**:
   - Enhance `_parse_llm_response` to implement a **ranked action hierarchy** fallback mechanism when the LLM output is invalid or ambiguous. Example hierarchy:
     - Priority Order: Build City > Build Settlement > Build Road > End Turn.
     - If a valid option matching the LLM response is not found, return the first valid action in this priority order.

4. **Logging**:
   - Improve logging to capture the heuristic scores, the LLM prompt, its raw response, and the fallback decision (when necessary) for post-game analysis.

Once complete, test the updated `FooPlayer.py`, run games, and report the results.================================ Human Message =================================

CODER

### Changes Made:
1. **Refined LLM Prompt Construction**:
   - Enhanced the `_build_prompt` function to use **segmented contextual prompting** with detailed headers for game state, player stats, opponent stats, and available actions.
   - Integrated **heuristic scores** for each action into the prompt to guide the LLM decision-making.

2. **Heuristic Computation Method**:
   - Added a `_compute_heuristic_scores` helper method to assign heuristic values to each action based on action type (e.g., city-building prioritized over road-building).

3. **Improved Parsing Logic**:
   - Enhanced `_parse_llm_response` to return a matching action from the LLM response, or delegate to the fallback mechanism if no match is found.

4. **Ranked Fallback Mechanism**:
   - Implemented `_fallback_action` to evaluate actions in a priority order: Build City > Build Settlement > Build Road > End Turn.
   - Default to the first action only when no prioritized options exist.

5. **Logging**:
   - Added print statements throughout to capture key debugging information:
     - The LLM prompt.
     - Heuristic scores of actions.
     - The LLM's raw response.
     - Logs for fallback mechanism use.

6. **Error Handling Enhancements**:
   - Integrated robust exception handling in the `decide` method for LLM failures, with clear logging of fallbacks.

### Notes for the Next Iteration:
- Tune the **heuristic scores** if the LLM's decisions align poorly with optimal strategies.
- Monitor how well the LLM responds to the enhanced prompt structure during testing.
- Evaluate the fallback mechanism's efficiency in comparison to the LLM's responses.

### Testing Recommendations:
- Focus on scenarios requiring diverse strategic goals (e.g., blocking opponent moves, building towards Largest Army).
- Analyze logs for patterns in ambiguous or ineffective LLM responses, and refine prompts or fallback heuristics accordingly.

AttributeError: 'Game' object has no attribute 'get_player_resources'================================ Human Message =================================

After Running The New foo_player.py Player, Here is my analysis and findings:

### Syntax Error Details:
- **Error Message**: `AttributeError: 'Game' object has no attribute 'get_player_resources'`
- **Exact Line Number**: Line 84 in `foo_player.py`
- **Exact Line of Code**: `resources=str(game.get_player_resources(Color.BLUE)),  # Example method to get resources`

### Root Cause:
The method `get_player_resources` is being called on the `Game` object, but it does not exist in the `Game` class, leading to an `AttributeError`. This indicates a mismatch between the game's API and the implementation in `foo_player.py`.

### Impact:
The syntax error prevents the game from running, and thus no game results were recorded for this evolution.

Let me know if you need anything else!================================== Ai Message ==================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Refactor FooPlayer to work seamlessly with the Catanatron API while continuing to enhance strategic decision-making via heuristic integration and LLM refinement. Achieve compatibility and avoid critical runtime errors in the next evolution to allow for testing and evaluation.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Resolve the `AttributeError` by ensuring that `foo_player.py` uses valid methods from the Catanatron `Game` class for retrieving player resources and other game state data. Validate the compatibility of all API calls in the `_build_prompt` method.

CHOSEN AGENT: RESEARCHER

AGENT OBJECTIVE: 
Identify the correct way to access the following game state information from the Catanatron API:
1. Player resources (e.g., wood, brick, grain, etc.) for a specific color (e.g., `Color.BLUE`).
2. Obtain other player and game statistics that might be relevant for building the LLM prompt (e.g., settlements, cities, roads, VP).
3. Provide a list of valid Game API methods and properties that could be helpful for efficiently querying such state details.

Ensure that the information provided directly addresses the API compatibility issues in `foo_player.py`.================================ Human Message =================================

RESEARCH:

#### Key Information on Accessing Game State Using Catanatron API

**1. Accessing Player Resources**
To retrieve resources (e.g., wood, brick, grain, etc.) for a specific player:
- Use the `get_player_freqdeck(state, color)` function, which provides the player's resource frequency deck.
  ```python
  from catanatron.state_functions import get_player_freqdeck
  player_resources = get_player_freqdeck(state, Color.BLUE)
  ```
- `player_num_resource_cards(state, color, resource)` can query the count for specific resources:
  ```python
  from catanatron.state_functions import player_num_resource_cards
  wood_count = player_num_resource_cards(state, Color.BLUE, "WOOD")
  ```

**2. Accessing Player and Game Statistics**
For settlements, cities, roads, and VP:
- **Settlements**: Use `get_player_buildings(state, color, "SETTLEMENT")` to retrieve settlement IDs of a player:
  ```python
  from catanatron.state_functions import get_player_buildings
  settlements = get_player_buildings(state, Color.BLUE, "SETTLEMENT")
  ```
- **Cities**: Similarly invoke `get_player_buildings(state, color, "CITY")` for city IDs:
  ```python
  cities = get_player_buildings(state, Color.BLUE, "CITY")
  ```
- **Roads Available**: Check roads available using state data:
  ```python
  player_key = player_key(state, Color.BLUE)
  roads_available = state.player_state[f"{player_key}_ROADS_AVAILABLE"]
  ```
- **Victory Points**: Victory points can be checked via:
  ```python
  victory_points = state.player_state[f"{player_key}_ACTUAL_VICTORY_POINTS"]
  ```

**3. General Game State Statistics**
The class `Game` contains the main API-level functions for interacting with game state, including:
- `play_tick()` to advance the game state.
- `winning_color()` to retrieve the player currently winning the game.
- `state.playable_actions` to list the valid actions at the current step.

```python
winning_player = game.winning_color()
playable_options = game.state.playable_actions
```

#### List of Useful Methods and Properties in Game API:
Valid methods within the `Game` class and associated functions:
- `get_player_freqdeck(state, color)` – Retrieves player's resources.
- `player_num_resource_cards(state, color, resource)` – Gets the count for specific resources.
- `player_key(state, color)` – Returns string key for player state.
- `get_player_buildings(state, color, building_type)` – Retrieves player's settlements/cities.
- `state.playable_actions` – Provides the currently executable actions.
- `game.play_tick()` – Advances game state one step.
- `game.winning_color()` – Returns the winning color/player.
- `state.colors` – Lists the colors in the game.

**References:**
1. `catanatron_core/catanatron/game.py` - Contains the Game class and `play_tick`, `winning_color`, `state.playable_actions`.
2. `catanatron_core/catanatron/models/player.py` - Includes player model and decision-making classes.
3. `catanatron_core/catanatron/models/enums.py` - Defines resources, colors, and action types.
4. `catanatron_core/catanatron/models/actions.py` - Includes `get_player_freqdeck`, `player_num_resource_cards`, and `get_player_buildings`.

END RESEARCH.================================== Ai Message ==================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Ensure functionality and compatibility of FooPlayer with the Catanatron API while strengthening the LLM decision-making mechanism in a way that improves strategic performance over the next 5 iterations.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Integrate valid Catanatron API calls into `foo_player.py`'s `_build_prompt` method to fetch relevant game data like resources, settlements, cities, roads, and victory points, and resolve the current `AttributeError` preventing gameplay.

CHOSEN AGENT: CODER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:  
Resolve the `AttributeError` by replacing invalid calls in `foo_player.py` with Catanatron-compatible API calls as outlined in the research:

1. **Resources**:
   - Replace `game.get_player_resources(Color.BLUE)` with `get_player_freqdeck(state, Color.BLUE)` to fetch all resources for FooPlayer.
   - Use `player_num_resource_cards(state, Color.BLUE, resource)` to query specific resource counts.

2. **Settlements and Cities**:
   - Replace invalid calls for settlements/cities with:
     ```python
     get_player_buildings(state, Color.BLUE, "SETTLEMENT")
     get_player_buildings(state, Color.BLUE, "CITY")
     ```

3. **Victory Points and Roads**:
   - Retrieve victory points using:
     ```python
     vp = state.player_state[player_key(state, Color.BLUE) + "_ACTUAL_VICTORY_POINTS"]
     ```
   - Roads remaining:
     ```python
     roads_available = state.player_state[player_key(state, Color.BLUE) + "_ROADS_AVAILABLE"]
     ```

4. **General Updates to `_build_prompt`**:
   - Adjust the prompt to include all valid game stats, ensuring Catanatron API calls function.
   - Include resource counts, settlements, cities, roads, and VP in the formatted prompt structure.

5. **Debugging and Validation**:
   - Add logging to verify data retrieval accuracy during gameplay for resources, actions, and VP.
   - Run a test evolution to confirm the absence of runtime errors.

Update the code to reflect these changes and provide detailed debug logs during testing for validation.================================ Human Message =================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Improve the performance of the `FooPlayer.py` by introducing intelligent strategy logic that leverages the LLM for decision-making. Specifically, aim for a minimum win count of 1 within the next 5 iterations while improving VP, settlements, and measurable gameplay metrics.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Address the issue of the `decide` method defaulting to selecting the first action. Integrate the LLM's `query_llm` functionality to intelligently evaluate actions based on state and strategy.

CHOSEN AGENT: CODER

AGENT OBJECTIVE: 
The current implementation of `FooPlayer` is defaulting to selecting the first action, as evidenced by the repeated log message "Choosing First Action on Default." Modify the `decide` method to leverage the `self.llm.query_llm` functionality for decision-making. Specifically:

1. Replace the current first-action default with an implementation that:
   a. Obtains a list of possible actions from the game state.
   b. Queries the LLM (`self.llm.query_llm`) for the evaluation of these actions.
   c. Selects the most intelligent action based on the LLM's evaluation.

2. Ensure the decision logic is robust and includes handling scenarios such as:
   - No valid actions available.
   - LLM providing ambiguous or conflicting guidance (fallback mechanisms).

3. Include clear comments and logging to observe how the LLM is influencing decision-making.

Once done, provide the modified code to be tested.================================== Ai Message ==================================

CODER

### Changes Made:
1. **Replaced Default Action Selection**:
   - Removed the hardcoded `return playable_actions[0]` that selected the first action by default.

2. **Integrated LLM Decision-Making in `decide`**:
   - Constructed a comprehensive prompt using the `_build_prompt` function to provide the LLM with game state and available actions.
   - Queried the LLM using `self.llm.query_llm(prompt)`.
   - Parsed the LLM's response using the `_parse_llm_response` function to select the most appropriate action from the available options.

3. **Added New Helper Methods**:
   - `_build_prompt`: Constructs a prompt by including the current game state and the list of playable actions.
   - `_parse_llm_response`: Interprets the LLM's response to match it with one of the playable actions. If no match is found, defaults to the first action.

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Included error handling for cases where the LLM query fails or returns an ambiguous response. In such cases, the method defaults to selecting the first action.
   - Added logging to show the LLM's response (`print(f"LLM Response: {llm_response}")`) and fallback mechanisms.

5. **Logging and Debugging**:
   - Added print statements for better debugging and observation:
     - Log when no playable actions are available.
     - Log the LLM's raw response.
     - Log if the response is ambiguous or invalid, and the fallback action is selected.

### Notes for the Next Iteration:
- **Prompt Details**: The current `_build_prompt` function makes a basic serialization of the game state and actions. If the LLM struggles to prioritize or understand the game details, refining this prompt may be necessary.
- **LLM Error Responses**: If runtime timing issues with `query_llm` arise (e.g., long delays or failures), adjustment of query limits or timeouts may be needed.

### Testing Recommendations:
- Test how the LLM chooses actions in various scenarios to verify that the parsing logic aligns with actual gameplay.
- Monitor logs (`LLM Response: ...`) for unexpected behaviors or ambiguous responses.

END CODER================================ Human Message =================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Transition FooPlayer into a competitive player over the next 5 iterations by leveraging enhanced strategy, including heuristic reinforcement, refined LLM prompts, and deterministic fallback mechanisms, and targeting measurable improvements in average VP and win rates.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Implement **segmented contextual prompting** and heuristic-enhanced decision-making into the LLM integration (as per Strategy 1 and 4). Additionally, integrate a **ranked action hierarchy** as a fallback mechanism (Strategy 2).

CHOSEN AGENT: CODER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:  
Modify the `decide` method of `FooPlayer.py` to achieve the following:

1. **Refined LLM Prompt**: 
   - Update the `_build_prompt` function to use **segmented contextual prompting**. Include headers that describe the game state, available resources, and strategic goals. Example structure:
     ```
     Current Game State:
     - Player Stats: {resources}, {settlements}, {cities}, VP: {victory_points}
     - Opponent Stats: {opponent resources/blockades}, etc.
     Goal: Maximize VP while taking advantage of the current game state.
     Available Actions: {list of formatted playable actions}
     Respond with:
     Action: {Selected optimal action}
     Justification: {Reasoning behind the action choice}
     ```

2. **Heuristic Context Integration**:
   - In the `_build_prompt` method, compute heuristic scores (e.g., settlement value, city upgrade value, road extension value) for each action. Integrate these scores into the prompt to help the LLM make better decisions.

3. **Fallback Mechanism**:
   - Enhance `_parse_llm_response` to implement a **ranked action hierarchy** fallback mechanism when the LLM output is invalid or ambiguous. Example hierarchy:
     - Priority Order: Build City > Build Settlement > Build Road > End Turn.
     - If a valid option matching the LLM response is not found, return the first valid action in this priority order.

4. **Logging**:
   - Improve logging to capture the heuristic scores, the LLM prompt, its raw response, and the fallback decision (when necessary) for post-game analysis.

Once complete, test the updated `FooPlayer.py`, run games, and report the results.================================== Ai Message ==================================

CODER

### Changes Made:
1. **Refined LLM Prompt Construction**:
   - Enhanced the `_build_prompt` function to use **segmented contextual prompting** with detailed headers for game state, player stats, opponent stats, and available actions.
   - Integrated **heuristic scores** for each action into the prompt to guide the LLM decision-making.

2. **Heuristic Computation Method**:
   - Added a `_compute_heuristic_scores` helper method to assign heuristic values to each action based on action type (e.g., city-building prioritized over road-building).

3. **Improved Parsing Logic**:
   - Enhanced `_parse_llm_response` to return a matching action from the LLM response, or delegate to the fallback mechanism if no match is found.

4. **Ranked Fallback Mechanism**:
   - Implemented `_fallback_action` to evaluate actions in a priority order: Build City > Build Settlement > Build Road > End Turn.
   - Default to the first action only when no prioritized options exist.

5. **Logging**:
   - Added print statements throughout to capture key debugging information:
     - The LLM prompt.
     - Heuristic scores of actions.
     - The LLM's raw response.
     - Logs for fallback mechanism use.

6. **Error Handling Enhancements**:
   - Integrated robust exception handling in the `decide` method for LLM failures, with clear logging of fallbacks.

### Notes for the Next Iteration:
- Tune the **heuristic scores** if the LLM's decisions align poorly with optimal strategies.
- Monitor how well the LLM responds to the enhanced prompt structure during testing.
- Evaluate the fallback mechanism's efficiency in comparison to the LLM's responses.

### Testing Recommendations:
- Focus on scenarios requiring diverse strategic goals (e.g., blocking opponent moves, building towards Largest Army).
- Analyze logs for patterns in ambiguous or ineffective LLM responses, and refine prompts or fallback heuristics accordingly.

AttributeError: 'Game' object has no attribute 'get_player_resources'================================ Human Message =================================

After Running The New foo_player.py Player, Here is my analysis and findings:

### Syntax Error Details:
- **Error Message**: `AttributeError: 'Game' object has no attribute 'get_player_resources'`
- **Exact Line Number**: Line 84 in `foo_player.py`
- **Exact Line of Code**: `resources=str(game.get_player_resources(Color.BLUE)),  # Example method to get resources`

### Root Cause:
The method `get_player_resources` is being called on the `Game` object, but it does not exist in the `Game` class, leading to an `AttributeError`. This indicates a mismatch between the game's API and the implementation in `foo_player.py`.

### Impact:
The syntax error prevents the game from running, and thus no game results were recorded for this evolution.

Let me know if you need anything else!================================== Ai Message ==================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Refactor FooPlayer to work seamlessly with the Catanatron API while continuing to enhance strategic decision-making via heuristic integration and LLM refinement. Achieve compatibility and avoid critical runtime errors in the next evolution to allow for testing and evaluation.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Resolve the `AttributeError` by ensuring that `foo_player.py` uses valid methods from the Catanatron `Game` class for retrieving player resources and other game state data. Validate the compatibility of all API calls in the `_build_prompt` method.

CHOSEN AGENT: RESEARCHER

AGENT OBJECTIVE: 
Identify the correct way to access the following game state information from the Catanatron API:
1. Player resources (e.g., wood, brick, grain, etc.) for a specific color (e.g., `Color.BLUE`).
2. Obtain other player and game statistics that might be relevant for building the LLM prompt (e.g., settlements, cities, roads, VP).
3. Provide a list of valid Game API methods and properties that could be helpful for efficiently querying such state details.

Ensure that the information provided directly addresses the API compatibility issues in `foo_player.py`.================================ Human Message =================================

RESEARCH:

#### Key Information on Accessing Game State Using Catanatron API

**1. Accessing Player Resources**
To retrieve resources (e.g., wood, brick, grain, etc.) for a specific player:
- Use the `get_player_freqdeck(state, color)` function, which provides the player's resource frequency deck.
  ```python
  from catanatron.state_functions import get_player_freqdeck
  player_resources = get_player_freqdeck(state, Color.BLUE)
  ```
- `player_num_resource_cards(state, color, resource)` can query the count for specific resources:
  ```python
  from catanatron.state_functions import player_num_resource_cards
  wood_count = player_num_resource_cards(state, Color.BLUE, "WOOD")
  ```

**2. Accessing Player and Game Statistics**
For settlements, cities, roads, and VP:
- **Settlements**: Use `get_player_buildings(state, color, "SETTLEMENT")` to retrieve settlement IDs of a player:
  ```python
  from catanatron.state_functions import get_player_buildings
  settlements = get_player_buildings(state, Color.BLUE, "SETTLEMENT")
  ```
- **Cities**: Similarly invoke `get_player_buildings(state, color, "CITY")` for city IDs:
  ```python
  cities = get_player_buildings(state, Color.BLUE, "CITY")
  ```
- **Roads Available**: Check roads available using state data:
  ```python
  player_key = player_key(state, Color.BLUE)
  roads_available = state.player_state[f"{player_key}_ROADS_AVAILABLE"]
  ```
- **Victory Points**: Victory points can be checked via:
  ```python
  victory_points = state.player_state[f"{player_key}_ACTUAL_VICTORY_POINTS"]
  ```

**3. General Game State Statistics**
The class `Game` contains the main API-level functions for interacting with game state, including:
- `play_tick()` to advance the game state.
- `winning_color()` to retrieve the player currently winning the game.
- `state.playable_actions` to list the valid actions at the current step.

```python
winning_player = game.winning_color()
playable_options = game.state.playable_actions
```

#### List of Useful Methods and Properties in Game API:
Valid methods within the `Game` class and associated functions:
- `get_player_freqdeck(state, color)` – Retrieves player's resources.
- `player_num_resource_cards(state, color, resource)` – Gets the count for specific resources.
- `player_key(state, color)` – Returns string key for player state.
- `get_player_buildings(state, color, building_type)` – Retrieves player's settlements/cities.
- `state.playable_actions` – Provides the currently executable actions.
- `game.play_tick()` – Advances game state one step.
- `game.winning_color()` – Returns the winning color/player.
- `state.colors` – Lists the colors in the game.

**References:**
1. `catanatron_core/catanatron/game.py` - Contains the Game class and `play_tick`, `winning_color`, `state.playable_actions`.
2. `catanatron_core/catanatron/models/player.py` - Includes player model and decision-making classes.
3. `catanatron_core/catanatron/models/enums.py` - Defines resources, colors, and action types.
4. `catanatron_core/catanatron/models/actions.py` - Includes `get_player_freqdeck`, `player_num_resource_cards`, and `get_player_buildings`.

END RESEARCH.================================== Ai Message ==================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Ensure functionality and compatibility of FooPlayer with the Catanatron API while strengthening the LLM decision-making mechanism in a way that improves strategic performance over the next 5 iterations.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Integrate valid Catanatron API calls into `foo_player.py`'s `_build_prompt` method to fetch relevant game data like resources, settlements, cities, roads, and victory points, and resolve the current `AttributeError` preventing gameplay.

CHOSEN AGENT: CODER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:  
Resolve the `AttributeError` by replacing invalid calls in `foo_player.py` with Catanatron-compatible API calls as outlined in the research:

1. **Resources**:
   - Replace `game.get_player_resources(Color.BLUE)` with `get_player_freqdeck(state, Color.BLUE)` to fetch all resources for FooPlayer.
   - Use `player_num_resource_cards(state, Color.BLUE, resource)` to query specific resource counts.

2. **Settlements and Cities**:
   - Replace invalid calls for settlements/cities with:
     ```python
     get_player_buildings(state, Color.BLUE, "SETTLEMENT")
     get_player_buildings(state, Color.BLUE, "CITY")
     ```

3. **Victory Points and Roads**:
   - Retrieve victory points using:
     ```python
     vp = state.player_state[player_key(state, Color.BLUE) + "_ACTUAL_VICTORY_POINTS"]
     ```
   - Roads remaining:
     ```python
     roads_available = state.player_state[player_key(state, Color.BLUE) + "_ROADS_AVAILABLE"]
     ```

4. **General Updates to `_build_prompt`**:
   - Adjust the prompt to include all valid game stats, ensuring Catanatron API calls function.
   - Include resource counts, settlements, cities, roads, and VP in the formatted prompt structure.

5. **Debugging and Validation**:
   - Add logging to verify data retrieval accuracy during gameplay for resources, actions, and VP.
   - Run a test evolution to confirm the absence of runtime errors.

Update the code to reflect these changes and provide detailed debug logs during testing for validation.================================ Human Message =================================

CODER

### Changes Made:
1. **Replaced Invalid API Calls**:
   - Substituted `game.get_player_resources(Color.BLUE)` with `get_player_freqdeck(state, Color.BLUE)` to correctly fetch resources.
   - Similar replacements made for settlements, cities, victory points, and roads using valid Catanatron API functions: 
     - `get_player_buildings(state, Color.BLUE, "SETTLEMENT")` and `get_player_buildings(state, Color.BLUE, "CITY")` for settlements and cities.
     - Victory points accessed via `state.player_state[f"{player_key(state, Color.BLUE)}_ACTUAL_VICTORY_POINTS"]`.
     - Roads available via `state.player_state[f"{player_key(state, Color.BLUE)}_ROADS_AVAILABLE"]`.

2. **Updated `_build_prompt` Method**:
   - Included new resource and state-fetching methods in the prompt template.
   - Enhanced formatting to make the prompt explainable and consistent with the desired LLM input structure.

3. **Improved Compatibility**:
   - Refactored the game state integration in `_build_prompt` to align with valid methods reliably compatible with the API.

4. **Debugging Enhancements**:
   - Added detailed logging via print statements to verify accurate state data retrieval during gameplay (resources, settlements, cities, heuristic scores).
   - Included error handling for invalid or mismatched LLM responses.

### Notes for the Next Iteration:
- Test how well the new prompt structure works with the LLM's decision-making.
- Monitor logs for resource/state-fetch accuracy and potential mismatches between heuristic scores and LLM responses.

### Testing Recommendations:
- Verify that resources, settlements, cities, and other player stats from the state align with the game's current state through debugging outputs.
- Check if the fallback mechanism handles invalid or ambiguous LLM responses efficiently.

ANALYZER OBJECTIVE:

If there is no syntax errors, I want you to return
    - The Scores of the foo_player.py player from the game_results json file
    - Short analysis of the game output (return anything interseting that was printed)
    - EMPHASIZE any errors, warnings, or signs of player implementation error in the game_output.txt file 

If there is a syntax error, I want you to return
    - The error message from the game_output.txt file
    - The exact line number of the error if possible
    - The exact line of code that caused the error if possible

Keep the Response as concise as possible

================================== Ai Message ==================================

After Running The New foo_player.py Player, Here is my analysis and findings:

### Scores of FooPlayer:
- Wins: 0
- Average Victory Points (VP): 2.0
- Average Settlements: 2.0
- Average Cities: 0.0
- Average Roads: 0.0
- Average Largest Army: 0.0
- Average Development VP: 0.0

### Short Analysis of Game Output:
- The phrase "Choosing First Action on Default" repeated throughout the log suggests that the implementation is defaulting to selecting the first action without strategy. 
- Results indicate poor performance compared to the opponent, with no victories achieved in the 3-game session. 

### Errors, Warnings, or Signs of Implementation Issues:
- **Implementation Warning**: The log shows "Choosing First Action on Default" continuously, indicating that the `decide` method is not leveraging the LLM integration (`self.llm.query_llm`) for decision-making.
- **Gameplay Warning**: The score disparity (2 VP versus 10 VP for the opponent) and the lack of progression in Cities, Roads, and Largest Army metrics highlight a lack of strategy execution.

After Running The New foo_player.py Player, Here is my analysis and findings:

### Scores of FooPlayer:
- Wins: 0  
- Average Victory Points (VP): 3.33  
- Average Settlements: 2.33  
- Average Cities: 0.33  
- Average Roads: 0.0  
- Average Largest Army: 0.0  
- Average Development VP: 0.33  

### Short Analysis of Game Output:
- The LLM consistently failed to provide valid or actionable responses: "LLM response ambiguous or invalid. Defaulting to first action."
- FooPlayer defaulted to the first available action in all scenarios instead of executing strategic decisions.
- The performance difference is stark: FooPlayer had no wins and significantly lower VP compared to AlphaBetaPlayer.

### Errors, Warnings, or Signs of Implementation Issues:
- **LLM Integration Issue**: LLM responses are not being parsed correctly or are poorly generated, leading to fallback actions ("Defaulting to first action").
- **Decision-Making Deficiency**: The lack of strategic outcomes (e.g., 0 roads, 0 Largest Army) suggests serious shortcomings in action planning and execution.
- **Repeated Logs**: Multiple instances of ambiguous LLM responses point to insufficient prompt design or response parsing mechanism in `_parse_llm_response`.

After Running The New foo_player.py Player, Here is my analysis and findings:

### Syntax Error Details:
- **Error Message**: `AttributeError: 'Game' object has no attribute 'get_player_resources'`
- **Exact Line Number**: Line 84 in `foo_player.py`
- **Exact Line of Code**: `resources=str(game.get_player_resources(Color.BLUE)),  # Example method to get resources`

### Root Cause:
The method `get_player_resources` is being called on the `Game` object, but it does not exist in the `Game` class, leading to an `AttributeError`. This indicates a mismatch between the game's API and the implementation in `foo_player.py`.

### Impact:
The syntax error prevents the game from running, and thus no game results were recorded for this evolution.

This is the current game_output.txt file

better utility.
LLM Response: Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)  
Justification: The "ROLL" action is the only available action, meaning there are no other decisions to evaluate. Rolling the dice is essential for progressing the game, as it generates resources for building and advancing your position. Its heuristic score of 1 reflects this necessity in the current turn. Hence, it's the optimal and mandatory move.
LLM Response: Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)  
Justification: All the heuristic scores for the available actions are equal (1), indicating no action is strongly preferable based on current metrics. Since you cannot make immediate progress toward building settlements, cities, or roads (due to lack of necessary resources), trading wood in maritime trade doesn't grant any clear benefit. Therefore, the optimal choice is to end the turn and gather new resources for future progress.
LLM Response: Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)  
Justification: Rolling the dice is the only available action. It advances the game by generating resources or triggering events, which can later be utilized to build settlements, roads, or cities to progress towards victory points. Since no other actions are available, this is the optimal choice.
LLM Response: Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.DISCARD: 'DISCARD'>, value=None)

Justification: The game state indicates that the only available action at this moment is to discard. This is likely due to a rule like exceeding the resource hand limit after a dice roll of 7, forcing the player to discard half their resources (rounded down). With 9 resources currently, this would require discarding 4 resources. Since this is the only action available, it must be selected to proceed to the next stage of the game.
LLM Response: Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MOVE_ROBBER: 'MOVE_ROBBER'>, value=((-1, 0, 1), <Color.RED: 'RED'>, None))

Justification: While all actions have an equal heuristic score, the optimal choice involves targeting another player (Color.RED) to potentially disrupt their resource production. Among the choices that allow targeting Red, this action moves the robber to a nearby hex (-1, 0, 1), keeping it strategically disruptive to the opponent without impacting our broader resource objectives. By denying resources to others, we indirectly bolster our own position in the game while maintaining flexibility.
LLM Response: Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)  
Justification: All available actions have an equal heuristic score of 1, which indicates none of the given options leads to a clearly better outcome based on the current game state. Since maritime trades do not directly support progress toward building settlements, cities, or roads given the current resource set, it is prudent to end the turn and await better options for resource acquisition in subsequent turns. Ending the turn avoids making unnecessary trades that might not provide immediate benefit.
LLM Response: Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)  
Justification: Rolling is the only available action and has a heuristic score of 1, indicating it's the logical step to take. This will generate resources, which are necessary for progressing in the game by building settlements, roads, or cities to earn more Victory Points.
LLM Response: ### Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)  
### Justification:  
All the provided actions have an equal heuristic score of 1, meaning there isn't a clearly advantageous move based on the current state. Maritime trade, while available, does not yield significant progress because the lack of other resource diversity (e.g., BRICK or WHEAT) means you still cannot build roads, settlements, or cities after trading. Given this, ending the turn is the optimal choice to wait for new resources or opportunities in subsequent turns, as no actionable strategy currently leads closer to victory.
LLM Response: Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)  
Justification: The only available action is to roll the dice, which is required to progress the game. Rolling generates resources for players based on dice results and the current board setup. Since there are no other actions available at this stage, rolling is the optimal choice to advance the game.
LLM Response: **Action:** Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.DISCARD: 'DISCARD'>, value=None)  
**Justification:** In the current game state, the only available action is to discard resources. This is likely due to exceeding the resource card limit (e.g., after rolling a 7 in Catan). While the heuristic score provides minimal insight (score of 1), it seems to confirm there is no alternative action. Discarding keeps the game moving and complies with the rules. Selecting the sole option is the logical and optimal choice to proceed.
LLM Response: ### Action: `Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MOVE_ROBBER: 'MOVE_ROBBER'>, value=((1, -1, 0), <Color.RED: 'RED'>, None))`

### Justification:
Given the heuristic scores of 1 for all actions, the choice becomes strategic rather than numerical. Moving the robber to `(1, -1, 0)` targets the `RED` player, presumably to impede their progress by blocking resource production from a critical hex. This choice aligns with the goal of reducing opposition while potentially increasing the chances of gaining stolen resources, as moving the robber to a hex targeting another player often allows you to steal a random resource from them. If `RED` appears to be a strong competitor or has resources you lack, this makes the action more impactful compared to other choices where no player is targeted or resources are blocked.
LLM Response: Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Justification: The only available action is to end your turn. Since no other actions are present, it is optimal to proceed with the end turn action to allow the game to continue.
LLM Response: Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)  
Justification: Rolling the dice is the only available action at this time, which makes it the optimal choice. This action will generate resources for players based on the roll result and the board state, enabling progression in the game (e.g., building new settlements, roads, or upgrading to cities). Without rolling, the game cannot advance.
LLM Response: Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)  
Justification: Since the only available action is to end the turn, it is the optimal and necessary choice. No other actions can be taken at this point, and ending the turn advances the game state.
LLM Response: Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)  
Justification: The only available action is to roll the dice (ROLL), which is necessary to continue the game by determining resource distribution. It is the optimal action because no other moves can be made until the resource production phase progresses.
LLM Response: Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)  
Justification: Based on the provided game state and available actions, the only action available is to end the turn. With no other choices presented and no immediate resources or development opportunities implied, ending the turn is the optimal and only viable decision.
LLM Response: Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)  
Justification: Rolling the dice is the only available action in this state. Without any possibility to trade, build, or perform other actions, rolling is necessary to advance the game and potentially gather more resources for future actions. Additionally, it has the highest heuristic score (1), indicating it is optimal based on the current game state.
LLM Response: Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)  
Justification: The given game state does not allow for any other actions aside from ending the turn. With limited resources (3 wheat and 3 brick, no wood, sheep, or ore), it is impossible to build roads, settlements, or cities. The heuristic score for ending the turn is 1, indicating it is the only viable action. Ending the turn allows progression to the next phase, where new resources or opportunities may be obtained.
LLM Response: Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)  
Justification: The available action has a heuristic score of 1, indicating this is the optimal move in the current state. Rolling the dice is essential to progress in Catan, as it can provide additional resources to enable further gameplay actions such as building settlements, upgrading to cities, or constructing roads. As there are no other alternative actions presented, rolling is the necessary and logical choice to advance the game.
LLM Response: ### Action:
**Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)**

### Justification:
Currently, none of the available maritime trade options provide a significant advantage since your resources and heuristic scores for all actions (including trades) are equal, each rated at 1. Additionally:

1. You have **5 wood and 5 ore, but no other resources** (e.g., brick, sheep, or wheat), which are critical to building roads, settlements, or upgrading to cities.
2. Trading wood or ore for other resources like wheat, brick, or sheep would not immediately lead to building anything, as you lack the requisite combination of resources outlined in the build rules of the game.
3. Ending your turn ensures that you conserve your resources and wait for a more favorable position, such as gaining resources on the next roll or benefiting from trades/interventions that might arise.

In summary, no productive action is available at this time, so ending the turn is optimal.
LLM Response: Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)  
Justification: The only available action is to roll the dice, indicated by the provided action list. Rolling the dice progresses the game forward, allowing for resource generation based on the settlements' placements or potential interaction with other mechanics. With no other options presented, this action is both optimal and mandatory.
LLM Response: ### Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

### Justification:  
All available actions have identical heuristic scores of 1, meaning no action provides a clear advantage over ending the turn. Additionally, given the current resource situation ([7, 0, 0, 0, 5]), the player lacks critical resources needed to construct roads, settlements, or cities. Maritime trades do not immediately contribute to better positioning or progress toward increasing victory points, as the trades provided either exchange four of the same resource (a highly costly trade) or do not result in a meaningful combination to pursue a build. Thus, the optimal choice is to *End Turn*, allowing the player to wait for the next resource gain opportunities and maintain a better position for future actions.
LLM Response: Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)  
Justification: The only available action is to roll the dice, given that it has a heuristic score of 1. Rolling may yield resources or trigger new opportunities for expansion, while advancing the game state.
LLM Response: Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(19, 46))

Justification: Building a road is the optimal action given the heuristic score of 5, which is the highest among available actions. Building roads improves your board position and advances your ability to connect settlements, head towards a new settlement or city location, and potentially secure the Longest Road bonus in the future. All road-building options have equal scores, so any of them would provide the same immediate value—let's go with the first one listed, `(19, 46)`, for simplicity. Maritime trade has a score of 1, making it a less beneficial action, and ending the turn is premature when there are resources and opportunities to act.
LLM Response: ### Action:
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(45, 46))

### Justification:
The optimal action involves building a road, as these actions all scored the highest heuristic score of 5. Building roads increases map presence, enables future expansion for settlements and cities, and contributes to the Longest Road victory point goal. 

Among the available road-building options, `(45, 46)` was chosen arbitrarily since no additional context or positional advantage information was provided distinguishing specific road-building locations. Any road-building action would have a similar positive impact.
LLM Response: **Action:** Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(2, 3))

**Justification:**  
Building roads is the top priority given the current heuristic scores, with all potential road-building actions scoring significantly higher (5) than the other possible actions (1). Roads contribute to key strategic goals in Catan, such as expanding settlement placement options, securing longest road points, and improving resource acquisition opportunities. Choosing to build a road at `(2, 3)` is optimal based on its high score, which likely indicates its advantageous placement for the player's overall strategy. Additionally, there are sufficient resources ([5, 1, 0, 0, 5]) available to afford the road, as building a road typically costs one wood and one brick.
LLM Response: ### Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

### Justification:
All available actions have the same heuristic score of 1, meaning they are equally rated in terms of immediate benefit based on the game's current evaluation. However, since none of the maritime trade options improve the player's ability to build new settlements, roads, or cities immediately (given the resource distribution), and there is no way to utilize the maritime trade actions strategically this turn, the optimal move is to **end the turn**. This allows the player to collect new resources during the production phase of the next turn, potentially enabling progress toward building more settlements, roads, or cities.
LLM Response: Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)  
Justification: Rolling the dice is the only available action. This is essential to advance the game by generating resources, which are needed to build settlements, cities, and roads, or to trade. Since no other actions are presented, rolling optimizes progress and aligns with the heuristic score provided, ensuring the game's momentum continues.
LLM Response: ### Action: `Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)`

### Justification:
Currently, all actions have the same heuristic score of `1`, indicating there is no significant advantage tied to any specific maritime trade. Your resources include 4 wood and 5 ore, but you lack key resources (wheat, brick, sheep) to build additional settlements, cities, or roads. None of the available maritime trades can provide a clear, immediate path to progress, given that a settlement requires wheat, brick, sheep, and wood (and you currently lack wheat and brick, which are not producible based on maritime options for 4 wood or 4 ore).

Because there is no actionable trade that significantly improves your position over the current turn, the optimal decision is to **end your turn** and wait for better opportunities on future resource rolls. Continuing to act when there's no clear benefit would be inefficient.
LLM Response: Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)  
Justification: Rolling the dice is the only available action, and its heuristic score is 1. Since there are no other actions to compare, rolling allows you to move the game forward, potentially gaining resources or triggering events that enable future actions to improve the game state.
LLM Response: ### Action: `Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)`

### Justification:
Given the current state, none of the maritime trade actions improve your immediate position as no trade directly contributes to building new settlements, cities, or roads. You lack core resources (like brick, wheat, sheep, and wood combinations) to construct settlements or roads, and you don't have any cities to upgrade. Additionally, the heuristic scores provided suggest that all actions, including the trade options and ending the turn, are equally valuable (score of 1). 

Since there is no clear path to progress through trades based on the current resources and maritime trade options, the optimal move is to end the turn to wait for a better resource roll or trading opportunity in the next turn.

    - Short analysis of the game output (return anything interseting that was printed)
    - EMPHASIZE any errors, warnings, or signs of player implementation error in the game_output.txt file 

If there is a syntax error, I want you to return
    - The error message from the game_output.txt file
    - The exact line number of the error if possible
    - The exact line of code that caused the error if possible

After Running The New foo_player.py Player, Here is my analysis and findings:

### Scores of FooPlayer:
- Wins: 0  
- Average Victory Points (VP): 2.33  
- Average Settlements: 1.67  
- Average Cities: 0.33  
- Average Roads: 0.0  
- Average Largest Army: 0.0  
- Average Development VP: 0.0  

### Short Analysis of Game Output:
- **LLM Interaction**: The LLM responded consistently, but gameplay justification often involved executing mandatory or default actions (e.g., "ROLL" and "END TURN"), suggesting limited strategic depth.
- **Interesting Output**: The heuristic scoring mechanism categorizes actions clearly, but no significant changes to gameplay performance reflect deeper strategy execution.
- **Signs of Issue**: No roads or army development indicates repeated failure to invest strategically in growth areas, despite consistent heuristic scoring.

### Errors, Warnings, or Signs of Implementation Issues:
- **Strategic Weakness**: The absence of victories and poor metrics like roads and army raises concerns about the decision-making quality. 
- **Heuristic Misalignment**: High heuristic scores for actions like "BUILD_ROAD" occasionally appear in the logs but fail to translate into meaningful gameplay progression.

After Running The New foo_player.py Player, Here is my analysis and findings:

### Scores of FooPlayer:
- Wins: 0
- Average Victory Points (VP): 2.0
- Average Settlements: 2.0
- Average Cities: 0.0
- Average Roads: 0.0
- Average Largest Army: 0.0

### Short Analysis of Game Output:
- The phrase "Choosing First Action on Default" repeated throughout the log suggests that the implementation is defaulting to selecting the first action without strategy. 
- Results indicate poor performance compared to the opponent, with no victories achieved in the 3-game session. 

### Errors, Warnings, or Signs of Implementation Issues:
- **Implementation Warning**: The log shows "Choosing First Action on Default" continuously, indicating that the `decide` method is not leveraging the LLM integration (`self.llm.query_llm`) for decision-making.
- **Gameplay Warning**: The score disparity (2 VP versus 10 VP for the opponent) and the lack of progression in Cities, Roads, and Largest Army metrics highlight a lack of strategy execution.

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Improve the performance of the `FooPlayer.py` by introducing intelligent strategy logic that leverages the LLM for decision-making. Specifically, aim for a minimum win count of 1 within the next 5 iterations while improving VP, settlements, and measurable gameplay metrics.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Address the issue of the `decide` method defaulting to selecting the first action. Integrate the LLM's `query_llm` functionality to intelligently evaluate actions based on state and strategy.

CHOSEN AGENT: CODER

AGENT OBJECTIVE: 
The current implementation of `FooPlayer` is defaulting to selecting the first action, as evidenced by the repeated log message "Choosing First Action on Default." Modify the `decide` method to leverage the `self.llm.query_llm` functionality for decision-making. Specifically:

1. Replace the current first-action default with an implementation that:
   a. Obtains a list of possible actions from the game state.
   b. Queries the LLM (`self.llm.query_llm`) for the evaluation of these actions.
   c. Selects the most intelligent action based on the LLM's evaluation.

2. Ensure the decision logic is robust and includes handling scenarios such as:
   - No valid actions available.
   - LLM providing ambiguous or conflicting guidance (fallback mechanisms).

3. Include clear comments and logging to observe how the LLM is influencing decision-making.

Once done, provide the modified code to be tested.================================ Human Message =================================

CODER

### Changes Made:
1. **Replaced Default Action Selection**:
   - Removed the hardcoded `return playable_actions[0]` that selected the first action by default.

2. **Integrated LLM Decision-Making in `decide`**:
   - Constructed a comprehensive prompt using the `_build_prompt` function to provide the LLM with game state and available actions.
   - Queried the LLM using `self.llm.query_llm(prompt)`.
   - Parsed the LLM's response using the `_parse_llm_response` function to select the most appropriate action from the available options.

3. **Added New Helper Methods**:
   - `_build_prompt`: Constructs a prompt by including the current game state and the list of playable actions.
   - `_parse_llm_response`: Interprets the LLM's response to match it with one of the playable actions. If no match is found, defaults to the first action.

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Included error handling for cases where the LLM query fails or returns an ambiguous response. In such cases, the method defaults to selecting the first action.
   - Added logging to show the LLM's response (`print(f"LLM Response: {llm_response}")`) and fallback mechanisms.

5. **Logging and Debugging**:
   - Added print statements for better debugging and observation:
     - Log when no playable actions are available.
     - Log the LLM's raw response.
     - Log if the response is ambiguous or invalid, and the fallback action is selected.

### Notes for the Next Iteration:
- **Prompt Details**: The current `_build_prompt` function makes a basic serialization of the game state and actions. If the LLM struggles to prioritize or understand the game details, refining this prompt may be necessary.
- **LLM Error Responses**: If runtime timing issues with `query_llm` arise (e.g., long delays or failures), adjustment of query limits or timeouts may be needed.

### Testing Recommendations:
- Test how the LLM chooses actions in various scenarios to verify that the parsing logic aligns with actual gameplay.
- Monitor logs (`LLM Response: ...`) for unexpected behaviors or ambiguous responses.

After Running The New foo_player.py Player, Here is my analysis and findings:

### Scores of FooPlayer:
- Wins: 0  
- Average Victory Points (VP): 3.33  
- Average Settlements: 2.33  
- Average Cities: 0.33  
- Average Roads: 0.0  
- Average Largest Army: 0.0  
- Average Development VP: 0.33  

### Short Analysis of Game Output:
- The LLM consistently failed to provide valid or actionable responses: "LLM response ambiguous or invalid. Defaulting to first action."
- FooPlayer defaulted to the first available action in all scenarios instead of executing strategic decisions.
- The performance difference is stark: FooPlayer had no wins and significantly lower VP compared to AlphaBetaPlayer.

### Errors, Warnings, or Signs of Implementation Issues:
- **LLM Integration Issue**: LLM responses are not being parsed correctly or are poorly generated, leading to fallback actions ("Defaulting to first action").
- **Decision-Making Deficiency**: The lack of strategic outcomes (e.g., 0 roads, 0 Largest Army) suggests serious shortcomings in action planning and execution.
- **Repeated Logs**: Multiple instances of ambiguous LLM responses point to insufficient prompt design or response parsing mechanism in `_parse_llm_response`.

Let me know if you need anything else!================================== Ai Message ==================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Develop a robust strategy execution mechanism that effectively leverages the LLM for decision-making. The aim is to improve FooPlayer's win count and strategic metrics, including roads, cities, and army contributions, while ensuring VP increases consistently over the iterations.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Address the LLM integration issue by refining the prompt construction in `_build_prompt` and improving the parsing logic in `_parse_llm_response`. Ensure valid and actionable responses are obtained and utilized for strategic decision-making.

CHOSEN AGENT: STRATEGIZER

AGENT OBJECTIVE: 
The LLM responses are ambiguous or invalid, causing the FooPlayer to revert to default fallback actions. This suggests that the strategy design or LLM integration is insufficiently aligned with achieving optimal gameplay outcomes. 

Please provide 5 new strategy options that could address these key deficiencies:
1. How to design prompts to make the LLM understand the game state and prioritize optimal actions more effectively.
2. Ideas for alternative fallback mechanisms if the LLM fails to provide valid responses.
3. Strategies to temporarily compete with AlphaBetaPlayer while testing LLM refinement, using deterministic or semi-deterministic rules.
4. Methods of integrating game-specific heuristics to guide the LLM's responses.
5. Suggestions for benchmarking the LLM's decision-making quality against predefined rule-based logic.================================ Human Message =================================

STRATEGY:

### 1. Designing Effective Prompts
The LLM query prompt construction should be more specific and structured to guide LLM decision-making effectively:
- **Segmented Contextual Prompting**: Break down the game state into key elements like resource availability, victory point progression, and opponent analysis. Use explicit headers, such as:
  ```
  Current Game State:
  - Player Stats: {resources}, {road_length}, {settlements}, {cities}, etc.
  - Opponent Stats: {resource_blockades}, {army_strength}, etc.
  - Goal: Maximize VP by using optimal actions considering available resources and the board state.
  ```
- **Action Explanation Request**: Explicitly require the LLM to provide a rationale for its decision:
  ```
  Respond with the optimal action and briefly justify your reasoning (e.g., maximizing resource gain or blocking opponent's road expansion).
  Example response structure:
  Action: {Chosen Action}
  Justification: {Rationale for Decision}
  ```

---

### 2. Alternative Fallback Mechanisms
Introduce enhanced fallback strategies when LLM returns invalid or ambiguous responses:
- **Priority Filtering**: Analyze the playable actions and prioritize the highest-value action types based on static strategic criteria:
  ```python
  if ActionType.BUILD_CITY in [action.action_type for action in playable_actions]:
      return next(action for action in playable_actions if action.action_type == ActionType.BUILD_CITY)
  ```
- **Deterministic Action Flow**: Create a ranked hierarchy of action preferences:
  1. Build City
  2. Build Settlement
  3. Build Road
  4. End Turn
  When the LLM fails, actions are chosen following this hierarchy.

---

### 3. Strategies to Compete With AlphaBetaPlayer During Testing
To reduce dependency on the LLM when aiming for immediate competitiveness:
- **Simplistic Economic Strategy**: Implement deterministic rules to prioritize resource gathering and expansion, focusing on settlement and city building to optimize resource production.
- **Blocking Mechanism**: Develop routines to block high-value paths or settlement spots for opponents while maintaining growth.
- **Pre-defined Decision Trees**: Temporarily hard-code a simple decision tree for strategy execution, emphasizing actions like:
  - If Victory Points >= threshold, prioritize defensive moves.
  - Else, expand aggressively towards high VP goals.

---

### 4. Integrating Game-Specific Heuristics to Guide the LLM
Provide the LLM with board knowledge by embedding heuristic calculations into the prompt:
- **Heuristic Scoring in Prompts**: Add metrics like road potential, resource diversity, and opponent growth advantage:
  ```
  Heuristic Scores:
  - Settlement Value: {calculated_value}
  - City Upgrade Value: {calculated_value}
  - Road Extension Value: {calculated_value}
  Prioritize the action with the highest heuristic score.
  ```
- **Guided Options List**: For each action, append a descriptive note:
  ```
  Here are the actions ranked by value:
  - Action A (Heuristic Value: 15.2): This blocks Player 2's longest road and increases your resource income.
  - Action B (Heuristic Value: 14.5): Upgrades a settlement to a city for 2 VP gain.
  ```

---

### 5. Benchmarking LLM Performance Against Rule-Based Logic
Establish a structured evaluation method to measure LLM's decision performance:
- **Simulated Competitive Runs**: Pair LLM-based FooPlayer with deterministic or AlphaBetaPlayer and track metrics (wins, VPs, strategic goals).
- **Monte Carlo Testing**: Run thousands of simulations where the LLM's actions are compared against a preset rule engine's results to assess decision quality in various scenarios.
- **Action Matching**: Create a dataset of optimal moves in given scenarios (based on historical game trends or AlphaBetaPlayer’s performances) to compare how often LLM decisions align with the "ground truth."
- **Score Weighting Metrics**:
  - Victory Point Contribution: Percentage of decisions that lead directly to VP gain.
  - Opponent Blocking: Success rate in disrupting opponent strategies.
  - Resource Utilization: Effective use of collected resources to maximize VP.
  
---

### Next Steps:
If necessary, prioritize implementing improved fallback mechanisms and basic decision trees first to ensure immediate competitiveness. Gradually integrate advanced decision-making systems via guided prompts and heuristic evaluations as LLM refinement continues.

END STRATEGY.================================== Ai Message ==================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Transition FooPlayer into a competitive player over the next 5 iterations by leveraging enhanced strategy, including heuristic reinforcement, refined LLM prompts, and deterministic fallback mechanisms, and targeting measurable improvements in average VP and win rates.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Implement **segmented contextual prompting** and heuristic-enhanced decision-making into the LLM integration (as per Strategy 1 and 4). Additionally, integrate a **ranked action hierarchy** as a fallback mechanism (Strategy 2).

CHOSEN AGENT: CODER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:  
Modify the `decide` method of `FooPlayer.py` to achieve the following:

1. **Refined LLM Prompt**: 
   - Update the `_build_prompt` function to use **segmented contextual prompting**. Include headers that describe the game state, available resources, and strategic goals. Example structure:
     ```
     Current Game State:
     - Player Stats: {resources}, {settlements}, {cities}, VP: {victory_points}
     - Opponent Stats: {opponent resources/blockades}, etc.
     Goal: Maximize VP while taking advantage of the current game state.
     Available Actions: {list of formatted playable actions}
     Respond with:
     Action: {Selected optimal action}
     Justification: {Reasoning behind the action choice}
     ```

2. **Heuristic Context Integration**:
   - In the `_build_prompt` method, compute heuristic scores (e.g., settlement value, city upgrade value, road extension value) for each action. Integrate these scores into the prompt to help the LLM make better decisions.

3. **Fallback Mechanism**:
   - Enhance `_parse_llm_response` to implement a **ranked action hierarchy** fallback mechanism when the LLM output is invalid or ambiguous. Example hierarchy:
     - Priority Order: Build City > Build Settlement > Build Road > End Turn.
     - If a valid option matching the LLM response is not found, return the first valid action in this priority order.

4. **Logging**:
   - Improve logging to capture the heuristic scores, the LLM prompt, its raw response, and the fallback decision (when necessary) for post-game analysis.

Once complete, test the updated `FooPlayer.py`, run games, and report the results.================================ Human Message =================================

CODER

### Changes Made:
1. **Refined LLM Prompt Construction**:
   - Enhanced the `_build_prompt` function to use **segmented contextual prompting** with detailed headers for game state, player stats, opponent stats, and available actions.
   - Integrated **heuristic scores** for each action into the prompt to guide the LLM decision-making.

2. **Heuristic Computation Method**:
   - Added a `_compute_heuristic_scores` helper method to assign heuristic values to each action based on action type (e.g., city-building prioritized over road-building).

3. **Improved Parsing Logic**:
   - Enhanced `_parse_llm_response` to return a matching action from the LLM response, or delegate to the fallback mechanism if no match is found.

4. **Ranked Fallback Mechanism**:
   - Implemented `_fallback_action` to evaluate actions in a priority order: Build City > Build Settlement > Build Road > End Turn.
   - Default to the first action only when no prioritized options exist.

5. **Logging**:
   - Added print statements throughout to capture key debugging information:
     - The LLM prompt.
     - Heuristic scores of actions.
     - The LLM's raw response.
     - Logs for fallback mechanism use.

6. **Error Handling Enhancements**:
   - Integrated robust exception handling in the `decide` method for LLM failures, with clear logging of fallbacks.

### Notes for the Next Iteration:
- Tune the **heuristic scores** if the LLM's decisions align poorly with optimal strategies.
- Monitor how well the LLM responds to the enhanced prompt structure during testing.
- Evaluate the fallback mechanism's efficiency in comparison to the LLM's responses.

### Testing Recommendations:
- Focus on scenarios requiring diverse strategic goals (e.g., blocking opponent moves, building towards Largest Army).
- Analyze logs for patterns in ambiguous or ineffective LLM responses, and refine prompts or fallback heuristics accordingly.

AttributeError: 'Game' object has no attribute 'get_player_resources'================================ Human Message =================================

After Running The New foo_player.py Player, Here is my analysis and findings:

### Syntax Error Details:
- **Error Message**: `AttributeError: 'Game' object has no attribute 'get_player_resources'`
- **Exact Line Number**: Line 84 in `foo_player.py`
- **Exact Line of Code**: `resources=str(game.get_player_resources(Color.BLUE)),  # Example method to get resources`

### Root Cause:
The method `get_player_resources` is being called on the `Game` object, but it does not exist in the `Game` class, leading to an `AttributeError`. This indicates a mismatch between the game's API and the implementation in `foo_player.py`.

### Impact:
The syntax error prevents the game from running, and thus no game results were recorded for this evolution.

Let me know if you need anything else!================================== Ai Message ==================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Refactor FooPlayer to work seamlessly with the Catanatron API while continuing to enhance strategic decision-making via heuristic integration and LLM refinement. Achieve compatibility and avoid critical runtime errors in the next evolution to allow for testing and evaluation.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Resolve the `AttributeError` by ensuring that `foo_player.py` uses valid methods from the Catanatron `Game` class for retrieving player resources and other game state data. Validate the compatibility of all API calls in the `_build_prompt` method.

CHOSEN AGENT: RESEARCHER

AGENT OBJECTIVE: 
Identify the correct way to access the following game state information from the Catanatron API:
1. Player resources (e.g., wood, brick, grain, etc.) for a specific color (e.g., `Color.BLUE`).
2. Obtain other player and game statistics that might be relevant for building the LLM prompt (e.g., settlements, cities, roads, VP).
3. Provide a list of valid Game API methods and properties that could be helpful for efficiently querying such state details.

Ensure that the information provided directly addresses the API compatibility issues in `foo_player.py`.================================ Human Message =================================

RESEARCH:

#### Key Information on Accessing Game State Using Catanatron API

**1. Accessing Player Resources**
To retrieve resources (e.g., wood, brick, grain, etc.) for a specific player:
- Use the `get_player_freqdeck(state, color)` function, which provides the player's resource frequency deck.
  ```python
  from catanatron.state_functions import get_player_freqdeck
  player_resources = get_player_freqdeck(state, Color.BLUE)
  ```
- `player_num_resource_cards(state, color, resource)` can query the count for specific resources:
  ```python
  from catanatron.state_functions import player_num_resource_cards
  wood_count = player_num_resource_cards(state, Color.BLUE, "WOOD")
  ```

**2. Accessing Player and Game Statistics**
For settlements, cities, roads, and VP:
- **Settlements**: Use `get_player_buildings(state, color, "SETTLEMENT")` to retrieve settlement IDs of a player:
  ```python
  from catanatron.state_functions import get_player_buildings
  settlements = get_player_buildings(state, Color.BLUE, "SETTLEMENT")
  ```
- **Cities**: Similarly invoke `get_player_buildings(state, color, "CITY")` for city IDs:
  ```python
  cities = get_player_buildings(state, Color.BLUE, "CITY")
  ```
- **Roads Available**: Check roads available using state data:
  ```python
  player_key = player_key(state, Color.BLUE)
  roads_available = state.player_state[f"{player_key}_ROADS_AVAILABLE"]
  ```
- **Victory Points**: Victory points can be checked via:
  ```python
  victory_points = state.player_state[f"{player_key}_ACTUAL_VICTORY_POINTS"]
  ```

**3. General Game State Statistics**
The class `Game` contains the main API-level functions for interacting with game state, including:
- `play_tick()` to advance the game state.
- `winning_color()` to retrieve the player currently winning the game.
- `state.playable_actions` to list the valid actions at the current step.

```python
winning_player = game.winning_color()
playable_options = game.state.playable_actions
```

#### List of Useful Methods and Properties in Game API:
Valid methods within the `Game` class and associated functions:
- `get_player_freqdeck(state, color)` – Retrieves player's resources.
- `player_num_resource_cards(state, color, resource)` – Gets the count for specific resources.
- `player_key(state, color)` – Returns string key for player state.
- `get_player_buildings(state, color, building_type)` – Retrieves player's settlements/cities.
- `state.playable_actions` – Provides the currently executable actions.
- `game.play_tick()` – Advances game state one step.
- `game.winning_color()` – Returns the winning color/player.
- `state.colors` – Lists the colors in the game.

**References:**
1. `catanatron_core/catanatron/game.py` - Contains the Game class and `play_tick`, `winning_color`, `state.playable_actions`.
2. `catanatron_core/catanatron/models/player.py` - Includes player model and decision-making classes.
3. `catanatron_core/catanatron/models/enums.py` - Defines resources, colors, and action types.
4. `catanatron_core/catanatron/models/actions.py` - Includes `get_player_freqdeck`, `player_num_resource_cards`, and `get_player_buildings`.

END RESEARCH.================================== Ai Message ==================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Ensure functionality and compatibility of FooPlayer with the Catanatron API while strengthening the LLM decision-making mechanism in a way that improves strategic performance over the next 5 iterations.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Integrate valid Catanatron API calls into `foo_player.py`'s `_build_prompt` method to fetch relevant game data like resources, settlements, cities, roads, and victory points, and resolve the current `AttributeError` preventing gameplay.

CHOSEN AGENT: CODER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:  
Resolve the `AttributeError` by replacing invalid calls in `foo_player.py` with Catanatron-compatible API calls as outlined in the research:

1. **Resources**:
   - Replace `game.get_player_resources(Color.BLUE)` with `get_player_freqdeck(state, Color.BLUE)` to fetch all resources for FooPlayer.
   - Use `player_num_resource_cards(state, Color.BLUE, resource)` to query specific resource counts.

2. **Settlements and Cities**:
   - Replace invalid calls for settlements/cities with:
     ```python
     get_player_buildings(state, Color.BLUE, "SETTLEMENT")
     get_player_buildings(state, Color.BLUE, "CITY")
     ```

3. **Victory Points and Roads**:
   - Retrieve victory points using:
     ```python
     vp = state.player_state[player_key(state, Color.BLUE) + "_ACTUAL_VICTORY_POINTS"]
     ```
   - Roads remaining:
     ```python
     roads_available = state.player_state[player_key(state, Color.BLUE) + "_ROADS_AVAILABLE"]
     ```

4. **General Updates to `_build_prompt`**:
   - Adjust the prompt to include all valid game stats, ensuring Catanatron API calls function.
   - Include resource counts, settlements, cities, roads, and VP in the formatted prompt structure.

5. **Debugging and Validation**:
   - Add logging to verify data retrieval accuracy during gameplay for resources, actions, and VP.
   - Run a test evolution to confirm the absence of runtime errors.

Update the code to reflect these changes and provide detailed debug logs during testing for validation.================================ Human Message =================================

CODER

### Changes Made:
1. **Replaced Invalid API Calls**:
   - Substituted `game.get_player_resources(Color.BLUE)` with `get_player_freqdeck(state, Color.BLUE)` to correctly fetch resources.
   - Similar replacements made for settlements, cities, victory points, and roads using valid Catanatron API functions: 
     - `get_player_buildings(state, Color.BLUE, "SETTLEMENT")` and `get_player_buildings(state, Color.BLUE, "CITY")` for settlements and cities.
     - Victory points accessed via `state.player_state[f"{player_key(state, Color.BLUE)}_ACTUAL_VICTORY_POINTS"]`.
     - Roads available via `state.player_state[f"{player_key(state, Color.BLUE)}_ROADS_AVAILABLE"]`.

2. **Updated `_build_prompt` Method**:
   - Included new resource and state-fetching methods in the prompt template.
   - Enhanced formatting to make the prompt explainable and consistent with the desired LLM input structure.

3. **Improved Compatibility**:
   - Refactored the game state integration in `_build_prompt` to align with valid methods reliably compatible with the API.

4. **Debugging Enhancements**:
   - Added detailed logging via print statements to verify accurate state data retrieval during gameplay (resources, settlements, cities, heuristic scores).
   - Included error handling for invalid or mismatched LLM responses.

### Notes for the Next Iteration:
- Test how well the new prompt structure works with the LLM's decision-making.
- Monitor logs for resource/state-fetch accuracy and potential mismatches between heuristic scores and LLM responses.

### Testing Recommendations:
- Verify that resources, settlements, cities, and other player stats from the state align with the game's current state through debugging outputs.
- Check if the fallback mechanism handles invalid or ambiguous LLM responses efficiently.

After Running The New foo_player.py Player, Here is my analysis and findings:

### Scores of FooPlayer:
- Wins: 0  
- Average Victory Points (VP): 2.33  
- Average Settlements: 1.67  
- Average Cities: 0.33  
- Average Roads: 0.0  
- Average Largest Army: 0.0  
- Average Development VP: 0.0  

### Short Analysis of Game Output:
- **LLM Interaction**: The LLM responded consistently, but gameplay justification often involved executing mandatory or default actions (e.g., "ROLL" and "END TURN"), suggesting limited strategic depth.
- **Interesting Output**: The heuristic scoring mechanism categorizes actions clearly, but no significant changes to gameplay performance reflect deeper strategy execution.
- **Signs of Issue**: No roads or army development indicates repeated failure to invest strategically in growth areas, despite consistent heuristic scoring.

### Errors, Warnings, or Signs of Implementation Issues:
- **Strategic Weakness**: The absence of victories and poor metrics like roads and army raises concerns about the decision-making quality. 
- **Heuristic Misalignment**: High heuristic scores for actions like "BUILD_ROAD" occasionally appear in the logs but fail to translate into meaningful gameplay progression. 

Let me know if you need anything else!================================== Ai Message ==================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Enhance the decision-making of FooPlayer by refining the strategic priorities directly implemented in both the heuristic framework and LLM prompt responses. Aim to improve measurable metrics such as roads, army, and settlements while moving closer to achieving winning conditions over the next 5 iterations.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Address the strategic weaknesses by introducing a deeper integration of heuristic priorities into the fallback mechanism and improving the clarity in LLM prompt responses to focus on VP growth, road-building, and settlements.

CHOSEN AGENT: STRATEGIZER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:  
Generate 5 improved strategies to address the current shortcomings:
1. Improvements to heuristic scoring that prioritize growth areas (e.g., building roads, achieving Largest Army).
2. Suggestions to alter fallback mechanisms to emphasize strategic contributions (e.g., prioritize roads early-game or settlements near resource-heavy tiles).
3. Refined LLM prompt designs that explicitly guide actions toward VP growth and strategic dominance.
4. Ideas to balance resource accumulation and strategic investments (e.g., cities vs roads) to diversify objectives.
5. Approach to identifying action bottlenecks that lead to stagnation (e.g., repeated patterns of "END TURN" or inefficient action sequences).================================ Human Message =================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Develop a robust strategy execution mechanism that effectively leverages the LLM for decision-making. The aim is to improve FooPlayer's win count and strategic metrics, including roads, cities, and army contributions, while ensuring VP increases consistently over the iterations.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Address the LLM integration issue by refining the prompt construction in `_build_prompt` and improving the parsing logic in `_parse_llm_response`. Ensure valid and actionable responses are obtained and utilized for strategic decision-making.

CHOSEN AGENT: STRATEGIZER

AGENT OBJECTIVE: 
The LLM responses are ambiguous or invalid, causing the FooPlayer to revert to default fallback actions. This suggests that the strategy design or LLM integration is insufficiently aligned with achieving optimal gameplay outcomes. 

Please provide 5 new strategy options that could address these key deficiencies:
1. How to design prompts to make the LLM understand the game state and prioritize optimal actions more effectively.
2. Ideas for alternative fallback mechanisms if the LLM fails to provide valid responses.
3. Strategies to temporarily compete with AlphaBetaPlayer while testing LLM refinement, using deterministic or semi-deterministic rules.
4. Methods of integrating game-specific heuristics to guide the LLM's responses.
5. Suggestions for benchmarking the LLM's decision-making quality against predefined rule-based logic. 

================================== Ai Message ==================================

STRATEGY:

### 1. Designing Effective Prompts
The LLM query prompt construction should be more specific and structured to guide LLM decision-making effectively:
- **Segmented Contextual Prompting**: Break down the game state into key elements like resource availability, victory point progression, and opponent analysis. Use explicit headers, such as:
  ```
  Current Game State:
  - Player Stats: {resources}, {road_length}, {settlements}, {cities}, etc.
  - Opponent Stats: {resource_blockades}, {army_strength}, etc.
  - Goal: Maximize VP by using optimal actions considering available resources and the board state.
  ```
- **Action Explanation Request**: Explicitly require the LLM to provide a rationale for its decision:
  ```
  Respond with the optimal action and briefly justify your reasoning (e.g., maximizing resource gain or blocking opponent's road expansion).
  Example response structure:
  Action: {Chosen Action}
  Justification: {Rationale for Decision}
  ```

---

### 2. Alternative Fallback Mechanisms
Introduce enhanced fallback strategies when LLM returns invalid or ambiguous responses:
- **Priority Filtering**: Analyze the playable actions and prioritize the highest-value action types based on static strategic criteria:
  ```python
  if ActionType.BUILD_CITY in [action.action_type for action in playable_actions]:
      return next(action for action in playable_actions if action.action_type == ActionType.BUILD_CITY)
  ```
- **Deterministic Action Flow**: Create a ranked hierarchy of action preferences:
  1. Build City
  2. Build Settlement
  3. Build Road
  4. End Turn
  When the LLM fails, actions are chosen following this hierarchy.

---

### 3. Strategies to Compete With AlphaBetaPlayer During Testing
To reduce dependency on the LLM when aiming for immediate competitiveness:
- **Simplistic Economic Strategy**: Implement deterministic rules to prioritize resource gathering and expansion, focusing on settlement and city building to optimize resource production.
- **Blocking Mechanism**: Develop routines to block high-value paths or settlement spots for opponents while maintaining growth.
- **Pre-defined Decision Trees**: Temporarily hard-code a simple decision tree for strategy execution, emphasizing actions like:
  - If Victory Points >= threshold, prioritize defensive moves.
  - Else, expand aggressively towards high VP goals.

---

### 4. Integrating Game-Specific Heuristics to Guide the LLM
Provide the LLM with board knowledge by embedding heuristic calculations into the prompt:
- **Heuristic Scoring in Prompts**: Add metrics like road potential, resource diversity, and opponent growth advantage:
  ```
  Heuristic Scores:
  - Settlement Value: {calculated_value}
  - City Upgrade Value: {calculated_value}
  - Road Extension Value: {calculated_value}
  Prioritize the action with the highest heuristic score.
  ```
- **Guided Options List**: For each action, append a descriptive note:
  ```
  Here are the actions ranked by value:
  - Action A (Heuristic Value: 15.2): This blocks Player 2's longest road and increases your resource income.
  - Action B (Heuristic Value: 14.5): Upgrades a settlement to a city for 2 VP gain.
  ```

---

### 5. Benchmarking LLM Performance Against Rule-Based Logic
Establish a structured evaluation method to measure LLM's decision performance:
- **Simulated Competitive Runs**: Pair LLM-based FooPlayer with deterministic or AlphaBetaPlayer and track metrics (wins, VPs, strategic goals).
- **Monte Carlo Testing**: Run thousands of simulations where the LLM's actions are compared against a preset rule engine's results to assess decision quality in various scenarios.
- **Action Matching**: Create a dataset of optimal moves in given scenarios (based on historical game trends or AlphaBetaPlayer’s performances) to compare how often LLM decisions align with the "ground truth."
- **Score Weighting Metrics**:
  - Victory Point Contribution: Percentage of decisions that lead directly to VP gain.
  - Opponent Blocking: Success rate in disrupting opponent strategies.
  - Resource Utilization: Effective use of collected resources to maximize VP.
  
---

### Next Steps:
If necessary, prioritize implementing improved fallback mechanisms and basic decision trees first to ensure immediate competitiveness. Gradually integrate advanced decision-making systems via guided prompts and heuristic evaluations as LLM refinement continues.

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Enhance the decision-making of FooPlayer by refining the strategic priorities directly implemented in both the heuristic framework and LLM prompt responses. Aim to improve measurable metrics such as roads, army, and settlements while moving closer to achieving winning conditions over the next 5 iterations.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Address the strategic weaknesses by introducing a deeper integration of heuristic priorities into the fallback mechanism and improving the clarity in LLM prompt responses to focus on VP growth, road-building, and settlements.

CHOSEN AGENT: STRATEGIZER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:  
Generate 5 improved strategies to address the current shortcomings:
1. Improvements to heuristic scoring that prioritize growth areas (e.g., building roads, achieving Largest Army).
2. Suggestions to alter fallback mechanisms to emphasize strategic contributions (e.g., prioritize roads early-game or settlements near resource-heavy tiles).
3. Refined LLM prompt designs that explicitly guide actions toward VP growth and strategic dominance.
4. Ideas to balance resource accumulation and strategic investments (e.g., cities vs roads) to diversify objectives.
5. Approach to identifying action bottlenecks that lead to stagnation (e.g., repeated patterns of "END TURN" or inefficient action sequences).================================== Ai Message ==================================

STRATEGY:

### 1. Improvements to Heuristic Scoring
Enhance heuristic scoring to align with strategic growth objectives and quantify the value of actions more effectively:
- **VP-Oriented Scoring**: Add a multiplier for actions directly contributing to Victory Points (e.g., upgrading to cities or building settlements on high-value intersections).
  ```python
  if action.action_type == ActionType.BUILD_SETTLEMENT and action.location.resource_value > threshold:
      heuristic_scores[action] = 10 + action.location.resource_value
  elif action.action_type == ActionType.BUILD_CITY:
      heuristic_scores[action] = 15
  elif action.action_type == ActionType.BUILD_ROAD:
      heuristic_scores[action] = 5 + len(connected_resources)
  ```
- **Dynamic Game Stage Consideration**: Assign higher scores to actions like building roads or settlements in the early game, shifting to cities and army card purchases in later stages based on available resources and board state.
- **Opponent Disruption**: Include metrics for actions that block opponents’ extensions or resource monopolies, such as cutting off road expansions.

---

### 2. Fallback Mechanism Adjustments
Revise the fallback mechanism to prioritize actions that align with broader strategic objectives:
- **Early-Game Priorities**:
  1. **Roads**: Emphasize road-building to expand quickly and secure settlement sites early (calculate heuristic road priority based on proximity to key tiles, e.g., 8/6/9 tiles).
  2. **Settlements**: Focus on openings that increase resource diversity and resource flow.
  ```python
  if len(settlements) < 3 and ActionType.BUILD_SETTLEMENT in actions:
      return next(action for action in actions if action.action_type == ActionType.BUILD_SETTLEMENT)
  ```
- **Late-Game Priorities**:
   - Transition to cities or army card purchases while only building roads/settlements to secure Longest Road or block opponents.
- **Secondary Metrics**:
   - Consider an aggregate utility metric (e.g., resource spillover from connected tiles) to decide between fallback paths.

---

### 3. Refined LLM Prompt Design
Re-orient the LLM prompt to place greater emphasis on VP growth and strategic objectives:
- **Structured Guidance**:
  ```
  You are tasked with growing Victory Points (VP) towards winning conditions. Prioritize actions that directly lead to VP growth (e.g., building settlements/cities or creating roads if expanding settlements is possible). Additionally, consider blocking opponents’ expansion and achieving Longest Road or Largest Army. Here are the factors to consider:
  - VP contributions: How does this action increase Victory Points?
  - Resource optimization: Does this action improve resource variety or frequency?
  - Opponent impact: Does this action hinder opponents?
  ```
- **Action Context and Justification**: Force the LLM to evaluate and justify its decision explicitly with VP and strategic metrics as criteria:
  ```
  Action: {Chosen Action}
  VP Contribution: {Describe how this action contributes to Victory Points or other winning conditions (Longest Road, Largest Army, etc.)}
  Strategic Justification: {Explain why this action is optimal in your current state.}
  ```

---

### 4. Balancing Resource Accumulation and Strategic Investments
Introduce a dynamic system to balance competing objectives like upgrading cities versus building roads:
- **Resource Thresholds**:
   - Maintain a minimum resource reserve (e.g., 3 bricks and 3 wood) for road-building during the early game.
   - Shift to reserving ore and wheat when cities are needed in the late game.
  ```python
  if resources['brick'] > 2 and resources['wood'] > 2 and ActionType.BUILD_ROAD in actions:
      return build_road_action
  elif resources['ore'] > 3 and resources['wheat'] > 2 and ActionType.BUILD_CITY in actions:
      return build_city_action
  ```
- **Investment Diversification**:
   - Build roads as placeholders if resources for settlements or cities are insufficient, keeping future options open.
   - Introduce a trigger to prioritize development cards if no immediate high-value options exist.

---

### 5. Identifying Bottlenecks and Inefficiencies
Implement mechanisms to evaluate and eliminate stagnation in decision-making:
- **Action Tracking**:
  - Track patterns of repetitive actions (e.g., 3 consecutive END TURN actions) and trigger specific re-evaluations for resource optimization or blocking moves.
  - Introduce a "resource stall threshold": If surplus resources accumulate beyond a predefined number, focus on spending them, even on sub-optimal actions.
- **Post-Action Evaluation**:
  - After every game session, log actions with their outcomes (e.g., Did this action result in VP gain or resource improvement?).
  - Use decision heatmaps to identify action sequences that correlate with stagnation (e.g., prolonged road-building with no settlements).
- **Dynamic Decision Adjustment**:
  - Adjust scoring to aggressively penalize repetitive non-contributory actions.
  ```python
  if "END TURN" repeats more than twice:
      print(f"Repeated END TURN actions detected. Prioritizing an alternative action.")
      # Force expansion or development actions here.
  ```

---

### Next Steps:
1. Prioritize enhancing heuristic scoring to drive better early-game performance.
2. Adjust fallback mechanisms to emphasize forward-looking strategies like settlement preparation.
3. Integrate bottleneck detection mechanisms for iteration feedback and adapt the LLM query structure for immediate impact.

After Running The New foo_player.py Player, Here is my analysis and findings:

### Scores of FooPlayer:
- Wins: 0
- Average Victory Points (VP): 2.0
- Average Settlements: 2.0
- Average Cities: 0.0
- Average Roads: 0.0
- Average Largest Army: 0.0
- Average Development VP: 0.0

### Short Analysis of Game Output:
- The phrase "Choosing First Action on Default" repeated throughout the log suggests that the implementation is defaulting to selecting the first action without strategy. 
- Results indicate poor performance compared to the opponent, with no victories achieved in the 3-game session. 

### Errors, Warnings, or Signs of Implementation Issues:
- **Implementation Warning**: The log shows "Choosing First Action on Default" continuously, indicating that the `decide` method is not leveraging the LLM integration (`self.llm.query_llm`) for decision-making.
- **Gameplay Warning**: The score disparity (2 VP versus 10 VP for the opponent) and the lack of progression in Cities, Roads, and Largest Army metrics highlight a lack of strategy execution.

Let me know if you need anything else!================================== Ai Message ==================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Improve the performance of the `FooPlayer.py` by introducing intelligent strategy logic that leverages the LLM for decision-making. Specifically, aim for a minimum win count of 1 within the next 5 iterations while improving VP, settlements, and measurable gameplay metrics.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Address the issue of the `decide` method defaulting to selecting the first action. Integrate the LLM's `query_llm` functionality to intelligently evaluate actions based on state and strategy.

CHOSEN AGENT: CODER

AGENT OBJECTIVE: 
The current implementation of `FooPlayer` is defaulting to selecting the first action, as evidenced by the repeated log message "Choosing First Action on Default." Modify the `decide` method to leverage the `self.llm.query_llm` functionality for decision-making. Specifically:

1. Replace the current first-action default with an implementation that:
   a. Obtains a list of possible actions from the game state.
   b. Queries the LLM (`self.llm.query_llm`) for the evaluation of these actions.
   c. Selects the most intelligent action based on the LLM's evaluation.

2. Ensure the decision logic is robust and includes handling scenarios such as:
   - No valid actions available.
   - LLM providing ambiguous or conflicting guidance (fallback mechanisms).

3. Include clear comments and logging to observe how the LLM is influencing decision-making.

Once done, provide the modified code to be tested.================================ Human Message =================================

CODER

### Changes Made:
1. **Replaced Default Action Selection**:
   - Removed the hardcoded `return playable_actions[0]` that selected the first action by default.

2. **Integrated LLM Decision-Making in `decide`**:
   - Constructed a comprehensive prompt using the `_build_prompt` function to provide the LLM with game state and available actions.
   - Queried the LLM using `self.llm.query_llm(prompt)`.
   - Parsed the LLM's response using the `_parse_llm_response` function to select the most appropriate action from the available options.

3. **Added New Helper Methods**:
   - `_build_prompt`: Constructs a prompt by including the current game state and the list of playable actions.
   - `_parse_llm_response`: Interprets the LLM's response to match it with one of the playable actions. If no match is found, defaults to the first action.

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Included error handling for cases where the LLM query fails or returns an ambiguous response. In such cases, the method defaults to selecting the first action.
   - Added logging to show the LLM's response (`print(f"LLM Response: {llm_response}")`) and fallback mechanisms.

5. **Logging and Debugging**:
   - Added print statements for better debugging and observation:
     - Log when no playable actions are available.
     - Log the LLM's raw response.
     - Log if the response is ambiguous or invalid, and the fallback action is selected.

### Notes for the Next Iteration:
- **Prompt Details**: The current `_build_prompt` function makes a basic serialization of the game state and actions. If the LLM struggles to prioritize or understand the game details, refining this prompt may be necessary.
- **LLM Error Responses**: If runtime timing issues with `query_llm` arise (e.g., long delays or failures), adjustment of query limits or timeouts may be needed.

### Testing Recommendations:
- Test how the LLM chooses actions in various scenarios to verify that the parsing logic aligns with actual gameplay.
- Monitor logs (`LLM Response: ...`) for unexpected behaviors or ambiguous responses.

After Running The New foo_player.py Player, Here is my analysis and findings:

### Scores of FooPlayer:
- Wins: 0  
- Average Victory Points (VP): 3.33  
- Average Settlements: 2.33  
- Average Cities: 0.33  
- Average Roads: 0.0  
- Average Largest Army: 0.0  
- Average Development VP: 0.33  

### Short Analysis of Game Output:
- The LLM consistently failed to provide valid or actionable responses: "LLM response ambiguous or invalid. Defaulting to first action."
- FooPlayer defaulted to the first available action in all scenarios instead of executing strategic decisions.
- The performance difference is stark: FooPlayer had no wins and significantly lower VP compared to AlphaBetaPlayer.

### Errors, Warnings, or Signs of Implementation Issues:
- **LLM Integration Issue**: LLM responses are not being parsed correctly or are poorly generated, leading to fallback actions ("Defaulting to first action").
- **Decision-Making Deficiency**: The lack of strategic outcomes (e.g., 0 roads, 0 Largest Army) suggests serious shortcomings in action planning and execution.
- **Repeated Logs**: Multiple instances of ambiguous LLM responses point to insufficient prompt design or response parsing mechanism in `_parse_llm_response`.

Let me know if you need anything else!================================== Ai Message ==================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Develop a robust strategy execution mechanism that effectively leverages the LLM for decision-making. The aim is to improve FooPlayer's win count and strategic metrics, including roads, cities, and army contributions, while ensuring VP increases consistently over the iterations.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Address the LLM integration issue by refining the prompt construction in `_build_prompt` and improving the parsing logic in `_parse_llm_response`. Ensure valid and actionable responses are obtained and utilized for strategic decision-making.

CHOSEN AGENT: STRATEGIZER

AGENT OBJECTIVE: 
The LLM responses are ambiguous or invalid, causing the FooPlayer to revert to default fallback actions. This suggests that the strategy design or LLM integration is insufficiently aligned with achieving optimal gameplay outcomes. 

Please provide 5 new strategy options that could address these key deficiencies:
1. How to design prompts to make the LLM understand the game state and prioritize optimal actions more effectively.
2. Ideas for alternative fallback mechanisms if the LLM fails to provide valid responses.
3. Strategies to temporarily compete with AlphaBetaPlayer while testing LLM refinement, using deterministic or semi-deterministic rules.
4. Methods of integrating game-specific heuristics to guide the LLM's responses.
5. Suggestions for benchmarking the LLM's decision-making quality against predefined rule-based logic.================================ Human Message =================================

STRATEGY:

### 1. Designing Effective Prompts
The LLM query prompt construction should be more specific and structured to guide LLM decision-making effectively:
- **Segmented Contextual Prompting**: Break down the game state into key elements like resource availability, victory point progression, and opponent analysis. Use explicit headers, such as:
  ```
  Current Game State:
  - Player Stats: {resources}, {road_length}, {settlements}, {cities}, etc.
  - Opponent Stats: {resource_blockades}, {army_strength}, etc.
  - Goal: Maximize VP by using optimal actions considering available resources and the board state.
  ```
- **Action Explanation Request**: Explicitly require the LLM to provide a rationale for its decision:
  ```
  Respond with the optimal action and briefly justify your reasoning (e.g., maximizing resource gain or blocking opponent's road expansion).
  Example response structure:
  Action: {Chosen Action}
  Justification: {Rationale for Decision}
  ```

---

### 2. Alternative Fallback Mechanisms
Introduce enhanced fallback strategies when LLM returns invalid or ambiguous responses:
- **Priority Filtering**: Analyze the playable actions and prioritize the highest-value action types based on static strategic criteria:
  ```python
  if ActionType.BUILD_CITY in [action.action_type for action in playable_actions]:
      return next(action for action in playable_actions if action.action_type == ActionType.BUILD_CITY)
  ```
- **Deterministic Action Flow**: Create a ranked hierarchy of action preferences:
  1. Build City
  2. Build Settlement
  3. Build Road
  4. End Turn
  When the LLM fails, actions are chosen following this hierarchy.

---

### 3. Strategies to Compete With AlphaBetaPlayer During Testing
To reduce dependency on the LLM when aiming for immediate competitiveness:
- **Simplistic Economic Strategy**: Implement deterministic rules to prioritize resource gathering and expansion, focusing on settlement and city building to optimize resource production.
- **Blocking Mechanism**: Develop routines to block high-value paths or settlement spots for opponents while maintaining growth.
- **Pre-defined Decision Trees**: Temporarily hard-code a simple decision tree for strategy execution, emphasizing actions like:
  - If Victory Points >= threshold, prioritize defensive moves.
  - Else, expand aggressively towards high VP goals.

---

### 4. Integrating Game-Specific Heuristics to Guide the LLM
Provide the LLM with board knowledge by embedding heuristic calculations into the prompt:
- **Heuristic Scoring in Prompts**: Add metrics like road potential, resource diversity, and opponent growth advantage:
  ```
  Heuristic Scores:
  - Settlement Value: {calculated_value}
  - City Upgrade Value: {calculated_value}
  - Road Extension Value: {calculated_value}
  Prioritize the action with the highest heuristic score.
  ```
- **Guided Options List**: For each action, append a descriptive note:
  ```
  Here are the actions ranked by value:
  - Action A (Heuristic Value: 15.2): This blocks Player 2's longest road and increases your resource income.
  - Action B (Heuristic Value: 14.5): Upgrades a settlement to a city for 2 VP gain.
  ```

---

### 5. Benchmarking LLM Performance Against Rule-Based Logic
Establish a structured evaluation method to measure LLM's decision performance:
- **Simulated Competitive Runs**: Pair LLM-based FooPlayer with deterministic or AlphaBetaPlayer and track metrics (wins, VPs, strategic goals).
- **Monte Carlo Testing**: Run thousands of simulations where the LLM's actions are compared against a preset rule engine's results to assess decision quality in various scenarios.
- **Action Matching**: Create a dataset of optimal moves in given scenarios (based on historical game trends or AlphaBetaPlayer’s performances) to compare how often LLM decisions align with the "ground truth."
- **Score Weighting Metrics**:
  - Victory Point Contribution: Percentage of decisions that lead directly to VP gain.
  - Opponent Blocking: Success rate in disrupting opponent strategies.
  - Resource Utilization: Effective use of collected resources to maximize VP.
  
---

### Next Steps:
If necessary, prioritize implementing improved fallback mechanisms and basic decision trees first to ensure immediate competitiveness. Gradually integrate advanced decision-making systems via guided prompts and heuristic evaluations as LLM refinement continues.

END STRATEGY.================================== Ai Message ==================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Transition FooPlayer into a competitive player over the next 5 iterations by leveraging enhanced strategy, including heuristic reinforcement, refined LLM prompts, and deterministic fallback mechanisms, and targeting measurable improvements in average VP and win rates.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Implement **segmented contextual prompting** and heuristic-enhanced decision-making into the LLM integration (as per Strategy 1 and 4). Additionally, integrate a **ranked action hierarchy** as a fallback mechanism (Strategy 2).

CHOSEN AGENT: CODER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:  
Modify the `decide` method of `FooPlayer.py` to achieve the following:

1. **Refined LLM Prompt**: 
   - Update the `_build_prompt` function to use **segmented contextual prompting**. Include headers that describe the game state, available resources, and strategic goals. Example structure:
     ```
     Current Game State:
     - Player Stats: {resources}, {settlements}, {cities}, VP: {victory_points}
     - Opponent Stats: {opponent resources/blockades}, etc.
     Goal: Maximize VP while taking advantage of the current game state.
     Available Actions: {list of formatted playable actions}
     Respond with:
     Action: {Selected optimal action}
     Justification: {Reasoning behind the action choice}
     ```

2. **Heuristic Context Integration**:
   - In the `_build_prompt` method, compute heuristic scores (e.g., settlement value, city upgrade value, road extension value) for each action. Integrate these scores into the prompt to help the LLM make better decisions.

3. **Fallback Mechanism**:
   - Enhance `_parse_llm_response` to implement a **ranked action hierarchy** fallback mechanism when the LLM output is invalid or ambiguous. Example hierarchy:
     - Priority Order: Build City > Build Settlement > Build Road > End Turn.
     - If a valid option matching the LLM response is not found, return the first valid action in this priority order.

4. **Logging**:
   - Improve logging to capture the heuristic scores, the LLM prompt, its raw response, and the fallback decision (when necessary) for post-game analysis.

Once complete, test the updated `FooPlayer.py`, run games, and report the results.================================ Human Message =================================

CODER

### Changes Made:
1. **Refined LLM Prompt Construction**:
   - Enhanced the `_build_prompt` function to use **segmented contextual prompting** with detailed headers for game state, player stats, opponent stats, and available actions.
   - Integrated **heuristic scores** for each action into the prompt to guide the LLM decision-making.

2. **Heuristic Computation Method**:
   - Added a `_compute_heuristic_scores` helper method to assign heuristic values to each action based on action type (e.g., city-building prioritized over road-building).

3. **Improved Parsing Logic**:
   - Enhanced `_parse_llm_response` to return a matching action from the LLM response, or delegate to the fallback mechanism if no match is found.

4. **Ranked Fallback Mechanism**:
   - Implemented `_fallback_action` to evaluate actions in a priority order: Build City > Build Settlement > Build Road > End Turn.
   - Default to the first action only when no prioritized options exist.

5. **Logging**:
   - Added print statements throughout to capture key debugging information:
     - The LLM prompt.
     - Heuristic scores of actions.
     - The LLM's raw response.
     - Logs for fallback mechanism use.

6. **Error Handling Enhancements**:
   - Integrated robust exception handling in the `decide` method for LLM failures, with clear logging of fallbacks.

### Notes for the Next Iteration:
- Tune the **heuristic scores** if the LLM's decisions align poorly with optimal strategies.
- Monitor how well the LLM responds to the enhanced prompt structure during testing.
- Evaluate the fallback mechanism's efficiency in comparison to the LLM's responses.

### Testing Recommendations:
- Focus on scenarios requiring diverse strategic goals (e.g., blocking opponent moves, building towards Largest Army).
- Analyze logs for patterns in ambiguous or ineffective LLM responses, and refine prompts or fallback heuristics accordingly.

AttributeError: 'Game' object has no attribute 'get_player_resources'================================ Human Message =================================

After Running The New foo_player.py Player, Here is my analysis and findings:

### Syntax Error Details:
- **Error Message**: `AttributeError: 'Game' object has no attribute 'get_player_resources'`
- **Exact Line Number**: Line 84 in `foo_player.py`
- **Exact Line of Code**: `resources=str(game.get_player_resources(Color.BLUE)),  # Example method to get resources`

### Root Cause:
The method `get_player_resources` is being called on the `Game` object, but it does not exist in the `Game` class, leading to an `AttributeError`. This indicates a mismatch between the game's API and the implementation in `foo_player.py`.

### Impact:
The syntax error prevents the game from running, and thus no game results were recorded for this evolution.

Let me know if you need anything else!================================== Ai Message ==================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Refactor FooPlayer to work seamlessly with the Catanatron API while continuing to enhance strategic decision-making via heuristic integration and LLM refinement. Achieve compatibility and avoid critical runtime errors in the next evolution to allow for testing and evaluation.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Resolve the `AttributeError` by ensuring that `foo_player.py` uses valid methods from the Catanatron `Game` class for retrieving player resources and other game state data. Validate the compatibility of all API calls in the `_build_prompt` method.

CHOSEN AGENT: RESEARCHER

AGENT OBJECTIVE: 
Identify the correct way to access the following game state information from the Catanatron API:
1. Player resources (e.g., wood, brick, grain, etc.) for a specific color (e.g., `Color.BLUE`).
2. Obtain other player and game statistics that might be relevant for building the LLM prompt (e.g., settlements, cities, roads, VP).
3. Provide a list of valid Game API methods and properties that could be helpful for efficiently querying such state details.

Ensure that the information provided directly addresses the API compatibility issues in `foo_player.py`.================================ Human Message =================================

RESEARCH:

#### Key Information on Accessing Game State Using Catanatron API

**1. Accessing Player Resources**
To retrieve resources (e.g., wood, brick, grain, etc.) for a specific player:
- Use the `get_player_freqdeck(state, color)` function, which provides the player's resource frequency deck.
  ```python
  from catanatron.state_functions import get_player_freqdeck
  player_resources = get_player_freqdeck(state, Color.BLUE)
  ```
- `player_num_resource_cards(state, color, resource)` can query the count for specific resources:
  ```python
  from catanatron.state_functions import player_num_resource_cards
  wood_count = player_num_resource_cards(state, Color.BLUE, "WOOD")
  ```

**2. Accessing Player and Game Statistics**
For settlements, cities, roads, and VP:
- **Settlements**: Use `get_player_buildings(state, color, "SETTLEMENT")` to retrieve settlement IDs of a player:
  ```python
  from catanatron.state_functions import get_player_buildings
  settlements = get_player_buildings(state, Color.BLUE, "SETTLEMENT")
  ```
- **Cities**: Similarly invoke `get_player_buildings(state, color, "CITY")` for city IDs:
  ```python
  cities = get_player_buildings(state, Color.BLUE, "CITY")
  ```
- **Roads Available**: Check roads available using state data:
  ```python
  player_key = player_key(state, Color.BLUE)
  roads_available = state.player_state[f"{player_key}_ROADS_AVAILABLE"]
  ```
- **Victory Points**: Victory points can be checked via:
  ```python
  victory_points = state.player_state[f"{player_key}_ACTUAL_VICTORY_POINTS"]
  ```

**3. General Game State Statistics**
The class `Game` contains the main API-level functions for interacting with game state, including:
- `play_tick()` to advance the game state.
- `winning_color()` to retrieve the player currently winning the game.
- `state.playable_actions` to list the valid actions at the current step.

```python
winning_player = game.winning_color()
playable_options = game.state.playable_actions
```

#### List of Useful Methods and Properties in Game API:
Valid methods within the `Game` class and associated functions:
- `get_player_freqdeck(state, color)` – Retrieves player's resources.
- `player_num_resource_cards(state, color, resource)` – Gets the count for specific resources.
- `player_key(state, color)` – Returns string key for player state.
- `get_player_buildings(state, color, building_type)` – Retrieves player's settlements/cities.
- `state.playable_actions` – Provides the currently executable actions.
- `game.play_tick()` – Advances game state one step.
- `game.winning_color()` – Returns the winning color/player.
- `state.colors` – Lists the colors in the game.

**References:**
1. `catanatron_core/catanatron/game.py` - Contains the Game class and `play_tick`, `winning_color`, `state.playable_actions`.
2. `catanatron_core/catanatron/models/player.py` - Includes player model and decision-making classes.
3. `catanatron_core/catanatron/models/enums.py` - Defines resources, colors, and action types.
4. `catanatron_core/catanatron/models/actions.py` - Includes `get_player_freqdeck`, `player_num_resource_cards`, and `get_player_buildings`.

END RESEARCH.================================== Ai Message ==================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Ensure functionality and compatibility of FooPlayer with the Catanatron API while strengthening the LLM decision-making mechanism in a way that improves strategic performance over the next 5 iterations.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Integrate valid Catanatron API calls into `foo_player.py`'s `_build_prompt` method to fetch relevant game data like resources, settlements, cities, roads, and victory points, and resolve the current `AttributeError` preventing gameplay.

CHOSEN AGENT: CODER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:  
Resolve the `AttributeError` by replacing invalid calls in `foo_player.py` with Catanatron-compatible API calls as outlined in the research:

1. **Resources**:
   - Replace `game.get_player_resources(Color.BLUE)` with `get_player_freqdeck(state, Color.BLUE)` to fetch all resources for FooPlayer.
   - Use `player_num_resource_cards(state, Color.BLUE, resource)` to query specific resource counts.

2. **Settlements and Cities**:
   - Replace invalid calls for settlements/cities with:
     ```python
     get_player_buildings(state, Color.BLUE, "SETTLEMENT")
     get_player_buildings(state, Color.BLUE, "CITY")
     ```

3. **Victory Points and Roads**:
   - Retrieve victory points using:
     ```python
     vp = state.player_state[player_key(state, Color.BLUE) + "_ACTUAL_VICTORY_POINTS"]
     ```
   - Roads remaining:
     ```python
     roads_available = state.player_state[player_key(state, Color.BLUE) + "_ROADS_AVAILABLE"]
     ```

4. **General Updates to `_build_prompt`**:
   - Adjust the prompt to include all valid game stats, ensuring Catanatron API calls function.
   - Include resource counts, settlements, cities, roads, and VP in the formatted prompt structure.

5. **Debugging and Validation**:
   - Add logging to verify data retrieval accuracy during gameplay for resources, actions, and VP.
   - Run a test evolution to confirm the absence of runtime errors.

Update the code to reflect these changes and provide detailed debug logs during testing for validation.================================ Human Message =================================

CODER

### Changes Made:
1. **Replaced Invalid API Calls**:
   - Substituted `game.get_player_resources(Color.BLUE)` with `get_player_freqdeck(state, Color.BLUE)` to correctly fetch resources.
   - Similar replacements made for settlements, cities, victory points, and roads using valid Catanatron API functions: 
     - `get_player_buildings(state, Color.BLUE, "SETTLEMENT")` and `get_player_buildings(state, Color.BLUE, "CITY")` for settlements and cities.
     - Victory points accessed via `state.player_state[f"{player_key(state, Color.BLUE)}_ACTUAL_VICTORY_POINTS"]`.
     - Roads available via `state.player_state[f"{player_key(state, Color.BLUE)}_ROADS_AVAILABLE"]`.

2. **Updated `_build_prompt` Method**:
   - Included new resource and state-fetching methods in the prompt template.
   - Enhanced formatting to make the prompt explainable and consistent with the desired LLM input structure.

3. **Improved Compatibility**:
   - Refactored the game state integration in `_build_prompt` to align with valid methods reliably compatible with the API.

4. **Debugging Enhancements**:
   - Added detailed logging via print statements to verify accurate state data retrieval during gameplay (resources, settlements, cities, heuristic scores).
   - Included error handling for invalid or mismatched LLM responses.

### Notes for the Next Iteration:
- Test how well the new prompt structure works with the LLM's decision-making.
- Monitor logs for resource/state-fetch accuracy and potential mismatches between heuristic scores and LLM responses.

### Testing Recommendations:
- Verify that resources, settlements, cities, and other player stats from the state align with the game's current state through debugging outputs.
- Check if the fallback mechanism handles invalid or ambiguous LLM responses efficiently.

After Running The New foo_player.py Player, Here is my analysis and findings:

### Scores of FooPlayer:
- Wins: 0  
- Average Victory Points (VP): 2.33  
- Average Settlements: 1.67  
- Average Cities: 0.33  
- Average Roads: 0.0  
- Average Largest Army: 0.0  
- Average Development VP: 0.0  

### Short Analysis of Game Output:
- **LLM Interaction**: The LLM responded consistently, but gameplay justification often involved executing mandatory or default actions (e.g., "ROLL" and "END TURN"), suggesting limited strategic depth.
- **Interesting Output**: The heuristic scoring mechanism categorizes actions clearly, but no significant changes to gameplay performance reflect deeper strategy execution.
- **Signs of Issue**: No roads or army development indicates repeated failure to invest strategically in growth areas, despite consistent heuristic scoring.

### Errors, Warnings, or Signs of Implementation Issues:
- **Strategic Weakness**: The absence of victories and poor metrics like roads and army raises concerns about the decision-making quality. 
- **Heuristic Misalignment**: High heuristic scores for actions like "BUILD_ROAD" occasionally appear in the logs but fail to translate into meaningful gameplay progression. 

Let me know if you need anything else!================================== Ai Message ==================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Enhance the decision-making of FooPlayer by refining the strategic priorities directly implemented in both the heuristic framework and LLM prompt responses. Aim to improve measurable metrics such as roads, army, and settlements while moving closer to achieving winning conditions over the next 5 iterations.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Address the strategic weaknesses by introducing a deeper integration of heuristic priorities into the fallback mechanism and improving the clarity in LLM prompt responses to focus on VP growth, road-building, and settlements.

CHOSEN AGENT: STRATEGIZER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:  
Generate 5 improved strategies to address the current shortcomings:
1. Improvements to heuristic scoring that prioritize growth areas (e.g., building roads, achieving Largest Army).
2. Suggestions to alter fallback mechanisms to emphasize strategic contributions (e.g., prioritize roads early-game or settlements near resource-heavy tiles).
3. Refined LLM prompt designs that explicitly guide actions toward VP growth and strategic dominance.
4. Ideas to balance resource accumulation and strategic investments (e.g., cities vs roads) to diversify objectives.
5. Approach to identifying action bottlenecks that lead to stagnation (e.g., repeated patterns of "END TURN" or inefficient action sequences).================================ Human Message =================================

STRATEGY:

### 1. Improvements to Heuristic Scoring
Enhance heuristic scoring to align with strategic growth objectives and quantify the value of actions more effectively:
- **VP-Oriented Scoring**: Add a multiplier for actions directly contributing to Victory Points (e.g., upgrading to cities or building settlements on high-value intersections).
  ```python
  if action.action_type == ActionType.BUILD_SETTLEMENT and action.location.resource_value > threshold:
      heuristic_scores[action] = 10 + action.location.resource_value
  elif action.action_type == ActionType.BUILD_CITY:
      heuristic_scores[action] = 15
  elif action.action_type == ActionType.BUILD_ROAD:
      heuristic_scores[action] = 5 + len(connected_resources)
  ```
- **Dynamic Game Stage Consideration**: Assign higher scores to actions like building roads or settlements in the early game, shifting to cities and army card purchases in later stages based on available resources and board state.
- **Opponent Disruption**: Include metrics for actions that block opponents’ extensions or resource monopolies, such as cutting off road expansions.

---

### 2. Fallback Mechanism Adjustments
Revise the fallback mechanism to prioritize actions that align with broader strategic objectives:
- **Early-Game Priorities**:
  1. **Roads**: Emphasize road-building to expand quickly and secure settlement sites early (calculate heuristic road priority based on proximity to key tiles, e.g., 8/6/9 tiles).
  2. **Settlements**: Focus on openings that increase resource diversity and resource flow.
  ```python
  if len(settlements) < 3 and ActionType.BUILD_SETTLEMENT in actions:
      return next(action for action in actions if action.action_type == ActionType.BUILD_SETTLEMENT)
  ```
- **Late-Game Priorities**:
   - Transition to cities or army card purchases while only building roads/settlements to secure Longest Road or block opponents.
- **Secondary Metrics**:
   - Consider an aggregate utility metric (e.g., resource spillover from connected tiles) to decide between fallback paths.

---

### 3. Refined LLM Prompt Design
Re-orient the LLM prompt to place greater emphasis on VP growth and strategic objectives:
- **Structured Guidance**:
  ```
  You are tasked with growing Victory Points (VP) towards winning conditions. Prioritize actions that directly lead to VP growth (e.g., building settlements/cities or creating roads if expanding settlements is possible). Additionally, consider blocking opponents’ expansion and achieving Longest Road or Largest Army. Here are the factors to consider:
  - VP contributions: How does this action increase Victory Points?
  - Resource optimization: Does this action improve resource variety or frequency?
  - Opponent impact: Does this action hinder opponents?
  ```
- **Action Context and Justification**: Force the LLM to evaluate and justify its decision explicitly with VP and strategic metrics as criteria:
  ```
  Action: {Chosen Action}
  VP Contribution: {Describe how this action contributes to Victory Points or other winning conditions (Longest Road, Largest Army, etc.)}
  Strategic Justification: {Explain why this action is optimal in your current state.}
  ```

---

### 4. Balancing Resource Accumulation and Strategic Investments
Introduce a dynamic system to balance competing objectives like upgrading cities versus building roads:
- **Resource Thresholds**:
   - Maintain a minimum resource reserve (e.g., 3 bricks and 3 wood) for road-building during the early game.
   - Shift to reserving ore and wheat when cities are needed in the late game.
  ```python
  if resources['brick'] > 2 and resources['wood'] > 2 and ActionType.BUILD_ROAD in actions:
      return build_road_action
  elif resources['ore'] > 3 and resources['wheat'] > 2 and ActionType.BUILD_CITY in actions:
      return build_city_action
  ```
- **Investment Diversification**:
   - Build roads as placeholders if resources for settlements or cities are insufficient, keeping future options open.
   - Introduce a trigger to prioritize development cards if no immediate high-value options exist.

---

### 5. Identifying Bottlenecks and Inefficiencies
Implement mechanisms to evaluate and eliminate stagnation in decision-making:
- **Action Tracking**:
  - Track patterns of repetitive actions (e.g., 3 consecutive END TURN actions) and trigger specific re-evaluations for resource optimization or blocking moves.
  - Introduce a "resource stall threshold": If surplus resources accumulate beyond a predefined number, focus on spending them, even on sub-optimal actions.
- **Post-Action Evaluation**:
  - After every game session, log actions with their outcomes (e.g., Did this action result in VP gain or resource improvement?).
  - Use decision heatmaps to identify action sequences that correlate with stagnation (e.g., prolonged road-building with no settlements).
- **Dynamic Decision Adjustment**:
  - Adjust scoring to aggressively penalize repetitive non-contributory actions.
  ```python
  if "END TURN" repeats more than twice:
      print(f"Repeated END TURN actions detected. Prioritizing an alternative action.")
      # Force expansion or development actions here.
  ```

---

### Next Steps:
1. Prioritize enhancing heuristic scoring to drive better early-game performance.
2. Adjust fallback mechanisms to emphasize forward-looking strategies like settlement preparation.
3. Integrate bottleneck detection mechanisms for iteration feedback and adapt the LLM query structure for immediate impact.

END STRATEGY.================================== Ai Message ==================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Implement a strategy that improves both early and late-game decision-making for FooPlayer through advanced heuristics, adjusted fallback mechanisms, and refined LLM prompts, achieving measurable improvements in metrics such as roads, settlements, and victory points.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Integrate enhanced heuristic scoring and dynamic fallback priorities into the decision flow while refining LLM responses for strategic action selection, focusing on VP growth and efficient resource use.

CHOSEN AGENT: CODER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:  
Modify FooPlayer to implement the strategies outlined in the five key areas. Specifically:

1. **Enhance Heuristic Scoring**:
   - Add multipliers for actions directly contributing to Victory Points, such as settlement building and city upgrading.
   - Dynamically adjust scores based on the game stage (early vs. late-game priorities), prioritizing roads and settlements early while focusing on VP-heavy actions late.

2. **Dynamic Fallback Mechanism**:
   - Revise the fallback mechanism to focus on early-game expansion via roads and settlements as placeholders for resource diversity and VP accumulation.
   - Later transition fallback logic to VP-centric actions like city upgrades and development cards.

3. **Refined LLM Prompt**:
   - Update the LLM prompt to emphasize VP growth explicitly.
   - Demand justification for actions based on Victory Points and strategic blocking of opponents.

4. **Resource Threshold Balancing**:
   - Introduce logic for maintaining resource reserves and diversifying investments based on available actions.
   - Trigger placeholder actions like road-building when strategic objectives are temporarily unattainable.

5. **Action Bottleneck Detection**:
   - Implement tracking logic for repetitive unproductive actions (e.g., repeated "END TURN").
   - Adjust decision scoring to discourage stagnation, forcing resource spending or defensive actions when necessary.

Make necessary modifications to the `decide` method and auxiliary functions like `_build_prompt` and `heuristic_scores`. Run a test iteration post-implementation to ensure that the changes positively impact FooPlayer performance.================================ Human Message =================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Improve the performance of the `FooPlayer.py` by introducing intelligent strategy logic that leverages the LLM for decision-making. Specifically, aim for a minimum win count of 1 within the next 5 iterations while improving VP, settlements, and measurable gameplay metrics.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Address the issue of the `decide` method defaulting to selecting the first action. Integrate the LLM's `query_llm` functionality to intelligently evaluate actions based on state and strategy.

CHOSEN AGENT: CODER

AGENT OBJECTIVE: 
The current implementation of `FooPlayer` is defaulting to selecting the first action, as evidenced by the repeated log message "Choosing First Action on Default." Modify the `decide` method to leverage the `self.llm.query_llm` functionality for decision-making. Specifically:

1. Replace the current first-action default with an implementation that:
   a. Obtains a list of possible actions from the game state.
   b. Queries the LLM (`self.llm.query_llm`) for the evaluation of these actions.
   c. Selects the most intelligent action based on the LLM's evaluation.

2. Ensure the decision logic is robust and includes handling scenarios such as:
   - No valid actions available.
   - LLM providing ambiguous or conflicting guidance (fallback mechanisms).

3. Include clear comments and logging to observe how the LLM is influencing decision-making.

Once done, provide the modified code to be tested.================================== Ai Message ==================================

CODER

### Changes Made:
1. **Replaced Default Action Selection**:
   - Removed the hardcoded `return playable_actions[0]` that selected the first action by default.

2. **Integrated LLM Decision-Making in `decide`**:
   - Constructed a comprehensive prompt using the `_build_prompt` function to provide the LLM with game state and available actions.
   - Queried the LLM using `self.llm.query_llm(prompt)`.
   - Parsed the LLM's response using the `_parse_llm_response` function to select the most appropriate action from the available options.

3. **Added New Helper Methods**:
   - `_build_prompt`: Constructs a prompt by including the current game state and the list of playable actions.
   - `_parse_llm_response`: Interprets the LLM's response to match it with one of the playable actions. If no match is found, defaults to the first action.

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Included error handling for cases where the LLM query fails or returns an ambiguous response. In such cases, the method defaults to selecting the first action.
   - Added logging to show the LLM's response (`print(f"LLM Response: {llm_response}")`) and fallback mechanisms.

5. **Logging and Debugging**:
   - Added print statements for better debugging and observation:
     - Log when no playable actions are available.
     - Log the LLM's raw response.
     - Log if the response is ambiguous or invalid, and the fallback action is selected.

### Notes for the Next Iteration:
- **Prompt Details**: The current `_build_prompt` function makes a basic serialization of the game state and actions. If the LLM struggles to prioritize or understand the game details, refining this prompt may be necessary.
- **LLM Error Responses**: If runtime timing issues with `query_llm` arise (e.g., long delays or failures), adjustment of query limits or timeouts may be needed.

### Testing Recommendations:
- Test how the LLM chooses actions in various scenarios to verify that the parsing logic aligns with actual gameplay.
- Monitor logs (`LLM Response: ...`) for unexpected behaviors or ambiguous responses.

END CODER================================ Human Message =================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Transition FooPlayer into a competitive player over the next 5 iterations by leveraging enhanced strategy, including heuristic reinforcement, refined LLM prompts, and deterministic fallback mechanisms, and targeting measurable improvements in average VP and win rates.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Implement **segmented contextual prompting** and heuristic-enhanced decision-making into the LLM integration (as per Strategy 1 and 4). Additionally, integrate a **ranked action hierarchy** as a fallback mechanism (Strategy 2).

CHOSEN AGENT: CODER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:  
Modify the `decide` method of `FooPlayer.py` to achieve the following:

1. **Refined LLM Prompt**: 
   - Update the `_build_prompt` function to use **segmented contextual prompting**. Include headers that describe the game state, available resources, and strategic goals. Example structure:
     ```
     Current Game State:
     - Player Stats: {resources}, {settlements}, {cities}, VP: {victory_points}
     - Opponent Stats: {opponent resources/blockades}, etc.
     Goal: Maximize VP while taking advantage of the current game state.
     Available Actions: {list of formatted playable actions}
     Respond with:
     Action: {Selected optimal action}
     Justification: {Reasoning behind the action choice}
     ```

2. **Heuristic Context Integration**:
   - In the `_build_prompt` method, compute heuristic scores (e.g., settlement value, city upgrade value, road extension value) for each action. Integrate these scores into the prompt to help the LLM make better decisions.

3. **Fallback Mechanism**:
   - Enhance `_parse_llm_response` to implement a **ranked action hierarchy** fallback mechanism when the LLM output is invalid or ambiguous. Example hierarchy:
     - Priority Order: Build City > Build Settlement > Build Road > End Turn.
     - If a valid option matching the LLM response is not found, return the first valid action in this priority order.

4. **Logging**:
   - Improve logging to capture the heuristic scores, the LLM prompt, its raw response, and the fallback decision (when necessary) for post-game analysis.

Once complete, test the updated `FooPlayer.py`, run games, and report the results.================================== Ai Message ==================================

CODER

### Changes Made:
1. **Refined LLM Prompt Construction**:
   - Enhanced the `_build_prompt` function to use **segmented contextual prompting** with detailed headers for game state, player stats, opponent stats, and available actions.
   - Integrated **heuristic scores** for each action into the prompt to guide the LLM decision-making.

2. **Heuristic Computation Method**:
   - Added a `_compute_heuristic_scores` helper method to assign heuristic values to each action based on action type (e.g., city-building prioritized over road-building).

3. **Improved Parsing Logic**:
   - Enhanced `_parse_llm_response` to return a matching action from the LLM response, or delegate to the fallback mechanism if no match is found.

4. **Ranked Fallback Mechanism**:
   - Implemented `_fallback_action` to evaluate actions in a priority order: Build City > Build Settlement > Build Road > End Turn.
   - Default to the first action only when no prioritized options exist.

5. **Logging**:
   - Added print statements throughout to capture key debugging information:
     - The LLM prompt.
     - Heuristic scores of actions.
     - The LLM's raw response.
     - Logs for fallback mechanism use.

6. **Error Handling Enhancements**:
   - Integrated robust exception handling in the `decide` method for LLM failures, with clear logging of fallbacks.

### Notes for the Next Iteration:
- Tune the **heuristic scores** if the LLM's decisions align poorly with optimal strategies.
- Monitor how well the LLM responds to the enhanced prompt structure during testing.
- Evaluate the fallback mechanism's efficiency in comparison to the LLM's responses.

### Testing Recommendations:
- Focus on scenarios requiring diverse strategic goals (e.g., blocking opponent moves, building towards Largest Army).
- Analyze logs for patterns in ambiguous or ineffective LLM responses, and refine prompts or fallback heuristics accordingly.

END CODER================================ Human Message =================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Ensure functionality and compatibility of FooPlayer with the Catanatron API while strengthening the LLM decision-making mechanism in a way that improves strategic performance over the next 5 iterations.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Integrate valid Catanatron API calls into `foo_player.py`'s `_build_prompt` method to fetch relevant game data like resources, settlements, cities, roads, and victory points, and resolve the current `AttributeError` preventing gameplay.

CHOSEN AGENT: CODER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:  
Resolve the `AttributeError` by replacing invalid calls in `foo_player.py` with Catanatron-compatible API calls as outlined in the research:

1. **Resources**:
   - Replace `game.get_player_resources(Color.BLUE)` with `get_player_freqdeck(state, Color.BLUE)` to fetch all resources for FooPlayer.
   - Use `player_num_resource_cards(state, Color.BLUE, resource)` to query specific resource counts.

2. **Settlements and Cities**:
   - Replace invalid calls for settlements/cities with:
     ```python
     get_player_buildings(state, Color.BLUE, "SETTLEMENT")
     get_player_buildings(state, Color.BLUE, "CITY")
     ```

3. **Victory Points and Roads**:
   - Retrieve victory points using:
     ```python
     vp = state.player_state[player_key(state, Color.BLUE) + "_ACTUAL_VICTORY_POINTS"]
     ```
   - Roads remaining:
     ```python
     roads_available = state.player_state[player_key(state, Color.BLUE) + "_ROADS_AVAILABLE"]
     ```

4. **General Updates to `_build_prompt`**:
   - Adjust the prompt to include all valid game stats, ensuring Catanatron API calls function.
   - Include resource counts, settlements, cities, roads, and VP in the formatted prompt structure.

5. **Debugging and Validation**:
   - Add logging to verify data retrieval accuracy during gameplay for resources, actions, and VP.
   - Run a test evolution to confirm the absence of runtime errors.

Update the code to reflect these changes and provide detailed debug logs during testing for validation.================================== Ai Message ==================================

CODER

### Changes Made:
1. **Replaced Invalid API Calls**:
   - Substituted `game.get_player_resources(Color.BLUE)` with `get_player_freqdeck(state, Color.BLUE)` to correctly fetch resources.
   - Similar replacements made for settlements, cities, victory points, and roads using valid Catanatron API functions: 
     - `get_player_buildings(state, Color.BLUE, "SETTLEMENT")` and `get_player_buildings(state, Color.BLUE, "CITY")` for settlements and cities.
     - Victory points accessed via `state.player_state[f"{player_key(state, Color.BLUE)}_ACTUAL_VICTORY_POINTS"]`.
     - Roads available via `state.player_state[f"{player_key(state, Color.BLUE)}_ROADS_AVAILABLE"]`.

2. **Updated `_build_prompt` Method**:
   - Included new resource and state-fetching methods in the prompt template.
   - Enhanced formatting to make the prompt explainable and consistent with the desired LLM input structure.

3. **Improved Compatibility**:
   - Refactored the game state integration in `_build_prompt` to align with valid methods reliably compatible with the API.

4. **Debugging Enhancements**:
   - Added detailed logging via print statements to verify accurate state data retrieval during gameplay (resources, settlements, cities, heuristic scores).
   - Included error handling for invalid or mismatched LLM responses.

### Notes for the Next Iteration:
- Test how well the new prompt structure works with the LLM's decision-making.
- Monitor logs for resource/state-fetch accuracy and potential mismatches between heuristic scores and LLM responses.

### Testing Recommendations:
- Verify that resources, settlements, cities, and other player stats from the state align with the game's current state through debugging outputs.
- Check if the fallback mechanism handles invalid or ambiguous LLM responses efficiently.

After Running The New foo_player.py Player, Here is my analysis and findings:

### Scores of FooPlayer:
- Wins: 0  
- Average Victory Points (VP): 2.33  
- Average Settlements: 1.67  
- Average Cities: 0.33  
- Average Roads: 0.0  
- Average Largest Army: 0.0  
- Average Development VP: 0.0  

### Short Analysis of Game Output:
- **LLM Interaction**: The LLM responded consistently, but gameplay justification often involved executing mandatory or default actions (e.g., "ROLL" and "END TURN"), suggesting limited strategic depth.
- **Interesting Output**: The heuristic scoring mechanism categorizes actions clearly, but no significant changes to gameplay performance reflect deeper strategy execution.
- **Signs of Issue**: No roads or army development indicates repeated failure to invest strategically in growth areas, despite consistent heuristic scoring.

### Errors, Warnings, or Signs of Implementation Issues:
- **Strategic Weakness**: The absence of victories and poor metrics like roads and army raises concerns about the decision-making quality. 
- **Heuristic Misalignment**: High heuristic scores for actions like "BUILD_ROAD" occasionally appear in the logs but fail to translate into meaningful gameplay progression. 

Let me know if you need anything else!================================== Ai Message ==================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Enhance the decision-making of FooPlayer by refining the strategic priorities directly implemented in both the heuristic framework and LLM prompt responses. Aim to improve measurable metrics such as roads, army, and settlements while moving closer to achieving winning conditions over the next 5 iterations.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Address the strategic weaknesses by introducing a deeper integration of heuristic priorities into the fallback mechanism and improving the clarity in LLM prompt responses to focus on VP growth, road-building, and settlements.

CHOSEN AGENT: STRATEGIZER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:  
Generate 5 improved strategies to address the current shortcomings:
1. Improvements to heuristic scoring that prioritize growth areas (e.g., building roads, achieving Largest Army).
2. Suggestions to alter fallback mechanisms to emphasize strategic contributions (e.g., prioritize roads early-game or settlements near resource-heavy tiles).
3. Refined LLM prompt designs that explicitly guide actions toward VP growth and strategic dominance.
4. Ideas to balance resource accumulation and strategic investments (e.g., cities vs roads) to diversify objectives.
5. Approach to identifying action bottlenecks that lead to stagnation (e.g., repeated patterns of "END TURN" or inefficient action sequences).================================ Human Message =================================

STRATEGY:

### 1. Improvements to Heuristic Scoring
Enhance heuristic scoring to align with strategic growth objectives and quantify the value of actions more effectively:
- **VP-Oriented Scoring**: Add a multiplier for actions directly contributing to Victory Points (e.g., upgrading to cities or building settlements on high-value intersections).
  ```python
  if action.action_type == ActionType.BUILD_SETTLEMENT and action.location.resource_value > threshold:
      heuristic_scores[action] = 10 + action.location.resource_value
  elif action.action_type == ActionType.BUILD_CITY:
      heuristic_scores[action] = 15
  elif action.action_type == ActionType.BUILD_ROAD:
      heuristic_scores[action] = 5 + len(connected_resources)
  ```
- **Dynamic Game Stage Consideration**: Assign higher scores to actions like building roads or settlements in the early game, shifting to cities and army card purchases in later stages based on available resources and board state.
- **Opponent Disruption**: Include metrics for actions that block opponents’ extensions or resource monopolies, such as cutting off road expansions.

### 2. Fallback Mechanism Adjustments
Revise the fallback mechanism to prioritize actions that align with broader strategic objectives:
- **Early-Game Priorities**:

- **Late-Game Priorities**:
   - Transition to cities or army card purchases while only building roads/settlements to secure Longest Road or block opponents.
- **Secondary Metrics**:
   - Consider an aggregate utility metric (e.g., resource spillover from connected tiles) to decide between fallback paths.

### 3. Refined LLM Prompt Design
Re-orient the LLM prompt to place greater emphasis on VP growth and strategic objectives:
- **Structured Guidance**:
  ```
  You are tasked with growing Victory Points (VP) towards winning conditions. Prioritize actions that directly lead to VP growth (e.g., building settlements/cities or creating roads if expanding settlements is possible).

  ```
  Action: {Chosen Action}
  VP Contribution: {Describe how this action contributes to Victory Points or other winning conditions (Longest Road, Largest Army, etc.)}

Introduce a dynamic system to balance competing objectives like upgrading cities versus building roads:
- **Resource Thresholds**:
   - Maintain a minimum resource reserve (e.g., 3 bricks and 3 wood) for road-building during the early game.
   - Shift to reserving ore and wheat when cities are needed in the late game.
  ```python

      return build_city_action
  ```
- **Investment Diversification**:
   - Build roads as placeholders if resources for settlements or cities are insufficient, keeping future options open.
   - Introduce a trigger to prioritize development cards if no immediate high-value options exist.

  - Introduce a "resource stall threshold": If surplus resources accumulate beyond a predefined number, focus on spending them, even on sub-optimal actions.
- **Post-Action Evaluation**:
  - After every game session, log actions with their outcomes (e.g., Did this action result in VP gain or resource improvement?).
  - Use decision heatmaps to identify action sequences that correlate with stagnation (e.g., prolonged road-building with no settlements).
- **Dynamic Decision Adjustment**:
  - Adjust scoring to aggressively penalize repetitive non-contributory actions.
  ```python
  if "END TURN" repeats more than twice:
      print(f"Repeated END TURN actions detected. Prioritizing an alternative action.")

### Next Steps:
1. Prioritize enhancing heuristic scoring to drive better early-game performance.
2. Adjust fallback mechanisms to emphasize forward-looking strategies like settlement preparation.

   - Introduce logic for maintaining resource reserves and diversifying investments based on available actions.
   - Trigger placeholder actions like road-building when strategic objectives are temporarily unattainable.

5. **Action Bottleneck Detection**:
   - Implement tracking logic for repetitive unproductive actions (e.g., repeated "END TURN").
   - Adjust decision scoring to discourage stagnation, forcing resource spending or defensive actions when necessary.

Make necessary modifications to the `decide` method and auxiliary functions like `_build_prompt` and `heuristic_scores`. Run a test iteration post-implementation to ensure that the changes positively impact FooPlayer performance.================================ Human Message =================================

### Summary of Changes:
1. **Enhanced Heuristic Scoring**:
   - Incorporated VP contribution into heuristic scores.
   - Adjusted scores dynamically based on roads remaining and game phase.

2. **Dynamic Fallback Priorities**:
   - Modified `_fallback_action` to prioritize actions strategically based on early vs. late-game aims.
   - Incorporated a priority order that promotes building cities, settlements, and roads.

3. **Refined LLM Prompt**:
   - Expanded the prompt to focus on VP, resource diversity, and opponent impact.
   - Included heuristic scores for LLM guidance and decision alignment.

4. **Improved Error and Response Handling**:
   - Enhanced `_parse_llm_response` to handle ambiguous LLM outputs.
   - Included detailed print logs during fallback decisions.

### Next Steps:
- Test the updated `FooPlayer` against increasingly challenging opponents to evaluate performance.
- Monitor logs, especially during fallback actions, for adjustments to scoring weights or LLM alignment.
- Incrementally refine heuristic values and prompt details based on test outcomes.

ANALYZER OBJECTIVE:

If there is no syntax errors, I want you to return
    - The Scores of the foo_player.py player from the game_results json file
    - Short analysis of the game output (return anything interseting that was printed)
    - EMPHASIZE any errors, warnings, or signs of player implementation error in the game_output.txt file 

If there is a syntax error, I want you to return
    - The error message from the game_output.txt file
    - The exact line number of the error if possible
    - The exact line of code that caused the error if possible

Keep the Response as concise as possible

After Running The New foo_player.py Player, Here is my analysis and findings:

### Scores of FooPlayer:
- Wins: 0
- Average Victory Points (VP): 2.0
- Average Settlements: 2.0
- Average Cities: 0.0
- Average Roads: 0.0
- Average Largest Army: 0.0
- Average Development VP: 0.0

### Short Analysis of Game Output:
- The phrase "Choosing First Action on Default" repeated throughout the log suggests that the implementation is defaulting to selecting the first action without strategy. 
- Results indicate poor performance compared to the opponent, with no victories achieved in the 3-game session. 

### Errors, Warnings, or Signs of Implementation Issues:
- **Implementation Warning**: The log shows "Choosing First Action on Default" continuously, indicating that the `decide` method is not leveraging the LLM integration (`self.llm.query_llm`) for decision-making.
- **Gameplay Warning**: The score disparity (2 VP versus 10 VP for the opponent) and the lack of progression in Cities, Roads, and Largest Army metrics highlight a lack of strategy execution.

- Wins: 0

- Average Settlements: 2.33  
- Average Cities: 0.33  
- Average Roads: 0.0  
- Average Largest Army: 0.0  
- Average Development VP: 0.33  

### Short Analysis of Game Output:
- The LLM consistently failed to provide valid or actionable responses: "LLM response ambiguous or invalid. Defaulting to first action."
- FooPlayer defaulted to the first available action in all scenarios instead of executing strategic decisions.
- The performance difference is stark: FooPlayer had no wins and significantly lower VP compared to AlphaBetaPlayer.

### Errors, Warnings, or Signs of Implementation Issues:
- **LLM Integration Issue**: LLM responses are not being parsed correctly or are poorly generated, leading to fallback actions ("Defaulting to first action").
- **Decision-Making Deficiency**: The lack of strategic outcomes (e.g., 0 roads, 0 Largest Army) suggests serious shortcomings in action planning and execution.
- **Repeated Logs**: Multiple instances of ambiguous LLM responses point to insufficient prompt design or response parsing mechanism in `_parse_llm_response`.

- **Error Message**: `AttributeError: 'Game' object has no attribute 'get_player_resources'`
- **Exact Line Number**: Line 84 in `foo_player.py`
- **Exact Line of Code**: `resources=str(game.get_player_resources(Color.BLUE)),  # Example method to get resources`

### Root Cause:
The method `get_player_resources` is being called on the `Game` object, but it does not exist in the `Game` class, leading to an `AttributeError`. This indicates a mismatch between the game's API and the implementation in `foo_player.py`.

### Impact:
The syntax error prevents the game from running, and thus no game results were recorded for this evolution.

### Short Analysis of Game Output:
- **LLM Interaction**: The LLM responded consistently, but gameplay justification often involved executing mandatory or default actions (e.g., "ROLL" and "END TURN"), suggesting limited strategic depth.
- **Interesting Output**: The heuristic scoring mechanism categorizes actions clearly, but no significant changes to gameplay performance reflect deeper strategy execution.
- **Signs of Issue**: No roads or army development indicates repeated failure to invest strategically in growth areas, despite consistent heuristic scoring.

### Errors, Warnings, or Signs of Implementation Issues:
- **Strategic Weakness**: The absence of victories and poor metrics like roads and army raises concerns about the decision-making quality. 
- **Heuristic Misalignment**: High heuristic scores for actions like "BUILD_ROAD" occasionally appear in the logs but fail to translate into meaningful gameplay progression.

This is the current game_output.txt file

nd has a heuristic score of 1, which indicates it is the optimal choice. Rolling the dice will generate resources or trigger development opportunities that improve the overall game state. Since additional actions are unavailable, this is the logical step to advance the game.
LLM Response: Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)  
Justification: The game state shows that you lack the necessary resources to build anything meaningful (e.g., settlements, cities, or roads). Additionally, there are no other actions available apart from ending your turn, making this the only viable option. Ending the turn is optimal to progress the game and potentially acquire additional resources on the next turn.
LLM Response: Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)  
Justification: Rolling is the only available action and has a heuristic score of 1. It is necessary to roll the dice to advance the game state, potentially collect resources, and enable further actions.
LLM Response: Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)  
Justification: All available actions have the same heuristic score (1), meaning they are equally valued in this game state. Since trading resources via maritime trade doesn’t appear to provide an immediate benefit or unlock further actionable opportunities (e.g., constructing additional settlements, roads, or cities), it isn't worth spending resources. Thus, the optimal decision is to end the turn and wait for a better opportunity in the next round.
LLM Response: Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)  
Justification: Rolling is the only action available, and its heuristic score is 1. Rolling the dice generates resources, increasing your resource pool, which can be used for building settlements, cities, roads, and ultimately gaining victory points. Without any other actionable options, rolling is the optimal choice at this stage.
LLM Response: Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)  
Justification: All the available actions have equal heuristic scores of 1, so there is no clear advantage to taking one over another. Since no immediate trade will significantly improve the game state, and you lack a strategic reason to perform a maritime trade (e.g., acquiring a specific resource to build something), the best course of action is to end the turn and wait for more favorable opportunities or resources on the next turn.
LLM Response: Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)  
Justification: The available action "ROLL" is the only option provided in the game state, and its heuristic score is 1. Rolling the dice is the optimal choice as it allows progression in the game by generating resources that can be used for future actions, such as building settlements, cities, or roads, and ultimately increasing Victory Points.
LLM Response: Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)  
Justification: All actions have an equal heuristic score of 1, indicating no immediate advantage among the maritime trades. Since the resources available don't currently allow for building a settlement, upgrading to a city, or building a road (and no configurations in maritime trade appear more beneficial at this moment), the best course of action is to end the turn and gather more resources. This allows you to wait for better opportunities in subsequent turns.
LLM Response: Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)  
Justification: The only action available is to roll the dice, as indicated by the game state. Rolling the dice is essential to advance the game, potentially gather resources, and create opportunities for additional actions in future turns. Given that no other actions are available, this is the optimal and required move at this stage.
LLM Response: ### Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

### Justification: 
All actions have the same heuristic score of 1, meaning from a decision-making perspective, they are equally viable based on the available information. However, none of the maritime trade options significantly advance the Victory Points or improve resource utility for building settlements, cities, or roads. Ending the turn is the optimal move to preserve resources and let the game progress, potentially leading to better opportunities on the next turn.
LLM Response: Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)  
Justification: The only available action is to roll the dice, which is necessary to progress the game. Rolling will distribute resources to players based on the outcome, enabling further actions like building, trading, or upgrading in future turns. Since there are no alternative actions, this is the optimal choice.
LLM Response: **Action:** Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)  
**Justification:** All available actions have the same heuristic score of 1, meaning that none of the maritime trades provide a clear benefit over simply ending the turn. Trading four WOOD resources, based on the current resource distribution, does not significantly improve the player's position towards building settlements, cities, or other strategic developments. Thus, the best move is to **end the turn** and wait for better opportunities or resource gains in subsequent turns.
LLM Response: Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)  
Justification: The only available action is to roll the dice, which is a necessary step to progress the game and potentially gather more resources. Since there are no other options, rolling the dice is optimal to advance the game state.
LLM Response: Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)  
Justification: All available actions have equal heuristic scores of 1, showing no clear advantage to using maritime trade for converting wood into other resources at this time. Given the game state, it is best to retain resources for future flexibility and avoid unnecessary trades that don't contribute to immediate progress or strategic advantage. Ending the turn allows the opportunity to accumulate more resources through dice rolls and prepare for better opportunities in the next turn.
LLM Response: Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)  
Justification: Rolling the dice is currently the only available action. This action progresses the game by determining resource distribution, which can potentially increase resources for future development like building settlements, roads, or upgrading to cities. Thus, choosing to roll is the optimal move at this stage.
LLM Response: Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.DISCARD: 'DISCARD'>, value=None)  
Justification: The only available action is a DISCARD action, which has a heuristic score of 1. Since there are no other choices presented, this action is optimal by default. Discarding resources is typically a forced action in scenarios like being over the limit due to a robber activation or other game rules.
LLM Response: ### Action:
```python
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MOVE_ROBBER: 'MOVE_ROBBER'>, value=((0, 0, 0), <Color.RED: 'RED'>, None))
```

### Justification:
- All available actions have an equal heuristic score of `1`, indicating that there's no clear numeric preference for one action based on immediate utility alone.
- However, since the action involves stealing from **<Color.RED>**, it offers a potential strategic advantage by disrupting their resource flow or acquiring a useful resource. The target hex `(0, 0, 0)` may also be central, impacting multiple red buildings.
- Opting for `(0, 0, 0)` as a default is reasonable to maintain consistency, especially since no additional information about resource preferences or opponents’ board positions is provided.
LLM Response: Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)  
Justification: The only available action at this point is to end the turn. No other actions are presented in the game state, making it the optimal (and only) choice to proceed. The associated heuristic score of 1 reflects this straightforward decision.
LLM Response: Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)  
Justification: Rolling the dice is the only available action, as indicated in the provided game state. This will allow resources to be generated based on existing settlements, advancing the game and enabling future actions such as building roads, settlements, or cities. While the heuristic score is low, it is still the optimal action since there are no other alternatives.
LLM Response: Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)  
Justification: The only available action is to end the turn. This indicates there are no current opportunities to build or trade given the player's resources and game state. Ending the turn allows the game to progress and provides the player a chance to acquire more resources or opportunities in subsequent turns.
LLM Response: Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)  
Justification: Rolling the dice is the only available action in this game state. It allows the game to progress by potentially gaining resources or triggering events depending on the dice roll outcomes. This is a necessary step to continue building and achieving further goals.
LLM Response: ### Action: `Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MOVE_ROBBER: 'MOVE_ROBBER'>, value=((1, -1, 0), <Color.RED: 'RED'>, None))`

### Justification:
The current heuristic scores for all actions are equal (all are 1), which means no action is strictly preferred based on the provided scores. In such cases, the decision should focus on actions that have potential strategic benefits.

1. **Impacting Opponent (Red)**: This action targets the Red player's hex at coordinates `(1, -1, 0)`, potentially disrupting their resource generation and slowing their progress. This is beneficial because targeting other players (especially Red) can hamper their efforts to build settlements, roads, and cities—important for progressing toward victory.

2. **Strategic Placement**: The hex `(1, -1, 0)` appears closer to the core board area, making it likely to be a central resource-producing area, which increases the chance that blocking this hex will result in significant interference.

3. **Consistency**: A move that impacts an opponent is preferable to moving the robber to a hex with no opponent presence. Blocking Red repeatedly can build pressure.

This action was chosen due to its strategic benefit in disrupting Red's game flow while contributing to the current player's progress indirectly.
LLM Response: Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)  
Justification: The only available action is to end the turn. Although the heuristic score for ending the turn is only 1, no other actions are presented, indicating that the player currently lacks the necessary resources or conditions to perform other actions like building roads, settlements, or upgrading settlements to cities. Ending the turn is therefore the optimal choice to set up for future resource collection and opportunities.
LLM Response: Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)  
Justification: The current available action is to roll the dice, and there are no alternative choices at this stage of the game. Rolling the dice is necessary to progress the game, as it determines resource production and any subsequent actions you might take. This is the optimal action as there are no other options available.
LLM Response: Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)  
Justification: The only available action in this game state is to end the turn. Without other actions to consider, this is the optimal choice. Ending the turn will pass control to the next player, allowing the game to progress.
LLM Response: Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)  
Justification: The only available action is to roll the dice, which progresses the game state by generating resources based on settlements and cities. Since no other actions are available and rolling has a positive heuristic score, it is the optimal choice to continue advancing the game.
LLM Response: Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Justification: The available resources ([2, 0, 1, 2, 0]) are insufficient to build anything (e.g., settlements, roads, or cities). There are no other viable actions listed, and ending the turn is the only action available, making it the optimal move to advance the game and gather more resources on the next turn.
LLM Response: Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)  
Justification: The only available action is "ROLL," and its heuristic score is 1. Rolling the dice is necessary to advance the game state by generating resources, which are critical for building settlements, roads, and cities to increase victory points. Since no other actions are available, this is the optimal choice.
LLM Response: Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)  
Justification: The player currently has insufficient resources to perform any upgrades (like building settlements, roads, or cities) or trade. With a heuristic score of 1 for ending the turn and no other actions available, ending the turn is the optimal choice to allow the player to collect more resources next turn and reassess potential future moves.
LLM Response: Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)  
Justification: The only action available is to roll the dice. The heuristic score indicates that this action is the optimal choice, albeit with a low score of 1, suggesting limited immediate impact. Rolling the dice is crucial to generating resources, enabling potential future actions such as building settlements, cities, or roads to progress toward victory points.
LLM Response: ### Action: `Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MOVE_ROBBER: 'MOVE_ROBBER'>, value=((0, 0, 0), <Color.RED: 'RED'>, None))`
### Justification: 
All actions have the same heuristic score of `1`, meaning there isn't a clear numerical advantage in one action over another. In cases like this, targeting an opponent can be strategically beneficial. By choosing the action involving `<Color.RED: 'RED'>` at `(0, 0, 0)`, we disrupt Red's production capability at this hex. This might hinder their resource accumulation, thereby slowing their progress and improving Blue's chance of maintaining an advantage. Additionally, `(0, 0, 0)` is a central tile, potentially blocking a high-value area for Red.
LLM Response: Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Justification: The only available action in this turn is to "END_TURN". There are no other actions to consider, as no alternative decisions or resources allow progress in the current state. Ending the turn is optimal to progress the game and wait for more resources or opportunities on subsequent turns.
LLM Response: Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)  
Justification: The only available action is to roll the dice. Rolling is necessary to generate resources or trigger trading and building opportunities, which are essential to progressing in the game. Since there are no other choices or competing heuristic scores, this is the optimal action to take at this point.
LLM Response: Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)  
Justification: Ending the turn is the only available action. Based on the heuristic score provided (1), there are no better alternatives, as there are no other optional moves to consider at this point in the game state. Ending the turn allows progression to the next phase where new opportunities might arise.
LLM Response: Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)  
Justification: The only action available is to roll the dice. Rolling is essential at the start of a turn to potentially collect resources, which can be used for building and progressing in the game. Since no other actions are available, this is the optimal action to take.
LLM Response: Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)  
Justification: With the current game state, you do not have sufficient resources to perform any other actions, such as building roads, settlements, or upgrading to cities. The only available action is to end your turn, which allows the game to progress and gives you the opportunity to gather more resources on the next roll or through trades. Ending the turn is optimal since there are no other viable moves at this time.

After Running The New foo_player.py Player, Here is my analysis and findings:

### Scores of FooPlayer:
- Wins: 0  
- Average Victory Points (VP): 2.6666666666666665  
- Average Settlements: 1.3333333333333333  
- Average Cities: 0.6666666666666666  
- Average Roads: 0.0  
- Average Largest Army: 0.0  
- Average Development VP: 0.0  

### Short Analysis of Game Output:
- **Repetitive Logs**: Multiple instances of LLM responses defaulting to basic actions such as "ROLL" and "END TURN," with justifications suggesting limited strategic depth. Example: "Rolling is necessary to progress the game state."
- **Neutral Heuristic Scoring**: Actions often evaluated with a low heuristic score (`1`). This indicates the heuristic system fails to differentiate between strategic actions.
- **Misalignment**: High-priority actions like "BUILD_CITY" or "BUILD_SETTLEMENT" seem underutilized, despite occasional high heuristic scores visible in logs. 

### Errors, Warnings, or Signs of Implementation Issues:
- **LLM Integration Weakness**: Responses imply poor decision quality by prioritizing roll/end-turn actions excessively. This indicates the prompt design and parsing mechanisms need refinement.
- **Strategic Gaps**: Failure to build roads or utilize army resources, even across multiple turns, suggests severe strategic deficiencies. The game log reinforces these gaps.
- **Warning**: Logs frequently state "Fallback mechanism applied," implying reliance on basic action prioritization rather than effective LLM outputs.

After Running The New foo_player.py Player, Here is my analysis and findings:

### Scores of FooPlayer:
- Wins: 0  
- Average Victory Points (VP): 3.33  
- Average Settlements: 2.33  
- Average Cities: 0.33  
- Average Roads: 0.0  
- Average Largest Army: 0.0  
- Average Development VP: 0.33  

### Short Analysis of Game Output:
- The LLM consistently failed to provide valid or actionable responses: "LLM response ambiguous or invalid. Defaulting to first action."
- FooPlayer defaulted to the first available action in all scenarios instead of executing strategic decisions.
- The performance difference is stark: FooPlayer had no wins and significantly lower VP compared to AlphaBetaPlayer.

### Errors, Warnings, or Signs of Implementation Issues:
- **LLM Integration Issue**: LLM responses are not being parsed correctly or are poorly generated, leading to fallback actions ("Defaulting to first action").
- **Decision-Making Deficiency**: The lack of strategic outcomes (e.g., 0 roads, 0 Largest Army) suggests serious shortcomings in action planning and execution.
- **Repeated Logs**: Multiple instances of ambiguous LLM responses point to insufficient prompt design or response parsing mechanism in `_parse_llm_response`.

Let me know if you need anything else!================================== Ai Message ==================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Develop a robust strategy execution mechanism that effectively leverages the LLM for decision-making. The aim is to improve FooPlayer's win count and strategic metrics, including roads, cities, and army contributions, while ensuring VP increases consistently over the iterations.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Address the LLM integration issue by refining the prompt construction in `_build_prompt` and improving the parsing logic in `_parse_llm_response`. Ensure valid and actionable responses are obtained and utilized for strategic decision-making.

CHOSEN AGENT: STRATEGIZER

AGENT OBJECTIVE: 
The LLM responses are ambiguous or invalid, causing the FooPlayer to revert to default fallback actions. This suggests that the strategy design or LLM integration is insufficiently aligned with achieving optimal gameplay outcomes. 

Please provide 5 new strategy options that could address these key deficiencies:
1. How to design prompts to make the LLM understand the game state and prioritize optimal actions more effectively.
2. Ideas for alternative fallback mechanisms if the LLM fails to provide valid responses.
3. Strategies to temporarily compete with AlphaBetaPlayer while testing LLM refinement, using deterministic or semi-deterministic rules.
4. Methods of integrating game-specific heuristics to guide the LLM's responses.
5. Suggestions for benchmarking the LLM's decision-making quality against predefined rule-based logic.================================ Human Message =================================

STRATEGY:

### 1. Designing Effective Prompts
The LLM query prompt construction should be more specific and structured to guide LLM decision-making effectively:
- **Segmented Contextual Prompting**: Break down the game state into key elements like resource availability, victory point progression, and opponent analysis. Use explicit headers, such as:
  ```
  Current Game State:
  - Player Stats: {resources}, {road_length}, {settlements}, {cities}, etc.
  - Opponent Stats: {resource_blockades}, {army_strength}, etc.
  - Goal: Maximize VP by using optimal actions considering available resources and the board state.
  ```
- **Action Explanation Request**: Explicitly require the LLM to provide a rationale for its decision:
  ```
  Respond with the optimal action and briefly justify your reasoning (e.g., maximizing resource gain or blocking opponent's road expansion).
  Example response structure:
  Action: {Chosen Action}
  Justification: {Rationale for Decision}
  ```

---

### 2. Alternative Fallback Mechanisms
Introduce enhanced fallback strategies when LLM returns invalid or ambiguous responses:
- **Priority Filtering**: Analyze the playable actions and prioritize the highest-value action types based on static strategic criteria:
  ```python
  if ActionType.BUILD_CITY in [action.action_type for action in playable_actions]:
      return next(action for action in playable_actions if action.action_type == ActionType.BUILD_CITY)
  ```
- **Deterministic Action Flow**: Create a ranked hierarchy of action preferences:
  1. Build City
  2. Build Settlement
  3. Build Road
  4. End Turn
  When the LLM fails, actions are chosen following this hierarchy.

---

### 3. Strategies to Compete With AlphaBetaPlayer During Testing
To reduce dependency on the LLM when aiming for immediate competitiveness:
- **Simplistic Economic Strategy**: Implement deterministic rules to prioritize resource gathering and expansion, focusing on settlement and city building to optimize resource production.
- **Blocking Mechanism**: Develop routines to block high-value paths or settlement spots for opponents while maintaining growth.
- **Pre-defined Decision Trees**: Temporarily hard-code a simple decision tree for strategy execution, emphasizing actions like:
  - If Victory Points >= threshold, prioritize defensive moves.
  - Else, expand aggressively towards high VP goals.

---

### 4. Integrating Game-Specific Heuristics to Guide the LLM
Provide the LLM with board knowledge by embedding heuristic calculations into the prompt:
- **Heuristic Scoring in Prompts**: Add metrics like road potential, resource diversity, and opponent growth advantage:
  ```
  Heuristic Scores:
  - Settlement Value: {calculated_value}
  - City Upgrade Value: {calculated_value}
  - Road Extension Value: {calculated_value}
  Prioritize the action with the highest heuristic score.
  ```
- **Guided Options List**: For each action, append a descriptive note:
  ```
  Here are the actions ranked by value:
  - Action A (Heuristic Value: 15.2): This blocks Player 2's longest road and increases your resource income.
  - Action B (Heuristic Value: 14.5): Upgrades a settlement to a city for 2 VP gain.
  ```

---

### 5. Benchmarking LLM Performance Against Rule-Based Logic
Establish a structured evaluation method to measure LLM's decision performance:
- **Simulated Competitive Runs**: Pair LLM-based FooPlayer with deterministic or AlphaBetaPlayer and track metrics (wins, VPs, strategic goals).
- **Monte Carlo Testing**: Run thousands of simulations where the LLM's actions are compared against a preset rule engine's results to assess decision quality in various scenarios.
- **Action Matching**: Create a dataset of optimal moves in given scenarios (based on historical game trends or AlphaBetaPlayer’s performances) to compare how often LLM decisions align with the "ground truth."
- **Score Weighting Metrics**:
  - Victory Point Contribution: Percentage of decisions that lead directly to VP gain.
  - Opponent Blocking: Success rate in disrupting opponent strategies.
  - Resource Utilization: Effective use of collected resources to maximize VP.
  
---

### Next Steps:
If necessary, prioritize implementing improved fallback mechanisms and basic decision trees first to ensure immediate competitiveness. Gradually integrate advanced decision-making systems via guided prompts and heuristic evaluations as LLM refinement continues.

END STRATEGY.================================== Ai Message ==================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Transition FooPlayer into a competitive player over the next 5 iterations by leveraging enhanced strategy, including heuristic reinforcement, refined LLM prompts, and deterministic fallback mechanisms, and targeting measurable improvements in average VP and win rates.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Implement **segmented contextual prompting** and heuristic-enhanced decision-making into the LLM integration (as per Strategy 1 and 4). Additionally, integrate a **ranked action hierarchy** as a fallback mechanism (Strategy 2).

CHOSEN AGENT: CODER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:  
Modify the `decide` method of `FooPlayer.py` to achieve the following:

1. **Refined LLM Prompt**: 
   - Update the `_build_prompt` function to use **segmented contextual prompting**. Include headers that describe the game state, available resources, and strategic goals. Example structure:
     ```
     Current Game State:
     - Player Stats: {resources}, {settlements}, {cities}, VP: {victory_points}
     - Opponent Stats: {opponent resources/blockades}, etc.
     Goal: Maximize VP while taking advantage of the current game state.
     Available Actions: {list of formatted playable actions}
     Respond with:
     Action: {Selected optimal action}
     Justification: {Reasoning behind the action choice}
     ```

2. **Heuristic Context Integration**:
   - In the `_build_prompt` method, compute heuristic scores (e.g., settlement value, city upgrade value, road extension value) for each action. Integrate these scores into the prompt to help the LLM make better decisions.

3. **Fallback Mechanism**:
   - Enhance `_parse_llm_response` to implement a **ranked action hierarchy** fallback mechanism when the LLM output is invalid or ambiguous. Example hierarchy:
     - Priority Order: Build City > Build Settlement > Build Road > End Turn.
     - If a valid option matching the LLM response is not found, return the first valid action in this priority order.

4. **Logging**:
   - Improve logging to capture the heuristic scores, the LLM prompt, its raw response, and the fallback decision (when necessary) for post-game analysis.

Once complete, test the updated `FooPlayer.py`, run games, and report the results.================================ Human Message =================================

CODER

### Changes Made:
1. **Refined LLM Prompt Construction**:
   - Enhanced the `_build_prompt` function to use **segmented contextual prompting** with detailed headers for game state, player stats, opponent stats, and available actions.
   - Integrated **heuristic scores** for each action into the prompt to guide the LLM decision-making.

2. **Heuristic Computation Method**:
   - Added a `_compute_heuristic_scores` helper method to assign heuristic values to each action based on action type (e.g., city-building prioritized over road-building).

3. **Improved Parsing Logic**:
   - Enhanced `_parse_llm_response` to return a matching action from the LLM response, or delegate to the fallback mechanism if no match is found.

4. **Ranked Fallback Mechanism**:
   - Implemented `_fallback_action` to evaluate actions in a priority order: Build City > Build Settlement > Build Road > End Turn.
   - Default to the first action only when no prioritized options exist.

5. **Logging**:
   - Added print statements throughout to capture key debugging information:
     - The LLM prompt.
     - Heuristic scores of actions.
     - The LLM's raw response.
     - Logs for fallback mechanism use.

6. **Error Handling Enhancements**:
   - Integrated robust exception handling in the `decide` method for LLM failures, with clear logging of fallbacks.

### Notes for the Next Iteration:
- Tune the **heuristic scores** if the LLM's decisions align poorly with optimal strategies.
- Monitor how well the LLM responds to the enhanced prompt structure during testing.
- Evaluate the fallback mechanism's efficiency in comparison to the LLM's responses.

### Testing Recommendations:
- Focus on scenarios requiring diverse strategic goals (e.g., blocking opponent moves, building towards Largest Army).
- Analyze logs for patterns in ambiguous or ineffective LLM responses, and refine prompts or fallback heuristics accordingly.

AttributeError: 'Game' object has no attribute 'get_player_resources'================================ Human Message =================================

After Running The New foo_player.py Player, Here is my analysis and findings:

### Syntax Error Details:
- **Error Message**: `AttributeError: 'Game' object has no attribute 'get_player_resources'`
- **Exact Line Number**: Line 84 in `foo_player.py`
- **Exact Line of Code**: `resources=str(game.get_player_resources(Color.BLUE)),  # Example method to get resources`

### Root Cause:
The method `get_player_resources` is being called on the `Game` object, but it does not exist in the `Game` class, leading to an `AttributeError`. This indicates a mismatch between the game's API and the implementation in `foo_player.py`.

### Impact:
The syntax error prevents the game from running, and thus no game results were recorded for this evolution.

Let me know if you need anything else!================================== Ai Message ==================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Refactor FooPlayer to work seamlessly with the Catanatron API while continuing to enhance strategic decision-making via heuristic integration and LLM refinement. Achieve compatibility and avoid critical runtime errors in the next evolution to allow for testing and evaluation.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Resolve the `AttributeError` by ensuring that `foo_player.py` uses valid methods from the Catanatron `Game` class for retrieving player resources and other game state data. Validate the compatibility of all API calls in the `_build_prompt` method.

CHOSEN AGENT: RESEARCHER

AGENT OBJECTIVE: 
Identify the correct way to access the following game state information from the Catanatron API:
1. Player resources (e.g., wood, brick, grain, etc.) for a specific color (e.g., `Color.BLUE`).
2. Obtain other player and game statistics that might be relevant for building the LLM prompt (e.g., settlements, cities, roads, VP).
3. Provide a list of valid Game API methods and properties that could be helpful for efficiently querying such state details.

Ensure that the information provided directly addresses the API compatibility issues in `foo_player.py`.================================ Human Message =================================

RESEARCH:

#### Key Information on Accessing Game State Using Catanatron API

**1. Accessing Player Resources**
To retrieve resources (e.g., wood, brick, grain, etc.) for a specific player:
- Use the `get_player_freqdeck(state, color)` function, which provides the player's resource frequency deck.
  ```python
  from catanatron.state_functions import get_player_freqdeck
  player_resources = get_player_freqdeck(state, Color.BLUE)
  ```
- `player_num_resource_cards(state, color, resource)` can query the count for specific resources:
  ```python
  from catanatron.state_functions import player_num_resource_cards
  wood_count = player_num_resource_cards(state, Color.BLUE, "WOOD")
  ```

**2. Accessing Player and Game Statistics**
For settlements, cities, roads, and VP:
- **Settlements**: Use `get_player_buildings(state, color, "SETTLEMENT")` to retrieve settlement IDs of a player:
  ```python
  from catanatron.state_functions import get_player_buildings
  settlements = get_player_buildings(state, Color.BLUE, "SETTLEMENT")
  ```
- **Cities**: Similarly invoke `get_player_buildings(state, color, "CITY")` for city IDs:
  ```python
  cities = get_player_buildings(state, Color.BLUE, "CITY")
  ```
- **Roads Available**: Check roads available using state data:
  ```python
  player_key = player_key(state, Color.BLUE)
  roads_available = state.player_state[f"{player_key}_ROADS_AVAILABLE"]
  ```
- **Victory Points**: Victory points can be checked via:
  ```python
  victory_points = state.player_state[f"{player_key}_ACTUAL_VICTORY_POINTS"]
  ```

**3. General Game State Statistics**
The class `Game` contains the main API-level functions for interacting with game state, including:
- `play_tick()` to advance the game state.
- `winning_color()` to retrieve the player currently winning the game.
- `state.playable_actions` to list the valid actions at the current step.

```python
winning_player = game.winning_color()
playable_options = game.state.playable_actions
```

#### List of Useful Methods and Properties in Game API:
Valid methods within the `Game` class and associated functions:
- `get_player_freqdeck(state, color)` – Retrieves player's resources.
- `player_num_resource_cards(state, color, resource)` – Gets the count for specific resources.
- `player_key(state, color)` – Returns string key for player state.
- `get_player_buildings(state, color, building_type)` – Retrieves player's settlements/cities.
- `state.playable_actions` – Provides the currently executable actions.
- `game.play_tick()` – Advances game state one step.
- `game.winning_color()` – Returns the winning color/player.
- `state.colors` – Lists the colors in the game.

**References:**
1. `catanatron_core/catanatron/game.py` - Contains the Game class and `play_tick`, `winning_color`, `state.playable_actions`.
2. `catanatron_core/catanatron/models/player.py` - Includes player model and decision-making classes.
3. `catanatron_core/catanatron/models/enums.py` - Defines resources, colors, and action types.
4. `catanatron_core/catanatron/models/actions.py` - Includes `get_player_freqdeck`, `player_num_resource_cards`, and `get_player_buildings`.

END RESEARCH.================================== Ai Message ==================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Ensure functionality and compatibility of FooPlayer with the Catanatron API while strengthening the LLM decision-making mechanism in a way that improves strategic performance over the next 5 iterations.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Integrate valid Catanatron API calls into `foo_player.py`'s `_build_prompt` method to fetch relevant game data like resources, settlements, cities, roads, and victory points, and resolve the current `AttributeError` preventing gameplay.

CHOSEN AGENT: CODER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:  
Resolve the `AttributeError` by replacing invalid calls in `foo_player.py` with Catanatron-compatible API calls as outlined in the research:

1. **Resources**:
   - Replace `game.get_player_resources(Color.BLUE)` with `get_player_freqdeck(state, Color.BLUE)` to fetch all resources for FooPlayer.
   - Use `player_num_resource_cards(state, Color.BLUE, resource)` to query specific resource counts.

2. **Settlements and Cities**:
   - Replace invalid calls for settlements/cities with:
     ```python
     get_player_buildings(state, Color.BLUE, "SETTLEMENT")
     get_player_buildings(state, Color.BLUE, "CITY")
     ```

3. **Victory Points and Roads**:
   - Retrieve victory points using:
     ```python
     vp = state.player_state[player_key(state, Color.BLUE) + "_ACTUAL_VICTORY_POINTS"]
     ```
   - Roads remaining:
     ```python
     roads_available = state.player_state[player_key(state, Color.BLUE) + "_ROADS_AVAILABLE"]
     ```

4. **General Updates to `_build_prompt`**:
   - Adjust the prompt to include all valid game stats, ensuring Catanatron API calls function.
   - Include resource counts, settlements, cities, roads, and VP in the formatted prompt structure.

5. **Debugging and Validation**:
   - Add logging to verify data retrieval accuracy during gameplay for resources, actions, and VP.
   - Run a test evolution to confirm the absence of runtime errors.

Update the code to reflect these changes and provide detailed debug logs during testing for validation.================================ Human Message =================================

   - Substituted `game.get_player_resources(Color.BLUE)` with `get_player_freqdeck(state, Color.BLUE)` to correctly fetch resources.
   - Similar replacements made for settlements, cities, victory points, and roads using valid Catanatron API functions: 
     - `get_player_buildings(state, Color.BLUE, "SETTLEMENT")` and `get_player_buildings(state, Color.BLUE, "CITY")` for settlements and cities.
     - Victory points accessed via `state.player_state[f"{player_key(state, Color.BLUE)}_ACTUAL_VICTORY_POINTS"]`.
     - Roads available via `state.player_state[f"{player_key(state, Color.BLUE)}_ROADS_AVAILABLE"]`.

2. **Updated `_build_prompt` Method**:
   - Included new resource and state-fetching methods in the prompt template.
   - Enhanced formatting to make the prompt explainable and consistent with the desired LLM input structure.

3. **Improved Compatibility**:
   - Refactored the game state integration in `_build_prompt` to align with valid methods reliably compatible with the API.

4. **Debugging Enhancements**:
   - Added detailed logging via print statements to verify accurate state data retrieval during gameplay (resources, settlements, cities, heuristic scores).
   - Included error handling for invalid or mismatched LLM responses.

### Notes for the Next Iteration:
- Test how well the new prompt structure works with the LLM's decision-making.
- Monitor logs for resource/state-fetch accuracy and potential mismatches between heuristic scores and LLM responses.

### Testing Recommendations:
- Verify that resources, settlements, cities, and other player stats from the state align with the game's current state through debugging outputs.
- Check if the fallback mechanism handles invalid or ambiguous LLM responses efficiently.

After Running The New foo_player.py Player, Here is my analysis and findings:

### Scores of FooPlayer:
- Wins: 0  
- Average Victory Points (VP): 2.33  
- Average Settlements: 1.67  
- Average Cities: 0.33  
- Average Roads: 0.0  
- Average Largest Army: 0.0  
- Average Development VP: 0.0  

### Short Analysis of Game Output:
- **LLM Interaction**: The LLM responded consistently, but gameplay justification often involved executing mandatory or default actions (e.g., "ROLL" and "END TURN"), suggesting limited strategic depth.
- **Interesting Output**: The heuristic scoring mechanism categorizes actions clearly, but no significant changes to gameplay performance reflect deeper strategy execution.
- **Signs of Issue**: No roads or army development indicates repeated failure to invest strategically in growth areas, despite consistent heuristic scoring.

### Errors, Warnings, or Signs of Implementation Issues:
- **Strategic Weakness**: The absence of victories and poor metrics like roads and army raises concerns about the decision-making quality. 
- **Heuristic Misalignment**: High heuristic scores for actions like "BUILD_ROAD" occasionally appear in the logs but fail to translate into meaningful gameplay progression. 

Let me know if you need anything else!================================== Ai Message ==================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Enhance the decision-making of FooPlayer by refining the strategic priorities directly implemented in both the heuristic framework and LLM prompt responses. Aim to improve measurable metrics such as roads, army, and settlements while moving closer to achieving winning conditions over the next 5 iterations.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Address the strategic weaknesses by introducing a deeper integration of heuristic priorities into the fallback mechanism and improving the clarity in LLM prompt responses to focus on VP growth, road-building, and settlements.

CHOSEN AGENT: STRATEGIZER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:  
Generate 5 improved strategies to address the current shortcomings:
1. Improvements to heuristic scoring that prioritize growth areas (e.g., building roads, achieving Largest Army).
2. Suggestions to alter fallback mechanisms to emphasize strategic contributions (e.g., prioritize roads early-game or settlements near resource-heavy tiles).
3. Refined LLM prompt designs that explicitly guide actions toward VP growth and strategic dominance.
4. Ideas to balance resource accumulation and strategic investments (e.g., cities vs roads) to diversify objectives.
5. Approach to identifying action bottlenecks that lead to stagnation (e.g., repeated patterns of "END TURN" or inefficient action sequences).================================ Human Message =================================

STRATEGY:

### 1. Improvements to Heuristic Scoring
Enhance heuristic scoring to align with strategic growth objectives and quantify the value of actions more effectively:
- **VP-Oriented Scoring**: Add a multiplier for actions directly contributing to Victory Points (e.g., upgrading to cities or building settlements on high-value intersections).
  ```python
  if action.action_type == ActionType.BUILD_SETTLEMENT and action.location.resource_value > threshold:
      heuristic_scores[action] = 10 + action.location.resource_value
  elif action.action_type == ActionType.BUILD_CITY:
      heuristic_scores[action] = 15
  elif action.action_type == ActionType.BUILD_ROAD:
      heuristic_scores[action] = 5 + len(connected_resources)
  ```
- **Dynamic Game Stage Consideration**: Assign higher scores to actions like building roads or settlements in the early game, shifting to cities and army card purchases in later stages based on available resources and board state.
- **Opponent Disruption**: Include metrics for actions that block opponents’ extensions or resource monopolies, such as cutting off road expansions.

---

### 2. Fallback Mechanism Adjustments
Revise the fallback mechanism to prioritize actions that align with broader strategic objectives:
- **Early-Game Priorities**:
  1. **Roads**: Emphasize road-building to expand quickly and secure settlement sites early (calculate heuristic road priority based on proximity to key tiles, e.g., 8/6/9 tiles).
  2. **Settlements**: Focus on openings that increase resource diversity and resource flow.
  ```python
  if len(settlements) < 3 and ActionType.BUILD_SETTLEMENT in actions:
      return next(action for action in actions if action.action_type == ActionType.BUILD_SETTLEMENT)
  ```
- **Late-Game Priorities**:
   - Transition to cities or army card purchases while only building roads/settlements to secure Longest Road or block opponents.
- **Secondary Metrics**:
   - Consider an aggregate utility metric (e.g., resource spillover from connected tiles) to decide between fallback paths.

---

### 3. Refined LLM Prompt Design
Re-orient the LLM prompt to place greater emphasis on VP growth and strategic objectives:
- **Structured Guidance**:
  ```
  You are tasked with growing Victory Points (VP) towards winning conditions. Prioritize actions that directly lead to VP growth (e.g., building settlements/cities or creating roads if expanding settlements is possible). Additionally, consider blocking opponents’ expansion and achieving Longest Road or Largest Army. Here are the factors to consider:
  - VP contributions: How does this action increase Victory Points?
  - Resource optimization: Does this action improve resource variety or frequency?
  - Opponent impact: Does this action hinder opponents?
  ```
- **Action Context and Justification**: Force the LLM to evaluate and justify its decision explicitly with VP and strategic metrics as criteria:
  ```
  Action: {Chosen Action}
  VP Contribution: {Describe how this action contributes to Victory Points or other winning conditions (Longest Road, Largest Army, etc.)}
  Strategic Justification: {Explain why this action is optimal in your current state.}
  ```

---

### 4. Balancing Resource Accumulation and Strategic Investments
Introduce a dynamic system to balance competing objectives like upgrading cities versus building roads:
- **Resource Thresholds**:
   - Maintain a minimum resource reserve (e.g., 3 bricks and 3 wood) for road-building during the early game.
   - Shift to reserving ore and wheat when cities are needed in the late game.
  ```python
  if resources['brick'] > 2 and resources['wood'] > 2 and ActionType.BUILD_ROAD in actions:
      return build_road_action
  elif resources['ore'] > 3 and resources['wheat'] > 2 and ActionType.BUILD_CITY in actions:
      return build_city_action
  ```
- **Investment Diversification**:
   - Build roads as placeholders if resources for settlements or cities are insufficient, keeping future options open.
   - Introduce a trigger to prioritize development cards if no immediate high-value options exist.

---

### 5. Identifying Bottlenecks and Inefficiencies
Implement mechanisms to evaluate and eliminate stagnation in decision-making:
- **Action Tracking**:
  - Track patterns of repetitive actions (e.g., 3 consecutive END TURN actions) and trigger specific re-evaluations for resource optimization or blocking moves.
  - Introduce a "resource stall threshold": If surplus resources accumulate beyond a predefined number, focus on spending them, even on sub-optimal actions.
- **Post-Action Evaluation**:
  - After every game session, log actions with their outcomes (e.g., Did this action result in VP gain or resource improvement?).
  - Use decision heatmaps to identify action sequences that correlate with stagnation (e.g., prolonged road-building with no settlements).
- **Dynamic Decision Adjustment**:
  - Adjust scoring to aggressively penalize repetitive non-contributory actions.
  ```python
  if "END TURN" repeats more than twice:
      print(f"Repeated END TURN actions detected. Prioritizing an alternative action.")
      # Force expansion or development actions here.
  ```

---

### Next Steps:
1. Prioritize enhancing heuristic scoring to drive better early-game performance.
2. Adjust fallback mechanisms to emphasize forward-looking strategies like settlement preparation.
3. Integrate bottleneck detection mechanisms for iteration feedback and adapt the LLM query structure for immediate impact.

END STRATEGY.================================== Ai Message ==================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Implement a strategy that improves both early and late-game decision-making for FooPlayer through advanced heuristics, adjusted fallback mechanisms, and refined LLM prompts, achieving measurable improvements in metrics such as roads, settlements, and victory points.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Integrate enhanced heuristic scoring and dynamic fallback priorities into the decision flow while refining LLM responses for strategic action selection, focusing on VP growth and efficient resource use.

CHOSEN AGENT: CODER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:  
Modify FooPlayer to implement the strategies outlined in the five key areas. Specifically:

1. **Enhance Heuristic Scoring**:
   - Add multipliers for actions directly contributing to Victory Points, such as settlement building and city upgrading.
   - Dynamically adjust scores based on the game stage (early vs. late-game priorities), prioritizing roads and settlements early while focusing on VP-heavy actions late.

2. **Dynamic Fallback Mechanism**:
   - Revise the fallback mechanism to focus on early-game expansion via roads and settlements as placeholders for resource diversity and VP accumulation.
   - Later transition fallback logic to VP-centric actions like city upgrades and development cards.

3. **Refined LLM Prompt**:
   - Update the LLM prompt to emphasize VP growth explicitly.
   - Demand justification for actions based on Victory Points and strategic blocking of opponents.

4. **Resource Threshold Balancing**:
   - Introduce logic for maintaining resource reserves and diversifying investments based on available actions.
   - Trigger placeholder actions like road-building when strategic objectives are temporarily unattainable.

5. **Action Bottleneck Detection**:
   - Implement tracking logic for repetitive unproductive actions (e.g., repeated "END TURN").
   - Adjust decision scoring to discourage stagnation, forcing resource spending or defensive actions when necessary.

Make necessary modifications to the `decide` method and auxiliary functions like `_build_prompt` and `heuristic_scores`. Run a test iteration post-implementation to ensure that the changes positively impact FooPlayer performance.================================ Human Message =================================

   - Adjusted scores dynamically based on roads remaining and game phase.

2. **Dynamic Fallback Priorities**:
   - Modified `_fallback_action` to prioritize actions strategically based on early vs. late-game aims.
   - Incorporated a priority order that promotes building cities, settlements, and roads.

3. **Refined LLM Prompt**:
   - Expanded the prompt to focus on VP, resource diversity, and opponent impact.
   - Included heuristic scores for LLM guidance and decision alignment.

4. **Improved Error and Response Handling**:
   - Enhanced `_parse_llm_response` to handle ambiguous LLM outputs.
   - Included detailed print logs during fallback decisions.

### Next Steps:
- Test the updated `FooPlayer` against increasingly challenging opponents to evaluate performance.
- Monitor logs, especially during fallback actions, for adjustments to scoring weights or LLM alignment.
- Incrementally refine heuristic values and prompt details based on test outcomes.

After Running The New foo_player.py Player, Here is my analysis and findings:

### Scores of FooPlayer:
- Wins: 0  
- Average Victory Points (VP): 2.6666666666666665  
- Average Settlements: 1.3333333333333333  
- Average Cities: 0.6666666666666666  
- Average Roads: 0.0  
- Average Largest Army: 0.0  
- Average Development VP: 0.0  

### Short Analysis of Game Output:
- **Repetitive Logs**: Multiple instances of LLM responses defaulting to basic actions such as "ROLL" and "END TURN," with justifications suggesting limited strategic depth. Example: "Rolling is necessary to progress the game state."
- **Neutral Heuristic Scoring**: Actions often evaluated with a low heuristic score (`1`). This indicates the heuristic system fails to differentiate between strategic actions.
- **Misalignment**: High-priority actions like "BUILD_CITY" or "BUILD_SETTLEMENT" seem underutilized, despite occasional high heuristic scores visible in logs. 

### Errors, Warnings, or Signs of Implementation Issues:
- **LLM Integration Weakness**: Responses imply poor decision quality by prioritizing roll/end-turn actions excessively. This indicates the prompt design and parsing mechanisms need refinement.
- **Strategic Gaps**: Failure to build roads or utilize army resources, even across multiple turns, suggests severe strategic deficiencies. The game log reinforces these gaps.
- **Warning**: Logs frequently state "Fallback mechanism applied," implying reliance on basic action prioritization rather than effective LLM outputs.

Let me know if you need anything else!================================== Ai Message ==================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Improve FooPlayer’s strategic depth by refining heuristic accuracy, enhancing LLM prompts to advocate stronger strategic actions, and reducing reliance on the fallback mechanism. Focus on measurable improvements in roads, settlements, and cities over the next 5 iterations.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Address the strategic misalignment by:
1. Refactoring heuristics to better differentiate and prioritize optimal actions (e.g., building roads, settlements, and cities).
2. Revising the LLM prompt design to explicitly prioritize non-default, VP-centric, and impactful actions.
3. Adjusting the fallback mechanism to penalize repetitive default actions and ensure meaningful progression.

CHOSEN AGENT: STRATEGIZER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:  
Provide 5 specific refinements or new strategies to improve FooPlayer’s decision-making system, focusing on the following:
1. How to recalibrate heuristic scoring to strongly favor foundational growth actions like roads and settlements early on.
2. Techniques to adjust prompt design to directly steer the LLM away from repetitive or low-value default actions.
3. Criteria for dynamically detecting high-impact actions (strategic bottlenecks or game pivots) and encouraging the LLM or fallback decision to prioritize them.
4. Hybrid mechanisms blending determinate strategic templates for fallback actions alongside heuristic-driven flexibility.
5. Methods to evaluate and tune the heuristic scoring weights and LLM response handling over multiple evolutions, ensuring consistent improvement in strategic metrics.================================ Human Message =================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Develop a robust strategy execution mechanism that effectively leverages the LLM for decision-making. The aim is to improve FooPlayer's win count and strategic metrics, including roads, cities, and army contributions, while ensuring VP increases consistently over the iterations.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Address the LLM integration issue by refining the prompt construction in `_build_prompt` and improving the parsing logic in `_parse_llm_response`. Ensure valid and actionable responses are obtained and utilized for strategic decision-making.

CHOSEN AGENT: STRATEGIZER

AGENT OBJECTIVE: 
The LLM responses are ambiguous or invalid, causing the FooPlayer to revert to default fallback actions. This suggests that the strategy design or LLM integration is insufficiently aligned with achieving optimal gameplay outcomes. 

Please provide 5 new strategy options that could address these key deficiencies:
1. How to design prompts to make the LLM understand the game state and prioritize optimal actions more effectively.
2. Ideas for alternative fallback mechanisms if the LLM fails to provide valid responses.
3. Strategies to temporarily compete with AlphaBetaPlayer while testing LLM refinement, using deterministic or semi-deterministic rules.
4. Methods of integrating game-specific heuristics to guide the LLM's responses.
5. Suggestions for benchmarking the LLM's decision-making quality against predefined rule-based logic. 

================================== Ai Message ==================================

STRATEGY:

### 1. Designing Effective Prompts
The LLM query prompt construction should be more specific and structured to guide LLM decision-making effectively:
- **Segmented Contextual Prompting**: Break down the game state into key elements like resource availability, victory point progression, and opponent analysis. Use explicit headers, such as:
  ```
  Current Game State:
  - Player Stats: {resources}, {road_length}, {settlements}, {cities}, etc.
  - Opponent Stats: {resource_blockades}, {army_strength}, etc.
  - Goal: Maximize VP by using optimal actions considering available resources and the board state.
  ```
- **Action Explanation Request**: Explicitly require the LLM to provide a rationale for its decision:
  ```
  Respond with the optimal action and briefly justify your reasoning (e.g., maximizing resource gain or blocking opponent's road expansion).
  Example response structure:
  Action: {Chosen Action}
  Justification: {Rationale for Decision}
  ```

---

### 2. Alternative Fallback Mechanisms
Introduce enhanced fallback strategies when LLM returns invalid or ambiguous responses:
- **Priority Filtering**: Analyze the playable actions and prioritize the highest-value action types based on static strategic criteria:
  ```python
  if ActionType.BUILD_CITY in [action.action_type for action in playable_actions]:
      return next(action for action in playable_actions if action.action_type == ActionType.BUILD_CITY)
  ```
- **Deterministic Action Flow**: Create a ranked hierarchy of action preferences:
  1. Build City
  2. Build Settlement
  3. Build Road
  4. End Turn
  When the LLM fails, actions are chosen following this hierarchy.

---

### 3. Strategies to Compete With AlphaBetaPlayer During Testing
To reduce dependency on the LLM when aiming for immediate competitiveness:
- **Simplistic Economic Strategy**: Implement deterministic rules to prioritize resource gathering and expansion, focusing on settlement and city building to optimize resource production.
- **Blocking Mechanism**: Develop routines to block high-value paths or settlement spots for opponents while maintaining growth.
- **Pre-defined Decision Trees**: Temporarily hard-code a simple decision tree for strategy execution, emphasizing actions like:
  - If Victory Points >= threshold, prioritize defensive moves.
  - Else, expand aggressively towards high VP goals.

---

### 4. Integrating Game-Specific Heuristics to Guide the LLM
Provide the LLM with board knowledge by embedding heuristic calculations into the prompt:
- **Heuristic Scoring in Prompts**: Add metrics like road potential, resource diversity, and opponent growth advantage:
  ```
  Heuristic Scores:
  - Settlement Value: {calculated_value}
  - City Upgrade Value: {calculated_value}
  - Road Extension Value: {calculated_value}
  Prioritize the action with the highest heuristic score.
  ```
- **Guided Options List**: For each action, append a descriptive note:
  ```
  Here are the actions ranked by value:
  - Action A (Heuristic Value: 15.2): This blocks Player 2's longest road and increases your resource income.
  - Action B (Heuristic Value: 14.5): Upgrades a settlement to a city for 2 VP gain.
  ```

### 5. Benchmarking LLM Performance Against Rule-Based Logic
Establish a structured evaluation method to measure LLM's decision performance:
- **Simulated Competitive Runs**: Pair LLM-based FooPlayer with deterministic or AlphaBetaPlayer and track metrics (wins, VPs, strategic goals).
- **Monte Carlo Testing**: Run thousands of simulations where the LLM's actions are compared against a preset rule engine's results to assess decision quality in various scenarios.
- **Action Matching**: Create a dataset of optimal moves in given scenarios (based on historical game trends or AlphaBetaPlayer’s performances) to compare how often LLM decisions align with the "ground truth."
- **Score Weighting Metrics**:
  - Victory Point Contribution: Percentage of decisions that lead directly to VP gain.
  - Opponent Blocking: Success rate in disrupting opponent strategies.
  - Resource Utilization: Effective use of collected resources to maximize VP.
  
---

### Next Steps:
If necessary, prioritize implementing improved fallback mechanisms and basic decision trees first to ensure immediate competitiveness. Gradually integrate advanced decision-making systems via guided prompts and heuristic evaluations as LLM refinement continues.

END STRATEGY.================================ Human Message =================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Enhance the decision-making of FooPlayer by refining the strategic priorities directly implemented in both the heuristic framework and LLM prompt responses. Aim to improve measurable metrics such as roads, army, and settlements while moving closer to achieving winning conditions over the next 5 iterations.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Address the strategic weaknesses by introducing a deeper integration of heuristic priorities into the fallback mechanism and improving the clarity in LLM prompt responses to focus on VP growth, road-building, and settlements.

CHOSEN AGENT: STRATEGIZER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:  
Generate 5 improved strategies to address the current shortcomings:
1. Improvements to heuristic scoring that prioritize growth areas (e.g., building roads, achieving Largest Army).
2. Suggestions to alter fallback mechanisms to emphasize strategic contributions (e.g., prioritize roads early-game or settlements near resource-heavy tiles).
3. Refined LLM prompt designs that explicitly guide actions toward VP growth and strategic dominance.
4. Ideas to balance resource accumulation and strategic investments (e.g., cities vs roads) to diversify objectives.
5. Approach to identifying action bottlenecks that lead to stagnation (e.g., repeated patterns of "END TURN" or inefficient action sequences).================================== Ai Message ==================================

STRATEGY:

### 1. Improvements to Heuristic Scoring
Enhance heuristic scoring to align with strategic growth objectives and quantify the value of actions more effectively:
- **VP-Oriented Scoring**: Add a multiplier for actions directly contributing to Victory Points (e.g., upgrading to cities or building settlements on high-value intersections).
  ```python
  if action.action_type == ActionType.BUILD_SETTLEMENT and action.location.resource_value > threshold:
      heuristic_scores[action] = 10 + action.location.resource_value
  elif action.action_type == ActionType.BUILD_CITY:
      heuristic_scores[action] = 15
  elif action.action_type == ActionType.BUILD_ROAD:
      heuristic_scores[action] = 5 + len(connected_resources)
  ```
- **Dynamic Game Stage Consideration**: Assign higher scores to actions like building roads or settlements in the early game, shifting to cities and army card purchases in later stages based on available resources and board state.
- **Opponent Disruption**: Include metrics for actions that block opponents’ extensions or resource monopolies, such as cutting off road expansions.

---

### 2. Fallback Mechanism Adjustments
Revise the fallback mechanism to prioritize actions that align with broader strategic objectives:
- **Early-Game Priorities**:
  1. **Roads**: Emphasize road-building to expand quickly and secure settlement sites early (calculate heuristic road priority based on proximity to key tiles, e.g., 8/6/9 tiles).
  2. **Settlements**: Focus on openings that increase resource diversity and resource flow.
  ```python
  if len(settlements) < 3 and ActionType.BUILD_SETTLEMENT in actions:
      return next(action for action in actions if action.action_type == ActionType.BUILD_SETTLEMENT)
  ```
- **Late-Game Priorities**:
   - Transition to cities or army card purchases while only building roads/settlements to secure Longest Road or block opponents.
- **Secondary Metrics**:
   - Consider an aggregate utility metric (e.g., resource spillover from connected tiles) to decide between fallback paths.

---

### 3. Refined LLM Prompt Design
Re-orient the LLM prompt to place greater emphasis on VP growth and strategic objectives:
- **Structured Guidance**:
  ```
  You are tasked with growing Victory Points (VP) towards winning conditions. Prioritize actions that directly lead to VP growth (e.g., building settlements/cities or creating roads if expanding settlements is possible). Additionally, consider blocking opponents’ expansion and achieving Longest Road or Largest Army. Here are the factors to consider:
  - VP contributions: How does this action increase Victory Points?
  - Resource optimization: Does this action improve resource variety or frequency?
  - Opponent impact: Does this action hinder opponents?
  ```
- **Action Context and Justification**: Force the LLM to evaluate and justify its decision explicitly with VP and strategic metrics as criteria:
  ```
  Action: {Chosen Action}
  VP Contribution: {Describe how this action contributes to Victory Points or other winning conditions (Longest Road, Largest Army, etc.)}
  Strategic Justification: {Explain why this action is optimal in your current state.}
  ```

---

### 4. Balancing Resource Accumulation and Strategic Investments
Introduce a dynamic system to balance competing objectives like upgrading cities versus building roads:
- **Resource Thresholds**:
   - Maintain a minimum resource reserve (e.g., 3 bricks and 3 wood) for road-building during the early game.
   - Shift to reserving ore and wheat when cities are needed in the late game.
  ```python
  if resources['brick'] > 2 and resources['wood'] > 2 and ActionType.BUILD_ROAD in actions:
      return build_road_action
  elif resources['ore'] > 3 and resources['wheat'] > 2 and ActionType.BUILD_CITY in actions:
      return build_city_action
  ```
- **Investment Diversification**:
   - Build roads as placeholders if resources for settlements or cities are insufficient, keeping future options open.
   - Introduce a trigger to prioritize development cards if no immediate high-value options exist.

---

### 5. Identifying Bottlenecks and Inefficiencies
Implement mechanisms to evaluate and eliminate stagnation in decision-making:
- **Action Tracking**:
  - Track patterns of repetitive actions (e.g., 3 consecutive END TURN actions) and trigger specific re-evaluations for resource optimization or blocking moves.
  - Introduce a "resource stall threshold": If surplus resources accumulate beyond a predefined number, focus on spending them, even on sub-optimal actions.
- **Post-Action Evaluation**:
  - After every game session, log actions with their outcomes (e.g., Did this action result in VP gain or resource improvement?).
  - Use decision heatmaps to identify action sequences that correlate with stagnation (e.g., prolonged road-building with no settlements).
- **Dynamic Decision Adjustment**:
  - Adjust scoring to aggressively penalize repetitive non-contributory actions.
  ```python
  if "END TURN" repeats more than twice:
      print(f"Repeated END TURN actions detected. Prioritizing an alternative action.")
      # Force expansion or development actions here.
  ```

---

### Next Steps:
1. Prioritize enhancing heuristic scoring to drive better early-game performance.
2. Adjust fallback mechanisms to emphasize forward-looking strategies like settlement preparation.
3. Integrate bottleneck detection mechanisms for iteration feedback and adapt the LLM query structure for immediate impact.

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Improve FooPlayer’s strategic depth by refining heuristic accuracy, enhancing LLM prompts to advocate stronger strategic actions, and reducing reliance on the fallback mechanism. Focus on measurable improvements in roads, settlements, and cities over the next 5 iterations.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Address the strategic misalignment by:
1. Refactoring heuristics to better differentiate and prioritize optimal actions (e.g., building roads, settlements, and cities).
2. Revising the LLM prompt design to explicitly prioritize non-default, VP-centric, and impactful actions.
3. Adjusting the fallback mechanism to penalize repetitive default actions and ensure meaningful progression.

CHOSEN AGENT: STRATEGIZER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:  
Provide 5 specific refinements or new strategies to improve FooPlayer’s decision-making system, focusing on the following:
1. How to recalibrate heuristic scoring to strongly favor foundational growth actions like roads and settlements early on.
2. Techniques to adjust prompt design to directly steer the LLM away from repetitive or low-value default actions.
3. Criteria for dynamically detecting high-impact actions (strategic bottlenecks or game pivots) and encouraging the LLM or fallback decision to prioritize them.
4. Hybrid mechanisms blending determinate strategic templates for fallback actions alongside heuristic-driven flexibility.
5. Methods to evaluate and tune the heuristic scoring weights and LLM response handling over multiple evolutions, ensuring consistent improvement in strategic metrics.================================== Ai Message ==================================

STRATEGY:

### 1. Recalibrating Heuristic Scoring for Early Foundational Growth
Refine the heuristic scoring system to prioritize foundational growth actions, particularly during the early game:
- **Dynamic Weight Adjustments for Game Stages**:
  - **Early Game**:
    - Roads: Score 10 (high priority for expansion).
    - Settlements: Score 8 (emphasize resource diversity and availability).
    - Cities: Score 5 (lower priority due to resource scarcity early on).
  - **Mid to Late Game**:
    - Settlements: Score 10 (needed for reaching VP thresholds).
    - Cities: Score 15 (maximize VP by converting settlements to cities).
    - Roads: Score 7 (focus on Longest Road or movement towards strategic settlement spots).  
- **Tile Resource Heuristic**:
  - Assign weighted scores to actions based on resource tile priority:
    - High-Value Tiles: Prioritize intersections with tiles like 6, 8 (ore/wheat bonuses), increasing the heuristic scores of these actions.
    ```python
    if action.action_type == ActionType.BUILD_SETTLEMENT and action.location.resource_value > 15:
        heuristic_scores[action] += 3  # Boost for high-value tiles
    ```
- **Disruption Consideration**:
  - Actions that block opponent growth (road connections or settlements) receive a bonus.

---

### 2. Adjusting Prompt Design to Guide the LLM Towards High-Impact Actions
Update the LLM prompt construction to explicitly penalize repetitive or low-value actions and focus on strategic, VP-driving goals:
- **Segmented Descriptions with Action Prioritization**:
  ```
  You are tasked with making the most impactful move in the Catanatron Minigame. Always prioritize actions with long-term strategic benefits over short-term results. Avoid repetitive, low-impact actions like ending turns without building to progress.
  
  Current Priorities:
  1. Expand settlements and roads for resource variety and VP growth.
  2. Upgrade settlements to cities to maximize VP.
  3. Act to hinder opponents’ expansion when possible.
  
  Consider the following heuristic scores and game state in your decision:
  ```
  - Add structured fields for each action to explicitly indicate their heuristic weight, stage relevance, and potential impact:
    ```
    Action: {Action}
    Heuristic Score: {Score}
    Stage Priority: {Early/Mid/Late Game Relevance}
    Impact: {How this action will improve VP or hinder opponents}
    ```

---

### 3. Dynamic Detection of High-Impact Actions (Bottlenecks or Game Pivots)
Introduce dynamic logic to identify and prioritize high-impact actions during pivotal game moments:
- **Bottleneck Identification**:
  - Detect signs of resource stagnation or unspent resources (e.g., excessive ore/wheat without city upgrades or brick/wood without roads/settlements).
  ```python
  if player_resources['brick'] >= 3 and player_resources['wood'] >= 3:
      heuristic_scores[ActionType.BUILD_ROAD] += 5  # Encourage spending surplus
  ```
  - Time-based triggers: Penalize repeated "END TURN" or fallback actions and boost the use of active building moves.
- **Strategic Pivot Boosting**:
  - Add bonuses to actions when triggered by game-specific pivots:
    - Longest Road: Encourage roads when near the threshold for Longest Road.
    - Largest Army: Prioritize development card purchases when competing for Largest Army or sabotaging opponents.
    ```python
    if current_army_size >= 2 and opponents_army_size <= current_army_size:
        heuristic_scores[action] += 4  # Edge out Largest Army
    ```

---

### 4. Hybrid Mechanisms for Fallback Actions
Redesign the fallback system to incorporate both deterministic templates and heuristic-driven flexibility:
- **Action Templates by Priority**:
  - Use deterministic logic based on game stage:
    - Early Game: Build roads and settlements to ensure resource coverage.
    - Mid-Late Game: Prioritize cities for VP growth or roads for Longest Road.
  ```python
  for action_type in ["BUILD_CITY", "BUILD_SETTLEMENT", "BUILD_ROAD"]:
      for action in playable_actions:
          if action.action_type == action_type and action meets_conditions:
              return action
  ```
- **Heuristic-Fallback Hybrid**:
  - If no deterministic action is suitable, rely on heuristic priorities derived from current state evaluations to make fallback decisions.
- **Penalty for Stagnation**:
  - Penalize fallback repetitions by gradually increasing the weight on impactful actions like settlement-building or resource diversity improvements.

---

### 5. Methods to Evaluate and Refine Heuristics and LLM Response Handling
Design a structured framework for tuning heuristics and refining LLM responses over multiple game iterations:
- **Performance Metrics**:
  - Track metrics such as VP growth per iteration, total roads/cities/settlements built, and resource efficiency (unused resources).
  - Correlate LLM responses and fallback heuristic effectiveness with game outcomes.
- **Iterative Weight Adjustment**:
  - Analyze N-game results to adjust heuristic weights dynamically:
    - If too many roads are built without follow-up settlements, reduce road priority.
    - If city upgrades lead to stagnation due to resource imbalances, shift the weighting back to settlements.
  ```python
  if settlements_built < expected_settlement_threshold:
      heuristic_weights['BUILD_SETTLEMENT'] += 2
  ```
- **Benchmarking Against Rule-Based Baselines**:
  - Compare LLM-driven decisions with predefined optimal or rule-based actions to evaluate alignment with strategic goals.
  - Use deviation scores to identify areas where LLM prompts need refinement (e.g., under-prioritizing Largest Army or Longest Road).

---

### Next Steps:
1. Begin recalibrating heuristic scores to reflect stage-specific priorities.
2. Implement the updated prompt design to explicitly guide LLM responses toward non-repetitive, VP-centric strategies.
3. Integrate fallback mechanisms with dynamic, bottleneck-based adjustments to address stagnation and repeated default actions.
4. Build tools for iterative heuristic tuning and response evaluation against predefined baselines.

END STRATEGY.================================== Ai Message ==================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Develop a robust strategy execution mechanism that effectively leverages the LLM for decision-making. The aim is to improve FooPlayer's win count and strategic metrics, including roads, cities, and army contributions, while ensuring VP increases consistently over the iterations.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Address the LLM integration issue by refining the prompt construction in `_build_prompt` and improving the parsing logic in `_parse_llm_response`. Ensure valid and actionable responses are obtained and utilized for strategic decision-making.

CHOSEN AGENT: STRATEGIZER

AGENT OBJECTIVE: 
The LLM responses are ambiguous or invalid, causing the FooPlayer to revert to default fallback actions. This suggests that the strategy design or LLM integration is insufficiently aligned with achieving optimal gameplay outcomes. 

Please provide 5 new strategy options that could address these key deficiencies:
1. How to design prompts to make the LLM understand the game state and prioritize optimal actions more effectively.
2. Ideas for alternative fallback mechanisms if the LLM fails to provide valid responses.
3. Strategies to temporarily compete with AlphaBetaPlayer while testing LLM refinement, using deterministic or semi-deterministic rules.
4. Methods of integrating game-specific heuristics to guide the LLM's responses.
5. Suggestions for benchmarking the LLM's decision-making quality against predefined rule-based logic.================================ Human Message =================================

STRATEGY:

### 1. Designing Effective Prompts
The LLM query prompt construction should be more specific and structured to guide LLM decision-making effectively:
- **Segmented Contextual Prompting**: Break down the game state into key elements like resource availability, victory point progression, and opponent analysis. Use explicit headers, such as:
  ```
  Current Game State:
  - Player Stats: {resources}, {road_length}, {settlements}, {cities}, etc.
  - Opponent Stats: {resource_blockades}, {army_strength}, etc.
  - Goal: Maximize VP by using optimal actions considering available resources and the board state.
  ```
- **Action Explanation Request**: Explicitly require the LLM to provide a rationale for its decision:
  ```
  Respond with the optimal action and briefly justify your reasoning (e.g., maximizing resource gain or blocking opponent's road expansion).
  Example response structure:
  Action: {Chosen Action}
  Justification: {Rationale for Decision}
  ```

---

### 2. Alternative Fallback Mechanisms
Introduce enhanced fallback strategies when LLM returns invalid or ambiguous responses:
- **Priority Filtering**: Analyze the playable actions and prioritize the highest-value action types based on static strategic criteria:
  ```python
  if ActionType.BUILD_CITY in [action.action_type for action in playable_actions]:
      return next(action for action in playable_actions if action.action_type == ActionType.BUILD_CITY)
  ```
- **Deterministic Action Flow**: Create a ranked hierarchy of action preferences:
  1. Build City
  2. Build Settlement
  3. Build Road
  4. End Turn
  When the LLM fails, actions are chosen following this hierarchy.

---

### 3. Strategies to Compete With AlphaBetaPlayer During Testing
To reduce dependency on the LLM when aiming for immediate competitiveness:
- **Simplistic Economic Strategy**: Implement deterministic rules to prioritize resource gathering and expansion, focusing on settlement and city building to optimize resource production.
- **Blocking Mechanism**: Develop routines to block high-value paths or settlement spots for opponents while maintaining growth.
- **Pre-defined Decision Trees**: Temporarily hard-code a simple decision tree for strategy execution, emphasizing actions like:
  - If Victory Points >= threshold, prioritize defensive moves.
  - Else, expand aggressively towards high VP goals.

---

### 4. Integrating Game-Specific Heuristics to Guide the LLM
Provide the LLM with board knowledge by embedding heuristic calculations into the prompt:
- **Heuristic Scoring in Prompts**: Add metrics like road potential, resource diversity, and opponent growth advantage:
  ```
  Heuristic Scores:
  - Settlement Value: {calculated_value}
  - City Upgrade Value: {calculated_value}
  - Road Extension Value: {calculated_value}
  Prioritize the action with the highest heuristic score.
  ```
- **Guided Options List**: For each action, append a descriptive note:
  ```
  Here are the actions ranked by value:
  - Action A (Heuristic Value: 15.2): This blocks Player 2's longest road and increases your resource income.
  - Action B (Heuristic Value: 14.5): Upgrades a settlement to a city for 2 VP gain.
  ```

---

### 5. Benchmarking LLM Performance Against Rule-Based Logic
Establish a structured evaluation method to measure LLM's decision performance:
- **Simulated Competitive Runs**: Pair LLM-based FooPlayer with deterministic or AlphaBetaPlayer and track metrics (wins, VPs, strategic goals).
- **Monte Carlo Testing**: Run thousands of simulations where the LLM's actions are compared against a preset rule engine's results to assess decision quality in various scenarios.
- **Action Matching**: Create a dataset of optimal moves in given scenarios (based on historical game trends or AlphaBetaPlayer’s performances) to compare how often LLM decisions align with the "ground truth."
- **Score Weighting Metrics**:
  - Victory Point Contribution: Percentage of decisions that lead directly to VP gain.
  - Opponent Blocking: Success rate in disrupting opponent strategies.
  - Resource Utilization: Effective use of collected resources to maximize VP.
  
---

### Next Steps:
If necessary, prioritize implementing improved fallback mechanisms and basic decision trees first to ensure immediate competitiveness. Gradually integrate advanced decision-making systems via guided prompts and heuristic evaluations as LLM refinement continues.

END STRATEGY.================================== Ai Message ==================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Transition FooPlayer into a competitive player over the next 5 iterations by leveraging enhanced strategy, including heuristic reinforcement, refined LLM prompts, and deterministic fallback mechanisms, and targeting measurable improvements in average VP and win rates.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Implement **segmented contextual prompting** and heuristic-enhanced decision-making into the LLM integration (as per Strategy 1 and 4). Additionally, integrate a **ranked action hierarchy** as a fallback mechanism (Strategy 2).

CHOSEN AGENT: CODER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:  
Modify the `decide` method of `FooPlayer.py` to achieve the following:

1. **Refined LLM Prompt**: 
   - Update the `_build_prompt` function to use **segmented contextual prompting**. Include headers that describe the game state, available resources, and strategic goals. Example structure:
     ```
     Current Game State:
     - Player Stats: {resources}, {settlements}, {cities}, VP: {victory_points}
     - Opponent Stats: {opponent resources/blockades}, etc.
     Goal: Maximize VP while taking advantage of the current game state.
     Available Actions: {list of formatted playable actions}
     Respond with:
     Action: {Selected optimal action}
     Justification: {Reasoning behind the action choice}
     ```

2. **Heuristic Context Integration**:
   - In the `_build_prompt` method, compute heuristic scores (e.g., settlement value, city upgrade value, road extension value) for each action. Integrate these scores into the prompt to help the LLM make better decisions.

3. **Fallback Mechanism**:
   - Enhance `_parse_llm_response` to implement a **ranked action hierarchy** fallback mechanism when the LLM output is invalid or ambiguous. Example hierarchy:
     - Priority Order: Build City > Build Settlement > Build Road > End Turn.
     - If a valid option matching the LLM response is not found, return the first valid action in this priority order.

4. **Logging**:
   - Improve logging to capture the heuristic scores, the LLM prompt, its raw response, and the fallback decision (when necessary) for post-game analysis.

Once complete, test the updated `FooPlayer.py`, run games, and report the results.================================ Human Message =================================

CODER

### Changes Made:
1. **Refined LLM Prompt Construction**:
   - Enhanced the `_build_prompt` function to use **segmented contextual prompting** with detailed headers for game state, player stats, opponent stats, and available actions.
   - Integrated **heuristic scores** for each action into the prompt to guide the LLM decision-making.

2. **Heuristic Computation Method**:
   - Added a `_compute_heuristic_scores` helper method to assign heuristic values to each action based on action type (e.g., city-building prioritized over road-building).

3. **Improved Parsing Logic**:
   - Enhanced `_parse_llm_response` to return a matching action from the LLM response, or delegate to the fallback mechanism if no match is found.

4. **Ranked Fallback Mechanism**:
   - Implemented `_fallback_action` to evaluate actions in a priority order: Build City > Build Settlement > Build Road > End Turn.
   - Default to the first action only when no prioritized options exist.

5. **Logging**:
   - Added print statements throughout to capture key debugging information:
     - The LLM prompt.
     - Heuristic scores of actions.
     - The LLM's raw response.
     - Logs for fallback mechanism use.

6. **Error Handling Enhancements**:
   - Integrated robust exception handling in the `decide` method for LLM failures, with clear logging of fallbacks.

### Notes for the Next Iteration:
- Tune the **heuristic scores** if the LLM's decisions align poorly with optimal strategies.
- Monitor how well the LLM responds to the enhanced prompt structure during testing.
- Evaluate the fallback mechanism's efficiency in comparison to the LLM's responses.

### Testing Recommendations:
- Focus on scenarios requiring diverse strategic goals (e.g., blocking opponent moves, building towards Largest Army).
- Analyze logs for patterns in ambiguous or ineffective LLM responses, and refine prompts or fallback heuristics accordingly.

AttributeError: 'Game' object has no attribute 'get_player_resources'================================ Human Message =================================

After Running The New foo_player.py Player, Here is my analysis and findings:

### Syntax Error Details:
- **Error Message**: `AttributeError: 'Game' object has no attribute 'get_player_resources'`
- **Exact Line Number**: Line 84 in `foo_player.py`
- **Exact Line of Code**: `resources=str(game.get_player_resources(Color.BLUE)),  # Example method to get resources`

### Root Cause:
The method `get_player_resources` is being called on the `Game` object, but it does not exist in the `Game` class, leading to an `AttributeError`. This indicates a mismatch between the game's API and the implementation in `foo_player.py`.

### Impact:
The syntax error prevents the game from running, and thus no game results were recorded for this evolution.

Let me know if you need anything else!================================== Ai Message ==================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Refactor FooPlayer to work seamlessly with the Catanatron API while continuing to enhance strategic decision-making via heuristic integration and LLM refinement. Achieve compatibility and avoid critical runtime errors in the next evolution to allow for testing and evaluation.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Resolve the `AttributeError` by ensuring that `foo_player.py` uses valid methods from the Catanatron `Game` class for retrieving player resources and other game state data. Validate the compatibility of all API calls in the `_build_prompt` method.

CHOSEN AGENT: RESEARCHER

AGENT OBJECTIVE: 
Identify the correct way to access the following game state information from the Catanatron API:
1. Player resources (e.g., wood, brick, grain, etc.) for a specific color (e.g., `Color.BLUE`).
2. Obtain other player and game statistics that might be relevant for building the LLM prompt (e.g., settlements, cities, roads, VP).
3. Provide a list of valid Game API methods and properties that could be helpful for efficiently querying such state details.

Ensure that the information provided directly addresses the API compatibility issues in `foo_player.py`.================================ Human Message =================================

RESEARCH:

#### Key Information on Accessing Game State Using Catanatron API

**1. Accessing Player Resources**
To retrieve resources (e.g., wood, brick, grain, etc.) for a specific player:
- Use the `get_player_freqdeck(state, color)` function, which provides the player's resource frequency deck.
  ```python
  from catanatron.state_functions import get_player_freqdeck
  player_resources = get_player_freqdeck(state, Color.BLUE)
  ```
- `player_num_resource_cards(state, color, resource)` can query the count for specific resources:
  ```python
  from catanatron.state_functions import player_num_resource_cards
  wood_count = player_num_resource_cards(state, Color.BLUE, "WOOD")
  ```

**2. Accessing Player and Game Statistics**
For settlements, cities, roads, and VP:
- **Settlements**: Use `get_player_buildings(state, color, "SETTLEMENT")` to retrieve settlement IDs of a player:
  ```python
  from catanatron.state_functions import get_player_buildings
  settlements = get_player_buildings(state, Color.BLUE, "SETTLEMENT")
  ```
- **Cities**: Similarly invoke `get_player_buildings(state, color, "CITY")` for city IDs:
  ```python
  cities = get_player_buildings(state, Color.BLUE, "CITY")
  ```
- **Roads Available**: Check roads available using state data:
  ```python
  player_key = player_key(state, Color.BLUE)
  roads_available = state.player_state[f"{player_key}_ROADS_AVAILABLE"]
  ```
- **Victory Points**: Victory points can be checked via:
  ```python
  victory_points = state.player_state[f"{player_key}_ACTUAL_VICTORY_POINTS"]
  ```

**3. General Game State Statistics**
The class `Game` contains the main API-level functions for interacting with game state, including:
- `play_tick()` to advance the game state.
- `winning_color()` to retrieve the player currently winning the game.
- `state.playable_actions` to list the valid actions at the current step.

```python
winning_player = game.winning_color()
playable_options = game.state.playable_actions
```

#### List of Useful Methods and Properties in Game API:
Valid methods within the `Game` class and associated functions:
- `get_player_freqdeck(state, color)` – Retrieves player's resources.
- `player_num_resource_cards(state, color, resource)` – Gets the count for specific resources.
- `player_key(state, color)` – Returns string key for player state.
- `get_player_buildings(state, color, building_type)` – Retrieves player's settlements/cities.
- `state.playable_actions` – Provides the currently executable actions.
- `game.play_tick()` – Advances game state one step.
- `game.winning_color()` – Returns the winning color/player.
- `state.colors` – Lists the colors in the game.

**References:**
1. `catanatron_core/catanatron/game.py` - Contains the Game class and `play_tick`, `winning_color`, `state.playable_actions`.
2. `catanatron_core/catanatron/models/player.py` - Includes player model and decision-making classes.
3. `catanatron_core/catanatron/models/enums.py` - Defines resources, colors, and action types.
4. `catanatron_core/catanatron/models/actions.py` - Includes `get_player_freqdeck`, `player_num_resource_cards`, and `get_player_buildings`.

END RESEARCH.================================== Ai Message ==================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Ensure functionality and compatibility of FooPlayer with the Catanatron API while strengthening the LLM decision-making mechanism in a way that improves strategic performance over the next 5 iterations.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Integrate valid Catanatron API calls into `foo_player.py`'s `_build_prompt` method to fetch relevant game data like resources, settlements, cities, roads, and victory points, and resolve the current `AttributeError` preventing gameplay.

CHOSEN AGENT: CODER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:  
Resolve the `AttributeError` by replacing invalid calls in `foo_player.py` with Catanatron-compatible API calls as outlined in the research:

1. **Resources**:
   - Replace `game.get_player_resources(Color.BLUE)` with `get_player_freqdeck(state, Color.BLUE)` to fetch all resources for FooPlayer.
   - Use `player_num_resource_cards(state, Color.BLUE, resource)` to query specific resource counts.

2. **Settlements and Cities**:
   - Replace invalid calls for settlements/cities with:
     ```python
     get_player_buildings(state, Color.BLUE, "SETTLEMENT")
     get_player_buildings(state, Color.BLUE, "CITY")
     ```

3. **Victory Points and Roads**:
   - Retrieve victory points using:
     ```python
     vp = state.player_state[player_key(state, Color.BLUE) + "_ACTUAL_VICTORY_POINTS"]
     ```
   - Roads remaining:
     ```python
     roads_available = state.player_state[player_key(state, Color.BLUE) + "_ROADS_AVAILABLE"]
     ```

4. **General Updates to `_build_prompt`**:
   - Adjust the prompt to include all valid game stats, ensuring Catanatron API calls function.
   - Include resource counts, settlements, cities, roads, and VP in the formatted prompt structure.

5. **Debugging and Validation**:
   - Add logging to verify data retrieval accuracy during gameplay for resources, actions, and VP.
   - Run a test evolution to confirm the absence of runtime errors.

Update the code to reflect these changes and provide detailed debug logs during testing for validation.================================ Human Message =================================

CODER

### Changes Made:
1. **Replaced Invalid API Calls**:
   - Substituted `game.get_player_resources(Color.BLUE)` with `get_player_freqdeck(state, Color.BLUE)` to correctly fetch resources.
   - Similar replacements made for settlements, cities, victory points, and roads using valid Catanatron API functions: 
     - `get_player_buildings(state, Color.BLUE, "SETTLEMENT")` and `get_player_buildings(state, Color.BLUE, "CITY")` for settlements and cities.
     - Victory points accessed via `state.player_state[f"{player_key(state, Color.BLUE)}_ACTUAL_VICTORY_POINTS"]`.
     - Roads available via `state.player_state[f"{player_key(state, Color.BLUE)}_ROADS_AVAILABLE"]`.

2. **Updated `_build_prompt` Method**:
   - Included new resource and state-fetching methods in the prompt template.
   - Enhanced formatting to make the prompt explainable and consistent with the desired LLM input structure.

3. **Improved Compatibility**:
   - Refactored the game state integration in `_build_prompt` to align with valid methods reliably compatible with the API.

4. **Debugging Enhancements**:
   - Added detailed logging via print statements to verify accurate state data retrieval during gameplay (resources, settlements, cities, heuristic scores).
   - Included error handling for invalid or mismatched LLM responses.

### Notes for the Next Iteration:
- Test how well the new prompt structure works with the LLM's decision-making.
- Monitor logs for resource/state-fetch accuracy and potential mismatches between heuristic scores and LLM responses.

### Testing Recommendations:
- Verify that resources, settlements, cities, and other player stats from the state align with the game's current state through debugging outputs.
- Check if the fallback mechanism handles invalid or ambiguous LLM responses efficiently.

After Running The New foo_player.py Player, Here is my analysis and findings:

### Scores of FooPlayer:
- Wins: 0  
- Average Victory Points (VP): 2.33  
- Average Settlements: 1.67  
- Average Cities: 0.33  
- Average Roads: 0.0  
- Average Largest Army: 0.0  
- Average Development VP: 0.0  

### Short Analysis of Game Output:
- **LLM Interaction**: The LLM responded consistently, but gameplay justification often involved executing mandatory or default actions (e.g., "ROLL" and "END TURN"), suggesting limited strategic depth.
- **Interesting Output**: The heuristic scoring mechanism categorizes actions clearly, but no significant changes to gameplay performance reflect deeper strategy execution.
- **Signs of Issue**: No roads or army development indicates repeated failure to invest strategically in growth areas, despite consistent heuristic scoring.

### Errors, Warnings, or Signs of Implementation Issues:
- **Strategic Weakness**: The absence of victories and poor metrics like roads and army raises concerns about the decision-making quality. 
- **Heuristic Misalignment**: High heuristic scores for actions like "BUILD_ROAD" occasionally appear in the logs but fail to translate into meaningful gameplay progression. 

Let me know if you need anything else!================================== Ai Message ==================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Enhance the decision-making of FooPlayer by refining the strategic priorities directly implemented in both the heuristic framework and LLM prompt responses. Aim to improve measurable metrics such as roads, army, and settlements while moving closer to achieving winning conditions over the next 5 iterations.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Address the strategic weaknesses by introducing a deeper integration of heuristic priorities into the fallback mechanism and improving the clarity in LLM prompt responses to focus on VP growth, road-building, and settlements.

CHOSEN AGENT: STRATEGIZER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:  
Generate 5 improved strategies to address the current shortcomings:
1. Improvements to heuristic scoring that prioritize growth areas (e.g., building roads, achieving Largest Army).
2. Suggestions to alter fallback mechanisms to emphasize strategic contributions (e.g., prioritize roads early-game or settlements near resource-heavy tiles).
3. Refined LLM prompt designs that explicitly guide actions toward VP growth and strategic dominance.
4. Ideas to balance resource accumulation and strategic investments (e.g., cities vs roads) to diversify objectives.
5. Approach to identifying action bottlenecks that lead to stagnation (e.g., repeated patterns of "END TURN" or inefficient action sequences).================================ Human Message =================================

STRATEGY:

### 1. Improvements to Heuristic Scoring
Enhance heuristic scoring to align with strategic growth objectives and quantify the value of actions more effectively:
- **VP-Oriented Scoring**: Add a multiplier for actions directly contributing to Victory Points (e.g., upgrading to cities or building settlements on high-value intersections).
  ```python
  if action.action_type == ActionType.BUILD_SETTLEMENT and action.location.resource_value > threshold:
      heuristic_scores[action] = 10 + action.location.resource_value
  elif action.action_type == ActionType.BUILD_CITY:
      heuristic_scores[action] = 15
  elif action.action_type == ActionType.BUILD_ROAD:
      heuristic_scores[action] = 5 + len(connected_resources)
  ```
- **Dynamic Game Stage Consideration**: Assign higher scores to actions like building roads or settlements in the early game, shifting to cities and army card purchases in later stages based on available resources and board state.
- **Opponent Disruption**: Include metrics for actions that block opponents’ extensions or resource monopolies, such as cutting off road expansions.

---

### 2. Fallback Mechanism Adjustments
Revise the fallback mechanism to prioritize actions that align with broader strategic objectives:
- **Early-Game Priorities**:
  1. **Roads**: Emphasize road-building to expand quickly and secure settlement sites early (calculate heuristic road priority based on proximity to key tiles, e.g., 8/6/9 tiles).
  2. **Settlements**: Focus on openings that increase resource diversity and resource flow.
  ```python
  if len(settlements) < 3 and ActionType.BUILD_SETTLEMENT in actions:
      return next(action for action in actions if action.action_type == ActionType.BUILD_SETTLEMENT)
  ```
- **Late-Game Priorities**:
   - Transition to cities or army card purchases while only building roads/settlements to secure Longest Road or block opponents.
- **Secondary Metrics**:
   - Consider an aggregate utility metric (e.g., resource spillover from connected tiles) to decide between fallback paths.

---

### 3. Refined LLM Prompt Design
Re-orient the LLM prompt to place greater emphasis on VP growth and strategic objectives:
- **Structured Guidance**:
  ```
  You are tasked with growing Victory Points (VP) towards winning conditions. Prioritize actions that directly lead to VP growth (e.g., building settlements/cities or creating roads if expanding settlements is possible). Additionally, consider blocking opponents’ expansion and achieving Longest Road or Largest Army. Here are the factors to consider:
  - VP contributions: How does this action increase Victory Points?
  - Resource optimization: Does this action improve resource variety or frequency?
  - Opponent impact: Does this action hinder opponents?
  ```
- **Action Context and Justification**: Force the LLM to evaluate and justify its decision explicitly with VP and strategic metrics as criteria:
  ```
  Action: {Chosen Action}
  VP Contribution: {Describe how this action contributes to Victory Points or other winning conditions (Longest Road, Largest Army, etc.)}
  Strategic Justification: {Explain why this action is optimal in your current state.}
  ```

---

### 4. Balancing Resource Accumulation and Strategic Investments
Introduce a dynamic system to balance competing objectives like upgrading cities versus building roads:
- **Resource Thresholds**:
   - Maintain a minimum resource reserve (e.g., 3 bricks and 3 wood) for road-building during the early game.
   - Shift to reserving ore and wheat when cities are needed in the late game.
  ```python
  if resources['brick'] > 2 and resources['wood'] > 2 and ActionType.BUILD_ROAD in actions:
      return build_road_action
  elif resources['ore'] > 3 and resources['wheat'] > 2 and ActionType.BUILD_CITY in actions:
      return build_city_action
  ```
- **Investment Diversification**:
   - Build roads as placeholders if resources for settlements or cities are insufficient, keeping future options open.
   - Introduce a trigger to prioritize development cards if no immediate high-value options exist.

---

### 5. Identifying Bottlenecks and Inefficiencies
Implement mechanisms to evaluate and eliminate stagnation in decision-making:
- **Action Tracking**:
  - Track patterns of repetitive actions (e.g., 3 consecutive END TURN actions) and trigger specific re-evaluations for resource optimization or blocking moves.
  - Introduce a "resource stall threshold": If surplus resources accumulate beyond a predefined number, focus on spending them, even on sub-optimal actions.
- **Post-Action Evaluation**:
  - After every game session, log actions with their outcomes (e.g., Did this action result in VP gain or resource improvement?).
  - Use decision heatmaps to identify action sequences that correlate with stagnation (e.g., prolonged road-building with no settlements).
- **Dynamic Decision Adjustment**:
  - Adjust scoring to aggressively penalize repetitive non-contributory actions.
  ```python
  if "END TURN" repeats more than twice:
      print(f"Repeated END TURN actions detected. Prioritizing an alternative action.")
      # Force expansion or development actions here.
  ```

---

### Next Steps:
1. Prioritize enhancing heuristic scoring to drive better early-game performance.
2. Adjust fallback mechanisms to emphasize forward-looking strategies like settlement preparation.
3. Integrate bottleneck detection mechanisms for iteration feedback and adapt the LLM query structure for immediate impact.

END STRATEGY.================================== Ai Message ==================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Implement a strategy that improves both early and late-game decision-making for FooPlayer through advanced heuristics, adjusted fallback mechanisms, and refined LLM prompts, achieving measurable improvements in metrics such as roads, settlements, and victory points.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Integrate enhanced heuristic scoring and dynamic fallback priorities into the decision flow while refining LLM responses for strategic action selection, focusing on VP growth and efficient resource use.

CHOSEN AGENT: CODER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:  
Modify FooPlayer to implement the strategies outlined in the five key areas. Specifically:

1. **Enhance Heuristic Scoring**:
   - Add multipliers for actions directly contributing to Victory Points, such as settlement building and city upgrading.
   - Dynamically adjust scores based on the game stage (early vs. late-game priorities), prioritizing roads and settlements early while focusing on VP-heavy actions late.

2. **Dynamic Fallback Mechanism**:
   - Revise the fallback mechanism to focus on early-game expansion via roads and settlements as placeholders for resource diversity and VP accumulation.
   - Later transition fallback logic to VP-centric actions like city upgrades and development cards.

3. **Refined LLM Prompt**:
   - Update the LLM prompt to emphasize VP growth explicitly.
   - Demand justification for actions based on Victory Points and strategic blocking of opponents.

4. **Resource Threshold Balancing**:
   - Introduce logic for maintaining resource reserves and diversifying investments based on available actions.
   - Trigger placeholder actions like road-building when strategic objectives are temporarily unattainable.

5. **Action Bottleneck Detection**:
   - Implement tracking logic for repetitive unproductive actions (e.g., repeated "END TURN").
   - Adjust decision scoring to discourage stagnation, forcing resource spending or defensive actions when necessary.

Make necessary modifications to the `decide` method and auxiliary functions like `_build_prompt` and `heuristic_scores`. Run a test iteration post-implementation to ensure that the changes positively impact FooPlayer performance.================================ Human Message =================================

### Summary of Changes:
1. **Enhanced Heuristic Scoring**:
   - Incorporated VP contribution into heuristic scores.
   - Adjusted scores dynamically based on roads remaining and game phase.

2. **Dynamic Fallback Priorities**:
   - Modified `_fallback_action` to prioritize actions strategically based on early vs. late-game aims.
   - Incorporated a priority order that promotes building cities, settlements, and roads.

3. **Refined LLM Prompt**:
   - Expanded the prompt to focus on VP, resource diversity, and opponent impact.
   - Included heuristic scores for LLM guidance and decision alignment.

4. **Improved Error and Response Handling**:
   - Enhanced `_parse_llm_response` to handle ambiguous LLM outputs.
   - Included detailed print logs during fallback decisions.

### Next Steps:
- Test the updated `FooPlayer` against increasingly challenging opponents to evaluate performance.
- Monitor logs, especially during fallback actions, for adjustments to scoring weights or LLM alignment.
- Incrementally refine heuristic values and prompt details based on test outcomes.

After Running The New foo_player.py Player, Here is my analysis and findings:

### Scores of FooPlayer:
- Wins: 0  
- Average Victory Points (VP): 2.6666666666666665  
- Average Settlements: 1.3333333333333333  
- Average Cities: 0.6666666666666666  
- Average Roads: 0.0  
- Average Largest Army: 0.0  
- Average Development VP: 0.0  

### Short Analysis of Game Output:
- **Repetitive Logs**: Multiple instances of LLM responses defaulting to basic actions such as "ROLL" and "END TURN," with justifications suggesting limited strategic depth. Example: "Rolling is necessary to progress the game state."
- **Neutral Heuristic Scoring**: Actions often evaluated with a low heuristic score (`1`). This indicates the heuristic system fails to differentiate between strategic actions.
- **Misalignment**: High-priority actions like "BUILD_CITY" or "BUILD_SETTLEMENT" seem underutilized, despite occasional high heuristic scores visible in logs. 

### Errors, Warnings, or Signs of Implementation Issues:
- **LLM Integration Weakness**: Responses imply poor decision quality by prioritizing roll/end-turn actions excessively. This indicates the prompt design and parsing mechanisms need refinement.
- **Strategic Gaps**: Failure to build roads or utilize army resources, even across multiple turns, suggests severe strategic deficiencies. The game log reinforces these gaps.
- **Warning**: Logs frequently state "Fallback mechanism applied," implying reliance on basic action prioritization rather than effective LLM outputs.

Let me know if you need anything else!================================== Ai Message ==================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Improve FooPlayer’s strategic depth by refining heuristic accuracy, enhancing LLM prompts to advocate stronger strategic actions, and reducing reliance on the fallback mechanism. Focus on measurable improvements in roads, settlements, and cities over the next 5 iterations.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Address the strategic misalignment by:
1. Refactoring heuristics to better differentiate and prioritize optimal actions (e.g., building roads, settlements, and cities).
2. Revising the LLM prompt design to explicitly prioritize non-default, VP-centric, and impactful actions.
3. Adjusting the fallback mechanism to penalize repetitive default actions and ensure meaningful progression.

CHOSEN AGENT: STRATEGIZER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:  
Provide 5 specific refinements or new strategies to improve FooPlayer’s decision-making system, focusing on the following:
1. How to recalibrate heuristic scoring to strongly favor foundational growth actions like roads and settlements early on.
2. Techniques to adjust prompt design to directly steer the LLM away from repetitive or low-value default actions.
3. Criteria for dynamically detecting high-impact actions (strategic bottlenecks or game pivots) and encouraging the LLM or fallback decision to prioritize them.
4. Hybrid mechanisms blending determinate strategic templates for fallback actions alongside heuristic-driven flexibility.
5. Methods to evaluate and tune the heuristic scoring weights and LLM response handling over multiple evolutions, ensuring consistent improvement in strategic metrics.================================ Human Message =================================

STRATEGY:

### 1. Recalibrating Heuristic Scoring for Early Foundational Growth
Refine the heuristic scoring system to prioritize foundational growth actions, particularly during the early game:
- **Dynamic Weight Adjustments for Game Stages**:
  - **Early Game**:
    - Roads: Score 10 (high priority for expansion).
    - Settlements: Score 8 (emphasize resource diversity and availability).
    - Cities: Score 5 (lower priority due to resource scarcity early on).
  - **Mid to Late Game**:
    - Settlements: Score 10 (needed for reaching VP thresholds).
    - Cities: Score 15 (maximize VP by converting settlements to cities).
    - Roads: Score 7 (focus on Longest Road or movement towards strategic settlement spots).  
- **Tile Resource Heuristic**:
  - Assign weighted scores to actions based on resource tile priority:
    - High-Value Tiles: Prioritize intersections with tiles like 6, 8 (ore/wheat bonuses), increasing the heuristic scores of these actions.
    ```python
    if action.action_type == ActionType.BUILD_SETTLEMENT and action.location.resource_value > 15:
        heuristic_scores[action] += 3  # Boost for high-value tiles
    ```
- **Disruption Consideration**:
  - Actions that block opponent growth (road connections or settlements) receive a bonus.

---

### 2. Adjusting Prompt Design to Guide the LLM Towards High-Impact Actions
Update the LLM prompt construction to explicitly penalize repetitive or low-value actions and focus on strategic, VP-driving goals:
- **Segmented Descriptions with Action Prioritization**:
  ```
  You are tasked with making the most impactful move in the Catanatron Minigame. Always prioritize actions with long-term strategic benefits over short-term results. Avoid repetitive, low-impact actions like ending turns without building to progress.
  
  Current Priorities:
  1. Expand settlements and roads for resource variety and VP growth.
  2. Upgrade settlements to cities to maximize VP.
  3. Act to hinder opponents’ expansion when possible.
  
  Consider the following heuristic scores and game state in your decision:
  ```
  - Add structured fields for each action to explicitly indicate their heuristic weight, stage relevance, and potential impact:
    ```
    Action: {Action}
    Heuristic Score: {Score}
    Stage Priority: {Early/Mid/Late Game Relevance}
    Impact: {How this action will improve VP or hinder opponents}
    ```

---

### 3. Dynamic Detection of High-Impact Actions (Bottlenecks or Game Pivots)
Introduce dynamic logic to identify and prioritize high-impact actions during pivotal game moments:
- **Bottleneck Identification**:
  - Detect signs of resource stagnation or unspent resources (e.g., excessive ore/wheat without city upgrades or brick/wood without roads/settlements).
  ```python
  if player_resources['brick'] >= 3 and player_resources['wood'] >= 3:
      heuristic_scores[ActionType.BUILD_ROAD] += 5  # Encourage spending surplus
  ```
  - Time-based triggers: Penalize repeated "END TURN" or fallback actions and boost the use of active building moves.
- **Strategic Pivot Boosting**:
  - Add bonuses to actions when triggered by game-specific pivots:
    - Longest Road: Encourage roads when near the threshold for Longest Road.
    - Largest Army: Prioritize development card purchases when competing for Largest Army or sabotaging opponents.
    ```python
    if current_army_size >= 2 and opponents_army_size <= current_army_size:
        heuristic_scores[action] += 4  # Edge out Largest Army
    ```

---

### 4. Hybrid Mechanisms for Fallback Actions
Redesign the fallback system to incorporate both deterministic templates and heuristic-driven flexibility:
- **Action Templates by Priority**:
  - Use deterministic logic based on game stage:
    - Early Game: Build roads and settlements to ensure resource coverage.
    - Mid-Late Game: Prioritize cities for VP growth or roads for Longest Road.
  ```python
  for action_type in ["BUILD_CITY", "BUILD_SETTLEMENT", "BUILD_ROAD"]:
      for action in playable_actions:
          if action.action_type == action_type and action meets_conditions:
              return action
  ```
- **Heuristic-Fallback Hybrid**:
  - If no deterministic action is suitable, rely on heuristic priorities derived from current state evaluations to make fallback decisions.
- **Penalty for Stagnation**:
  - Penalize fallback repetitions by gradually increasing the weight on impactful actions like settlement-building or resource diversity improvements.

---

### 5. Methods to Evaluate and Refine Heuristics and LLM Response Handling
Design a structured framework for tuning heuristics and refining LLM responses over multiple game iterations:
- **Performance Metrics**:
  - Track metrics such as VP growth per iteration, total roads/cities/settlements built, and resource efficiency (unused resources).
  - Correlate LLM responses and fallback heuristic effectiveness with game outcomes.
- **Iterative Weight Adjustment**:
  - Analyze N-game results to adjust heuristic weights dynamically:
    - If too many roads are built without follow-up settlements, reduce road priority.
    - If city upgrades lead to stagnation due to resource imbalances, shift the weighting back to settlements.
  ```python
  if settlements_built < expected_settlement_threshold:
      heuristic_weights['BUILD_SETTLEMENT'] += 2
  ```
- **Benchmarking Against Rule-Based Baselines**:
  - Compare LLM-driven decisions with predefined optimal or rule-based actions to evaluate alignment with strategic goals.
  - Use deviation scores to identify areas where LLM prompts need refinement (e.g., under-prioritizing Largest Army or Longest Road).

---

### Next Steps:
1. Begin recalibrating heuristic scores to reflect stage-specific priorities.
2. Implement the updated prompt design to explicitly guide LLM responses toward non-repetitive, VP-centric strategies.
3. Integrate fallback mechanisms with dynamic, bottleneck-based adjustments to address stagnation and repeated default actions.
4. Build tools for iterative heuristic tuning and response evaluation against predefined baselines.

END STRATEGY.================================== Ai Message ==================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Over the next 5 iterations, implement and refine a system that better aligns FooPlayer's heuristic evaluation, LLM prompt design, and fallback mechanisms towards impactful, VP-driven actions. Aim for measurable improvements in foundational metrics like roads, settlements, and cities.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Recalibrate FooPlayer's heuristic scoring system to implement stage-specific priorities and dynamically address bottlenecks, ensuring better alignment between heuristic-driven actions and LLM output. Update the LLM prompt design to explicitly focus on VP growth and reduce low-value decision patterns.

CHOSEN AGENT: CODER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:  
Update `foo_player.py` as follows:

1. **Enhanced Heuristic Scoring**: 
    - Modify `_compute_heuristic_scores` to include stage-specific priorities:
      - Early-game boosts for roads and settlements.
      - Late-game emphasis on cities and development cards.
    - Include dynamic bottle-neck handling, e.g.:
      - Reward actions that address resource buildup or stagnation.
      - Encourage actions that disrupt opponents (e.g., blocking roads/settlements).
    - Use tile values (6, 8, etc.) to boost settlement scores for strategic intersections.

2. **Refined LLM Prompt**:
    - Update `_build_prompt` with stronger emphasis on guiding actions toward VP and strategic goals:
      - Enumerate priorities explicitly: building roads, settlements, cities.
      - Include heuristic scores in the prompt with descriptions of why actions are valuable.
      - Penalize repetitive actions like "END TURN" through explicit discouragement in the prompt.

3. **Fallback Mechanism Adjustment**:
    - Introduce deterministic templates for stage-specific fallback actions:
      - Early-game: Prioritize roads and settlements for expansion.
      - Late-game: Focus on cities and VP-centric actions.
    - Dynamically adapt fallback decisions based on resource surplus or game state bottlenecks.
    ```python
    if player_resources["brick"] >= 3 and player_resources["wood"] >= 3:
        heuristic_scores[ActionType.BUILD_ROAD] += 5
    ```

4. **Action Bottleneck Detection**:
    - Add detection for repetitive or stagnating actions (e.g., unspent resources or repeated "END TURN").
    - Penalize stagnation by prioritizing resource expenditure and spatial expansion.

Upon completing the updates, test the revised player for functional improvements in decision-making, focusing on roads, settlements, and overall strategic progression.================================ Human Message =================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Improve the performance of the `FooPlayer.py` by introducing intelligent strategy logic that leverages the LLM for decision-making. Specifically, aim for a minimum win count of 1 within the next 5 iterations while improving VP, settlements, and measurable gameplay metrics.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Address the issue of the `decide` method defaulting to selecting the first action. Integrate the LLM's `query_llm` functionality to intelligently evaluate actions based on state and strategy.

CHOSEN AGENT: CODER

AGENT OBJECTIVE: 
The current implementation of `FooPlayer` is defaulting to selecting the first action, as evidenced by the repeated log message "Choosing First Action on Default." Modify the `decide` method to leverage the `self.llm.query_llm` functionality for decision-making. Specifically:

1. Replace the current first-action default with an implementation that:
   a. Obtains a list of possible actions from the game state.
   b. Queries the LLM (`self.llm.query_llm`) for the evaluation of these actions.
   c. Selects the most intelligent action based on the LLM's evaluation.

2. Ensure the decision logic is robust and includes handling scenarios such as:
   - No valid actions available.
   - LLM providing ambiguous or conflicting guidance (fallback mechanisms).

3. Include clear comments and logging to observe how the LLM is influencing decision-making.

Once done, provide the modified code to be tested.================================== Ai Message ==================================

CODER

### Changes Made:
1. **Replaced Default Action Selection**:
   - Removed the hardcoded `return playable_actions[0]` that selected the first action by default.

2. **Integrated LLM Decision-Making in `decide`**:
   - Constructed a comprehensive prompt using the `_build_prompt` function to provide the LLM with game state and available actions.
   - Queried the LLM using `self.llm.query_llm(prompt)`.
   - Parsed the LLM's response using the `_parse_llm_response` function to select the most appropriate action from the available options.

3. **Added New Helper Methods**:
   - `_build_prompt`: Constructs a prompt by including the current game state and the list of playable actions.
   - `_parse_llm_response`: Interprets the LLM's response to match it with one of the playable actions. If no match is found, defaults to the first action.

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Included error handling for cases where the LLM query fails or returns an ambiguous response. In such cases, the method defaults to selecting the first action.
   - Added logging to show the LLM's response (`print(f"LLM Response: {llm_response}")`) and fallback mechanisms.

5. **Logging and Debugging**:
   - Added print statements for better debugging and observation:
     - Log when no playable actions are available.
     - Log the LLM's raw response.
     - Log if the response is ambiguous or invalid, and the fallback action is selected.

### Notes for the Next Iteration:
- **Prompt Details**: The current `_build_prompt` function makes a basic serialization of the game state and actions. If the LLM struggles to prioritize or understand the game details, refining this prompt may be necessary.
- **LLM Error Responses**: If runtime timing issues with `query_llm` arise (e.g., long delays or failures), adjustment of query limits or timeouts may be needed.

### Testing Recommendations:
- Test how the LLM chooses actions in various scenarios to verify that the parsing logic aligns with actual gameplay.
- Monitor logs (`LLM Response: ...`) for unexpected behaviors or ambiguous responses.

END CODER================================ Human Message =================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Transition FooPlayer into a competitive player over the next 5 iterations by leveraging enhanced strategy, including heuristic reinforcement, refined LLM prompts, and deterministic fallback mechanisms, and targeting measurable improvements in average VP and win rates.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Implement **segmented contextual prompting** and heuristic-enhanced decision-making into the LLM integration (as per Strategy 1 and 4). Additionally, integrate a **ranked action hierarchy** as a fallback mechanism (Strategy 2).

CHOSEN AGENT: CODER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:  
Modify the `decide` method of `FooPlayer.py` to achieve the following:

1. **Refined LLM Prompt**: 
   - Update the `_build_prompt` function to use **segmented contextual prompting**. Include headers that describe the game state, available resources, and strategic goals. Example structure:
     ```
     Current Game State:
     - Player Stats: {resources}, {settlements}, {cities}, VP: {victory_points}
     - Opponent Stats: {opponent resources/blockades}, etc.
     Goal: Maximize VP while taking advantage of the current game state.
     Available Actions: {list of formatted playable actions}
     Respond with:
     Action: {Selected optimal action}
     Justification: {Reasoning behind the action choice}
     ```

2. **Heuristic Context Integration**:
   - In the `_build_prompt` method, compute heuristic scores (e.g., settlement value, city upgrade value, road extension value) for each action. Integrate these scores into the prompt to help the LLM make better decisions.

3. **Fallback Mechanism**:
   - Enhance `_parse_llm_response` to implement a **ranked action hierarchy** fallback mechanism when the LLM output is invalid or ambiguous. Example hierarchy:
     - Priority Order: Build City > Build Settlement > Build Road > End Turn.
     - If a valid option matching the LLM response is not found, return the first valid action in this priority order.

4. **Logging**:
   - Improve logging to capture the heuristic scores, the LLM prompt, its raw response, and the fallback decision (when necessary) for post-game analysis.

Once complete, test the updated `FooPlayer.py`, run games, and report the results.================================== Ai Message ==================================

CODER

### Changes Made:
1. **Refined LLM Prompt Construction**:
   - Enhanced the `_build_prompt` function to use **segmented contextual prompting** with detailed headers for game state, player stats, opponent stats, and available actions.
   - Integrated **heuristic scores** for each action into the prompt to guide the LLM decision-making.

2. **Heuristic Computation Method**:
   - Added a `_compute_heuristic_scores` helper method to assign heuristic values to each action based on action type (e.g., city-building prioritized over road-building).

3. **Improved Parsing Logic**:
   - Enhanced `_parse_llm_response` to return a matching action from the LLM response, or delegate to the fallback mechanism if no match is found.

4. **Ranked Fallback Mechanism**:
   - Implemented `_fallback_action` to evaluate actions in a priority order: Build City > Build Settlement > Build Road > End Turn.
   - Default to the first action only when no prioritized options exist.

5. **Logging**:
   - Added print statements throughout to capture key debugging information:
     - The LLM prompt.
     - Heuristic scores of actions.
     - The LLM's raw response.
     - Logs for fallback mechanism use.

6. **Error Handling Enhancements**:
   - Integrated robust exception handling in the `decide` method for LLM failures, with clear logging of fallbacks.

### Notes for the Next Iteration:
- Tune the **heuristic scores** if the LLM's decisions align poorly with optimal strategies.
- Monitor how well the LLM responds to the enhanced prompt structure during testing.
- Evaluate the fallback mechanism's efficiency in comparison to the LLM's responses.

### Testing Recommendations:
- Focus on scenarios requiring diverse strategic goals (e.g., blocking opponent moves, building towards Largest Army).
- Analyze logs for patterns in ambiguous or ineffective LLM responses, and refine prompts or fallback heuristics accordingly.

END CODER================================ Human Message =================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Ensure functionality and compatibility of FooPlayer with the Catanatron API while strengthening the LLM decision-making mechanism in a way that improves strategic performance over the next 5 iterations.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Integrate valid Catanatron API calls into `foo_player.py`'s `_build_prompt` method to fetch relevant game data like resources, settlements, cities, roads, and victory points, and resolve the current `AttributeError` preventing gameplay.

CHOSEN AGENT: CODER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:  
Resolve the `AttributeError` by replacing invalid calls in `foo_player.py` with Catanatron-compatible API calls as outlined in the research:

1. **Resources**:
   - Replace `game.get_player_resources(Color.BLUE)` with `get_player_freqdeck(state, Color.BLUE)` to fetch all resources for FooPlayer.
   - Use `player_num_resource_cards(state, Color.BLUE, resource)` to query specific resource counts.

2. **Settlements and Cities**:
   - Replace invalid calls for settlements/cities with:
     ```python
     get_player_buildings(state, Color.BLUE, "SETTLEMENT")
     get_player_buildings(state, Color.BLUE, "CITY")
     ```

3. **Victory Points and Roads**:
   - Retrieve victory points using:
     ```python
     vp = state.player_state[player_key(state, Color.BLUE) + "_ACTUAL_VICTORY_POINTS"]
     ```
   - Roads remaining:
     ```python
     roads_available = state.player_state[player_key(state, Color.BLUE) + "_ROADS_AVAILABLE"]
     ```

4. **General Updates to `_build_prompt`**:
   - Adjust the prompt to include all valid game stats, ensuring Catanatron API calls function.
   - Include resource counts, settlements, cities, roads, and VP in the formatted prompt structure.

5. **Debugging and Validation**:
   - Add logging to verify data retrieval accuracy during gameplay for resources, actions, and VP.
   - Run a test evolution to confirm the absence of runtime errors.

Update the code to reflect these changes and provide detailed debug logs during testing for validation.================================== Ai Message ==================================

CODER

### Changes Made:
1. **Replaced Invalid API Calls**:
   - Substituted `game.get_player_resources(Color.BLUE)` with `get_player_freqdeck(state, Color.BLUE)` to correctly fetch resources.
   - Similar replacements made for settlements, cities, victory points, and roads using valid Catanatron API functions: 
     - `get_player_buildings(state, Color.BLUE, "SETTLEMENT")` and `get_player_buildings(state, Color.BLUE, "CITY")` for settlements and cities.
     - Victory points accessed via `state.player_state[f"{player_key(state, Color.BLUE)}_ACTUAL_VICTORY_POINTS"]`.
     - Roads available via `state.player_state[f"{player_key(state, Color.BLUE)}_ROADS_AVAILABLE"]`.

2. **Updated `_build_prompt` Method**:
   - Included new resource and state-fetching methods in the prompt template.
   - Enhanced formatting to make the prompt explainable and consistent with the desired LLM input structure.

3. **Improved Compatibility**:
   - Refactored the game state integration in `_build_prompt` to align with valid methods reliably compatible with the API.

4. **Debugging Enhancements**:
   - Added detailed logging via print statements to verify accurate state data retrieval during gameplay (resources, settlements, cities, heuristic scores).
   - Included error handling for invalid or mismatched LLM responses.

### Notes for the Next Iteration:
- Test how well the new prompt structure works with the LLM's decision-making.
- Monitor logs for resource/state-fetch accuracy and potential mismatches between heuristic scores and LLM responses.

### Testing Recommendations:
- Verify that resources, settlements, cities, and other player stats from the state align with the game's current state through debugging outputs.
- Check if the fallback mechanism handles invalid or ambiguous LLM responses efficiently.

END CODER================================ Human Message =================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Implement a strategy that improves both early and late-game decision-making for FooPlayer through advanced heuristics, adjusted fallback mechanisms, and refined LLM prompts, achieving measurable improvements in metrics such as roads, settlements, and victory points.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Integrate enhanced heuristic scoring and dynamic fallback priorities into the decision flow while refining LLM responses for strategic action selection, focusing on VP growth and efficient resource use.

CHOSEN AGENT: CODER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:  
Modify FooPlayer to implement the strategies outlined in the five key areas. Specifically:

1. **Enhance Heuristic Scoring**:
   - Add multipliers for actions directly contributing to Victory Points, such as settlement building and city upgrading.
   - Dynamically adjust scores based on the game stage (early vs. late-game priorities), prioritizing roads and settlements early while focusing on VP-heavy actions late.

2. **Dynamic Fallback Mechanism**:
   - Revise the fallback mechanism to focus on early-game expansion via roads and settlements as placeholders for resource diversity and VP accumulation.
   - Later transition fallback logic to VP-centric actions like city upgrades and development cards.

3. **Refined LLM Prompt**:
   - Update the LLM prompt to emphasize VP growth explicitly.
   - Demand justification for actions based on Victory Points and strategic blocking of opponents.

4. **Resource Threshold Balancing**:
   - Introduce logic for maintaining resource reserves and diversifying investments based on available actions.
   - Trigger placeholder actions like road-building when strategic objectives are temporarily unattainable.

5. **Action Bottleneck Detection**:
   - Implement tracking logic for repetitive unproductive actions (e.g., repeated "END TURN").
   - Adjust decision scoring to discourage stagnation, forcing resource spending or defensive actions when necessary.

Make necessary modifications to the `decide` method and auxiliary functions like `_build_prompt` and `heuristic_scores`. Run a test iteration post-implementation to ensure that the changes positively impact FooPlayer performance.

After Running The New foo_player.py Player, Here is my analysis and findings:

### Scores of FooPlayer:
- Wins: 0  
- Average Victory Points (VP): 2.6666666666666665  
- Average Settlements: 1.3333333333333333  
- Average Cities: 0.6666666666666666  
- Average Roads: 0.0  
- Average Largest Army: 0.0  
- Average Development VP: 0.0  

### Short Analysis of Game Output:
- **Repetitive Logs**: Multiple instances of LLM responses defaulting to basic actions such as "ROLL" and "END TURN," with justifications suggesting limited strategic depth. Example: "Rolling is necessary to progress the game state."
- **Neutral Heuristic Scoring**: Actions often evaluated with a low heuristic score (`1`). This indicates the heuristic system fails to differentiate between strategic actions.
- **Misalignment**: High-priority actions like "BUILD_CITY" or "BUILD_SETTLEMENT" seem underutilized, despite occasional high heuristic scores visible in logs. 

### Errors, Warnings, or Signs of Implementation Issues:
- **LLM Integration Weakness**: Responses imply poor decision quality by prioritizing roll/end-turn actions excessively. This indicates the prompt design and parsing mechanisms need refinement.
- **Strategic Gaps**: Failure to build roads or utilize army resources, even across multiple turns, suggests severe strategic deficiencies. The game log reinforces these gaps.
- **Warning**: Logs frequently state "Fallback mechanism applied," implying reliance on basic action prioritization rather than effective LLM outputs.

Let me know if you need anything else!================================== Ai Message ==================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Improve FooPlayer’s strategic depth by refining heuristic accuracy, enhancing LLM prompts to advocate stronger strategic actions, and reducing reliance on the fallback mechanism. Focus on measurable improvements in roads, settlements, and cities over the next 5 iterations.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Address the strategic misalignment by:
1. Refactoring heuristics to better differentiate and prioritize optimal actions (e.g., building roads, settlements, and cities).
2. Revising the LLM prompt design to explicitly prioritize non-default, VP-centric, and impactful actions.
3. Adjusting the fallback mechanism to penalize repetitive default actions and ensure meaningful progression.

CHOSEN AGENT: STRATEGIZER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:  
Provide 5 specific refinements or new strategies to improve FooPlayer’s decision-making system, focusing on the following:
1. How to recalibrate heuristic scoring to strongly favor foundational growth actions like roads and settlements early on.
2. Techniques to adjust prompt design to directly steer the LLM away from repetitive or low-value default actions.
3. Criteria for dynamically detecting high-impact actions (strategic bottlenecks or game pivots) and encouraging the LLM or fallback decision to prioritize them.
4. Hybrid mechanisms blending determinate strategic templates for fallback actions alongside heuristic-driven flexibility.
5. Methods to evaluate and tune the heuristic scoring weights and LLM response handling over multiple evolutions, ensuring consistent improvement in strategic metrics.================================ Human Message =================================

STRATEGY:

### 1. Recalibrating Heuristic Scoring for Early Foundational Growth
Refine the heuristic scoring system to prioritize foundational growth actions, particularly during the early game:
- **Dynamic Weight Adjustments for Game Stages**:
  - **Early Game**:
    - Roads: Score 10 (high priority for expansion).
    - Settlements: Score 8 (emphasize resource diversity and availability).
    - Cities: Score 5 (lower priority due to resource scarcity early on).
  - **Mid to Late Game**:
    - Settlements: Score 10 (needed for reaching VP thresholds).
    - Cities: Score 15 (maximize VP by converting settlements to cities).
    - Roads: Score 7 (focus on Longest Road or movement towards strategic settlement spots).  
- **Tile Resource Heuristic**:
  - Assign weighted scores to actions based on resource tile priority:
    - High-Value Tiles: Prioritize intersections with tiles like 6, 8 (ore/wheat bonuses), increasing the heuristic scores of these actions.
    ```python
    if action.action_type == ActionType.BUILD_SETTLEMENT and action.location.resource_value > 15:
        heuristic_scores[action] += 3  # Boost for high-value tiles
    ```
- **Disruption Consideration**:
  - Actions that block opponent growth (road connections or settlements) receive a bonus.

---

### 2. Adjusting Prompt Design to Guide the LLM Towards High-Impact Actions
Update the LLM prompt construction to explicitly penalize repetitive or low-value actions and focus on strategic, VP-driving goals:
- **Segmented Descriptions with Action Prioritization**:
  ```
  You are tasked with making the most impactful move in the Catanatron Minigame. Always prioritize actions with long-term strategic benefits over short-term results. Avoid repetitive, low-impact actions like ending turns without building to progress.
  
  Current Priorities:
  1. Expand settlements and roads for resource variety and VP growth.
  2. Upgrade settlements to cities to maximize VP.
  3. Act to hinder opponents’ expansion when possible.
  
  Consider the following heuristic scores and game state in your decision:
  ```
  - Add structured fields for each action to explicitly indicate their heuristic weight, stage relevance, and potential impact:
    ```
    Action: {Action}
    Heuristic Score: {Score}
    Stage Priority: {Early/Mid/Late Game Relevance}
    Impact: {How this action will improve VP or hinder opponents}
    ```

---

### 3. Dynamic Detection of High-Impact Actions (Bottlenecks or Game Pivots)
Introduce dynamic logic to identify and prioritize high-impact actions during pivotal game moments:
- **Bottleneck Identification**:
  - Detect signs of resource stagnation or unspent resources (e.g., excessive ore/wheat without city upgrades or brick/wood without roads/settlements).
  ```python
  if player_resources['brick'] >= 3 and player_resources['wood'] >= 3:
      heuristic_scores[ActionType.BUILD_ROAD] += 5  # Encourage spending surplus
  ```
  - Time-based triggers: Penalize repeated "END TURN" or fallback actions and boost the use of active building moves.
- **Strategic Pivot Boosting**:
  - Add bonuses to actions when triggered by game-specific pivots:
    - Longest Road: Encourage roads when near the threshold for Longest Road.
    - Largest Army: Prioritize development card purchases when competing for Largest Army or sabotaging opponents.
    ```python
    if current_army_size >= 2 and opponents_army_size <= current_army_size:
        heuristic_scores[action] += 4  # Edge out Largest Army
    ```

---

### 4. Hybrid Mechanisms for Fallback Actions
Redesign the fallback system to incorporate both deterministic templates and heuristic-driven flexibility:
- **Action Templates by Priority**:
  - Use deterministic logic based on game stage:
    - Early Game: Build roads and settlements to ensure resource coverage.
    - Mid-Late Game: Prioritize cities for VP growth or roads for Longest Road.
  ```python
  for action_type in ["BUILD_CITY", "BUILD_SETTLEMENT", "BUILD_ROAD"]:
      for action in playable_actions:
          if action.action_type == action_type and action meets_conditions:
              return action
  ```
- **Heuristic-Fallback Hybrid**:
  - If no deterministic action is suitable, rely on heuristic priorities derived from current state evaluations to make fallback decisions.
- **Penalty for Stagnation**:
  - Penalize fallback repetitions by gradually increasing the weight on impactful actions like settlement-building or resource diversity improvements.

---

### 5. Methods to Evaluate and Refine Heuristics and LLM Response Handling
Design a structured framework for tuning heuristics and refining LLM responses over multiple game iterations:
- **Performance Metrics**:
  - Track metrics such as VP growth per iteration, total roads/cities/settlements built, and resource efficiency (unused resources).
  - Correlate LLM responses and fallback heuristic effectiveness with game outcomes.
- **Iterative Weight Adjustment**:
  - Analyze N-game results to adjust heuristic weights dynamically:
    - If too many roads are built without follow-up settlements, reduce road priority.
    - If city upgrades lead to stagnation due to resource imbalances, shift the weighting back to settlements.
  ```python
  if settlements_built < expected_settlement_threshold:
      heuristic_weights['BUILD_SETTLEMENT'] += 2
  ```
- **Benchmarking Against Rule-Based Baselines**:
  - Compare LLM-driven decisions with predefined optimal or rule-based actions to evaluate alignment with strategic goals.
  - Use deviation scores to identify areas where LLM prompts need refinement (e.g., under-prioritizing Largest Army or Longest Road).

---

### Next Steps:
1. Begin recalibrating heuristic scores to reflect stage-specific priorities.
2. Implement the updated prompt design to explicitly guide LLM responses toward non-repetitive, VP-centric strategies.
3. Integrate fallback mechanisms with dynamic, bottleneck-based adjustments to address stagnation and repeated default actions.
4. Build tools for iterative heuristic tuning and response evaluation against predefined baselines.

END STRATEGY.================================== Ai Message ==================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Over the next 5 iterations, implement and refine a system that better aligns FooPlayer's heuristic evaluation, LLM prompt design, and fallback mechanisms towards impactful, VP-driven actions. Aim for measurable improvements in foundational metrics like roads, settlements, and cities.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Recalibrate FooPlayer's heuristic scoring system to implement stage-specific priorities and dynamically address bottlenecks, ensuring better alignment between heuristic-driven actions and LLM output. Update the LLM prompt design to explicitly focus on VP growth and reduce low-value decision patterns.

CHOSEN AGENT: CODER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:  
Update `foo_player.py` as follows:

1. **Enhanced Heuristic Scoring**: 
    - Modify `_compute_heuristic_scores` to include stage-specific priorities:
      - Early-game boosts for roads and settlements.
      - Late-game emphasis on cities and development cards.
    - Include dynamic bottle-neck handling, e.g.:
      - Reward actions that address resource buildup or stagnation.
      - Encourage actions that disrupt opponents (e.g., blocking roads/settlements).
    - Use tile values (6, 8, etc.) to boost settlement scores for strategic intersections.

2. **Refined LLM Prompt**:
    - Update `_build_prompt` with stronger emphasis on guiding actions toward VP and strategic goals:
      - Enumerate priorities explicitly: building roads, settlements, cities.
      - Include heuristic scores in the prompt with descriptions of why actions are valuable.
      - Penalize repetitive actions like "END TURN" through explicit discouragement in the prompt.

3. **Fallback Mechanism Adjustment**:
    - Introduce deterministic templates for stage-specific fallback actions:
      - Early-game: Prioritize roads and settlements for expansion.
      - Late-game: Focus on cities and VP-centric actions.
    - Dynamically adapt fallback decisions based on resource surplus or game state bottlenecks.
    ```python
    if player_resources["brick"] >= 3 and player_resources["wood"] >= 3:
        heuristic_scores[ActionType.BUILD_ROAD] += 5
    ```

4. **Action Bottleneck Detection**:
    - Add detection for repetitive or stagnating actions (e.g., unspent resources or repeated "END TURN").
    - Penalize stagnation by prioritizing resource expenditure and spatial expansion.

Upon completing the updates, test the revised player for functional improvements in decision-making, focusing on roads, settlements, and overall strategic progression.================================ Human Message =================================

CODER

### Updates to `foo_player.py`:
1. **Enhanced Heuristic Scoring**:
   - Integrated stage-specific priorities (e.g., roads and settlements emphasized early-game, cities in mid-late game).
   - Added bonuses for high-resource tiles in settlement actions.
   - Introduced penalties to address resource bottlenecks (e.g., surplus brick/wood triggers road-building incentives).
   - Incorporated logic to dynamically adjust scores based on resource availability and VP contributions.

2. **Refined LLM Prompt**:
   - Redesigned `_build_prompt` to better guide the LLM:
     - Explicit priorities for strategic actions based on Victory Point (VP) growth.
     - Highlighted roadmap for early-game road/settlement building and late-game upgrades.
     - Discouraged repetitive or non-impactful actions like unnecessary turns.
   - Included heuristic scores in the prompt, with explanations for why certain actions are prioritized.

3. **Dynamic Fallback Mechanism**:
   - Structured fallback logic to prioritize actions based on game state:
     - Early-game: Roads and settlements.
     - Late-game: Cities and VP-centric actions.
   - Updated fallback mechanism to prevent stagnation by using deterministic templates blended with heuristic-driven conditions.

4. **Bottleneck and Surplus Resource Handling**:
   - Added logic to detect and dynamically handle situations where surplus resources exist (e.g., incentivizing road-building on excess brick/wood).
   - Increased priority for settlement or city building to resolve resource stagnation.

5. **Improved Logs**:
   - Added meaningful print statements across key decision-making steps to facilitate debugging:
     - Fallback actions.
     - Detected bottlenecks or resource imbalances.
     - LLM responses (and when fallback mechanisms are triggered).

### Testing Suggestions:
- **Evaluate Decision Quality**:
  - Test early-game actions for expansion focus (roads and settlements).
  - Verify mid-to-late game actions prioritize cities and VP-centric plays.
- **Monitor Bottleneck Response**:
  - Simulate resource-rich scenarios to observe if surplus resources are properly spent.
- **Validate Fallback Logic**:
  - Conduct games where the LLM fails or incorrectly parses the prompt to assess fallback success.
- **Track Metrics**:
  - Compare average VP, settlements, and city counts across multiple iterations to previous versions.

### Next Steps:
- Refine heuristic weights after testing to balance strategic trade-offs.
- Incorporate feedback cycles to analyze and further tune prompt alignment with heuristic evaluations.
- Observe repetitive "END TURN" penalties and ensure they improve game progression.

================================== Ai Message ==================================

After Running The New foo_player.py Player, Here is my analysis and findings:

### Scores of FooPlayer:
- Wins: 0
- Average Victory Points (VP): 2.0
- Average Settlements: 2.0
- Average Cities: 0.0
- Average Roads: 0.0
- Average Largest Army: 0.0
- Average Development VP: 0.0

### Short Analysis of Game Output:
- The phrase "Choosing First Action on Default" repeated throughout the log suggests that the implementation is defaulting to selecting the first action without strategy. 
- Results indicate poor performance compared to the opponent, with no victories achieved in the 3-game session. 

### Errors, Warnings, or Signs of Implementation Issues:
- **Implementation Warning**: The log shows "Choosing First Action on Default" continuously, indicating that the `decide` method is not leveraging the LLM integration (`self.llm.query_llm`) for decision-making.
- **Gameplay Warning**: The score disparity (2 VP versus 10 VP for the opponent) and the lack of progression in Cities, Roads, and Largest Army metrics highlight a lack of strategy execution.

After Running The New foo_player.py Player, Here is my analysis and findings:

### Scores of FooPlayer:
- Wins: 0  
- Average Victory Points (VP): 3.33  
- Average Settlements: 2.33  
- Average Cities: 0.33  
- Average Roads: 0.0  
- Average Largest Army: 0.0  
- Average Development VP: 0.33  

### Short Analysis of Game Output:
- The LLM consistently failed to provide valid or actionable responses: "LLM response ambiguous or invalid. Defaulting to first action."
- FooPlayer defaulted to the first available action in all scenarios instead of executing strategic decisions.
- The performance difference is stark: FooPlayer had no wins and significantly lower VP compared to AlphaBetaPlayer.

### Errors, Warnings, or Signs of Implementation Issues:
- **LLM Integration Issue**: LLM responses are not being parsed correctly or are poorly generated, leading to fallback actions ("Defaulting to first action").
- **Decision-Making Deficiency**: The lack of strategic outcomes (e.g., 0 roads, 0 Largest Army) suggests serious shortcomings in action planning and execution.
- **Repeated Logs**: Multiple instances of ambiguous LLM responses point to insufficient prompt design or response parsing mechanism in `_parse_llm_response`.

================================== Ai Message ==================================

After Running The New foo_player.py Player, Here is my analysis and findings:

### Syntax Error Details:
- **Error Message**: `AttributeError: 'Game' object has no attribute 'get_player_resources'`
- **Exact Line Number**: Line 84 in `foo_player.py`
- **Exact Line of Code**: `resources=str(game.get_player_resources(Color.BLUE)),  # Example method to get resources`

### Root Cause:
The method `get_player_resources` is being called on the `Game` object, but it does not exist in the `Game` class, leading to an `AttributeError`. This indicates a mismatch between the game's API and the implementation in `foo_player.py`.

### Impact:
The syntax error prevents the game from running, and thus no game results were recorded for this evolution.

After Running The New foo_player.py Player, Here is my analysis and findings:

### Scores of FooPlayer:
- Wins: 0  
- Average Victory Points (VP): 2.33  
- Average Settlements: 1.67  
- Average Cities: 0.33  
- Average Roads: 0.0  
- Average Largest Army: 0.0  
- Average Development VP: 0.0  

### Short Analysis of Game Output:
- **LLM Interaction**: The LLM responded consistently, but gameplay justification often involved executing mandatory or default actions (e.g., "ROLL" and "END TURN"), suggesting limited strategic depth.
- **Interesting Output**: The heuristic scoring mechanism categorizes actions clearly, but no significant changes to gameplay performance reflect deeper strategy execution.
- **Signs of Issue**: No roads or army development indicates repeated failure to invest strategically in growth areas, despite consistent heuristic scoring.

### Errors, Warnings, or Signs of Implementation Issues:
- **Strategic Weakness**: The absence of victories and poor metrics like roads and army raises concerns about the decision-making quality. 
- **Heuristic Misalignment**: High heuristic scores for actions like "BUILD_ROAD" occasionally appear in the logs but fail to translate into meaningful gameplay progression.

After Running The New foo_player.py Player, Here is my analysis and findings:

### Scores of FooPlayer:
- Wins: 0  
- Average Victory Points (VP): 2.6666666666666665  
- Average Settlements: 1.3333333333333333  
- Average Cities: 0.6666666666666666  
- Average Roads: 0.0  
- Average Largest Army: 0.0  
- Average Development VP: 0.0  

### Short Analysis of Game Output:
- **Repetitive Logs**: Multiple instances of LLM responses defaulting to basic actions such as "ROLL" and "END TURN," with justifications suggesting limited strategic depth. Example: "Rolling is necessary to progress the game state."
- **Neutral Heuristic Scoring**: Actions often evaluated with a low heuristic score (`1`). This indicates the heuristic system fails to differentiate between strategic actions.
- **Misalignment**: High-priority actions like "BUILD_CITY" or "BUILD_SETTLEMENT" seem underutilized, despite occasional high heuristic scores visible in logs. 

### Errors, Warnings, or Signs of Implementation Issues:
- **LLM Integration Weakness**: Responses imply poor decision quality by prioritizing roll/end-turn actions excessively. This indicates the prompt design and parsing mechanisms need refinement.
- **Strategic Gaps**: Failure to build roads or utilize army resources, even across multiple turns, suggests severe strategic deficiencies. The game log reinforces these gaps.
- **Warning**: Logs frequently state "Fallback mechanism applied," implying reliance on basic action prioritization rather than effective LLM outputs.

After Running The New foo_player.py Player, Here is my analysis and findings:

### Syntax Error Details:
- **Error Message**: `AttributeError: 'Action' object has no attribute 'location'`
- **Exact Line Number**: Line 90 in `foo_player.py`
- **Exact Line of Code**: `score = 8 + (3 if action.location.resource_value > 15 else 0)`

### Root Cause:
The `Action` class used in the code does not have an attribute `location`. This issue arises within the `_compute_heuristic_scores` method when attempting to access non-existent properties of the `Action` object.

### Impact:
This syntax error prevents the game from running, leading to no recorded results or scores for this evolution.

AttributeError: 'Game' object has no attribute 'get_player_resources'================================ Human Message =================================

After Running The New foo_player.py Player, Here is my analysis and findings:

### Syntax Error Details:
- **Error Message**: `AttributeError: 'Game' object has no attribute 'get_player_resources'`
- **Exact Line Number**: Line 84 in `foo_player.py`
- **Exact Line of Code**: `resources=str(game.get_player_resources(Color.BLUE)),  # Example method to get resources`

### Root Cause:
The method `get_player_resources` is being called on the `Game` object, but it does not exist in the `Game` class, leading to an `AttributeError`. This indicates a mismatch between the game's API and the implementation in `foo_player.py`.

### Impact:
The syntax error prevents the game from running, and thus no game results were recorded for this evolution.

Let me know if you need anything else!================================== Ai Message ==================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Refactor FooPlayer to work seamlessly with the Catanatron API while continuing to enhance strategic decision-making via heuristic integration and LLM refinement. Achieve compatibility and avoid critical runtime errors in the next evolution to allow for testing and evaluation.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Resolve the `AttributeError` by ensuring that `foo_player.py` uses valid methods from the Catanatron `Game` class for retrieving player resources and other game state data. Validate the compatibility of all API calls in the `_build_prompt` method.

CHOSEN AGENT: RESEARCHER

AGENT OBJECTIVE: 
Identify the correct way to access the following game state information from the Catanatron API:
1. Player resources (e.g., wood, brick, grain, etc.) for a specific color (e.g., `Color.BLUE`).
2. Obtain other player and game statistics that might be relevant for building the LLM prompt (e.g., settlements, cities, roads, VP).
3. Provide a list of valid Game API methods and properties that could be helpful for efficiently querying such state details.

Ensure that the information provided directly addresses the API compatibility issues in `foo_player.py`.================================ Human Message =================================

RESEARCH:

#### Key Information on Accessing Game State Using Catanatron API

**1. Accessing Player Resources**
To retrieve resources (e.g., wood, brick, grain, etc.) for a specific player:
- Use the `get_player_freqdeck(state, color)` function, which provides the player's resource frequency deck.
  ```python
  from catanatron.state_functions import get_player_freqdeck
  player_resources = get_player_freqdeck(state, Color.BLUE)
  ```
- `player_num_resource_cards(state, color, resource)` can query the count for specific resources:
  ```python
  from catanatron.state_functions import player_num_resource_cards
  wood_count = player_num_resource_cards(state, Color.BLUE, "WOOD")
  ```

**2. Accessing Player and Game Statistics**
For settlements, cities, roads, and VP:
- **Settlements**: Use `get_player_buildings(state, color, "SETTLEMENT")` to retrieve settlement IDs of a player:
  ```python
  from catanatron.state_functions import get_player_buildings
  settlements = get_player_buildings(state, Color.BLUE, "SETTLEMENT")
  ```
- **Cities**: Similarly invoke `get_player_buildings(state, color, "CITY")` for city IDs:
  ```python
  cities = get_player_buildings(state, Color.BLUE, "CITY")
  ```
- **Roads Available**: Check roads available using state data:
  ```python
  player_key = player_key(state, Color.BLUE)
  roads_available = state.player_state[f"{player_key}_ROADS_AVAILABLE"]
  ```
- **Victory Points**: Victory points can be checked via:
  ```python
  victory_points = state.player_state[f"{player_key}_ACTUAL_VICTORY_POINTS"]
  ```

**3. General Game State Statistics**
The class `Game` contains the main API-level functions for interacting with game state, including:
- `play_tick()` to advance the game state.
- `winning_color()` to retrieve the player currently winning the game.
- `state.playable_actions` to list the valid actions at the current step.

```python
winning_player = game.winning_color()
playable_options = game.state.playable_actions
```

#### List of Useful Methods and Properties in Game API:
Valid methods within the `Game` class and associated functions:
- `get_player_freqdeck(state, color)` – Retrieves player's resources.
- `player_num_resource_cards(state, color, resource)` – Gets the count for specific resources.
- `player_key(state, color)` – Returns string key for player state.
- `get_player_buildings(state, color, building_type)` – Retrieves player's settlements/cities.
- `state.playable_actions` – Provides the currently executable actions.
- `game.play_tick()` – Advances game state one step.
- `game.winning_color()` – Returns the winning color/player.
- `state.colors` – Lists the colors in the game.

**References:**
1. `catanatron_core/catanatron/game.py` - Contains the Game class and `play_tick`, `winning_color`, `state.playable_actions`.
2. `catanatron_core/catanatron/models/player.py` - Includes player model and decision-making classes.
3. `catanatron_core/catanatron/models/enums.py` - Defines resources, colors, and action types.
4. `catanatron_core/catanatron/models/actions.py` - Includes `get_player_freqdeck`, `player_num_resource_cards`, and `get_player_buildings`.

END RESEARCH.================================== Ai Message ==================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Ensure functionality and compatibility of FooPlayer with the Catanatron API while strengthening the LLM decision-making mechanism in a way that improves strategic performance over the next 5 iterations.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Integrate valid Catanatron API calls into `foo_player.py`'s `_build_prompt` method to fetch relevant game data like resources, settlements, cities, roads, and victory points, and resolve the current `AttributeError` preventing gameplay.

CHOSEN AGENT: CODER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:  
Resolve the `AttributeError` by replacing invalid calls in `foo_player.py` with Catanatron-compatible API calls as outlined in the research:

1. **Resources**:
   - Replace `game.get_player_resources(Color.BLUE)` with `get_player_freqdeck(state, Color.BLUE)` to fetch all resources for FooPlayer.
   - Use `player_num_resource_cards(state, Color.BLUE, resource)` to query specific resource counts.

2. **Settlements and Cities**:
   - Replace invalid calls for settlements/cities with:
     ```python
     get_player_buildings(state, Color.BLUE, "SETTLEMENT")
     get_player_buildings(state, Color.BLUE, "CITY")
     ```

3. **Victory Points and Roads**:
   - Retrieve victory points using:
     ```python
     vp = state.player_state[player_key(state, Color.BLUE) + "_ACTUAL_VICTORY_POINTS"]
     ```
   - Roads remaining:
     ```python
     roads_available = state.player_state[player_key(state, Color.BLUE) + "_ROADS_AVAILABLE"]
     ```

4. **General Updates to `_build_prompt`**:
   - Adjust the prompt to include all valid game stats, ensuring Catanatron API calls function.
   - Include resource counts, settlements, cities, roads, and VP in the formatted prompt structure.

5. **Debugging and Validation**:
   - Add logging to verify data retrieval accuracy during gameplay for resources, actions, and VP.
   - Run a test evolution to confirm the absence of runtime errors.

Update the code to reflect these changes and provide detailed debug logs during testing for validation.================================ Human Message =================================

CODER

### Changes Made:
1. **Replaced Invalid API Calls**:
   - Substituted `game.get_player_resources(Color.BLUE)` with `get_player_freqdeck(state, Color.BLUE)` to correctly fetch resources.
   - Similar replacements made for settlements, cities, victory points, and roads using valid Catanatron API functions: 
     - `get_player_buildings(state, Color.BLUE, "SETTLEMENT")` and `get_player_buildings(state, Color.BLUE, "CITY")` for settlements and cities.
     - Victory points accessed via `state.player_state[f"{player_key(state, Color.BLUE)}_ACTUAL_VICTORY_POINTS"]`.
     - Roads available via `state.player_state[f"{player_key(state, Color.BLUE)}_ROADS_AVAILABLE"]`.

2. **Updated `_build_prompt` Method**:
   - Included new resource and state-fetching methods in the prompt template.
   - Enhanced formatting to make the prompt explainable and consistent with the desired LLM input structure.

3. **Improved Compatibility**:
   - Refactored the game state integration in `_build_prompt` to align with valid methods reliably compatible with the API.

4. **Debugging Enhancements**:
   - Added detailed logging via print statements to verify accurate state data retrieval during gameplay (resources, settlements, cities, heuristic scores).
   - Included error handling for invalid or mismatched LLM responses.

### Notes for the Next Iteration:
- Test how well the new prompt structure works with the LLM's decision-making.
- Monitor logs for resource/state-fetch accuracy and potential mismatches between heuristic scores and LLM responses.

### Testing Recommendations:
- Verify that resources, settlements, cities, and other player stats from the state align with the game's current state through debugging outputs.
- Check if the fallback mechanism handles invalid or ambiguous LLM responses efficiently.

After Running The New foo_player.py Player, Here is my analysis and findings:

### Scores of FooPlayer:
- Wins: 0  
- Average Victory Points (VP): 2.33  
- Average Settlements: 1.67  
- Average Cities: 0.33  
- Average Roads: 0.0  
- Average Largest Army: 0.0  
- Average Development VP: 0.0  

### Short Analysis of Game Output:
- **LLM Interaction**: The LLM responded consistently, but gameplay justification often involved executing mandatory or default actions (e.g., "ROLL" and "END TURN"), suggesting limited strategic depth.
- **Interesting Output**: The heuristic scoring mechanism categorizes actions clearly, but no significant changes to gameplay performance reflect deeper strategy execution.
- **Signs of Issue**: No roads or army development indicates repeated failure to invest strategically in growth areas, despite consistent heuristic scoring.

### Errors, Warnings, or Signs of Implementation Issues:
- **Strategic Weakness**: The absence of victories and poor metrics like roads and army raises concerns about the decision-making quality. 
- **Heuristic Misalignment**: High heuristic scores for actions like "BUILD_ROAD" occasionally appear in the logs but fail to translate into meaningful gameplay progression. 

Let me know if you need anything else!================================== Ai Message ==================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Enhance the decision-making of FooPlayer by refining the strategic priorities directly implemented in both the heuristic framework and LLM prompt responses. Aim to improve measurable metrics such as roads, army, and settlements while moving closer to achieving winning conditions over the next 5 iterations.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Address the strategic weaknesses by introducing a deeper integration of heuristic priorities into the fallback mechanism and improving the clarity in LLM prompt responses to focus on VP growth, road-building, and settlements.

CHOSEN AGENT: STRATEGIZER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:  
Generate 5 improved strategies to address the current shortcomings:
1. Improvements to heuristic scoring that prioritize growth areas (e.g., building roads, achieving Largest Army).
2. Suggestions to alter fallback mechanisms to emphasize strategic contributions (e.g., prioritize roads early-game or settlements near resource-heavy tiles).
3. Refined LLM prompt designs that explicitly guide actions toward VP growth and strategic dominance.
4. Ideas to balance resource accumulation and strategic investments (e.g., cities vs roads) to diversify objectives.
5. Approach to identifying action bottlenecks that lead to stagnation (e.g., repeated patterns of "END TURN" or inefficient action sequences).================================ Human Message =================================

STRATEGY:

### 1. Improvements to Heuristic Scoring
Enhance heuristic scoring to align with strategic growth objectives and quantify the value of actions more effectively:
- **VP-Oriented Scoring**: Add a multiplier for actions directly contributing to Victory Points (e.g., upgrading to cities or building settlements on high-value intersections).
  ```python
  if action.action_type == ActionType.BUILD_SETTLEMENT and action.location.resource_value > threshold:
      heuristic_scores[action] = 10 + action.location.resource_value
  elif action.action_type == ActionType.BUILD_CITY:
      heuristic_scores[action] = 15
  elif action.action_type == ActionType.BUILD_ROAD:
      heuristic_scores[action] = 5 + len(connected_resources)
  ```
- **Dynamic Game Stage Consideration**: Assign higher scores to actions like building roads or settlements in the early game, shifting to cities and army card purchases in later stages based on available resources and board state.
- **Opponent Disruption**: Include metrics for actions that block opponents’ extensions or resource monopolies, such as cutting off road expansions.

---

### 2. Fallback Mechanism Adjustments
Revise the fallback mechanism to prioritize actions that align with broader strategic objectives:
- **Early-Game Priorities**:
  1. **Roads**: Emphasize road-building to expand quickly and secure settlement sites early (calculate heuristic road priority based on proximity to key tiles, e.g., 8/6/9 tiles).
  2. **Settlements**: Focus on openings that increase resource diversity and resource flow.
  ```python
  if len(settlements) < 3 and ActionType.BUILD_SETTLEMENT in actions:
      return next(action for action in actions if action.action_type == ActionType.BUILD_SETTLEMENT)
  ```
- **Late-Game Priorities**:
   - Transition to cities or army card purchases while only building roads/settlements to secure Longest Road or block opponents.
- **Secondary Metrics**:
   - Consider an aggregate utility metric (e.g., resource spillover from connected tiles) to decide between fallback paths.

---

### 3. Refined LLM Prompt Design
Re-orient the LLM prompt to place greater emphasis on VP growth and strategic objectives:
- **Structured Guidance**:
  ```
  You are tasked with growing Victory Points (VP) towards winning conditions. Prioritize actions that directly lead to VP growth (e.g., building settlements/cities or creating roads if expanding settlements is possible). Additionally, consider blocking opponents’ expansion and achieving Longest Road or Largest Army. Here are the factors to consider:
  - VP contributions: How does this action increase Victory Points?
  - Resource optimization: Does this action improve resource variety or frequency?
  - Opponent impact: Does this action hinder opponents?
  ```
- **Action Context and Justification**: Force the LLM to evaluate and justify its decision explicitly with VP and strategic metrics as criteria:
  ```
  Action: {Chosen Action}
  VP Contribution: {Describe how this action contributes to Victory Points or other winning conditions (Longest Road, Largest Army, etc.)}
  Strategic Justification: {Explain why this action is optimal in your current state.}
  ```

---

### 4. Balancing Resource Accumulation and Strategic Investments
Introduce a dynamic system to balance competing objectives like upgrading cities versus building roads:
- **Resource Thresholds**:
   - Maintain a minimum resource reserve (e.g., 3 bricks and 3 wood) for road-building during the early game.
   - Shift to reserving ore and wheat when cities are needed in the late game.
  ```python
  if resources['brick'] > 2 and resources['wood'] > 2 and ActionType.BUILD_ROAD in actions:
      return build_road_action
  elif resources['ore'] > 3 and resources['wheat'] > 2 and ActionType.BUILD_CITY in actions:
      return build_city_action
  ```
- **Investment Diversification**:
   - Build roads as placeholders if resources for settlements or cities are insufficient, keeping future options open.
   - Introduce a trigger to prioritize development cards if no immediate high-value options exist.

---

### 5. Identifying Bottlenecks and Inefficiencies
Implement mechanisms to evaluate and eliminate stagnation in decision-making:
- **Action Tracking**:
  - Track patterns of repetitive actions (e.g., 3 consecutive END TURN actions) and trigger specific re-evaluations for resource optimization or blocking moves.
  - Introduce a "resource stall threshold": If surplus resources accumulate beyond a predefined number, focus on spending them, even on sub-optimal actions.
- **Post-Action Evaluation**:
  - After every game session, log actions with their outcomes (e.g., Did this action result in VP gain or resource improvement?).
  - Use decision heatmaps to identify action sequences that correlate with stagnation (e.g., prolonged road-building with no settlements).
- **Dynamic Decision Adjustment**:
  - Adjust scoring to aggressively penalize repetitive non-contributory actions.
  ```python
  if "END TURN" repeats more than twice:
      print(f"Repeated END TURN actions detected. Prioritizing an alternative action.")
      # Force expansion or development actions here.
  ```

---

### Next Steps:
1. Prioritize enhancing heuristic scoring to drive better early-game performance.
2. Adjust fallback mechanisms to emphasize forward-looking strategies like settlement preparation.
3. Integrate bottleneck detection mechanisms for iteration feedback and adapt the LLM query structure for immediate impact.

END STRATEGY.================================== Ai Message ==================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Implement a strategy that improves both early and late-game decision-making for FooPlayer through advanced heuristics, adjusted fallback mechanisms, and refined LLM prompts, achieving measurable improvements in metrics such as roads, settlements, and victory points.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Integrate enhanced heuristic scoring and dynamic fallback priorities into the decision flow while refining LLM responses for strategic action selection, focusing on VP growth and efficient resource use.

CHOSEN AGENT: CODER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:  
Modify FooPlayer to implement the strategies outlined in the five key areas. Specifically:

1. **Enhance Heuristic Scoring**:
   - Add multipliers for actions directly contributing to Victory Points, such as settlement building and city upgrading.
   - Dynamically adjust scores based on the game stage (early vs. late-game priorities), prioritizing roads and settlements early while focusing on VP-heavy actions late.

2. **Dynamic Fallback Mechanism**:
   - Revise the fallback mechanism to focus on early-game expansion via roads and settlements as placeholders for resource diversity and VP accumulation.
   - Later transition fallback logic to VP-centric actions like city upgrades and development cards.

3. **Refined LLM Prompt**:
   - Update the LLM prompt to emphasize VP growth explicitly.
   - Demand justification for actions based on Victory Points and strategic blocking of opponents.

4. **Resource Threshold Balancing**:
   - Introduce logic for maintaining resource reserves and diversifying investments based on available actions.
   - Trigger placeholder actions like road-building when strategic objectives are temporarily unattainable.

5. **Action Bottleneck Detection**:
   - Implement tracking logic for repetitive unproductive actions (e.g., repeated "END TURN").
   - Adjust decision scoring to discourage stagnation, forcing resource spending or defensive actions when necessary.

Make necessary modifications to the `decide` method and auxiliary functions like `_build_prompt` and `heuristic_scores`. Run a test iteration post-implementation to ensure that the changes positively impact FooPlayer performance.================================ Human Message =================================

        print("Fallback mechanism applied. Defaulting to first available action.")
        return playable_actions[0]
```

### Summary of Changes:
1. **Enhanced Heuristic Scoring**:
   - Incorporated VP contribution into heuristic scores.
   - Adjusted scores dynamically based on roads remaining and game phase.

2. **Dynamic Fallback Priorities**:
   - Modified `_fallback_action` to prioritize actions strategically based on early vs. late-game aims.
   - Incorporated a priority order that promotes building cities, settlements, and roads.

3. **Refined LLM Prompt**:
   - Expanded the prompt to focus on VP, resource diversity, and opponent impact.
   - Included heuristic scores for LLM guidance and decision alignment.

4. **Improved Error and Response Handling**:
   - Enhanced `_parse_llm_response` to handle ambiguous LLM outputs.
   - Included detailed print logs during fallback decisions.

### Next Steps:
- Test the updated `FooPlayer` against increasingly challenging opponents to evaluate performance.
- Monitor logs, especially during fallback actions, for adjustments to scoring weights or LLM alignment.
- Incrementally refine heuristic values and prompt details based on test outcomes.

After Running The New foo_player.py Player, Here is my analysis and findings:

### Scores of FooPlayer:
- Wins: 0  
- Average Victory Points (VP): 2.6666666666666665  
- Average Settlements: 1.3333333333333333  
- Average Cities: 0.6666666666666666  
- Average Roads: 0.0  
- Average Largest Army: 0.0  
- Average Development VP: 0.0  

### Short Analysis of Game Output:
- **Repetitive Logs**: Multiple instances of LLM responses defaulting to basic actions such as "ROLL" and "END TURN," with justifications suggesting limited strategic depth. Example: "Rolling is necessary to progress the game state."
- **Neutral Heuristic Scoring**: Actions often evaluated with a low heuristic score (`1`). This indicates the heuristic system fails to differentiate between strategic actions.
- **Misalignment**: High-priority actions like "BUILD_CITY" or "BUILD_SETTLEMENT" seem underutilized, despite occasional high heuristic scores visible in logs. 

### Errors, Warnings, or Signs of Implementation Issues:
- **LLM Integration Weakness**: Responses imply poor decision quality by prioritizing roll/end-turn actions excessively. This indicates the prompt design and parsing mechanisms need refinement.
- **Strategic Gaps**: Failure to build roads or utilize army resources, even across multiple turns, suggests severe strategic deficiencies. The game log reinforces these gaps.
- **Warning**: Logs frequently state "Fallback mechanism applied," implying reliance on basic action prioritization rather than effective LLM outputs.

Let me know if you need anything else!================================== Ai Message ==================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Improve FooPlayer’s strategic depth by refining heuristic accuracy, enhancing LLM prompts to advocate stronger strategic actions, and reducing reliance on the fallback mechanism. Focus on measurable improvements in roads, settlements, and cities over the next 5 iterations.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Address the strategic misalignment by:
1. Refactoring heuristics to better differentiate and prioritize optimal actions (e.g., building roads, settlements, and cities).
2. Revising the LLM prompt design to explicitly prioritize non-default, VP-centric, and impactful actions.
3. Adjusting the fallback mechanism to penalize repetitive default actions and ensure meaningful progression.

CHOSEN AGENT: STRATEGIZER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:  
Provide 5 specific refinements or new strategies to improve FooPlayer’s decision-making system, focusing on the following:
1. How to recalibrate heuristic scoring to strongly favor foundational growth actions like roads and settlements early on.
2. Techniques to adjust prompt design to directly steer the LLM away from repetitive or low-value default actions.
3. Criteria for dynamically detecting high-impact actions (strategic bottlenecks or game pivots) and encouraging the LLM or fallback decision to prioritize them.
4. Hybrid mechanisms blending determinate strategic templates for fallback actions alongside heuristic-driven flexibility.
5. Methods to evaluate and tune the heuristic scoring weights and LLM response handling over multiple evolutions, ensuring consistent improvement in strategic metrics.================================ Human Message =================================

STRATEGY:

### 1. Recalibrating Heuristic Scoring for Early Foundational Growth
Refine the heuristic scoring system to prioritize foundational growth actions, particularly during the early game:
- **Dynamic Weight Adjustments for Game Stages**:
  - **Early Game**:
    - Roads: Score 10 (high priority for expansion).
    - Settlements: Score 8 (emphasize resource diversity and availability).
    - Cities: Score 5 (lower priority due to resource scarcity early on).
  - **Mid to Late Game**:
    - Settlements: Score 10 (needed for reaching VP thresholds).
    - Cities: Score 15 (maximize VP by converting settlements to cities).
    - Roads: Score 7 (focus on Longest Road or movement towards strategic settlement spots).  
- **Tile Resource Heuristic**:
  - Assign weighted scores to actions based on resource tile priority:
    - High-Value Tiles: Prioritize intersections with tiles like 6, 8 (ore/wheat bonuses), increasing the heuristic scores of these actions.
    ```python
    if action.action_type == ActionType.BUILD_SETTLEMENT and action.location.resource_value > 15:
        heuristic_scores[action] += 3  # Boost for high-value tiles
    ```
- **Disruption Consideration**:
  - Actions that block opponent growth (road connections or settlements) receive a bonus.

---

### 2. Adjusting Prompt Design to Guide the LLM Towards High-Impact Actions
Update the LLM prompt construction to explicitly penalize repetitive or low-value actions and focus on strategic, VP-driving goals:
- **Segmented Descriptions with Action Prioritization**:
  ```
  You are tasked with making the most impactful move in the Catanatron Minigame. Always prioritize actions with long-term strategic benefits over short-term results. Avoid repetitive, low-impact actions like ending turns without building to progress.
  
  Current Priorities:
  1. Expand settlements and roads for resource variety and VP growth.
  2. Upgrade settlements to cities to maximize VP.
  3. Act to hinder opponents’ expansion when possible.
  
  Consider the following heuristic scores and game state in your decision:
  ```
  - Add structured fields for each action to explicitly indicate their heuristic weight, stage relevance, and potential impact:
    ```
    Action: {Action}
    Heuristic Score: {Score}
    Stage Priority: {Early/Mid/Late Game Relevance}
    Impact: {How this action will improve VP or hinder opponents}
    ```

---

### 3. Dynamic Detection of High-Impact Actions (Bottlenecks or Game Pivots)
Introduce dynamic logic to identify and prioritize high-impact actions during pivotal game moments:
- **Bottleneck Identification**:
  - Detect signs of resource stagnation or unspent resources (e.g., excessive ore/wheat without city upgrades or brick/wood without roads/settlements).
  ```python
  if player_resources['brick'] >= 3 and player_resources['wood'] >= 3:
      heuristic_scores[ActionType.BUILD_ROAD] += 5  # Encourage spending surplus
  ```
  - Time-based triggers: Penalize repeated "END TURN" or fallback actions and boost the use of active building moves.
- **Strategic Pivot Boosting**:
  - Add bonuses to actions when triggered by game-specific pivots:
    - Longest Road: Encourage roads when near the threshold for Longest Road.
    - Largest Army: Prioritize development card purchases when competing for Largest Army or sabotaging opponents.
    ```python
    if current_army_size >= 2 and opponents_army_size <= current_army_size:
        heuristic_scores[action] += 4  # Edge out Largest Army
    ```

---

### 4. Hybrid Mechanisms for Fallback Actions
Redesign the fallback system to incorporate both deterministic templates and heuristic-driven flexibility:
- **Action Templates by Priority**:
  - Use deterministic logic based on game stage:
    - Early Game: Build roads and settlements to ensure resource coverage.
    - Mid-Late Game: Prioritize cities for VP growth or roads for Longest Road.
  ```python
  for action_type in ["BUILD_CITY", "BUILD_SETTLEMENT", "BUILD_ROAD"]:
      for action in playable_actions:
          if action.action_type == action_type and action meets_conditions:
              return action
  ```
- **Heuristic-Fallback Hybrid**:
  - If no deterministic action is suitable, rely on heuristic priorities derived from current state evaluations to make fallback decisions.
- **Penalty for Stagnation**:
  - Penalize fallback repetitions by gradually increasing the weight on impactful actions like settlement-building or resource diversity improvements.

---

### 5. Methods to Evaluate and Refine Heuristics and LLM Response Handling
Design a structured framework for tuning heuristics and refining LLM responses over multiple game iterations:
- **Performance Metrics**:
  - Track metrics such as VP growth per iteration, total roads/cities/settlements built, and resource efficiency (unused resources).
  - Correlate LLM responses and fallback heuristic effectiveness with game outcomes.
- **Iterative Weight Adjustment**:
  - Analyze N-game results to adjust heuristic weights dynamically:
    - If too many roads are built without follow-up settlements, reduce road priority.
    - If city upgrades lead to stagnation due to resource imbalances, shift the weighting back to settlements.
  ```python
  if settlements_built < expected_settlement_threshold:
      heuristic_weights['BUILD_SETTLEMENT'] += 2
  ```
- **Benchmarking Against Rule-Based Baselines**:
  - Compare LLM-driven decisions with predefined optimal or rule-based actions to evaluate alignment with strategic goals.
  - Use deviation scores to identify areas where LLM prompts need refinement (e.g., under-prioritizing Largest Army or Longest Road).

---

### Next Steps:
1. Begin recalibrating heuristic scores to reflect stage-specific priorities.
2. Implement the updated prompt design to explicitly guide LLM responses toward non-repetitive, VP-centric strategies.
3. Integrate fallback mechanisms with dynamic, bottleneck-based adjustments to address stagnation and repeated default actions.
4. Build tools for iterative heuristic tuning and response evaluation against predefined baselines.

END STRATEGY.================================== Ai Message ==================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Over the next 5 iterations, implement and refine a system that better aligns FooPlayer's heuristic evaluation, LLM prompt design, and fallback mechanisms towards impactful, VP-driven actions. Aim for measurable improvements in foundational metrics like roads, settlements, and cities.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Recalibrate FooPlayer's heuristic scoring system to implement stage-specific priorities and dynamically address bottlenecks, ensuring better alignment between heuristic-driven actions and LLM output. Update the LLM prompt design to explicitly focus on VP growth and reduce low-value decision patterns.

CHOSEN AGENT: CODER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:  
Update `foo_player.py` as follows:

1. **Enhanced Heuristic Scoring**: 
    - Modify `_compute_heuristic_scores` to include stage-specific priorities:
      - Early-game boosts for roads and settlements.
      - Late-game emphasis on cities and development cards.
    - Include dynamic bottle-neck handling, e.g.:
      - Reward actions that address resource buildup or stagnation.
      - Encourage actions that disrupt opponents (e.g., blocking roads/settlements).
    - Use tile values (6, 8, etc.) to boost settlement scores for strategic intersections.

2. **Refined LLM Prompt**:
    - Update `_build_prompt` with stronger emphasis on guiding actions toward VP and strategic goals:
      - Enumerate priorities explicitly: building roads, settlements, cities.
      - Include heuristic scores in the prompt with descriptions of why actions are valuable.
      - Penalize repetitive actions like "END TURN" through explicit discouragement in the prompt.

3. **Fallback Mechanism Adjustment**:
    - Introduce deterministic templates for stage-specific fallback actions:
      - Early-game: Prioritize roads and settlements for expansion.
      - Late-game: Focus on cities and VP-centric actions.
    - Dynamically adapt fallback decisions based on resource surplus or game state bottlenecks.
    ```python
    if player_resources["brick"] >= 3 and player_resources["wood"] >= 3:
        heuristic_scores[ActionType.BUILD_ROAD] += 5
    ```

4. **Action Bottleneck Detection**:
    - Add detection for repetitive or stagnating actions (e.g., unspent resources or repeated "END TURN").
    - Penalize stagnation by prioritizing resource expenditure and spatial expansion.

Upon completing the updates, test the revised player for functional improvements in decision-making, focusing on roads, settlements, and overall strategic progression.================================ Human Message =================================

CODER

### Updates to `foo_player.py`:
1. **Enhanced Heuristic Scoring**:
   - Integrated stage-specific priorities (e.g., roads and settlements emphasized early-game, cities in mid-late game).
   - Added bonuses for high-resource tiles in settlement actions.
   - Introduced penalties to address resource bottlenecks (e.g., surplus brick/wood triggers road-building incentives).
   - Incorporated logic to dynamically adjust scores based on resource availability and VP contributions.

2. **Refined LLM Prompt**:
   - Redesigned `_build_prompt` to better guide the LLM:
     - Explicit priorities for strategic actions based on Victory Point (VP) growth.
     - Highlighted roadmap for early-game road/settlement building and late-game upgrades.
     - Discouraged repetitive or non-impactful actions like unnecessary turns.
   - Included heuristic scores in the prompt, with explanations for why certain actions are prioritized.

3. **Dynamic Fallback Mechanism**:
   - Structured fallback logic to prioritize actions based on game state:
     - Early-game: Roads and settlements.
     - Late-game: Cities and VP-centric actions.
   - Updated fallback mechanism to prevent stagnation by using deterministic templates blended with heuristic-driven conditions.

4. **Bottleneck and Surplus Resource Handling**:
   - Added logic to detect and dynamically handle situations where surplus resources exist (e.g., incentivizing road-building on excess brick/wood).
   - Increased priority for settlement or city building to resolve resource stagnation.

5. **Improved Logs**:
   - Added meaningful print statements across key decision-making steps to facilitate debugging:
     - Fallback actions.
     - Detected bottlenecks or resource imbalances.
     - LLM responses (and when fallback mechanisms are triggered).

### Testing Suggestions:
- **Evaluate Decision Quality**:
  - Test early-game actions for expansion focus (roads and settlements).
  - Verify mid-to-late game actions prioritize cities and VP-centric plays.
- **Monitor Bottleneck Response**:
  - Simulate resource-rich scenarios to observe if surplus resources are properly spent.
- **Validate Fallback Logic**:
  - Conduct games where the LLM fails or incorrectly parses the prompt to assess fallback success.
- **Track Metrics**:
  - Compare average VP, settlements, and city counts across multiple iterations to previous versions.

### Next Steps:
- Refine heuristic weights after testing to balance strategic trade-offs.
- Incorporate feedback cycles to analyze and further tune prompt alignment with heuristic evaluations.
- Observe repetitive "END TURN" penalties and ensure they improve game progression.

AttributeError: 'Action' object has no attribute 'location'================================ Human Message =================================

After Running The New foo_player.py Player, Here is my analysis and findings:

### Syntax Error Details:
- **Error Message**: `AttributeError: 'Action' object has no attribute 'location'`
- **Exact Line Number**: Line 90 in `foo_player.py`
- **Exact Line of Code**: `score = 8 + (3 if action.location.resource_value > 15 else 0)`

### Root Cause:
The `Action` class used in the code does not have an attribute `location`. This issue arises within the `_compute_heuristic_scores` method when attempting to access non-existent properties of the `Action` object.

### Impact:
This syntax error prevents the game from running, leading to no recorded results or scores for this evolution.

Let me know if you need anything else!================================== Ai Message ==================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Ensure FooPlayer's compatibility with the Catanatron API by resolving syntax errors and accurately utilizing the `Action` class attributes. Stabilize gameplay to allow evaluation of performance metrics over the next five iterations.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Fix the `AttributeError` by removing invalid references to the nonexistent `location` property in the `Action` class. Correct the scoring logic in `_compute_heuristic_scores` and replace erroneous calls with valid attributes from the `Action` class or game state.

CHOSEN AGENT: RESEARCHER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:  
Investigate the valid attributes and methods available in the `Action` class within the Catanatron API. Specifically:
1. Determine how to access the location or resource value associated with an action (if applicable).
2. Provide documentation or examples on other valid attributes of `Action` that might be relevant for heuristic scoring.
3. If no direct way exists to link `Action` to resource tiles or locations, suggest alternative ways to retrieve this context from the `Game` or `State` class for heuristic calculations.

Ensure the information is precise and actionable to debug and resolve the issue effectively.================================ Human Message =================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Refactor FooPlayer to work seamlessly with the Catanatron API while continuing to enhance strategic decision-making via heuristic integration and LLM refinement. Achieve compatibility and avoid critical runtime errors in the next evolution to allow for testing and evaluation.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Resolve the `AttributeError` by ensuring that `foo_player.py` uses valid methods from the Catanatron `Game` class for retrieving player resources and other game state data. Validate the compatibility of all API calls in the `_build_prompt` method.

CHOSEN AGENT: RESEARCHER

AGENT OBJECTIVE: 
Identify the correct way to access the following game state information from the Catanatron API:
1. Player resources (e.g., wood, brick, grain, etc.) for a specific color (e.g., `Color.BLUE`).
2. Obtain other player and game statistics that might be relevant for building the LLM prompt (e.g., settlements, cities, roads, VP).
3. Provide a list of valid Game API methods and properties that could be helpful for efficiently querying such state details.

Ensure that the information provided directly addresses the API compatibility issues in `foo_player.py`.================================== Ai Message ==================================

RESEARCH:

#### Key Information on Accessing Game State Using Catanatron API

**1. Accessing Player Resources**
To retrieve resources (e.g., wood, brick, grain, etc.) for a specific player:
- Use the `get_player_freqdeck(state, color)` function, which provides the player's resource frequency deck.
  ```python
  from catanatron.state_functions import get_player_freqdeck
  player_resources = get_player_freqdeck(state, Color.BLUE)
  ```
- `player_num_resource_cards(state, color, resource)` can query the count for specific resources:
  ```python
  from catanatron.state_functions import player_num_resource_cards
  wood_count = player_num_resource_cards(state, Color.BLUE, "WOOD")
  ```

**2. Accessing Player and Game Statistics**
For settlements, cities, roads, and VP:
- **Settlements**: Use `get_player_buildings(state, color, "SETTLEMENT")` to retrieve settlement IDs of a player:
  ```python
  from catanatron.state_functions import get_player_buildings
  settlements = get_player_buildings(state, Color.BLUE, "SETTLEMENT")
  ```
- **Cities**: Similarly invoke `get_player_buildings(state, color, "CITY")` for city IDs:
  ```python
  cities = get_player_buildings(state, Color.BLUE, "CITY")
  ```
- **Roads Available**: Check roads available using state data:
  ```python
  player_key = player_key(state, Color.BLUE)
  roads_available = state.player_state[f"{player_key}_ROADS_AVAILABLE"]
  ```
- **Victory Points**: Victory points can be checked via:
  ```python
  victory_points = state.player_state[f"{player_key}_ACTUAL_VICTORY_POINTS"]
  ```

**3. General Game State Statistics**
The class `Game` contains the main API-level functions for interacting with game state, including:
- `play_tick()` to advance the game state.
- `winning_color()` to retrieve the player currently winning the game.
- `state.playable_actions` to list the valid actions at the current step.

```python
winning_player = game.winning_color()
playable_options = game.state.playable_actions
```

#### List of Useful Methods and Properties in Game API:
Valid methods within the `Game` class and associated functions:
- `get_player_freqdeck(state, color)` – Retrieves player's resources.
- `player_num_resource_cards(state, color, resource)` – Gets the count for specific resources.
- `player_key(state, color)` – Returns string key for player state.
- `get_player_buildings(state, color, building_type)` – Retrieves player's settlements/cities.
- `state.playable_actions` – Provides the currently executable actions.
- `game.play_tick()` – Advances game state one step.
- `game.winning_color()` – Returns the winning color/player.
- `state.colors` – Lists the colors in the game.

**References:**
1. `catanatron_core/catanatron/game.py` - Contains the Game class and `play_tick`, `winning_color`, `state.playable_actions`.
2. `catanatron_core/catanatron/models/player.py` - Includes player model and decision-making classes.
3. `catanatron_core/catanatron/models/enums.py` - Defines resources, colors, and action types.
4. `catanatron_core/catanatron/models/actions.py` - Includes `get_player_freqdeck`, `player_num_resource_cards`, and `get_player_buildings`.

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Ensure FooPlayer's compatibility with the Catanatron API by resolving syntax errors and accurately utilizing the `Action` class attributes. Stabilize gameplay to allow evaluation of performance metrics over the next five iterations.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Fix the `AttributeError` by removing invalid references to the nonexistent `location` property in the `Action` class. Correct the scoring logic in `_compute_heuristic_scores` and replace erroneous calls with valid attributes from the `Action` class or game state.

CHOSEN AGENT: RESEARCHER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:  
Investigate the valid attributes and methods available in the `Action` class within the Catanatron API. Specifically:
1. Determine how to access the location or resource value associated with an action (if applicable).
2. Provide documentation or examples on other valid attributes of `Action` that might be relevant for heuristic scoring.
3. If no direct way exists to link `Action` to resource tiles or locations, suggest alternative ways to retrieve this context from the `Game` or `State` class for heuristic calculations.

Ensure the information is precise and actionable to debug and resolve the issue effectively.================================== Ai Message ==================================

        actions (List[Action]): Log of all actions taken. Fully-specified actions.
        num_turns (int): number of turns thus far
        current_player_index (int): index per colors array of player that should be
            making a decision now. Not necesarilly the same as current_turn_index
            because there are out-of-turn decisions like discarding.
        current_turn_index (int): index per colors array of player whose turn is it.
        current_prompt (ActionPrompt): DEPRECATED. Not needed; use is_initial_build_phase,

RESEARCH:

### Investigation of the `Action` Class and Related Attributes
The `Action` class is part of the core mechanics for handling user actions during the gameplay. Here's the context based on the files:

#### 1. Valid Attributes of the `Action` Class
The `Action` class is defined and utilized in multiple modules. Its attributes are:
- **`color`**: Represents the player's color (e.g., `Color.BLUE`).
- **`action_type`**: Identifies the type of action (e.g., `ActionType.BUILD_SETTLEMENT`, `ActionType.PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD`).
- **`value`**: The specific content of the action based on its type. For example:
  - `Build actions` (`BUILD_SETTLEMENT`, `BUILD_CITY`) use `value` to represent the node location (`node_id`). 
  - `BUILD_ROAD` uses an `edge` object as its `value`.
  - In `MOVE_ROBBER`, `value` is a tuple such as `(coordinate, robbed_color, robbed_resource)`.

Attributes cannot directly reference nonexistent properties, such as `location`.

#### 2. Documentation and Examples of Related Action Types
Key samples of `Action` usage based on the context:
- **Action Initialization**:
  ```python
  Action(color, ActionType.BUILD_SETTLEMENT, node_id)
  Action(color, ActionType.MOVE_ROBBER, (coordinate, enemy_color, resource))
  Action(color, ActionType.ROLL, dice_roll_result)
  ```
- **Examples of Valid `ActionType` Values**:
  - Actions related to resource handling: `ROLL`, `MARITIME_TRADE`, `PLAY_YEAR_OF_PLENTY`, `PLAY_MONOPOLY`.
  - Building-related actions: `BUILD_ROAD`, `BUILD_SETTLEMENT`, `BUILD_CITY`.
  - Development cards and robber actions: `PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD`, `MOVE_ROBBER`.

#### 3. Accessing Location and Resource Context for an `Action`
The `Action` class itself does not store location or resource details unless explicitly set using the `value` attribute.

##### Alternatives for Accessing Context:
- **From the Game State (`State` Class)**:
  - To retrieve the current player's buildings (settlements, roads, etc.) or check surroundings:
    ```python
    buildings = state.buildings_by_color[Color.BLUE]
    settlements = buildings[SETTLEMENT]
    cities = buildings[CITY]
    ```
  - To get adjacent resource tiles for a node:
    ```python
    adjacent_tiles = state.board.map.adjacent_tiles[node_id]
    resources = [tile.resource for tile in adjacent_tiles if tile.resource is not None]
    ```
  - To get the bank's resource availability:
    ```python
    state.resource_freqdeck  # Bank’s current resources
    ```

- **Using `Action.value` for Specific Action Contexts**:
  In specific cases like building or moving, `Action.value` already provides relevant location-like data:
  - For building roads: Retrieve edges with `Action.value`.
  - For building settlements/cities: Use `node_id` from `Action.value`.

#### 4. Valid Methods for Game and State Interactions
Key methods/functions from the `Game` and `State`:
- **`Game` Class**:
  - `play_tick()`: Executes one game tick.
  - `winning_color()`: Returns the player currently winning the game.
  - `execute(action: Action)`: Executes a given action for a player.
  
- **`State` Class**:
  - `state.playable_actions`: Returns a list of actions currently available.
  - `state.board.buildable_node_ids(color)`: Returns node IDs where the player can build.
  - `state.player_state`: Dictionary containing details for each player (e.g., `Color.BLUE_CITIES_AVAILABLE`, `Color.BLUE_HAS_ROLLED`).

---

##### Additional Notes:
If there is a dependency on parsing `location` or `tile` data, it should instead rely on `Action.value` explicitly or query the `State` for adjacent tiles or positions as outlined above.

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Refactor FooPlayer to work seamlessly with the Catanatron API while continuing to enhance strategic decision-making via heuristic integration and LLM refinement. Achieve compatibility and avoid critical runtime errors in the next evolution to allow for testing and evaluation.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Resolve the `AttributeError` by ensuring that `foo_player.py` uses valid methods from the Catanatron `Game` class for retrieving player resources and other game state data. Validate the compatibility of all API calls in the `_build_prompt` method.

CHOSEN AGENT: RESEARCHER

AGENT OBJECTIVE: 
Identify the correct way to access the following game state information from the Catanatron API:
1. Player resources (e.g., wood, brick, grain, etc.) for a specific color (e.g., `Color.BLUE`).
2. Obtain other player and game statistics that might be relevant for building the LLM prompt (e.g., settlements, cities, roads, VP).
3. Provide a list of valid Game API methods and properties that could be helpful for efficiently querying such state details.

#### Key Information on Accessing Game State Using Catanatron API

**1. Accessing Player Resources**
To retrieve resources (e.g., wood, brick, grain, etc.) for a specific player:
- Use the `get_player_freqdeck(state, color)` function, which provides the player's resource frequency deck.
  ```python
  from catanatron.state_functions import get_player_freqdeck
  player_resources = get_player_freqdeck(state, Color.BLUE)
  ```
- `player_num_resource_cards(state, color, resource)` can query the count for specific resources:
  ```python
  from catanatron.state_functions import player_num_resource_cards
  wood_count = player_num_resource_cards(state, Color.BLUE, "WOOD")
  ```

**2. Accessing Player and Game Statistics**
For settlements, cities, roads, and VP:
- **Settlements**: Use `get_player_buildings(state, color, "SETTLEMENT")` to retrieve settlement IDs of a player:
  ```python
  from catanatron.state_functions import get_player_buildings
  settlements = get_player_buildings(state, Color.BLUE, "SETTLEMENT")
  ```
- **Cities**: Similarly invoke `get_player_buildings(state, color, "CITY")` for city IDs:
  ```python
  cities = get_player_buildings(state, Color.BLUE, "CITY")
  ```
- **Roads Available**: Check roads available using state data:
  ```python
  player_key = player_key(state, Color.BLUE)
  roads_available = state.player_state[f"{player_key}_ROADS_AVAILABLE"]
  ```
- **Victory Points**: Victory points can be checked via:
  ```python
  victory_points = state.player_state[f"{player_key}_ACTUAL_VICTORY_POINTS"]
  ```

**3. General Game State Statistics**
The class `Game` contains the main API-level functions for interacting with game state, including:
- `play_tick()` to advance the game state.
- `winning_color()` to retrieve the player currently winning the game.
- `state.playable_actions` to list the valid actions at the current step.

```python
winning_player = game.winning_color()
playable_options = game.state.playable_actions
```

#### List of Useful Methods and Properties in Game API:
Valid methods within the `Game` class and associated functions:
- `get_player_freqdeck(state, color)` – Retrieves player's resources.
- `player_num_resource_cards(state, color, resource)` – Gets the count for specific resources.

END RESEARCH.================================== Ai Message ==================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Ensure functionality and compatibility of FooPlayer with the Catanatron API while strengthening the LLM decision-making mechanism in a way that improves strategic performance over the next 5 iterations.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Integrate valid Catanatron API calls into `foo_player.py`'s `_build_prompt` method to fetch relevant game data like resources, settlements, cities, roads, and victory points, and resolve the current `AttributeError` preventing gameplay.

CHOSEN AGENT: CODER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:  
Resolve the `AttributeError` by replacing invalid calls in `foo_player.py` with Catanatron-compatible API calls as outlined in the research:

1. **Resources**:
   - Replace `game.get_player_resources(Color.BLUE)` with `get_player_freqdeck(state, Color.BLUE)` to fetch all resources for FooPlayer.
   - Use `player_num_resource_cards(state, Color.BLUE, resource)` to query specific resource counts.

2. **Settlements and Cities**:
   - Replace invalid calls for settlements/cities with:
     ```python
     get_player_buildings(state, Color.BLUE, "SETTLEMENT")
     get_player_buildings(state, Color.BLUE, "CITY")
     ```

3. **Victory Points and Roads**:
   - Retrieve victory points using:
     ```python
     vp = state.player_state[player_key(state, Color.BLUE) + "_ACTUAL_VICTORY_POINTS"]
     ```
   - Roads remaining:
     ```python
     roads_available = state.player_state[player_key(state, Color.BLUE) + "_ROADS_AVAILABLE"]
     ```

4. **General Updates to `_build_prompt`**:
   - Adjust the prompt to include all valid game stats, ensuring Catanatron API calls function.
   - Include resource counts, settlements, cities, roads, and VP in the formatted prompt structure.

5. **Debugging and Validation**:
   - Add logging to verify data retrieval accuracy during gameplay for resources, actions, and VP.
   - Run a test evolution to confirm the absence of runtime errors.

Update the code to reflect these changes and provide detailed debug logs during testing for validation.================================ Human Message =================================

CODER

### Changes Made:
1. **Replaced Invalid API Calls**:
   - Substituted `game.get_player_resources(Color.BLUE)` with `get_player_freqdeck(state, Color.BLUE)` to correctly fetch resources.
   - Similar replacements made for settlements, cities, victory points, and roads using valid Catanatron API functions: 
     - `get_player_buildings(state, Color.BLUE, "SETTLEMENT")` and `get_player_buildings(state, Color.BLUE, "CITY")` for settlements and cities.
     - Victory points accessed via `state.player_state[f"{player_key(state, Color.BLUE)}_ACTUAL_VICTORY_POINTS"]`.
     - Roads available via `state.player_state[f"{player_key(state, Color.BLUE)}_ROADS_AVAILABLE"]`.

2. **Updated `_build_prompt` Method**:
   - Included new resource and state-fetching methods in the prompt template.
   - Enhanced formatting to make the prompt explainable and consistent with the desired LLM input structure.

3. **Improved Compatibility**:
   - Refactored the game state integration in `_build_prompt` to align with valid methods reliably compatible with the API.

4. **Debugging Enhancements**:
   - Added detailed logging via print statements to verify accurate state data retrieval during gameplay (resources, settlements, cities, heuristic scores).
   - Included error handling for invalid or mismatched LLM responses.

### Notes for the Next Iteration:
- Test how well the new prompt structure works with the LLM's decision-making.
- Monitor logs for resource/state-fetch accuracy and potential mismatches between heuristic scores and LLM responses.

### Testing Recommendations:
- Verify that resources, settlements, cities, and other player stats from the state align with the game's current state through debugging outputs.
- Check if the fallback mechanism handles invalid or ambiguous LLM responses efficiently.

After Running The New foo_player.py Player, Here is my analysis and findings:

### Scores of FooPlayer:
- Wins: 0  
- Average Victory Points (VP): 2.33  
- Average Settlements: 1.67  
- Average Cities: 0.33  
- Average Roads: 0.0  
- Average Largest Army: 0.0  
- Average Development VP: 0.0  

### Short Analysis of Game Output:
- **LLM Interaction**: The LLM responded consistently, but gameplay justification often involved executing mandatory or default actions (e.g., "ROLL" and "END TURN"), suggesting limited strategic depth.
- **Interesting Output**: The heuristic scoring mechanism categorizes actions clearly, but no significant changes to gameplay performance reflect deeper strategy execution.
- **Signs of Issue**: No roads or army development indicates repeated failure to invest strategically in growth areas, despite consistent heuristic scoring.

### Errors, Warnings, or Signs of Implementation Issues:
- **Strategic Weakness**: The absence of victories and poor metrics like roads and army raises concerns about the decision-making quality. 
- **Heuristic Misalignment**: High heuristic scores for actions like "BUILD_ROAD" occasionally appear in the logs but fail to translate into meaningful gameplay progression. 

Let me know if you need anything else!================================== Ai Message ==================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Enhance the decision-making of FooPlayer by refining the strategic priorities directly implemented in both the heuristic framework and LLM prompt responses. Aim to improve measurable metrics such as roads, army, and settlements while moving closer to achieving winning conditions over the next 5 iterations.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Address the strategic weaknesses by introducing a deeper integration of heuristic priorities into the fallback mechanism and improving the clarity in LLM prompt responses to focus on VP growth, road-building, and settlements.

CHOSEN AGENT: STRATEGIZER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:  
Generate 5 improved strategies to address the current shortcomings:
1. Improvements to heuristic scoring that prioritize growth areas (e.g., building roads, achieving Largest Army).
2. Suggestions to alter fallback mechanisms to emphasize strategic contributions (e.g., prioritize roads early-game or settlements near resource-heavy tiles).
3. Refined LLM prompt designs that explicitly guide actions toward VP growth and strategic dominance.
4. Ideas to balance resource accumulation and strategic investments (e.g., cities vs roads) to diversify objectives.
5. Approach to identifying action bottlenecks that lead to stagnation (e.g., repeated patterns of "END TURN" or inefficient action sequences).================================ Human Message =================================

STRATEGY:

### 1. Improvements to Heuristic Scoring
Enhance heuristic scoring to align with strategic growth objectives and quantify the value of actions more effectively:
- **VP-Oriented Scoring**: Add a multiplier for actions directly contributing to Victory Points (e.g., upgrading to cities or building settlements on high-value intersections).
  ```python
  if action.action_type == ActionType.BUILD_SETTLEMENT and action.location.resource_value > threshold:
      heuristic_scores[action] = 10 + action.location.resource_value
  elif action.action_type == ActionType.BUILD_CITY:
      heuristic_scores[action] = 15
  elif action.action_type == ActionType.BUILD_ROAD:
      heuristic_scores[action] = 5 + len(connected_resources)
  ```
- **Dynamic Game Stage Consideration**: Assign higher scores to actions like building roads or settlements in the early game, shifting to cities and army card purchases in later stages based on available resources and board state.
- **Opponent Disruption**: Include metrics for actions that block opponents’ extensions or resource monopolies, such as cutting off road expansions.

---

### 2. Fallback Mechanism Adjustments
Revise the fallback mechanism to prioritize actions that align with broader strategic objectives:
- **Early-Game Priorities**:
  1. **Roads**: Emphasize road-building to expand quickly and secure settlement sites early (calculate heuristic road priority based on proximity to key tiles, e.g., 8/6/9 tiles).
  2. **Settlements**: Focus on openings that increase resource diversity and resource flow.
  ```python
  if len(settlements) < 3 and ActionType.BUILD_SETTLEMENT in actions:
      return next(action for action in actions if action.action_type == ActionType.BUILD_SETTLEMENT)
  ```
- **Late-Game Priorities**:
   - Transition to cities or army card purchases while only building roads/settlements to secure Longest Road or block opponents.
- **Secondary Metrics**:
   - Consider an aggregate utility metric (e.g., resource spillover from connected tiles) to decide between fallback paths.

---

### 3. Refined LLM Prompt Design
Re-orient the LLM prompt to place greater emphasis on VP growth and strategic objectives:
- **Structured Guidance**:
  ```
  You are tasked with growing Victory Points (VP) towards winning conditions. Prioritize actions that directly lead to VP growth (e.g., building settlements/cities or creating roads if expanding settlements is possible). Additionally, consider blocking opponents’ expansion and achieving Longest Road or Largest Army. Here are the factors to consider:
  - VP contributions: How does this action increase Victory Points?
  - Resource optimization: Does this action improve resource variety or frequency?
  - Opponent impact: Does this action hinder opponents?
  ```
- **Action Context and Justification**: Force the LLM to evaluate and justify its decision explicitly with VP and strategic metrics as criteria:
  ```
  Action: {Chosen Action}
  VP Contribution: {Describe how this action contributes to Victory Points or other winning conditions (Longest Road, Largest Army, etc.)}
  Strategic Justification: {Explain why this action is optimal in your current state.}
  ```

---

### 4. Balancing Resource Accumulation and Strategic Investments
Introduce a dynamic system to balance competing objectives like upgrading cities versus building roads:
- **Resource Thresholds**:
   - Maintain a minimum resource reserve (e.g., 3 bricks and 3 wood) for road-building during the early game.
   - Shift to reserving ore and wheat when cities are needed in the late game.
  ```python
  if resources['brick'] > 2 and resources['wood'] > 2 and ActionType.BUILD_ROAD in actions:
      return build_road_action
  elif resources['ore'] > 3 and resources['wheat'] > 2 and ActionType.BUILD_CITY in actions:
      return build_city_action
  ```
- **Investment Diversification**:
   - Build roads as placeholders if resources for settlements or cities are insufficient, keeping future options open.
   - Introduce a trigger to prioritize development cards if no immediate high-value options exist.

---

### 5. Identifying Bottlenecks and Inefficiencies
Implement mechanisms to evaluate and eliminate stagnation in decision-making:
- **Action Tracking**:
  - Track patterns of repetitive actions (e.g., 3 consecutive END TURN actions) and trigger specific re-evaluations for resource optimization or blocking moves.
  - Introduce a "resource stall threshold": If surplus resources accumulate beyond a predefined number, focus on spending them, even on sub-optimal actions.
- **Post-Action Evaluation**:
  - After every game session, log actions with their outcomes (e.g., Did this action result in VP gain or resource improvement?).
  - Use decision heatmaps to identify action sequences that correlate with stagnation (e.g., prolonged road-building with no settlements).
- **Dynamic Decision Adjustment**:
  - Adjust scoring to aggressively penalize repetitive non-contributory actions.
  ```python
  if "END TURN" repeats more than twice:
      print(f"Repeated END TURN actions detected. Prioritizing an alternative action.")
      # Force expansion or development actions here.
  ```

---

### Next Steps:
1. Prioritize enhancing heuristic scoring to drive better early-game performance.
2. Adjust fallback mechanisms to emphasize forward-looking strategies like settlement preparation.
3. Integrate bottleneck detection mechanisms for iteration feedback and adapt the LLM query structure for immediate impact.

END STRATEGY.================================== Ai Message ==================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Implement a strategy that improves both early and late-game decision-making for FooPlayer through advanced heuristics, adjusted fallback mechanisms, and refined LLM prompts, achieving measurable improvements in metrics such as roads, settlements, and victory points.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Integrate enhanced heuristic scoring and dynamic fallback priorities into the decision flow while refining LLM responses for strategic action selection, focusing on VP growth and efficient resource use.

CHOSEN AGENT: CODER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:  
Modify FooPlayer to implement the strategies outlined in the five key areas. Specifically:

1. **Enhance Heuristic Scoring**:
   - Add multipliers for actions directly contributing to Victory Points, such as settlement building and city upgrading.
   - Dynamically adjust scores based on the game stage (early vs. late-game priorities), prioritizing roads and settlements early while focusing on VP-heavy actions late.

2. **Dynamic Fallback Mechanism**:
   - Revise the fallback mechanism to focus on early-game expansion via roads and settlements as placeholders for resource diversity and VP accumulation.
   - Later transition fallback logic to VP-centric actions like city upgrades and development cards.

3. **Refined LLM Prompt**:
   - Update the LLM prompt to emphasize VP growth explicitly.
   - Demand justification for actions based on Victory Points and strategic blocking of opponents.

4. **Resource Threshold Balancing**:
   - Introduce logic for maintaining resource reserves and diversifying investments based on available actions.
   - Trigger placeholder actions like road-building when strategic objectives are temporarily unattainable.

5. **Action Bottleneck Detection**:
   - Implement tracking logic for repetitive unproductive actions (e.g., repeated "END TURN").
   - Adjust decision scoring to discourage stagnation, forcing resource spending or defensive actions when necessary.

Make necessary modifications to the `decide` method and auxiliary functions like `_build_prompt` and `heuristic_scores`. Run a test iteration post-implementation to ensure that the changes positively impact FooPlayer performance.================================ Human Message =================================

### Summary of Changes:
1. **Enhanced Heuristic Scoring**:
   - Incorporated VP contribution into heuristic scores.
   - Adjusted scores dynamically based on roads remaining and game phase.

2. **Dynamic Fallback Priorities**:
   - Modified `_fallback_action` to prioritize actions strategically based on early vs. late-game aims.
   - Incorporated a priority order that promotes building cities, settlements, and roads.

3. **Refined LLM Prompt**:
   - Expanded the prompt to focus on VP, resource diversity, and opponent impact.
   - Included heuristic scores for LLM guidance and decision alignment.

4. **Improved Error and Response Handling**:
   - Enhanced `_parse_llm_response` to handle ambiguous LLM outputs.
   - Included detailed print logs during fallback decisions.

### Next Steps:
- Test the updated `FooPlayer` against increasingly challenging opponents to evaluate performance.
- Monitor logs, especially during fallback actions, for adjustments to scoring weights or LLM alignment.
- Incrementally refine heuristic values and prompt details based on test outcomes.

After Running The New foo_player.py Player, Here is my analysis and findings:

### Scores of FooPlayer:
- Wins: 0  
- Average Victory Points (VP): 2.6666666666666665  
- Average Settlements: 1.3333333333333333

- Average Roads: 0.0  
- Average Largest Army: 0.0  
- Average Development VP: 0.0  

### Short Analysis of Game Output:
- **Repetitive Logs**: Multiple instances of LLM responses defaulting to basic actions such as "ROLL" and "END TURN," with justifications suggesting limited strategic depth. Example: "Rolling is necessary to progress the game state."
- **Neutral Heuristic Scoring**: Actions often evaluated with a low heuristic score (`1`). This indicates the heuristic system fails to differentiate between strategic actions.
- **Misalignment**: High-priority actions like "BUILD_CITY" or "BUILD_SETTLEMENT" seem underutilized, despite occasional high heuristic scores visible in logs. 

### Errors, Warnings, or Signs of Implementation Issues:
- **LLM Integration Weakness**: Responses imply poor decision quality by prioritizing roll/end-turn actions excessively. This indicates the prompt design and parsing mechanisms need refinement.
- **Strategic Gaps**: Failure to build roads or utilize army resources, even across multiple turns, suggests severe strategic deficiencies. The game log reinforces these gaps.
- **Warning**: Logs frequently state "Fallback mechanism applied," implying reliance on basic action prioritization rather than effective LLM outputs.

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Improve FooPlayer’s strategic depth by refining heuristic accuracy, enhancing LLM prompts to advocate stronger strategic actions, and reducing reliance on the fallback mechanism. Focus on measurable improvements in roads, settlements, and cities over the next 5 iterations.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Address the strategic misalignment by:
1. Refactoring heuristics to better differentiate and prioritize optimal actions (e.g., building roads, settlements, and cities).
2. Revising the LLM prompt design to explicitly prioritize non-default, VP-centric, and impactful actions.
3. Adjusting the fallback mechanism to penalize repetitive default actions and ensure meaningful progression.

CHOSEN AGENT: STRATEGIZER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:  
Provide 5 specific refinements or new strategies to improve FooPlayer’s decision-making system, focusing on the following:
1. How to recalibrate heuristic scoring to strongly favor foundational growth actions like roads and settlements early on.
2. Techniques to adjust prompt design to directly steer the LLM away from repetitive or low-value default actions.
3. Criteria for dynamically detecting high-impact actions (strategic bottlenecks or game pivots) and encouraging the LLM or fallback decision to prioritize them.
4. Hybrid mechanisms blending determinate strategic templates for fallback actions alongside heuristic-driven flexibility.
5. Methods to evaluate and tune the heuristic scoring weights and LLM response handling over multiple evolutions, ensuring consistent improvement in strategic metrics.================================ Human Message =================================

STRATEGY:

### 1. Recalibrating Heuristic Scoring for Early Foundational Growth
Refine the heuristic scoring system to prioritize foundational growth actions, particularly during the early game:
- **Dynamic Weight Adjustments for Game Stages**:
  - **Early Game**:
    - Roads: Score 10 (high priority for expansion).
    - Settlements: Score 8 (emphasize resource diversity and availability).
    - Cities: Score 5 (lower priority due to resource scarcity early on).
  - **Mid to Late Game**:
    - Settlements: Score 10 (needed for reaching VP thresholds).
    - Cities: Score 15 (maximize VP by converting settlements to cities).
    - Roads: Score 7 (focus on Longest Road or movement towards strategic settlement spots).  
- **Tile Resource Heuristic**:
  - Assign weighted scores to actions based on resource tile priority:
    - High-Value Tiles: Prioritize intersections with tiles like 6, 8 (ore/wheat bonuses), increasing the heuristic scores of these actions.
    ```python
    if action.action_type == ActionType.BUILD_SETTLEMENT and action.location.resource_value > 15:
        heuristic_scores[action] += 3  # Boost for high-value tiles
    ```
- **Disruption Consideration**:
  - Actions that block opponent growth (road connections or settlements) receive a bonus.

---

### 2. Adjusting Prompt Design to Guide the LLM Towards High-Impact Actions
Update the LLM prompt construction to explicitly penalize repetitive or low-value actions and focus on strategic, VP-driving goals:
- **Segmented Descriptions with Action Prioritization**:
  ```
  You are tasked with making the most impactful move in the Catanatron Minigame. Always prioritize actions with long-term strategic benefits over short-term results. Avoid repetitive, low-impact actions like ending turns without building to progress.
  
  Current Priorities:
  1. Expand settlements and roads for resource variety and VP growth.
  2. Upgrade settlements to cities to maximize VP.
  3. Act to hinder opponents’ expansion when possible.
  
  Consider the following heuristic scores and game state in your decision:
  ```
  - Add structured fields for each action to explicitly indicate their heuristic weight, stage relevance, and potential impact:
    ```
    Action: {Action}
    Heuristic Score: {Score}
    Stage Priority: {Early/Mid/Late Game Relevance}
    Impact: {How this action will improve VP or hinder opponents}
    ```

---

### 3. Dynamic Detection of High-Impact Actions (Bottlenecks or Game Pivots)
Introduce dynamic logic to identify and prioritize high-impact actions during pivotal game moments:
- **Bottleneck Identification**:
  - Detect signs of resource stagnation or unspent resources (e.g., excessive ore/wheat without city upgrades or brick/wood without roads/settlements).
  ```python
  if player_resources['brick'] >= 3 and player_resources['wood'] >= 3:
      heuristic_scores[ActionType.BUILD_ROAD] += 5  # Encourage spending surplus
  ```
  - Time-based triggers: Penalize repeated "END TURN" or fallback actions and boost the use of active building moves.
- **Strategic Pivot Boosting**:
  - Add bonuses to actions when triggered by game-specific pivots:
    - Longest Road: Encourage roads when near the threshold for Longest Road.
    - Largest Army: Prioritize development card purchases when competing for Largest Army or sabotaging opponents.
    ```python
    if current_army_size >= 2 and opponents_army_size <= current_army_size:
        heuristic_scores[action] += 4  # Edge out Largest Army
    ```

---

### 4. Hybrid Mechanisms for Fallback Actions
Redesign the fallback system to incorporate both deterministic templates and heuristic-driven flexibility:
- **Action Templates by Priority**:
  - Use deterministic logic based on game stage:
    - Early Game: Build roads and settlements to ensure resource coverage.
    - Mid-Late Game: Prioritize cities for VP growth or roads for Longest Road.
  ```python
  for action_type in ["BUILD_CITY", "BUILD_SETTLEMENT", "BUILD_ROAD"]:
      for action in playable_actions:
          if action.action_type == action_type and action meets_conditions:
              return action
  ```
- **Heuristic-Fallback Hybrid**:
  - If no deterministic action is suitable, rely on heuristic priorities derived from current state evaluations to make fallback decisions.
- **Penalty for Stagnation**:
  - Penalize fallback repetitions by gradually increasing the weight on impactful actions like settlement-building or resource diversity improvements.

---

### 5. Methods to Evaluate and Refine Heuristics and LLM Response Handling
Design a structured framework for tuning heuristics and refining LLM responses over multiple game iterations:
- **Performance Metrics**:
  - Track metrics such as VP growth per iteration, total roads/cities/settlements built, and resource efficiency (unused resources).
  - Correlate LLM responses and fallback heuristic effectiveness with game outcomes.
- **Iterative Weight Adjustment**:
  - Analyze N-game results to adjust heuristic weights dynamically:
    - If too many roads are built without follow-up settlements, reduce road priority.
    - If city upgrades lead to stagnation due to resource imbalances, shift the weighting back to settlements.
  ```python
  if settlements_built < expected_settlement_threshold:
      heuristic_weights['BUILD_SETTLEMENT'] += 2
  ```
- **Benchmarking Against Rule-Based Baselines**:
  - Compare LLM-driven decisions with predefined optimal or rule-based actions to evaluate alignment with strategic goals.
  - Use deviation scores to identify areas where LLM prompts need refinement (e.g., under-prioritizing Largest Army or Longest Road).

---

### Next Steps:
1. Begin recalibrating heuristic scores to reflect stage-specific priorities.
2. Implement the updated prompt design to explicitly guide LLM responses toward non-repetitive, VP-centric strategies.
3. Integrate fallback mechanisms with dynamic, bottleneck-based adjustments to address stagnation and repeated default actions.
4. Build tools for iterative heuristic tuning and response evaluation against predefined baselines.

END STRATEGY.================================== Ai Message ==================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Over the next 5 iterations, implement and refine a system that better aligns FooPlayer's heuristic evaluation, LLM prompt design, and fallback mechanisms towards impactful, VP-driven actions. Aim for measurable improvements in foundational metrics like roads, settlements, and cities.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Recalibrate FooPlayer's heuristic scoring system to implement stage-specific priorities and dynamically address bottlenecks, ensuring better alignment between heuristic-driven actions and LLM output. Update the LLM prompt design to explicitly focus on VP growth and reduce low-value decision patterns.

CHOSEN AGENT: CODER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:  
Update `foo_player.py` as follows:

1. **Enhanced Heuristic Scoring**: 
    - Modify `_compute_heuristic_scores` to include stage-specific priorities:
      - Early-game boosts for roads and settlements.
      - Late-game emphasis on cities and development cards.
    - Include dynamic bottle-neck handling, e.g.:
      - Reward actions that address resource buildup or stagnation.
      - Encourage actions that disrupt opponents (e.g., blocking roads/settlements).
    - Use tile values (6, 8, etc.) to boost settlement scores for strategic intersections.

2. **Refined LLM Prompt**:
    - Update `_build_prompt` with stronger emphasis on guiding actions toward VP and strategic goals:
      - Enumerate priorities explicitly: building roads, settlements, cities.
      - Include heuristic scores in the prompt with descriptions of why actions are valuable.
      - Penalize repetitive actions like "END TURN" through explicit discouragement in the prompt.

3. **Fallback Mechanism Adjustment**:
    - Introduce deterministic templates for stage-specific fallback actions:
      - Early-game: Prioritize roads and settlements for expansion.
      - Late-game: Focus on cities and VP-centric actions.
    - Dynamically adapt fallback decisions based on resource surplus or game state bottlenecks.
    ```python
    if player_resources["brick"] >= 3 and player_resources["wood"] >= 3:
        heuristic_scores[ActionType.BUILD_ROAD] += 5
    ```

4. **Action Bottleneck Detection**:
    - Add detection for repetitive or stagnating actions (e.g., unspent resources or repeated "END TURN").
    - Penalize stagnation by prioritizing resource expenditure and spatial expansion.

Upon completing the updates, test the revised player for functional improvements in decision-making, focusing on roads, settlements, and overall strategic progression.================================ Human Message =================================

CODER

### Updates to `foo_player.py`:
1. **Enhanced Heuristic Scoring**:
   - Integrated stage-specific priorities (e.g., roads and settlements emphasized early-game, cities in mid-late game).
   - Added bonuses for high-resource tiles in settlement actions.
   - Introduced penalties to address resource bottlenecks (e.g., surplus brick/wood triggers road-building incentives).
   - Incorporated logic to dynamically adjust scores based on resource availability and VP contributions.

2. **Refined LLM Prompt**:
   - Redesigned `_build_prompt` to better guide the LLM:
     - Explicit priorities for strategic actions based on Victory Point (VP) growth.
     - Highlighted roadmap for early-game road/settlement building and late-game upgrades.
     - Discouraged repetitive or non-impactful actions like unnecessary turns.
   - Included heuristic scores in the prompt, with explanations for why certain actions are prioritized.

3. **Dynamic Fallback Mechanism**:
   - Structured fallback logic to prioritize actions based on game state:
     - Early-game: Roads and settlements.
     - Late-game: Cities and VP-centric actions.
   - Updated fallback mechanism to prevent stagnation by using deterministic templates blended with heuristic-driven conditions.

4. **Bottleneck and Surplus Resource Handling**:
   - Added logic to detect and dynamically handle situations where surplus resources exist (e.g., incentivizing road-building on excess brick/wood).
   - Increased priority for settlement or city building to resolve resource stagnation.

5. **Improved Logs**:
   - Added meaningful print statements across key decision-making steps to facilitate debugging:
     - Fallback actions.
     - Detected bottlenecks or resource imbalances.
     - LLM responses (and when fallback mechanisms are triggered).

### Testing Suggestions:
- **Evaluate Decision Quality**:
  - Test early-game actions for expansion focus (roads and settlements).
  - Verify mid-to-late game actions prioritize cities and VP-centric plays.
- **Monitor Bottleneck Response**:
  - Simulate resource-rich scenarios to observe if surplus resources are properly spent.
- **Validate Fallback Logic**:
  - Conduct games where the LLM fails or incorrectly parses the prompt to assess fallback success.
- **Track Metrics**:
  - Compare average VP, settlements, and city counts across multiple iterations to previous versions.

### Next Steps:
- Refine heuristic weights after testing to balance strategic trade-offs.
- Incorporate feedback cycles to analyze and further tune prompt alignment with heuristic evaluations.
- Observe repetitive "END TURN" penalties and ensure they improve game progression.

AttributeError: 'Action' object has no attribute 'location'================================ Human Message =================================

After Running The New foo_player.py Player, Here is my analysis and findings:

### Syntax Error Details:
- **Error Message**: `AttributeError: 'Action' object has no attribute 'location'`
- **Exact Line Number**: Line 90 in `foo_player.py`
- **Exact Line of Code**: `score = 8 + (3 if action.location.resource_value > 15 else 0)`

### Root Cause:
The `Action` class used in the code does not have an attribute `location`. This issue arises within the `_compute_heuristic_scores` method when attempting to access non-existent properties of the `Action` object.

### Impact:
This syntax error prevents the game from running, leading to no recorded results or scores for this evolution.

Let me know if you need anything else!================================== Ai Message ==================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Ensure FooPlayer's compatibility with the Catanatron API by resolving syntax errors and accurately utilizing the `Action` class attributes. Stabilize gameplay to allow evaluation of performance metrics over the next five iterations.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Fix the `AttributeError` by removing invalid references to the nonexistent `location` property in the `Action` class. Correct the scoring logic in `_compute_heuristic_scores` and replace erroneous calls with valid attributes from the `Action` class or game state.

CHOSEN AGENT: RESEARCHER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:  
Investigate the valid attributes and methods available in the `Action` class within the Catanatron API. Specifically:
1. Determine how to access the location or resource value associated with an action (if applicable).
2. Provide documentation or examples on other valid attributes of `Action` that might be relevant for heuristic scoring.
3. If no direct way exists to link `Action` to resource tiles or locations, suggest alternative ways to retrieve this context from the `Game` or `State` class for heuristic calculations.

Ensure the information is precise and actionable to debug and resolve the issue effectively.================================ Human Message =================================

RESEARCH:

### Investigation of the `Action` Class and Related Attributes
The `Action` class is part of the core mechanics for handling user actions during the gameplay. Here's the context based on the files:

#### 1. Valid Attributes of the `Action` Class
The `Action` class is defined and utilized in multiple modules. Its attributes are:
- **`color`**: Represents the player's color (e.g., `Color.BLUE`).
- **`action_type`**: Identifies the type of action (e.g., `ActionType.BUILD_SETTLEMENT`, `ActionType.PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD`).
- **`value`**: The specific content of the action based on its type. For example:
  - `Build actions` (`BUILD_SETTLEMENT`, `BUILD_CITY`) use `value` to represent the node location (`node_id`). 
  - `BUILD_ROAD` uses an `edge` object as its `value`.
  - In `MOVE_ROBBER`, `value` is a tuple such as `(coordinate, robbed_color, robbed_resource)`.

Attributes cannot directly reference nonexistent properties, such as `location`.

#### 2. Documentation and Examples of Related Action Types
Key samples of `Action` usage based on the context:
- **Action Initialization**:
  ```python
  Action(color, ActionType.BUILD_SETTLEMENT, node_id)
  Action(color, ActionType.MOVE_ROBBER, (coordinate, enemy_color, resource))
  Action(color, ActionType.ROLL, dice_roll_result)
  ```
- **Examples of Valid `ActionType` Values**:
  - Actions related to resource handling: `ROLL`, `MARITIME_TRADE`, `PLAY_YEAR_OF_PLENTY`, `PLAY_MONOPOLY`.
  - Building-related actions: `BUILD_ROAD`, `BUILD_SETTLEMENT`, `BUILD_CITY`.
  - Development cards and robber actions: `PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD`, `MOVE_ROBBER`.

#### 3. Accessing Location and Resource Context for an `Action`
The `Action` class itself does not store location or resource details unless explicitly set using the `value` attribute.

##### Alternatives for Accessing Context:
- **From the Game State (`State` Class)**:
  - To retrieve the current player's buildings (settlements, roads, etc.) or check surroundings:
    ```python
    buildings = state.buildings_by_color[Color.BLUE]
    settlements = buildings[SETTLEMENT]
    cities = buildings[CITY]
    ```
  - To get adjacent resource tiles for a node:
    ```python
    adjacent_tiles = state.board.map.adjacent_tiles[node_id]
    resources = [tile.resource for tile in adjacent_tiles if tile.resource is not None]
    ```
  - To get the bank's resource availability:
    ```python
    state.resource_freqdeck  # Bank’s current resources
    ```

- **Using `Action.value` for Specific Action Contexts**:
  In specific cases like building or moving, `Action.value` already provides relevant location-like data:
  - For building roads: Retrieve edges with `Action.value`.
  - For building settlements/cities: Use `node_id` from `Action.value`.

#### 4. Valid Methods for Game and State Interactions
Key methods/functions from the `Game` and `State`:
- **`Game` Class**:
  - `play_tick()`: Executes one game tick.
  - `winning_color()`: Returns the player currently winning the game.
  - `execute(action: Action)`: Executes a given action for a player.
  
- **`State` Class**:
  - `state.playable_actions`: Returns a list of actions currently available.
  - `state.board.buildable_node_ids(color)`: Returns node IDs where the player can build.
  - `state.player_state`: Dictionary containing details for each player (e.g., `Color.BLUE_CITIES_AVAILABLE`, `Color.BLUE_HAS_ROLLED`).

---

##### Additional Notes:
If there is a dependency on parsing `location` or `tile` data, it should instead rely on `Action.value` explicitly or query the `State` for adjacent tiles or positions as outlined above.

END RESEARCH.================================== Ai Message ==================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Ensure compatibility with the Catanatron API by appropriately integrating valid attributes of the `Action` class and utilizing game state data to enhance decision-making. Achieve stable functionality for testing strategic performance over the next 5 iterations.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Correct the `AttributeError` by refactoring `foo_player.py` to rely on valid `Action.value` attributes or query relevant context from the `State` class for heuristic scoring. Ensure all references to `location` are replaced with valid methods to retrieve positional or resource data.

CHOSEN AGENT: CODER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:
Refactor `foo_player.py` to address the syntax error and improve heuristic scoring:

1. **Fix Invalid References**:
   - Replace all calls to the nonexistent `action.location` with queries to `Action.value` or `State` methods.
   - Example adjustments:
     ```python
     if action.action_type == ActionType.BUILD_SETTLEMENT and len(state.board.map.adjacent_tiles[action.value]) > threshold:
         heuristic_scores[action] += 3
     ```
     Here, `action.value` provides the node ID where the settlement would be built.

2. **Context Retrieval from State**:
   - For actions like `BUILD_SETTLEMENT` or `BUILD_CITY`, retrieve adjacent tiles and their resource values using `state.board.map.adjacent_tiles[action.value]`.
   - For roads, use `Action.value` to access edge information and query connected tiles.

3. **Heuristic Scoring Enhancements**:
   - Incorporate valid context details from the state or action attributes to refine heuristic scoring:
     - High-value tiles should boost settlement scores:
       ```python
       adjacent_resources = [tile.resource for tile in state.board.map.adjacent_tiles[action.value] if tile.resource is not None]
       resource_bonus = sum(tile.value for resource in adjacent_resources)
       heuristic_scores[action] += resource_bonus
       ```

4. **Debugging and Validation**:
   - Ensure all invalid references are replaced with valid calls.
   - Add debug print statements to verify successful access to `Action.value` or state functions during gameplay.

Once refactoring is complete, test FooPlayer to confirm it runs without errors and demonstrate functional heuristic scoring improvements.================================ Human Message =================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Improve the performance of the `FooPlayer.py` by introducing intelligent strategy logic that leverages the LLM for decision-making. Specifically, aim for a minimum win count of 1 within the next 5 iterations while improving VP, settlements, and measurable gameplay metrics.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Address the issue of the `decide` method defaulting to selecting the first action. Integrate the LLM's `query_llm` functionality to intelligently evaluate actions based on state and strategy.

CHOSEN AGENT: CODER

AGENT OBJECTIVE: 
The current implementation of `FooPlayer` is defaulting to selecting the first action, as evidenced by the repeated log message "Choosing First Action on Default." Modify the `decide` method to leverage the `self.llm.query_llm` functionality for decision-making. Specifically:

1. Replace the current first-action default with an implementation that:
   a. Obtains a list of possible actions from the game state.
   b. Queries the LLM (`self.llm.query_llm`) for the evaluation of these actions.
   c. Selects the most intelligent action based on the LLM's evaluation.

2. Ensure the decision logic is robust and includes handling scenarios such as:
   - No valid actions available.
   - LLM providing ambiguous or conflicting guidance (fallback mechanisms).

3. Include clear comments and logging to observe how the LLM is influencing decision-making.

Once done, provide the modified code to be tested.================================== Ai Message ==================================

CODER

### Changes Made:
1. **Replaced Default Action Selection**:
   - Removed the hardcoded `return playable_actions[0]` that selected the first action by default.

2. **Integrated LLM Decision-Making in `decide`**:
   - Constructed a comprehensive prompt using the `_build_prompt` function to provide the LLM with game state and available actions.
   - Queried the LLM using `self.llm.query_llm(prompt)`.
   - Parsed the LLM's response using the `_parse_llm_response` function to select the most appropriate action from the available options.

3. **Added New Helper Methods**:
   - `_build_prompt`: Constructs a prompt by including the current game state and the list of playable actions.
   - `_parse_llm_response`: Interprets the LLM's response to match it with one of the playable actions. If no match is found, defaults to the first action.

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Included error handling for cases where the LLM query fails or returns an ambiguous response. In such cases, the method defaults to selecting the first action.
   - Added logging to show the LLM's response (`print(f"LLM Response: {llm_response}")`) and fallback mechanisms.

5. **Logging and Debugging**:
   - Added print statements for better debugging and observation:
     - Log when no playable actions are available.
     - Log the LLM's raw response.
     - Log if the response is ambiguous or invalid, and the fallback action is selected.

### Notes for the Next Iteration:
- **Prompt Details**: The current `_build_prompt` function makes a basic serialization of the game state and actions. If the LLM struggles to prioritize or understand the game details, refining this prompt may be necessary.
- **LLM Error Responses**: If runtime timing issues with `query_llm` arise (e.g., long delays or failures), adjustment of query limits or timeouts may be needed.

### Testing Recommendations:
- Test how the LLM chooses actions in various scenarios to verify that the parsing logic aligns with actual gameplay.
- Monitor logs (`LLM Response: ...`) for unexpected behaviors or ambiguous responses.

END CODER================================ Human Message =================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Transition FooPlayer into a competitive player over the next 5 iterations by leveraging enhanced strategy, including heuristic reinforcement, refined LLM prompts, and deterministic fallback mechanisms, and targeting measurable improvements in average VP and win rates.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Implement **segmented contextual prompting** and heuristic-enhanced decision-making into the LLM integration (as per Strategy 1 and 4). Additionally, integrate a **ranked action hierarchy** as a fallback mechanism (Strategy 2).

CHOSEN AGENT: CODER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:  
Modify the `decide` method of `FooPlayer.py` to achieve the following:

1. **Refined LLM Prompt**: 
   - Update the `_build_prompt` function to use **segmented contextual prompting**. Include headers that describe the game state, available resources, and strategic goals. Example structure:
     ```
     Current Game State:
     - Player Stats: {resources}, {settlements}, {cities}, VP: {victory_points}
     - Opponent Stats: {opponent resources/blockades}, etc.
     Goal: Maximize VP while taking advantage of the current game state.
     Available Actions: {list of formatted playable actions}
     Respond with:
     Action: {Selected optimal action}
     Justification: {Reasoning behind the action choice}
     ```

2. **Heuristic Context Integration**:
   - In the `_build_prompt` method, compute heuristic scores (e.g., settlement value, city upgrade value, road extension value) for each action. Integrate these scores into the prompt to help the LLM make better decisions.

3. **Fallback Mechanism**:
   - Enhance `_parse_llm_response` to implement a **ranked action hierarchy** fallback mechanism when the LLM output is invalid or ambiguous. Example hierarchy:
     - Priority Order: Build City > Build Settlement > Build Road > End Turn.
     - If a valid option matching the LLM response is not found, return the first valid action in this priority order.

4. **Logging**:
   - Improve logging to capture the heuristic scores, the LLM prompt, its raw response, and the fallback decision (when necessary) for post-game analysis.

Once complete, test the updated `FooPlayer.py`, run games, and report the results.================================== Ai Message ==================================

CODER

### Changes Made:
1. **Refined LLM Prompt Construction**:
   - Enhanced the `_build_prompt` function to use **segmented contextual prompting** with detailed headers for game state, player stats, opponent stats, and available actions.
   - Integrated **heuristic scores** for each action into the prompt to guide the LLM decision-making.

2. **Heuristic Computation Method**:
   - Added a `_compute_heuristic_scores` helper method to assign heuristic values to each action based on action type (e.g., city-building prioritized over road-building).

3. **Improved Parsing Logic**:
   - Enhanced `_parse_llm_response` to return a matching action from the LLM response, or delegate to the fallback mechanism if no match is found.

4. **Ranked Fallback Mechanism**:
   - Implemented `_fallback_action` to evaluate actions in a priority order: Build City > Build Settlement > Build Road > End Turn.
   - Default to the first action only when no prioritized options exist.

5. **Logging**:
   - Added print statements throughout to capture key debugging information:
     - The LLM prompt.
     - Heuristic scores of actions.
     - The LLM's raw response.
     - Logs for fallback mechanism use.

6. **Error Handling Enhancements**:
   - Integrated robust exception handling in the `decide` method for LLM failures, with clear logging of fallbacks.

### Notes for the Next Iteration:
- Tune the **heuristic scores** if the LLM's decisions align poorly with optimal strategies.
- Monitor how well the LLM responds to the enhanced prompt structure during testing.
- Evaluate the fallback mechanism's efficiency in comparison to the LLM's responses.

### Testing Recommendations:
- Focus on scenarios requiring diverse strategic goals (e.g., blocking opponent moves, building towards Largest Army).
- Analyze logs for patterns in ambiguous or ineffective LLM responses, and refine prompts or fallback heuristics accordingly.

END CODER================================ Human Message =================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Ensure functionality and compatibility of FooPlayer with the Catanatron API while strengthening the LLM decision-making mechanism in a way that improves strategic performance over the next 5 iterations.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Integrate valid Catanatron API calls into `foo_player.py`'s `_build_prompt` method to fetch relevant game data like resources, settlements, cities, roads, and victory points, and resolve the current `AttributeError` preventing gameplay.

CHOSEN AGENT: CODER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:  
Resolve the `AttributeError` by replacing invalid calls in `foo_player.py` with Catanatron-compatible API calls as outlined in the research:

1. **Resources**:
   - Replace `game.get_player_resources(Color.BLUE)` with `get_player_freqdeck(state, Color.BLUE)` to fetch all resources for FooPlayer.
   - Use `player_num_resource_cards(state, Color.BLUE, resource)` to query specific resource counts.

2. **Settlements and Cities**:
   - Replace invalid calls for settlements/cities with:
     ```python
     get_player_buildings(state, Color.BLUE, "SETTLEMENT")
     get_player_buildings(state, Color.BLUE, "CITY")
     ```

3. **Victory Points and Roads**:
   - Retrieve victory points using:
     ```python
     vp = state.player_state[player_key(state, Color.BLUE) + "_ACTUAL_VICTORY_POINTS"]
     ```
   - Roads remaining:
     ```python
     roads_available = state.player_state[player_key(state, Color.BLUE) + "_ROADS_AVAILABLE"]
     ```

4. **General Updates to `_build_prompt`**:
   - Adjust the prompt to include all valid game stats, ensuring Catanatron API calls function.
   - Include resource counts, settlements, cities, roads, and VP in the formatted prompt structure.

5. **Debugging and Validation**:
   - Add logging to verify data retrieval accuracy during gameplay for resources, actions, and VP.
   - Run a test evolution to confirm the absence of runtime errors.

Update the code to reflect these changes and provide detailed debug logs during testing for validation.================================== Ai Message ==================================

CODER

### Changes Made:
1. **Replaced Invalid API Calls**:
   - Substituted `game.get_player_resources(Color.BLUE)` with `get_player_freqdeck(state, Color.BLUE)` to correctly fetch resources.
   - Similar replacements made for settlements, cities, victory points, and roads using valid Catanatron API functions: 
     - `get_player_buildings(state, Color.BLUE, "SETTLEMENT")` and `get_player_buildings(state, Color.BLUE, "CITY")` for settlements and cities.
     - Victory points accessed via `state.player_state[f"{player_key(state, Color.BLUE)}_ACTUAL_VICTORY_POINTS"]`.
     - Roads available via `state.player_state[f"{player_key(state, Color.BLUE)}_ROADS_AVAILABLE"]`.

2. **Updated `_build_prompt` Method**:
   - Included new resource and state-fetching methods in the prompt template.
   - Enhanced formatting to make the prompt explainable and consistent with the desired LLM input structure.

3. **Improved Compatibility**:
   - Refactored the game state integration in `_build_prompt` to align with valid methods reliably compatible with the API.

4. **Debugging Enhancements**:
   - Added detailed logging via print statements to verify accurate state data retrieval during gameplay (resources, settlements, cities, heuristic scores).
   - Included error handling for invalid or mismatched LLM responses.

### Notes for the Next Iteration:
- Test how well the new prompt structure works with the LLM's decision-making.
- Monitor logs for resource/state-fetch accuracy and potential mismatches between heuristic scores and LLM responses.

### Testing Recommendations:
- Verify that resources, settlements, cities, and other player stats from the state align with the game's current state through debugging outputs.
- Check if the fallback mechanism handles invalid or ambiguous LLM responses efficiently.

END CODER================================ Human Message =================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Implement a strategy that improves both early and late-game decision-making for FooPlayer through advanced heuristics, adjusted fallback mechanisms, and refined LLM prompts, achieving measurable improvements in metrics such as roads, settlements, and victory points.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Integrate enhanced heuristic scoring and dynamic fallback priorities into the decision flow while refining LLM responses for strategic action selection, focusing on VP growth and efficient resource use.

CHOSEN AGENT: CODER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:  
Modify FooPlayer to implement the strategies outlined in the five key areas. Specifically:

1. **Enhance Heuristic Scoring**:
   - Add multipliers for actions directly contributing to Victory Points, such as settlement building and city upgrading.
   - Dynamically adjust scores based on the game stage (early vs. late-game priorities), prioritizing roads and settlements early while focusing on VP-heavy actions late.

2. **Dynamic Fallback Mechanism**:
   - Revise the fallback mechanism to focus on early-game expansion via roads and settlements as placeholders for resource diversity and VP accumulation.
   - Later transition fallback logic to VP-centric actions like city upgrades and development cards.

3. **Refined LLM Prompt**:
   - Update the LLM prompt to emphasize VP growth explicitly.
   - Demand justification for actions based on Victory Points and strategic blocking of opponents.

4. **Resource Threshold Balancing**:
   - Introduce logic for maintaining resource reserves and diversifying investments based on available actions.
   - Trigger placeholder actions like road-building when strategic objectives are temporarily unattainable.

5. **Action Bottleneck Detection**:
   - Implement tracking logic for repetitive unproductive actions (e.g., repeated "END TURN").
   - Adjust decision scoring to discourage stagnation, forcing resource spending or defensive actions when necessary.

Make necessary modifications to the `decide` method and auxiliary functions like `_build_prompt` and `heuristic_scores`. Run a test iteration post-implementation to ensure that the changes positively impact FooPlayer performance.

Let me know when you're ready to test the updated player!================================ Human Message =================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Over the next 5 iterations, implement and refine a system that better aligns FooPlayer's heuristic evaluation, LLM prompt design, and fallback mechanisms towards impactful, VP-driven actions. Aim for measurable improvements in foundational metrics like roads, settlements, and cities.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Recalibrate FooPlayer's heuristic scoring system to implement stage-specific priorities and dynamically address bottlenecks, ensuring better alignment between heuristic-driven actions and LLM output. Update the LLM prompt design to explicitly focus on VP growth and reduce low-value decision patterns.

CHOSEN AGENT: CODER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:  
Update `foo_player.py` as follows:

1. **Enhanced Heuristic Scoring**: 
    - Modify `_compute_heuristic_scores` to include stage-specific priorities:
      - Early-game boosts for roads and settlements.
      - Late-game emphasis on cities and development cards.
    - Include dynamic bottle-neck handling, e.g.:
      - Reward actions that address resource buildup or stagnation.
      - Encourage actions that disrupt opponents (e.g., blocking roads/settlements).
    - Use tile values (6, 8, etc.) to boost settlement scores for strategic intersections.

2. **Refined LLM Prompt**:
    - Update `_build_prompt` with stronger emphasis on guiding actions toward VP and strategic goals:
      - Enumerate priorities explicitly: building roads, settlements, cities.
      - Include heuristic scores in the prompt with descriptions of why actions are valuable.
      - Penalize repetitive actions like "END TURN" through explicit discouragement in the prompt.

3. **Fallback Mechanism Adjustment**:
    - Introduce deterministic templates for stage-specific fallback actions:
      - Early-game: Prioritize roads and settlements for expansion.
      - Late-game: Focus on cities and VP-centric actions.
    - Dynamically adapt fallback decisions based on resource surplus or game state bottlenecks.
    ```python
    if player_resources["brick"] >= 3 and player_resources["wood"] >= 3:
        heuristic_scores[ActionType.BUILD_ROAD] += 5
    ```

4. **Action Bottleneck Detection**:
    - Add detection for repetitive or stagnating actions (e.g., unspent resources or repeated "END TURN").
    - Penalize stagnation by prioritizing resource expenditure and spatial expansion.

Upon completing the updates, test the revised player for functional improvements in decision-making, focusing on roads, settlements, and overall strategic progression.================================== Ai Message ==================================

CODER

### Updates to `foo_player.py`:
1. **Enhanced Heuristic Scoring**:
   - Integrated stage-specific priorities (e.g., roads and settlements emphasized early-game, cities in mid-late game).
   - Added bonuses for high-resource tiles in settlement actions.
   - Introduced penalties to address resource bottlenecks (e.g., surplus brick/wood triggers road-building incentives).
   - Incorporated logic to dynamically adjust scores based on resource availability and VP contributions.

2. **Refined LLM Prompt**:
   - Redesigned `_build_prompt` to better guide the LLM:
     - Explicit priorities for strategic actions based on Victory Point (VP) growth.
     - Highlighted roadmap for early-game road/settlement building and late-game upgrades.
     - Discouraged repetitive or non-impactful actions like unnecessary turns.
   - Included heuristic scores in the prompt, with explanations for why certain actions are prioritized.

3. **Dynamic Fallback Mechanism**:
   - Structured fallback logic to prioritize actions based on game state:
     - Early-game: Roads and settlements.
     - Late-game: Cities and VP-centric actions.
   - Updated fallback mechanism to prevent stagnation by using deterministic templates blended with heuristic-driven conditions.

4. **Bottleneck and Surplus Resource Handling**:
   - Added logic to detect and dynamically handle situations where surplus resources exist (e.g., incentivizing road-building on excess brick/wood).
   - Increased priority for settlement or city building to resolve resource stagnation.

5. **Improved Logs**:
   - Added meaningful print statements across key decision-making steps to facilitate debugging:
     - Fallback actions.
     - Detected bottlenecks or resource imbalances.
     - LLM responses (and when fallback mechanisms are triggered).

### Testing Suggestions:
- **Evaluate Decision Quality**:
  - Test early-game actions for expansion focus (roads and settlements).
  - Verify mid-to-late game actions prioritize cities and VP-centric plays.
- **Monitor Bottleneck Response**:
  - Simulate resource-rich scenarios to observe if surplus resources are properly spent.
- **Validate Fallback Logic**:
  - Conduct games where the LLM fails or incorrectly parses the prompt to assess fallback success.
- **Track Metrics**:
  - Compare average VP, settlements, and city counts across multiple iterations to previous versions.

### Next Steps:
- Refine heuristic weights after testing to balance strategic trade-offs.
- Incorporate feedback cycles to analyze and further tune prompt alignment with heuristic evaluations.
- Observe repetitive "END TURN" penalties and ensure they improve game progression.

- **Exact Line Number**: Line 90 in `foo_player.py`
- **Exact Line of Code**: `score = 8 + (3 if action.location.resource_value > 15 else 0)`

### Root Cause:
The `Action` class used in the code does not have an attribute `location`. This issue arises within the `_compute_heuristic_scores` method when attempting to access non-existent properties of the `Action` object.

### Impact:
This syntax error prevents the game from running, leading to no recorded results or scores for this evolution.

Let me know if you need anything else!================================== Ai Message ==================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Ensure FooPlayer's compatibility with the Catanatron API by resolving syntax errors and accurately utilizing the `Action` class attributes. Stabilize gameplay to allow evaluation of performance metrics over the next five iterations.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Fix the `AttributeError` by removing invalid references to the nonexistent `location` property in the `Action` class. Correct the scoring logic in `_compute_heuristic_scores` and replace erroneous calls with valid attributes from the `Action` class or game state.

CHOSEN AGENT: RESEARCHER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:  
Investigate the valid attributes and methods available in the `Action` class within the Catanatron API. Specifically:
1. Determine how to access the location or resource value associated with an action (if applicable).
2. Provide documentation or examples on other valid attributes of `Action` that might be relevant for heuristic scoring.
3. If no direct way exists to link `Action` to resource tiles or locations, suggest alternative ways to retrieve this context from the `Game` or `State` class for heuristic calculations.

Ensure the information is precise and actionable to debug and resolve the issue effectively.================================ Human Message =================================

RESEARCH:

### Investigation of the `Action` Class and Related Attributes
The `Action` class is part of the core mechanics for handling user actions during the gameplay. Here's the context based on the files:

#### 1. Valid Attributes of the `Action` Class
The `Action` class is defined and utilized in multiple modules. Its attributes are:
- **`color`**: Represents the player's color (e.g., `Color.BLUE`).
- **`action_type`**: Identifies the type of action (e.g., `ActionType.BUILD_SETTLEMENT`, `ActionType.PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD`).
- **`value`**: The specific content of the action based on its type. For example:
  - `Build actions` (`BUILD_SETTLEMENT`, `BUILD_CITY`) use `value` to represent the node location (`node_id`). 
  - `BUILD_ROAD` uses an `edge` object as its `value`.
  - In `MOVE_ROBBER`, `value` is a tuple such as `(coordinate, robbed_color, robbed_resource)`.

Attributes cannot directly reference nonexistent properties, such as `location`.

#### 2. Documentation and Examples of Related Action Types
Key samples of `Action` usage based on the context:
- **Action Initialization**:
  ```python
  Action(color, ActionType.BUILD_SETTLEMENT, node_id)
  Action(color, ActionType.MOVE_ROBBER, (coordinate, enemy_color, resource))
  Action(color, ActionType.ROLL, dice_roll_result)
  ```
- **Examples of Valid `ActionType` Values**:
  - Actions related to resource handling: `ROLL`, `MARITIME_TRADE`, `PLAY_YEAR_OF_PLENTY`, `PLAY_MONOPOLY`.
  - Building-related actions: `BUILD_ROAD`, `BUILD_SETTLEMENT`, `BUILD_CITY`.
  - Development cards and robber actions: `PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD`, `MOVE_ROBBER`.

#### 3. Accessing Location and Resource Context for an `Action`
The `Action` class itself does not store location or resource details unless explicitly set using the `value` attribute.

##### Alternatives for Accessing Context:
- **From the Game State (`State` Class)**:
  - To retrieve the current player's buildings (settlements, roads, etc.) or check surroundings:
    ```python
    buildings = state.buildings_by_color[Color.BLUE]
    settlements = buildings[SETTLEMENT]
    cities = buildings[CITY]
    ```
  - To get adjacent resource tiles for a node:
    ```python
    adjacent_tiles = state.board.map.adjacent_tiles[node_id]
    resources = [tile.resource for tile in adjacent_tiles if tile.resource is not None]
    ```
  - To get the bank's resource availability:
    ```python
    state.resource_freqdeck  # Bank’s current resources
    ```

- **Using `Action.value` for Specific Action Contexts**:
  In specific cases like building or moving, `Action.value` already provides relevant location-like data:
  - For building roads: Retrieve edges with `Action.value`.
  - For building settlements/cities: Use `node_id` from `Action.value`.

#### 4. Valid Methods for Game and State Interactions
Key methods/functions from the `Game` and `State`:
- **`Game` Class**:
  - `play_tick()`: Executes one game tick.
  - `winning_color()`: Returns the player currently winning the game.
  - `execute(action: Action)`: Executes a given action for a player.
  
- **`State` Class**:
  - `state.playable_actions`: Returns a list of actions currently available.
  - `state.board.buildable_node_ids(color)`: Returns node IDs where the player can build.
  - `state.player_state`: Dictionary containing details for each player (e.g., `Color.BLUE_CITIES_AVAILABLE`, `Color.BLUE_HAS_ROLLED`).

---

##### Additional Notes:
If there is a dependency on parsing `location` or `tile` data, it should instead rely on `Action.value` explicitly or query the `State` for adjacent tiles or positions as outlined above.

END RESEARCH.================================== Ai Message ==================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Ensure compatibility with the Catanatron API by appropriately integrating valid attributes of the `Action` class and utilizing game state data to enhance decision-making. Achieve stable functionality for testing strategic performance over the next 5 iterations.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Correct the `AttributeError` by refactoring `foo_player.py` to rely on valid `Action.value` attributes or query relevant context from the `State` class for heuristic scoring. Ensure all references to `location` are replaced with valid methods to retrieve positional or resource data.

CHOSEN AGENT: CODER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:
Refactor `foo_player.py` to address the syntax error and improve heuristic scoring:

1. **Fix Invalid References**:
   - Replace all calls to the nonexistent `action.location` with queries to `Action.value` or `State` methods.
   - Example adjustments:
     ```python
     if action.action_type == ActionType.BUILD_SETTLEMENT and len(state.board.map.adjacent_tiles[action.value]) > threshold:
         heuristic_scores[action] += 3
     ```
     Here, `action.value` provides the node ID where the settlement would be built.

2. **Context Retrieval from State**:
   - For actions like `BUILD_SETTLEMENT` or `BUILD_CITY`, retrieve adjacent tiles and their resource values using `state.board.map.adjacent_tiles[action.value]`.
   - For roads, use `Action.value` to access edge information and query connected tiles.

3. **Heuristic Scoring Enhancements**:
   - Incorporate valid context details from the state or action attributes to refine heuristic scoring:
     - High-value tiles should boost settlement scores:
       ```python
       adjacent_resources = [tile.resource for tile in state.board.map.adjacent_tiles[action.value] if tile.resource is not None]
       resource_bonus = sum(tile.value for resource in adjacent_resources)
       heuristic_scores[action] += resource_bonus
       ```

4. **Debugging and Validation**:
   - Ensure all invalid references are replaced with valid calls.
   - Add debug print statements to verify successful access to `Action.value` or state functions during gameplay.

Once refactoring is complete, test FooPlayer to confirm it runs without errors and demonstrate functional heuristic scoring improvements.================================ Human Message =================================

### Summary of Changes:
1. **Fixed `AttributeError`**:
   - Replaced invalid references to `action.location` with valid attribute and context retrieval using `action.value` and game state methods (e.g., accessing `state.board.map.adjacent_tiles` for settlement scoring).

2. **Improved Settlement Scoring**:
   - Enhanced `_compute_heuristic_scores` to calculate bonuses for settlements based on adjacent tiles' resource values using `state.board.map.adjacent_tiles[action.value]`.

3. **Resource Bottleneck Handling**:
   - Retained logic for surplus brick/wood to incentivize road-building.

4. **Improved Debugging**:
   - Added specific print statements during fallback and heuristic computation to verify logic.

5. **Dynamic Heuristic Refinements**:
   - Settlement scoring dynamically adjusts based on adjacent tile values, improving action prioritization.

### Testing Plan:
- Verify that the game runs without errors.
- Validate heuristic score calculations for settlements and roads using logs.
- Test gameplay performance:
  - Early-game: Expansion (settlements and roads).
  - Late-game: City-building and VP growth.

Let me know if the updated player behaves as expected or requires further refinements.

After Running The New foo_player.py Player, Here is my analysis and findings:

### Scores of FooPlayer:
- Wins: 0
- Average Victory Points (VP): 2.0
- Average Settlements: 2.0
- Average Cities: 0.0
- Average Roads: 0.0
- Average Largest Army: 0.0
- Average Development VP: 0.0

### Short Analysis of Game Output:
- The phrase "Choosing First Action on Default" repeated throughout the log suggests that the implementation is defaulting to selecting the first action without strategy. 
- Results indicate poor performance compared to the opponent, with no victories achieved in the 3-game session. 

### Errors, Warnings, or Signs of Implementation Issues:
- **Implementation Warning**: The log shows "Choosing First Action on Default" continuously, indicating that the `decide` method is not leveraging the LLM integration (`self.llm.query_llm`) for decision-making.
- **Gameplay Warning**: The score disparity (2 VP versus 10 VP for the opponent) and the lack of progression in Cities, Roads, and Largest Army metrics highlight a lack of strategy execution.

- The LLM consistently failed to provide valid or actionable responses: "LLM response ambiguous or invalid. Defaulting to first action."
- FooPlayer defaulted to the first available action in all scenarios instead of executing strategic decisions.
- The performance difference is stark: FooPlayer had no wins and significantly lower VP compared to AlphaBetaPlayer.

### Errors, Warnings, or Signs of Implementation Issues:
- **LLM Integration Issue**: LLM responses are not being parsed correctly or are poorly generated, leading to fallback actions ("Defaulting to first action").
- **Decision-Making Deficiency**: The lack of strategic outcomes (e.g., 0 roads, 0 Largest Army) suggests serious shortcomings in action planning and execution.
- **Repeated Logs**: Multiple instances of ambiguous LLM responses point to insufficient prompt design or response parsing mechanism in `_parse_llm_response`.

After Running The New foo_player.py Player, Here is my analysis and findings:

### Syntax Error Details:
- **Error Message**: `AttributeError: 'Game' object has no attribute 'get_player_resources'`
- **Exact Line Number**: Line 84 in `foo_player.py`
- **Exact Line of Code**: `resources=str(game.get_player_resources(Color.BLUE)),  # Example method to get resources`

### Root Cause:
The method `get_player_resources` is being called on the `Game` object, but it does not exist in the `Game` class, leading to an `AttributeError`. This indicates a mismatch between the game's API and the implementation in `foo_player.py`.

### Impact:
The syntax error prevents the game from running, and thus no game results were recorded for this evolution.

After Running The New foo_player.py Player, Here is my analysis and findings:

### Scores of FooPlayer:
- Wins: 0  
- Average Victory Points (VP): 2.33  
- Average Settlements: 1.67  
- Average Cities: 0.33  
- Average Roads: 0.0  
- Average Largest Army: 0.0  
- Average Development VP: 0.0  

### Short Analysis of Game Output:
- **LLM Interaction**: The LLM responded consistently, but gameplay justification often involved executing mandatory or default actions (e.g., "ROLL" and "END TURN"), suggesting limited strategic depth.
- **Interesting Output**: The heuristic scoring mechanism categorizes actions clearly, but no significant changes to gameplay performance reflect deeper strategy execution.
- **Signs of Issue**: No roads or army development indicates repeated failure to invest strategically in growth areas, despite consistent heuristic scoring.

### Errors, Warnings, or Signs of Implementation Issues:
- **Strategic Weakness**: The absence of victories and poor metrics like roads and army raises concerns about the decision-making quality. 
- **Heuristic Misalignment**: High heuristic scores for actions like "BUILD_ROAD" occasionally appear in the logs but fail to translate into meaningful gameplay progression.

After Running The New foo_player.py Player, Here is my analysis and findings:

### Scores of FooPlayer:
- Wins: 0  
- Average Victory Points (VP): 2.6666666666666665  
- Average Settlements: 1.3333333333333333  
- Average Cities: 0.6666666666666666  
- Average Roads: 0.0  
- Average Largest Army: 0.0  
- Average Development VP: 0.0  

### Short Analysis of Game Output:
- **Repetitive Logs**: Multiple instances of LLM responses defaulting to basic actions such as "ROLL" and "END TURN," with justifications suggesting limited strategic depth. Example: "Rolling is necessary to progress the game state."
- **Neutral Heuristic Scoring**: Actions often evaluated with a low heuristic score (`1`). This indicates the heuristic system fails to differentiate between strategic actions.
- **Misalignment**: High-priority actions like "BUILD_CITY" or "BUILD_SETTLEMENT" seem underutilized, despite occasional high heuristic scores visible in logs. 

### Errors, Warnings, or Signs of Implementation Issues:
- **LLM Integration Weakness**: Responses imply poor decision quality by prioritizing roll/end-turn actions excessively. This indicates the prompt design and parsing mechanisms need refinement.
- **Strategic Gaps**: Failure to build roads or utilize army resources, even across multiple turns, suggests severe strategic deficiencies. The game log reinforces these gaps.
- **Warning**: Logs frequently state "Fallback mechanism applied," implying reliance on basic action prioritization rather than effective LLM outputs.

After Running The New foo_player.py Player, Here is my analysis and findings:

### Syntax Error Details:
- **Error Message**: `AttributeError: 'Action' object has no attribute 'location'`
- **Exact Line Number**: Line 90 in `foo_player.py`
- **Exact Line of Code**: `score = 8 + (3 if action.location.resource_value > 15 else 0)`

### Root Cause:
The `Action` class used in the code does not have an attribute `location`. This issue arises within the `_compute_heuristic_scores` method when attempting to access non-existent properties of the `Action` object.

### Impact:
This syntax error prevents the game from running, leading to no recorded results or scores for this evolution.

After Running The New foo_player.py Player, Here is my analysis and findings:

### Syntax Error Details:
- **Error Message**: `AttributeError: 'LandTile' object has no attribute 'value'`
- **Exact Line Number**: Line 92 in `foo_player.py`
- **Exact Line of Code**: `tile.value for tile in adjacent_tiles if tile.resource is not None`

### Root Cause:
The `LandTile` class does not have a `value` attribute as assumed in `_compute_heuristic_scores`. This error occurs when attempting to calculate resource bonuses for building settlements based on adjacent tiles.

### Impact:
The syntax error prevents the game from running, resulting in no recorded game results or player performance data for this evolution.

}================================ Human Message =================================

After Running The New foo_player.py Player, Here is my analysis and findings:

### Scores of FooPlayer:
- Wins: 0  
- Average Victory Points (VP): 2.33  
- Average Settlements: 1.67  
- Average Cities: 0.33  
- Average Roads: 0.0  
- Average Largest Army: 0.0  
- Average Development VP: 0.0  

### Short Analysis of Game Output:
- **LLM Interaction**: The LLM responded consistently, but gameplay justification often involved executing mandatory or default actions (e.g., "ROLL" and "END TURN"), suggesting limited strategic depth.
- **Interesting Output**: The heuristic scoring mechanism categorizes actions clearly, but no significant changes to gameplay performance reflect deeper strategy execution.
- **Signs of Issue**: No roads or army development indicates repeated failure to invest strategically in growth areas, despite consistent heuristic scoring.

### Errors, Warnings, or Signs of Implementation Issues:
- **Strategic Weakness**: The absence of victories and poor metrics like roads and army raises concerns about the decision-making quality. 
- **Heuristic Misalignment**: High heuristic scores for actions like "BUILD_ROAD" occasionally appear in the logs but fail to translate into meaningful gameplay progression. 

Let me know if you need anything else!================================== Ai Message ==================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Enhance the decision-making of FooPlayer by refining the strategic priorities directly implemented in both the heuristic framework and LLM prompt responses. Aim to improve measurable metrics such as roads, army, and settlements while moving closer to achieving winning conditions over the next 5 iterations.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Address the strategic weaknesses by introducing a deeper integration of heuristic priorities into the fallback mechanism and improving the clarity in LLM prompt responses to focus on VP growth, road-building, and settlements.

CHOSEN AGENT: STRATEGIZER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:  
Generate 5 improved strategies to address the current shortcomings:
1. Improvements to heuristic scoring that prioritize growth areas (e.g., building roads, achieving Largest Army).
2. Suggestions to alter fallback mechanisms to emphasize strategic contributions (e.g., prioritize roads early-game or settlements near resource-heavy tiles).
3. Refined LLM prompt designs that explicitly guide actions toward VP growth and strategic dominance.
4. Ideas to balance resource accumulation and strategic investments (e.g., cities vs roads) to diversify objectives.
5. Approach to identifying action bottlenecks that lead to stagnation (e.g., repeated patterns of "END TURN" or inefficient action sequences).================================ Human Message =================================

STRATEGY:

### 1. Improvements to Heuristic Scoring
Enhance heuristic scoring to align with strategic growth objectives and quantify the value of actions more effectively:
- **VP-Oriented Scoring**: Add a multiplier for actions directly contributing to Victory Points (e.g., upgrading to cities or building settlements on high-value intersections).
  ```python
  if action.action_type == ActionType.BUILD_SETTLEMENT and action.location.resource_value > threshold:
      heuristic_scores[action] = 10 + action.location.resource_value
  elif action.action_type == ActionType.BUILD_CITY:
      heuristic_scores[action] = 15
  elif action.action_type == ActionType.BUILD_ROAD:
      heuristic_scores[action] = 5 + len(connected_resources)
  ```
- **Dynamic Game Stage Consideration**: Assign higher scores to actions like building roads or settlements in the early game, shifting to cities and army card purchases in later stages based on available resources and board state.
- **Opponent Disruption**: Include metrics for actions that block opponents’ extensions or resource monopolies, such as cutting off road expansions.

---

### 2. Fallback Mechanism Adjustments
Revise the fallback mechanism to prioritize actions that align with broader strategic objectives:
- **Early-Game Priorities**:
  1. **Roads**: Emphasize road-building to expand quickly and secure settlement sites early (calculate heuristic road priority based on proximity to key tiles, e.g., 8/6/9 tiles).
  2. **Settlements**: Focus on openings that increase resource diversity and resource flow.
  ```python
  if len(settlements) < 3 and ActionType.BUILD_SETTLEMENT in actions:
      return next(action for action in actions if action.action_type == ActionType.BUILD_SETTLEMENT)
  ```
- **Late-Game Priorities**:
   - Transition to cities or army card purchases while only building roads/settlements to secure Longest Road or block opponents.
- **Secondary Metrics**:
   - Consider an aggregate utility metric (e.g., resource spillover from connected tiles) to decide between fallback paths.

---

### 3. Refined LLM Prompt Design
Re-orient the LLM prompt to place greater emphasis on VP growth and strategic objectives:
- **Structured Guidance**:
  ```
  You are tasked with growing Victory Points (VP) towards winning conditions. Prioritize actions that directly lead to VP growth (e.g., building settlements/cities or creating roads if expanding settlements is possible). Additionally, consider blocking opponents’ expansion and achieving Longest Road or Largest Army. Here are the factors to consider:
  - VP contributions: How does this action increase Victory Points?
  - Resource optimization: Does this action improve resource variety or frequency?
  - Opponent impact: Does this action hinder opponents?
  ```
- **Action Context and Justification**: Force the LLM to evaluate and justify its decision explicitly with VP and strategic metrics as criteria:
  ```
  Action: {Chosen Action}
  VP Contribution: {Describe how this action contributes to Victory Points or other winning conditions (Longest Road, Largest Army, etc.)}
  Strategic Justification: {Explain why this action is optimal in your current state.}
  ```

---

### 4. Balancing Resource Accumulation and Strategic Investments
Introduce a dynamic system to balance competing objectives like upgrading cities versus building roads:
- **Resource Thresholds**:
   - Maintain a minimum resource reserve (e.g., 3 bricks and 3 wood) for road-building during the early game.
   - Shift to reserving ore and wheat when cities are needed in the late game.
  ```python
  if resources['brick'] > 2 and resources['wood'] > 2 and ActionType.BUILD_ROAD in actions:
      return build_road_action
  elif resources['ore'] > 3 and resources['wheat'] > 2 and ActionType.BUILD_CITY in actions:
      return build_city_action
  ```
- **Investment Diversification**:
   - Build roads as placeholders if resources for settlements or cities are insufficient, keeping future options open.
   - Introduce a trigger to prioritize development cards if no immediate high-value options exist.

---

### 5. Identifying Bottlenecks and Inefficiencies
Implement mechanisms to evaluate and eliminate stagnation in decision-making:
- **Action Tracking**:
  - Track patterns of repetitive actions (e.g., 3 consecutive END TURN actions) and trigger specific re-evaluations for resource optimization or blocking moves.
  - Introduce a "resource stall threshold": If surplus resources accumulate beyond a predefined number, focus on spending them, even on sub-optimal actions.
- **Post-Action Evaluation**:
  - After every game session, log actions with their outcomes (e.g., Did this action result in VP gain or resource improvement?).
  - Use decision heatmaps to identify action sequences that correlate with stagnation (e.g., prolonged road-building with no settlements).
- **Dynamic Decision Adjustment**:
  - Adjust scoring to aggressively penalize repetitive non-contributory actions.
  ```python
  if "END TURN" repeats more than twice:
      print(f"Repeated END TURN actions detected. Prioritizing an alternative action.")
      # Force expansion or development actions here.
  ```

---

### Next Steps:
1. Prioritize enhancing heuristic scoring to drive better early-game performance.
2. Adjust fallback mechanisms to emphasize forward-looking strategies like settlement preparation.
3. Integrate bottleneck detection mechanisms for iteration feedback and adapt the LLM query structure for immediate impact.

END STRATEGY.================================== Ai Message ==================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Implement a strategy that improves both early and late-game decision-making for FooPlayer through advanced heuristics, adjusted fallback mechanisms, and refined LLM prompts, achieving measurable improvements in metrics such as roads, settlements, and victory points.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Integrate enhanced heuristic scoring and dynamic fallback priorities into the decision flow while refining LLM responses for strategic action selection, focusing on VP growth and efficient resource use.

CHOSEN AGENT: CODER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:  
Modify FooPlayer to implement the strategies outlined in the five key areas. Specifically:

1. **Enhance Heuristic Scoring**:
   - Add multipliers for actions directly contributing to Victory Points, such as settlement building and city upgrading.
   - Dynamically adjust scores based on the game stage (early vs. late-game priorities), prioritizing roads and settlements early while focusing on VP-heavy actions late.

2. **Dynamic Fallback Mechanism**:
   - Revise the fallback mechanism to focus on early-game expansion via roads and settlements as placeholders for resource diversity and VP accumulation.
   - Later transition fallback logic to VP-centric actions like city upgrades and development cards.

3. **Refined LLM Prompt**:
   - Update the LLM prompt to emphasize VP growth explicitly.
   - Demand justification for actions based on Victory Points and strategic blocking of opponents.

4. **Resource Threshold Balancing**:
   - Introduce logic for maintaining resource reserves and diversifying investments based on available actions.
   - Trigger placeholder actions like road-building when strategic objectives are temporarily unattainable.

5. **Action Bottleneck Detection**:
   - Implement tracking logic for repetitive unproductive actions (e.g., repeated "END TURN").
   - Adjust decision scoring to discourage stagnation, forcing resource spending or defensive actions when necessary.

Make necessary modifications to the `decide` method and auxiliary functions like `_build_prompt` and `heuristic_scores`. Run a test iteration post-implementation to ensure that the changes positively impact FooPlayer performance.================================ Human Message =================================

After Running The New foo_player.py Player, Here is my analysis and findings:

### Scores of FooPlayer:
- Wins: 0  
- Average Victory Points (VP): 2.6666666666666665  
- Average Settlements: 1.3333333333333333

- Average Roads: 0.0  
- Average Largest Army: 0.0  
- Average Development VP: 0.0  

### Short Analysis of Game Output:
- **Repetitive Logs**: Multiple instances of LLM responses defaulting to basic actions such as "ROLL" and "END TURN," with justifications suggesting limited strategic depth. Example: "Rolling is necessary to progress the game state."
- **Neutral Heuristic Scoring**: Actions often evaluated with a low heuristic score (`1`). This indicates the heuristic system fails to differentiate between strategic actions.
- **Misalignment**: High-priority actions like "BUILD_CITY" or "BUILD_SETTLEMENT" seem underutilized, despite occasional high heuristic scores visible in logs. 

### Errors, Warnings, or Signs of Implementation Issues:
- **LLM Integration Weakness**: Responses imply poor decision quality by prioritizing roll/end-turn actions excessively. This indicates the prompt design and parsing mechanisms need refinement.
- **Strategic Gaps**: Failure to build roads or utilize army resources, even across multiple turns, suggests severe strategic deficiencies. The game log reinforces these gaps.
- **Warning**: Logs frequently state "Fallback mechanism applied," implying reliance on basic action prioritization rather than effective LLM outputs.

Let me know if you need anything else!================================== Ai Message ==================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Improve FooPlayer’s strategic depth by refining heuristic accuracy, enhancing LLM prompts to advocate stronger strategic actions, and reducing reliance on the fallback mechanism. Focus on measurable improvements in roads, settlements, and cities over the next 5 iterations.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Address the strategic misalignment by:
1. Refactoring heuristics to better differentiate and prioritize optimal actions (e.g., building roads, settlements, and cities).
2. Revising the LLM prompt design to explicitly prioritize non-default, VP-centric, and impactful actions.
3. Adjusting the fallback mechanism to penalize repetitive default actions and ensure meaningful progression.

CHOSEN AGENT: STRATEGIZER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:  
Provide 5 specific refinements or new strategies to improve FooPlayer’s decision-making system, focusing on the following:
1. How to recalibrate heuristic scoring to strongly favor foundational growth actions like roads and settlements early on.
2. Techniques to adjust prompt design to directly steer the LLM away from repetitive or low-value default actions.
3. Criteria for dynamically detecting high-impact actions (strategic bottlenecks or game pivots) and encouraging the LLM or fallback decision to prioritize them.
4. Hybrid mechanisms blending determinate strategic templates for fallback actions alongside heuristic-driven flexibility.
5. Methods to evaluate and tune the heuristic scoring weights and LLM response handling over multiple evolutions, ensuring consistent improvement in strategic metrics.================================ Human Message =================================

STRATEGY:

### 1. Recalibrating Heuristic Scoring for Early Foundational Growth
Refine the heuristic scoring system to prioritize foundational growth actions, particularly during the early game:
- **Dynamic Weight Adjustments for Game Stages**:
  - **Early Game**:
    - Roads: Score 10 (high priority for expansion).
    - Settlements: Score 8 (emphasize resource diversity and availability).
    - Cities: Score 5 (lower priority due to resource scarcity early on).
  - **Mid to Late Game**:
    - Settlements: Score 10 (needed for reaching VP thresholds).
    - Cities: Score 15 (maximize VP by converting settlements to cities).
    - Roads: Score 7 (focus on Longest Road or movement towards strategic settlement spots).  
- **Tile Resource Heuristic**:
  - Assign weighted scores to actions based on resource tile priority:
    - High-Value Tiles: Prioritize intersections with tiles like 6, 8 (ore/wheat bonuses), increasing the heuristic scores of these actions.
    ```python
    if action.action_type == ActionType.BUILD_SETTLEMENT and action.location.resource_value > 15:
        heuristic_scores[action] += 3  # Boost for high-value tiles
    ```
- **Disruption Consideration**:
  - Actions that block opponent growth (road connections or settlements) receive a bonus.

---

### 2. Adjusting Prompt Design to Guide the LLM Towards High-Impact Actions
Update the LLM prompt construction to explicitly penalize repetitive or low-value actions and focus on strategic, VP-driving goals:
- **Segmented Descriptions with Action Prioritization**:
  ```
  You are tasked with making the most impactful move in the Catanatron Minigame. Always prioritize actions with long-term strategic benefits over short-term results. Avoid repetitive, low-impact actions like ending turns without building to progress.
  
  Current Priorities:
  1. Expand settlements and roads for resource variety and VP growth.
  2. Upgrade settlements to cities to maximize VP.
  3. Act to hinder opponents’ expansion when possible.
  
  Consider the following heuristic scores and game state in your decision:
  ```
  - Add structured fields for each action to explicitly indicate their heuristic weight, stage relevance, and potential impact:
    ```
    Action: {Action}
    Heuristic Score: {Score}
    Stage Priority: {Early/Mid/Late Game Relevance}
    Impact: {How this action will improve VP or hinder opponents}
    ```

---

### 3. Dynamic Detection of High-Impact Actions (Bottlenecks or Game Pivots)
Introduce dynamic logic to identify and prioritize high-impact actions during pivotal game moments:
- **Bottleneck Identification**:
  - Detect signs of resource stagnation or unspent resources (e.g., excessive ore/wheat without city upgrades or brick/wood without roads/settlements).
  ```python
  if player_resources['brick'] >= 3 and player_resources['wood'] >= 3:
      heuristic_scores[ActionType.BUILD_ROAD] += 5  # Encourage spending surplus
  ```
  - Time-based triggers: Penalize repeated "END TURN" or fallback actions and boost the use of active building moves.
- **Strategic Pivot Boosting**:
  - Add bonuses to actions when triggered by game-specific pivots:
    - Longest Road: Encourage roads when near the threshold for Longest Road.
    - Largest Army: Prioritize development card purchases when competing for Largest Army or sabotaging opponents.
    ```python
    if current_army_size >= 2 and opponents_army_size <= current_army_size:
        heuristic_scores[action] += 4  # Edge out Largest Army
    ```

---

### 4. Hybrid Mechanisms for Fallback Actions
Redesign the fallback system to incorporate both deterministic templates and heuristic-driven flexibility:
- **Action Templates by Priority**:
  - Use deterministic logic based on game stage:
    - Early Game: Build roads and settlements to ensure resource coverage.
    - Mid-Late Game: Prioritize cities for VP growth or roads for Longest Road.
  ```python
  for action_type in ["BUILD_CITY", "BUILD_SETTLEMENT", "BUILD_ROAD"]:
      for action in playable_actions:
          if action.action_type == action_type and action meets_conditions:
              return action
  ```
- **Heuristic-Fallback Hybrid**:
  - If no deterministic action is suitable, rely on heuristic priorities derived from current state evaluations to make fallback decisions.
- **Penalty for Stagnation**:
  - Penalize fallback repetitions by gradually increasing the weight on impactful actions like settlement-building or resource diversity improvements.

---

### 5. Methods to Evaluate and Refine Heuristics and LLM Response Handling
Design a structured framework for tuning heuristics and refining LLM responses over multiple game iterations:
- **Performance Metrics**:
  - Track metrics such as VP growth per iteration, total roads/cities/settlements built, and resource efficiency (unused resources).
  - Correlate LLM responses and fallback heuristic effectiveness with game outcomes.
- **Iterative Weight Adjustment**:
  - Analyze N-game results to adjust heuristic weights dynamically:
    - If too many roads are built without follow-up settlements, reduce road priority.
    - If city upgrades lead to stagnation due to resource imbalances, shift the weighting back to settlements.
  ```python
  if settlements_built < expected_settlement_threshold:
      heuristic_weights['BUILD_SETTLEMENT'] += 2
  ```
- **Benchmarking Against Rule-Based Baselines**:
  - Compare LLM-driven decisions with predefined optimal or rule-based actions to evaluate alignment with strategic goals.
  - Use deviation scores to identify areas where LLM prompts need refinement (e.g., under-prioritizing Largest Army or Longest Road).

---

### Next Steps:
1. Begin recalibrating heuristic scores to reflect stage-specific priorities.
2. Implement the updated prompt design to explicitly guide LLM responses toward non-repetitive, VP-centric strategies.
3. Integrate fallback mechanisms with dynamic, bottleneck-based adjustments to address stagnation and repeated default actions.
4. Build tools for iterative heuristic tuning and response evaluation against predefined baselines.

END STRATEGY.================================== Ai Message ==================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Over the next 5 iterations, implement and refine a system that better aligns FooPlayer's heuristic evaluation, LLM prompt design, and fallback mechanisms towards impactful, VP-driven actions. Aim for measurable improvements in foundational metrics like roads, settlements, and cities.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Recalibrate FooPlayer's heuristic scoring system to implement stage-specific priorities and dynamically address bottlenecks, ensuring better alignment between heuristic-driven actions and LLM output. Update the LLM prompt design to explicitly focus on VP growth and reduce low-value decision patterns.

1. **Enhanced Heuristic Scoring**: 
    - Modify `_compute_heuristic_scores` to include stage-specific priorities:
      - Early-game boosts for roads and settlements.
      - Late-game emphasis on cities and development cards.
    - Include dynamic bottle-neck handling, e.g.:
      - Reward actions that address resource buildup or stagnation.
      - Encourage actions that disrupt opponents (e.g., blocking roads/settlements).
    - Use tile values (6, 8, etc.) to boost settlement scores for strategic intersections.

2. **Refined LLM Prompt**:
    - Update `_build_prompt` with stronger emphasis on guiding actions toward VP and strategic goals:
      - Enumerate priorities explicitly: building roads, settlements, cities.
      - Include heuristic scores in the prompt with descriptions of why actions are valuable.
      - Penalize repetitive actions like "END TURN" through explicit discouragement in the prompt.

3. **Fallback Mechanism Adjustment**:
    - Introduce deterministic templates for stage-specific fallback actions:
      - Early-game: Prioritize roads and settlements for expansion.
      - Late-game: Focus on cities and VP-centric actions.
    - Dynamically adapt fallback decisions based on resource surplus or game state bottlenecks.
    ```python
    if player_resources["brick"] >= 3 and player_resources["wood"] >= 3:
        heuristic_scores[ActionType.BUILD_ROAD] += 5
    ```

4. **Action Bottleneck Detection**:
    - Add detection for repetitive or stagnating actions (e.g., unspent resources or repeated "END TURN").
    - Penalize stagnation by prioritizing resource expenditure and spatial expansion.

Upon completing the updates, test the revised player for functional improvements in decision-making, focusing on roads, settlements, and overall strategic progression.================================ Human Message =================================

CODER

### Updates to `foo_player.py`:
1. **Enhanced Heuristic Scoring**:
   - Integrated stage-specific priorities (e.g., roads and settlements emphasized early-game, cities in mid-late game).
   - Added bonuses for high-resource tiles in settlement actions.
   - Introduced penalties to address resource bottlenecks (e.g., surplus brick/wood triggers road-building incentives).
   - Incorporated logic to dynamically adjust scores based on resource availability and VP contributions.

2. **Refined LLM Prompt**:
   - Redesigned `_build_prompt` to better guide the LLM:
     - Explicit priorities for strategic actions based on Victory Point (VP) growth.
     - Highlighted roadmap for early-game road/settlement building and late-game upgrades.
     - Discouraged repetitive or non-impactful actions like unnecessary turns.
   - Included heuristic scores in the prompt, with explanations for why certain actions are prioritized.

3. **Dynamic Fallback Mechanism**:
   - Structured fallback logic to prioritize actions based on game state:
     - Early-game: Roads and settlements.
     - Late-game: Cities and VP-centric actions.
   - Updated fallback mechanism to prevent stagnation by using deterministic templates blended with heuristic-driven conditions.

4. **Bottleneck and Surplus Resource Handling**:
   - Added logic to detect and dynamically handle situations where surplus resources exist (e.g., incentivizing road-building on excess brick/wood).
   - Increased priority for settlement or city building to resolve resource stagnation.

5. **Improved Logs**:
   - Added meaningful print statements across key decision-making steps to facilitate debugging:
     - Fallback actions.
     - Detected bottlenecks or resource imbalances.
     - LLM responses (and when fallback mechanisms are triggered).

### Testing Suggestions:
- **Evaluate Decision Quality**:
  - Test early-game actions for expansion focus (roads and settlements).
  - Verify mid-to-late game actions prioritize cities and VP-centric plays.
- **Monitor Bottleneck Response**:
  - Simulate resource-rich scenarios to observe if surplus resources are properly spent.
- **Validate Fallback Logic**:
  - Conduct games where the LLM fails or incorrectly parses the prompt to assess fallback success.
- **Track Metrics**:
  - Compare average VP, settlements, and city counts across multiple iterations to previous versions.

### Next Steps:
- Refine heuristic weights after testing to balance strategic trade-offs.
- Incorporate feedback cycles to analyze and further tune prompt alignment with heuristic evaluations.
- Observe repetitive "END TURN" penalties and ensure they improve game progression.

AttributeError: 'Action' object has no attribute 'location'================================ Human Message =================================

After Running The New foo_player.py Player, Here is my analysis and findings:

### Syntax Error Details:
- **Error Message**: `AttributeError: 'Action' object has no attribute 'location'`
- **Exact Line Number**: Line 90 in `foo_player.py`
- **Exact Line of Code**: `score = 8 + (3 if action.location.resource_value > 15 else 0)`

### Root Cause:
The `Action` class used in the code does not have an attribute `location`. This issue arises within the `_compute_heuristic_scores` method when attempting to access non-existent properties of the `Action` object.

### Impact:
This syntax error prevents the game from running, leading to no recorded results or scores for this evolution.

Let me know if you need anything else!================================== Ai Message ==================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Ensure FooPlayer's compatibility with the Catanatron API by resolving syntax errors and accurately utilizing the `Action` class attributes. Stabilize gameplay to allow evaluation of performance metrics over the next five iterations.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Fix the `AttributeError` by removing invalid references to the nonexistent `location` property in the `Action` class. Correct the scoring logic in `_compute_heuristic_scores` and replace erroneous calls with valid attributes from the `Action` class or game state.

CHOSEN AGENT: RESEARCHER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:  
Investigate the valid attributes and methods available in the `Action` class within the Catanatron API. Specifically:
1. Determine how to access the location or resource value associated with an action (if applicable).
2. Provide documentation or examples on other valid attributes of `Action` that might be relevant for heuristic scoring.
3. If no direct way exists to link `Action` to resource tiles or locations, suggest alternative ways to retrieve this context from the `Game` or `State` class for heuristic calculations.

Ensure the information is precise and actionable to debug and resolve the issue effectively.================================ Human Message =================================

RESEARCH:

### Investigation of the `Action` Class and Related Attributes
The `Action` class is part of the core mechanics for handling user actions during the gameplay. Here's the context based on the files:

#### 1. Valid Attributes of the `Action` Class
The `Action` class is defined and utilized in multiple modules. Its attributes are:
- **`color`**: Represents the player's color (e.g., `Color.BLUE`).
- **`action_type`**: Identifies the type of action (e.g., `ActionType.BUILD_SETTLEMENT`, `ActionType.PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD`).
- **`value`**: The specific content of the action based on its type. For example:
  - `Build actions` (`BUILD_SETTLEMENT`, `BUILD_CITY`) use `value` to represent the node location (`node_id`). 
  - `BUILD_ROAD` uses an `edge` object as its `value`.
  - In `MOVE_ROBBER`, `value` is a tuple such as `(coordinate, robbed_color, robbed_resource)`.

Attributes cannot directly reference nonexistent properties, such as `location`.

#### 2. Documentation and Examples of Related Action Types
Key samples of `Action` usage based on the context:
- **Action Initialization**:
  ```python
  Action(color, ActionType.BUILD_SETTLEMENT, node_id)
  Action(color, ActionType.MOVE_ROBBER, (coordinate, enemy_color, resource))
  Action(color, ActionType.ROLL, dice_roll_result)
  ```
- **Examples of Valid `ActionType` Values**:
  - Actions related to resource handling: `ROLL`, `MARITIME_TRADE`, `PLAY_YEAR_OF_PLENTY`, `PLAY_MONOPOLY`.
  - Building-related actions: `BUILD_ROAD`, `BUILD_SETTLEMENT`, `BUILD_CITY`.
  - Development cards and robber actions: `PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD`, `MOVE_ROBBER`.

#### 3. Accessing Location and Resource Context for an `Action`
The `Action` class itself does not store location or resource details unless explicitly set using the `value` attribute.

##### Alternatives for Accessing Context:
- **From the Game State (`State` Class)**:
  - To retrieve the current player's buildings (settlements, roads, etc.) or check surroundings:
    ```python
    buildings = state.buildings_by_color[Color.BLUE]
    settlements = buildings[SETTLEMENT]
    cities = buildings[CITY]
    ```
  - To get adjacent resource tiles for a node:
    ```python
    adjacent_tiles = state.board.map.adjacent_tiles[node_id]
    resources = [tile.resource for tile in adjacent_tiles if tile.resource is not None]
    ```
  - To get the bank's resource availability:
    ```python
    state.resource_freqdeck  # Bank’s current resources
    ```

- **Using `Action.value` for Specific Action Contexts**:
  In specific cases like building or moving, `Action.value` already provides relevant location-like data:
  - For building roads: Retrieve edges with `Action.value`.
  - For building settlements/cities: Use `node_id` from `Action.value`.

#### 4. Valid Methods for Game and State Interactions
Key methods/functions from the `Game` and `State`:
- **`Game` Class**:
  - `play_tick()`: Executes one game tick.
  - `winning_color()`: Returns the player currently winning the game.
  - `execute(action: Action)`: Executes a given action for a player.
  
- **`State` Class**:
  - `state.playable_actions`: Returns a list of actions currently available.
  - `state.board.buildable_node_ids(color)`: Returns node IDs where the player can build.
  - `state.player_state`: Dictionary containing details for each player (e.g., `Color.BLUE_CITIES_AVAILABLE`, `Color.BLUE_HAS_ROLLED`).

---

##### Additional Notes:
If there is a dependency on parsing `location` or `tile` data, it should instead rely on `Action.value` explicitly or query the `State` for adjacent tiles or positions as outlined above.

END RESEARCH.================================== Ai Message ==================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Ensure compatibility with the Catanatron API by appropriately integrating valid attributes of the `Action` class and utilizing game state data to enhance decision-making. Achieve stable functionality for testing strategic performance over the next 5 iterations.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Correct the `AttributeError` by refactoring `foo_player.py` to rely on valid `Action.value` attributes or query relevant context from the `State` class for heuristic scoring. Ensure all references to `location` are replaced with valid methods to retrieve positional or resource data.

CHOSEN AGENT: CODER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:
Refactor `foo_player.py` to address the syntax error and improve heuristic scoring:

1. **Fix Invalid References**:
   - Replace all calls to the nonexistent `action.location` with queries to `Action.value` or `State` methods.
   - Example adjustments:
     ```python
     if action.action_type == ActionType.BUILD_SETTLEMENT and len(state.board.map.adjacent_tiles[action.value]) > threshold:
         heuristic_scores[action] += 3
     ```
     Here, `action.value` provides the node ID where the settlement would be built.

2. **Context Retrieval from State**:
   - For actions like `BUILD_SETTLEMENT` or `BUILD_CITY`, retrieve adjacent tiles and their resource values using `state.board.map.adjacent_tiles[action.value]`.
   - For roads, use `Action.value` to access edge information and query connected tiles.

3. **Heuristic Scoring Enhancements**:
   - Incorporate valid context details from the state or action attributes to refine heuristic scoring:
     - High-value tiles should boost settlement scores:
       ```python
       adjacent_resources = [tile.resource for tile in state.board.map.adjacent_tiles[action.value] if tile.resource is not None]
       resource_bonus = sum(tile.value for resource in adjacent_resources)
       heuristic_scores[action] += resource_bonus
       ```

4. **Debugging and Validation**:
   - Ensure all invalid references are replaced with valid calls.
   - Add debug print statements to verify successful access to `Action.value` or state functions during gameplay.

Once refactoring is complete, test FooPlayer to confirm it runs without errors and demonstrate functional heuristic scoring improvements.================================ Human Message =================================

CODER

### Summary of Changes:
1. **Fixed `AttributeError`**:
   - Replaced invalid references to `action.location` with valid attribute and context retrieval using `action.value` and game state methods (e.g., accessing `state.board.map.adjacent_tiles` for settlement scoring).

2. **Improved Settlement Scoring**:
   - Enhanced `_compute_heuristic_scores` to calculate bonuses for settlements based on adjacent tiles' resource values using `state.board.map.adjacent_tiles[action.value]`.

3. **Resource Bottleneck Handling**:
   - Retained logic for surplus brick/wood to incentivize road-building.

4. **Improved Debugging**:
   - Added specific print statements during fallback and heuristic computation to verify logic.

5. **Dynamic Heuristic Refinements**:
   - Settlement scoring dynamically adjusts based on adjacent tile values, improving action prioritization.

### Testing Plan:
- Verify that the game runs without errors.
- Validate heuristic score calculations for settlements and roads using logs.
- Test gameplay performance:
  - Early-game: Expansion (settlements and roads).
  - Late-game: City-building and VP growth.

Let me know if the updated player behaves as expected or requires further refinements.

AttributeError: 'LandTile' object has no attribute 'value'================================ Human Message =================================

After Running The New foo_player.py Player, Here is my analysis and findings:

### Syntax Error Details:
- **Error Message**: `AttributeError: 'LandTile' object has no attribute 'value'`
- **Exact Line Number**: Line 92 in `foo_player.py`
- **Exact Line of Code**: `tile.value for tile in adjacent_tiles if tile.resource is not None`

### Root Cause:
The `LandTile` class does not have a `value` attribute as assumed in `_compute_heuristic_scores`. This error occurs when attempting to calculate resource bonuses for building settlements based on adjacent tiles.

### Impact:
The syntax error prevents the game from running, resulting in no recorded game results or player performance data for this evolution.

Let me know if you need anything else!================================== Ai Message ==================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Ensure compatibility with the Catanatron API and eliminate syntax errors by properly accessing attributes of the `LandTile` class and adjacent tiles during heuristic scoring. Stabilize gameplay for functional testing and iterative improvements in performance metrics.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Correct the error by replacing the incorrect reference to `tile.value` with valid calls to extract resource-related attributes or other properties from the `LandTile` class. Fully debug and ensure the heuristic scoring function runs smoothly without errors.

CHOSEN AGENT: RESEARCHER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:  
Investigate the `LandTile` class and its valid attributes. Specifically:
1. Identify what attributes or methods the `LandTile` class provides for retrieving resource-type or strategic value data.
2. Provide guidance on how to properly compute bonuses for adjacent tiles when building settlements or roads.
3. Suggest alternative approaches if direct resource value computation from `LandTile` is not viable.  

Ensure the information is actionable and tailored for correcting the heuristic scoring computations.================================ Human Message =================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Refactor FooPlayer to work seamlessly with the Catanatron API while continuing to enhance strategic decision-making via heuristic integration and LLM refinement. Achieve compatibility and avoid critical runtime errors in the next evolution to allow for testing and evaluation.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Resolve the `AttributeError` by ensuring that `foo_player.py` uses valid methods from the Catanatron `Game` class for retrieving player resources and other game state data. Validate the compatibility of all API calls in the `_build_prompt` method.

CHOSEN AGENT: RESEARCHER

AGENT OBJECTIVE: 
Identify the correct way to access the following game state information from the Catanatron API:
1. Player resources (e.g., wood, brick, grain, etc.) for a specific color (e.g., `Color.BLUE`).
2. Obtain other player and game statistics that might be relevant for building the LLM prompt (e.g., settlements, cities, roads, VP).
3. Provide a list of valid Game API methods and properties that could be helpful for efficiently querying such state details.

Ensure that the information provided directly addresses the API compatibility issues in `foo_player.py`.================================== Ai Message ==================================

RESEARCH:

#### Key Information on Accessing Game State Using Catanatron API

**1. Accessing Player Resources**
To retrieve resources (e.g., wood, brick, grain, etc.) for a specific player:
- Use the `get_player_freqdeck(state, color)` function, which provides the player's resource frequency deck.
  ```python
  from catanatron.state_functions import get_player_freqdeck
  player_resources = get_player_freqdeck(state, Color.BLUE)
  ```
- `player_num_resource_cards(state, color, resource)` can query the count for specific resources:
  ```python
  from catanatron.state_functions import player_num_resource_cards
  wood_count = player_num_resource_cards(state, Color.BLUE, "WOOD")
  ```

**2. Accessing Player and Game Statistics**
For settlements, cities, roads, and VP:
- **Settlements**: Use `get_player_buildings(state, color, "SETTLEMENT")` to retrieve settlement IDs of a player:
  ```python
  from catanatron.state_functions import get_player_buildings
  settlements = get_player_buildings(state, Color.BLUE, "SETTLEMENT")
  ```
- **Cities**: Similarly invoke `get_player_buildings(state, color, "CITY")` for city IDs:
  ```python
  cities = get_player_buildings(state, Color.BLUE, "CITY")
  ```
- **Roads Available**: Check roads available using state data:
  ```python
  player_key = player_key(state, Color.BLUE)
  roads_available = state.player_state[f"{player_key}_ROADS_AVAILABLE"]
  ```
- **Victory Points**: Victory points can be checked via:
  ```python
  victory_points = state.player_state[f"{player_key}_ACTUAL_VICTORY_POINTS"]
  ```

**3. General Game State Statistics**
The class `Game` contains the main API-level functions for interacting with game state, including:
- `play_tick()` to advance the game state.
- `winning_color()` to retrieve the player currently winning the game.
- `state.playable_actions` to list the valid actions at the current step.

```python
winning_player = game.winning_color()
playable_options = game.state.playable_actions
```

#### List of Useful Methods and Properties in Game API:
Valid methods within the `Game` class and associated functions:
- `get_player_freqdeck(state, color)` – Retrieves player's resources.
- `player_num_resource_cards(state, color, resource)` – Gets the count for specific resources.
- `player_key(state, color)` – Returns string key for player state.
- `get_player_buildings(state, color, building_type)` – Retrieves player's settlements/cities.
- `state.playable_actions` – Provides the currently executable actions.
- `game.play_tick()` – Advances game state one step.
- `game.winning_color()` – Returns the winning color/player.
- `state.colors` – Lists the colors in the game.

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Ensure FooPlayer's compatibility with the Catanatron API by resolving syntax errors and accurately utilizing the `Action` class attributes. Stabilize gameplay to allow evaluation of performance metrics over the next five iterations.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Fix the `AttributeError` by removing invalid references to the nonexistent `location` property in the `Action` class. Correct the scoring logic in `_compute_heuristic_scores` and replace erroneous calls with valid attributes from the `Action` class or game state.

CHOSEN AGENT: RESEARCHER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:  
Investigate the valid attributes and methods available in the `Action` class within the Catanatron API. Specifically:
1. Determine how to access the location or resource value associated with an action (if applicable).
2. Provide documentation or examples on other valid attributes of `Action` that might be relevant for heuristic scoring.
3. If no direct way exists to link `Action` to resource tiles or locations, suggest alternative ways to retrieve this context from the `Game` or `State` class for heuristic calculations.

Ensure the information is precise and actionable to debug and resolve the issue effectively.================================== Ai Message ==================================

RESEARCH:

### Investigation of the `Action` Class and Related Attributes
The `Action` class is part of the core mechanics for handling user actions during the gameplay. Here's the context based on the files:

#### 1. Valid Attributes of the `Action` Class
The `Action` class is defined and utilized in multiple modules. Its attributes are:
- **`color`**: Represents the player's color (e.g., `Color.BLUE`).
- **`action_type`**: Identifies the type of action (e.g., `ActionType.BUILD_SETTLEMENT`, `ActionType.PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD`).
- **`value`**: The specific content of the action based on its type. For example:
  - `Build actions` (`BUILD_SETTLEMENT`, `BUILD_CITY`) use `value` to represent the node location (`node_id`). 
  - `BUILD_ROAD` uses an `edge` object as its `value`.
  - In `MOVE_ROBBER`, `value` is a tuple such as `(coordinate, robbed_color, robbed_resource)`.

Attributes cannot directly reference nonexistent properties, such as `location`.

#### 2. Documentation and Examples of Related Action Types
Key samples of `Action` usage based on the context:
- **Action Initialization**:
  ```python
  Action(color, ActionType.BUILD_SETTLEMENT, node_id)
  Action(color, ActionType.MOVE_ROBBER, (coordinate, enemy_color, resource))
  Action(color, ActionType.ROLL, dice_roll_result)
  ```
- **Examples of Valid `ActionType` Values**:
  - Actions related to resource handling: `ROLL`, `MARITIME_TRADE`, `PLAY_YEAR_OF_PLENTY`, `PLAY_MONOPOLY`.
  - Building-related actions: `BUILD_ROAD`, `BUILD_SETTLEMENT`, `BUILD_CITY`.
  - Development cards and robber actions: `PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD`, `MOVE_ROBBER`.

#### 3. Accessing Location and Resource Context for an `Action`
The `Action` class itself does not store location or resource details unless explicitly set using the `value` attribute.

##### Alternatives for Accessing Context:
- **From the Game State (`State` Class)**:
  - To retrieve the current player's buildings (settlements, roads, etc.) or check surroundings:
    ```python
    buildings = state.buildings_by_color[Color.BLUE]
    settlements = buildings[SETTLEMENT]
    cities = buildings[CITY]
    ```
  - To get adjacent resource tiles for a node:
    ```python
    adjacent_tiles = state.board.map.adjacent_tiles[node_id]
    resources = [tile.resource for tile in adjacent_tiles if tile.resource is not None]
    ```
  - To get the bank's resource availability:
    ```python
    state.resource_freqdeck  # Bank’s current resources
    ```

- **Using `Action.value` for Specific Action Contexts**:
  In specific cases like building or moving, `Action.value` already provides relevant location-like data:
  - For building roads: Retrieve edges with `Action.value`.
  - For building settlements/cities: Use `node_id` from `Action.value`.

#### 4. Valid Methods for Game and State Interactions
Key methods/functions from the `Game` and `State`:
- **`Game` Class**:
  - `play_tick()`: Executes one game tick.
  - `winning_color()`: Returns the player currently winning the game.
  - `execute(action: Action)`: Executes a given action for a player.
  
- **`State` Class**:
  - `state.playable_actions`: Returns a list of actions currently available.
  - `state.board.buildable_node_ids(color)`: Returns node IDs where the player can build.
  - `state.player_state`: Dictionary containing details for each player (e.g., `Color.BLUE_CITIES_AVAILABLE`, `Color.BLUE_HAS_ROLLED`).

---

##### Additional Notes:
If there is a dependency on parsing `location` or `tile` data, it should instead rely on `Action.value` explicitly or query the `State` for adjacent tiles or positions as outlined above.

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Ensure compatibility with the Catanatron API and eliminate syntax errors by properly accessing attributes of the `LandTile` class and adjacent tiles during heuristic scoring. Stabilize gameplay for functional testing and iterative improvements in performance metrics.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Correct the error by replacing the incorrect reference to `tile.value` with valid calls to extract resource-related attributes or other properties from the `LandTile` class. Fully debug and ensure the heuristic scoring function runs smoothly without errors.

CHOSEN AGENT: RESEARCHER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:  
Investigate the `LandTile` class and its valid attributes. Specifically:
1. Identify what attributes or methods the `LandTile` class provides for retrieving resource-type or strategic value data.
2. Provide guidance on how to properly compute bonuses for adjacent tiles when building settlements or roads.
3. Suggest alternative approaches if direct resource value computation from `LandTile` is not viable.  

Ensure the information is actionable and tailored for correcting the heuristic scoring computations.================================== Ai Message ==================================

### Investigating Attributes and Methods of the `LandTile` Class
The `LandTile` class and associated structures define the core elements of gameplay tiles in the Catanatron framework. Here's a breakdown of the relevant components:

---

### **1. Valid Attributes of `LandTile`**
The `LandTile` class provides the following attributes:
- **`id`**: A unique identifier for the land tile.
- **`resource`**: The resource type for the tile (e.g., `WOOD`, `BRICK`, `WHEAT`, `SHEEP`, `ORE`, or `None` for desert tiles).
- **`number`**: The number associated with the tile (dice roll probability value). `None` indicates desert tiles.
- **`nodes`**: A dictionary where the keys are `NodeRef` values (relative positions like `NORTH`, `SOUTH`) and the values are `node_id`s.
- **`edges`**: A dictionary mapping `EdgeRef` (edge directions) to edge IDs.

Example usage:
```python
tile_id = land_tile.id
tile_resource = land_tile.resource  # e.g., WOOD
tile_number = land_tile.number  # e.g., 8 for a high-probability tile
tile_nodes = list(land_tile.nodes.values())  # Get the node IDs
tile_edges = list(land_tile.edges.values())  # Get associated edges
```

---

### **2. Calculating Bonuses or Context from Adjacent Tiles**
To compute heuristic bonuses from adjacent tiles when assigning strategic values for settlements or roads:

#### 2.1 Accessing Adjacent Tiles
The `CatanMap` object maintains an auxiliary structure for adjacent tiles:
- **`CatanMap.adjacent_tiles`**: Maps `node_id` to a list of `LandTile` objects surrounding that node.
  ```python
  adjacent_tiles = game.state.board.adjacent_tiles[node_id]
  for tile in adjacent_tiles:
      resource = tile.resource
      probability = tile.number_probability(tile.number)
      print(f"Adjacent tile {tile.id}: Resource={resource}, Probability={probability}")
  ```

#### 2.2 Computing Resource Production
You can estimate the cumulative production at a node based on resource probabilities of adjacent tiles:
- **`CatanMap.node_production`**: Maps `node_id` to a `Counter` of resource probabilities.
  ```python
  resource_production = game.state.board.node_production[node_id]
  # Example format: Counter({WOOD: 0.25, BRICK: 0.12})
  ```

---

### **3. Alternative Approaches if Direct Resource Value is Not Possible**
When direct computation is unavailable, use a combination of these methods:
- **Resource Contributions from Tiles**: Use `CatanMap.adjacent_tiles` and `LandTile.resource` or `LandTile.number`.
  ```python
  adjacent_tiles = game.state.board.adjacent_tiles[node_id]
  resource_values = [tile.resource for tile in adjacent_tiles if tile.resource]
  ```

- **Dice Roll Probability**: Use `number_probability()` on a tile’s `number`.
  ```python
  from catanatron.models.map import number_probability
  dice_probability = number_probability(tile.number)  # Roll chance for the tile
  ```

- **Ports and Trading Context**: If ports matter (e.g., for heuristic value), access via:
  ```python
  ports = game.state.board.port_nodes  # Get port mappings
  ```

---

### **Actionable Guidance for Heuristic Scoring**
To integrate this into the heuristic computation:
1. Replace `tile.value` in `_compute_heuristic_scores` with access to `tile.resource` or `tile.number`.
   ```python
   resource = tile.resource  # WOOD, BRICK, etc.
   probability = number_probability(tile.number)  # Dice probability
   ```
2. For adjacent tile context at `node_id`, query `game.state.board.adjacent_tiles`.
   ```python
   adjacent_tiles = game.state.board.adjacent_tiles[node_id]
   for tile in adjacent_tiles:
       if tile.resource is not None:
           resource_value = tile.resource
           probability = number_probability(tile.number)
   ```

---

END RESEARCH.================================== Ai Message ==================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Enhance the decision-making of FooPlayer by refining the strategic priorities directly implemented in both the heuristic framework and LLM prompt responses. Aim to improve measurable metrics such as roads, army, and settlements while moving closer to achieving winning conditions over the next 5 iterations.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Address the strategic weaknesses by introducing a deeper integration of heuristic priorities into the fallback mechanism and improving the clarity in LLM prompt responses to focus on VP growth, road-building, and settlements.

CHOSEN AGENT: STRATEGIZER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:  
Generate 5 improved strategies to address the current shortcomings:
1. Improvements to heuristic scoring that prioritize growth areas (e.g., building roads, achieving Largest Army).
2. Suggestions to alter fallback mechanisms to emphasize strategic contributions (e.g., prioritize roads early-game or settlements near resource-heavy tiles).
3. Refined LLM prompt designs that explicitly guide actions toward VP growth and strategic dominance.
4. Ideas to balance resource accumulation and strategic investments (e.g., cities vs roads) to diversify objectives.
5. Approach to identifying action bottlenecks that lead to stagnation (e.g., repeated patterns of "END TURN" or inefficient action sequences).================================ Human Message =================================

STRATEGY:

### 1. Improvements to Heuristic Scoring
Enhance heuristic scoring to align with strategic growth objectives and quantify the value of actions more effectively:
- **VP-Oriented Scoring**: Add a multiplier for actions directly contributing to Victory Points (e.g., upgrading to cities or building settlements on high-value intersections).
  ```python
  if action.action_type == ActionType.BUILD_SETTLEMENT and action.location.resource_value > threshold:
      heuristic_scores[action] = 10 + action.location.resource_value
  elif action.action_type == ActionType.BUILD_CITY:
      heuristic_scores[action] = 15
  elif action.action_type == ActionType.BUILD_ROAD:
      heuristic_scores[action] = 5 + len(connected_resources)
  ```
- **Dynamic Game Stage Consideration**: Assign higher scores to actions like building roads or settlements in the early game, shifting to cities and army card purchases in later stages based on available resources and board state.
- **Opponent Disruption**: Include metrics for actions that block opponents’ extensions or resource monopolies, such as cutting off road expansions.

---

### 2. Fallback Mechanism Adjustments
Revise the fallback mechanism to prioritize actions that align with broader strategic objectives:
- **Early-Game Priorities**:
  1. **Roads**: Emphasize road-building to expand quickly and secure settlement sites early (calculate heuristic road priority based on proximity to key tiles, e.g., 8/6/9 tiles).
  2. **Settlements**: Focus on openings that increase resource diversity and resource flow.
  ```python
  if len(settlements) < 3 and ActionType.BUILD_SETTLEMENT in actions:
      return next(action for action in actions if action.action_type == ActionType.BUILD_SETTLEMENT)
  ```
- **Late-Game Priorities**:
   - Transition to cities or army card purchases while only building roads/settlements to secure Longest Road or block opponents.
- **Secondary Metrics**:
   - Consider an aggregate utility metric (e.g., resource spillover from connected tiles) to decide between fallback paths.

---

### 3. Refined LLM Prompt Design
Re-orient the LLM prompt to place greater emphasis on VP growth and strategic objectives:
- **Structured Guidance**:
  ```
  You are tasked with growing Victory Points (VP) towards winning conditions. Prioritize actions that directly lead to VP growth (e.g., building settlements/cities or creating roads if expanding settlements is possible). Additionally, consider blocking opponents’ expansion and achieving Longest Road or Largest Army. Here are the factors to consider:
  - VP contributions: How does this action increase Victory Points?
  - Resource optimization: Does this action improve resource variety or frequency?
  - Opponent impact: Does this action hinder opponents?
  ```
- **Action Context and Justification**: Force the LLM to evaluate and justify its decision explicitly with VP and strategic metrics as criteria:
  ```
  Action: {Chosen Action}
  VP Contribution: {Describe how this action contributes to Victory Points or other winning conditions (Longest Road, Largest Army, etc.)}
  Strategic Justification: {Explain why this action is optimal in your current state.}
  ```

---

### 4. Balancing Resource Accumulation and Strategic Investments
Introduce a dynamic system to balance competing objectives like upgrading cities versus building roads:
- **Resource Thresholds**:
   - Maintain a minimum resource reserve (e.g., 3 bricks and 3 wood) for road-building during the early game.
   - Shift to reserving ore and wheat when cities are needed in the late game.
  ```python
  if resources['brick'] > 2 and resources['wood'] > 2 and ActionType.BUILD_ROAD in actions:
      return build_road_action
  elif resources['ore'] > 3 and resources['wheat'] > 2 and ActionType.BUILD_CITY in actions:
      return build_city_action
  ```
- **Investment Diversification**:
   - Build roads as placeholders if resources for settlements or cities are insufficient, keeping future options open.
   - Introduce a trigger to prioritize development cards if no immediate high-value options exist.

---

### 5. Identifying Bottlenecks and Inefficiencies
Implement mechanisms to evaluate and eliminate stagnation in decision-making:
- **Action Tracking**:
  - Track patterns of repetitive actions (e.g., 3 consecutive END TURN actions) and trigger specific re-evaluations for resource optimization or blocking moves.
  - Introduce a "resource stall threshold": If surplus resources accumulate beyond a predefined number, focus on spending them, even on sub-optimal actions.
- **Post-Action Evaluation**:
  - After every game session, log actions with their outcomes (e.g., Did this action result in VP gain or resource improvement?).
  - Use decision heatmaps to identify action sequences that correlate with stagnation (e.g., prolonged road-building with no settlements).
- **Dynamic Decision Adjustment**:
  - Adjust scoring to aggressively penalize repetitive non-contributory actions.
  ```python
  if "END TURN" repeats more than twice:
      print(f"Repeated END TURN actions detected. Prioritizing an alternative action.")
      # Force expansion or development actions here.
  ```

---

### Next Steps:
1. Prioritize enhancing heuristic scoring to drive better early-game performance.
2. Adjust fallback mechanisms to emphasize forward-looking strategies like settlement preparation.
3. Integrate bottleneck detection mechanisms for iteration feedback and adapt the LLM query structure for immediate impact.

END STRATEGY.================================== Ai Message ==================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Implement a strategy that improves both early and late-game decision-making for FooPlayer through advanced heuristics, adjusted fallback mechanisms, and refined LLM prompts, achieving measurable improvements in metrics such as roads, settlements, and victory points.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Integrate enhanced heuristic scoring and dynamic fallback priorities into the decision flow while refining LLM responses for strategic action selection, focusing on VP growth and efficient resource use.

CHOSEN AGENT: CODER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:  
Modify FooPlayer to implement the strategies outlined in the five key areas. Specifically:

1. **Enhance Heuristic Scoring**:
   - Add multipliers for actions directly contributing to Victory Points, such as settlement building and city upgrading.
   - Dynamically adjust scores based on the game stage (early vs. late-game priorities), prioritizing roads and settlements early while focusing on VP-heavy actions late.

2. **Dynamic Fallback Mechanism**:
   - Revise the fallback mechanism to focus on early-game expansion via roads and settlements as placeholders for resource diversity and VP accumulation.
   - Later transition fallback logic to VP-centric actions like city upgrades and development cards.

3. **Refined LLM Prompt**:
   - Update the LLM prompt to emphasize VP growth explicitly.
   - Demand justification for actions based on Victory Points and strategic blocking of opponents.

4. **Resource Threshold Balancing**:
   - Introduce logic for maintaining resource reserves and diversifying investments based on available actions.
   - Trigger placeholder actions like road-building when strategic objectives are temporarily unattainable.

5. **Action Bottleneck Detection**:
   - Implement tracking logic for repetitive unproductive actions (e.g., repeated "END TURN").
   - Adjust decision scoring to discourage stagnation, forcing resource spending or defensive actions when necessary.

Make necessary modifications to the `decide` method and auxiliary functions like `_build_prompt` and `heuristic_scores`. Run a test iteration post-implementation to ensure that the changes positively impact FooPlayer performance.================================ Human Message =================================

After Running The New foo_player.py Player, Here is my analysis and findings:

### Scores of FooPlayer:
- Wins: 0  
- Average Victory Points (VP): 2.6666666666666665  
- Average Settlements: 1.3333333333333333  
- Average Cities: 0.6666666666666666  
- Average Roads: 0.0  
- Average Largest Army: 0.0  
- Average Development VP: 0.0  

### Short Analysis of Game Output:
- **Repetitive Logs**: Multiple instances of LLM responses defaulting to basic actions such as "ROLL" and "END TURN," with justifications suggesting limited strategic depth. Example: "Rolling is necessary to progress the game state."
- **Neutral Heuristic Scoring**: Actions often evaluated with a low heuristic score (`1`). This indicates the heuristic system fails to differentiate between strategic actions.
- **Misalignment**: High-priority actions like "BUILD_CITY" or "BUILD_SETTLEMENT" seem underutilized, despite occasional high heuristic scores visible in logs. 

### Errors, Warnings, or Signs of Implementation Issues:
- **LLM Integration Weakness**: Responses imply poor decision quality by prioritizing roll/end-turn actions excessively. This indicates the prompt design and parsing mechanisms need refinement.
- **Strategic Gaps**: Failure to build roads or utilize army resources, even across multiple turns, suggests severe strategic deficiencies. The game log reinforces these gaps.
- **Warning**: Logs frequently state "Fallback mechanism applied," implying reliance on basic action prioritization rather than effective LLM outputs.

Let me know if you need anything else!================================== Ai Message ==================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Improve FooPlayer’s strategic depth by refining heuristic accuracy, enhancing LLM prompts to advocate stronger strategic actions, and reducing reliance on the fallback mechanism. Focus on measurable improvements in roads, settlements, and cities over the next 5 iterations.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Address the strategic misalignment by:
1. Refactoring heuristics to better differentiate and prioritize optimal actions (e.g., building roads, settlements, and cities).
2. Revising the LLM prompt design to explicitly prioritize non-default, VP-centric, and impactful actions.
3. Adjusting the fallback mechanism to penalize repetitive default actions and ensure meaningful progression.

CHOSEN AGENT: STRATEGIZER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:  
Provide 5 specific refinements or new strategies to improve FooPlayer’s decision-making system, focusing on the following:
1. How to recalibrate heuristic scoring to strongly favor foundational growth actions like roads and settlements early on.
2. Techniques to adjust prompt design to directly steer the LLM away from repetitive or low-value default actions.
3. Criteria for dynamically detecting high-impact actions (strategic bottlenecks or game pivots) and encouraging the LLM or fallback decision to prioritize them.
4. Hybrid mechanisms blending determinate strategic templates for fallback actions alongside heuristic-driven flexibility.
5. Methods to evaluate and tune the heuristic scoring weights and LLM response handling over multiple evolutions, ensuring consistent improvement in strategic metrics.================================ Human Message =================================

STRATEGY:

### 1. Recalibrating Heuristic Scoring for Early Foundational Growth
Refine the heuristic scoring system to prioritize foundational growth actions, particularly during the early game:
- **Dynamic Weight Adjustments for Game Stages**:
  - **Early Game**:
    - Roads: Score 10 (high priority for expansion).
    - Settlements: Score 8 (emphasize resource diversity and availability).
    - Cities: Score 5 (lower priority due to resource scarcity early on).
  - **Mid to Late Game**:
    - Settlements: Score 10 (needed for reaching VP thresholds).
    - Cities: Score 15 (maximize VP by converting settlements to cities).
    - Roads: Score 7 (focus on Longest Road or movement towards strategic settlement spots).  
- **Tile Resource Heuristic**:
  - Assign weighted scores to actions based on resource tile priority:
    - High-Value Tiles: Prioritize intersections with tiles like 6, 8 (ore/wheat bonuses), increasing the heuristic scores of these actions.
    ```python
    if action.action_type == ActionType.BUILD_SETTLEMENT and action.location.resource_value > 15:
        heuristic_scores[action] += 3  # Boost for high-value tiles
    ```
- **Disruption Consideration**:
  - Actions that block opponent growth (road connections or settlements) receive a bonus.

---

### 2. Adjusting Prompt Design to Guide the LLM Towards High-Impact Actions
Update the LLM prompt construction to explicitly penalize repetitive or low-value actions and focus on strategic, VP-driving goals:
- **Segmented Descriptions with Action Prioritization**:
  ```
  You are tasked with making the most impactful move in the Catanatron Minigame. Always prioritize actions with long-term strategic benefits over short-term results. Avoid repetitive, low-impact actions like ending turns without building to progress.
  
  Current Priorities:
  1. Expand settlements and roads for resource variety and VP growth.
  2. Upgrade settlements to cities to maximize VP.
  3. Act to hinder opponents’ expansion when possible.
  
  Consider the following heuristic scores and game state in your decision:
  ```
  - Add structured fields for each action to explicitly indicate their heuristic weight, stage relevance, and potential impact:
    ```
    Action: {Action}
    Heuristic Score: {Score}
    Stage Priority: {Early/Mid/Late Game Relevance}
    Impact: {How this action will improve VP or hinder opponents}
    ```

---

### 3. Dynamic Detection of High-Impact Actions (Bottlenecks or Game Pivots)
Introduce dynamic logic to identify and prioritize high-impact actions during pivotal game moments:
- **Bottleneck Identification**:
  - Detect signs of resource stagnation or unspent resources (e.g., excessive ore/wheat without city upgrades or brick/wood without roads/settlements).
  ```python
  if player_resources['brick'] >= 3 and player_resources['wood'] >= 3:
      heuristic_scores[ActionType.BUILD_ROAD] += 5  # Encourage spending surplus
  ```
  - Time-based triggers: Penalize repeated "END TURN" or fallback actions and boost the use of active building moves.
- **Strategic Pivot Boosting**:
  - Add bonuses to actions when triggered by game-specific pivots:
    - Longest Road: Encourage roads when near the threshold for Longest Road.
    - Largest Army: Prioritize development card purchases when competing for Largest Army or sabotaging opponents.
    ```python
    if current_army_size >= 2 and opponents_army_size <= current_army_size:
        heuristic_scores[action] += 4  # Edge out Largest Army
    ```

---

### 4. Hybrid Mechanisms for Fallback Actions
Redesign the fallback system to incorporate both deterministic templates and heuristic-driven flexibility:
- **Action Templates by Priority**:
  - Use deterministic logic based on game stage:
    - Early Game: Build roads and settlements to ensure resource coverage.
    - Mid-Late Game: Prioritize cities for VP growth or roads for Longest Road.
  ```python
  for action_type in ["BUILD_CITY", "BUILD_SETTLEMENT", "BUILD_ROAD"]:
      for action in playable_actions:
          if action.action_type == action_type and action meets_conditions:
              return action
  ```
- **Heuristic-Fallback Hybrid**:
  - If no deterministic action is suitable, rely on heuristic priorities derived from current state evaluations to make fallback decisions.
- **Penalty for Stagnation**:
  - Penalize fallback repetitions by gradually increasing the weight on impactful actions like settlement-building or resource diversity improvements.

---

### 5. Methods to Evaluate and Refine Heuristics and LLM Response Handling
Design a structured framework for tuning heuristics and refining LLM responses over multiple game iterations:
- **Performance Metrics**:
  - Track metrics such as VP growth per iteration, total roads/cities/settlements built, and resource efficiency (unused resources).
  - Correlate LLM responses and fallback heuristic effectiveness with game outcomes.
- **Iterative Weight Adjustment**:
  - Analyze N-game results to adjust heuristic weights dynamically:
    - If too many roads are built without follow-up settlements, reduce road priority.
    - If city upgrades lead to stagnation due to resource imbalances, shift the weighting back to settlements.
  ```python
  if settlements_built < expected_settlement_threshold:
      heuristic_weights['BUILD_SETTLEMENT'] += 2
  ```
- **Benchmarking Against Rule-Based Baselines**:
  - Compare LLM-driven decisions with predefined optimal or rule-based actions to evaluate alignment with strategic goals.
  - Use deviation scores to identify areas where LLM prompts need refinement (e.g., under-prioritizing Largest Army or Longest Road).

---

### Next Steps:
1. Begin recalibrating heuristic scores to reflect stage-specific priorities.
2. Implement the updated prompt design to explicitly guide LLM responses toward non-repetitive, VP-centric strategies.
3. Integrate fallback mechanisms with dynamic, bottleneck-based adjustments to address stagnation and repeated default actions.
4. Build tools for iterative heuristic tuning and response evaluation against predefined baselines.

END STRATEGY.================================== Ai Message ==================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Over the next 5 iterations, implement and refine a system that better aligns FooPlayer's heuristic evaluation, LLM prompt design, and fallback mechanisms towards impactful, VP-driven actions. Aim for measurable improvements in foundational metrics like roads, settlements, and cities.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Recalibrate FooPlayer's heuristic scoring system to implement stage-specific priorities and dynamically address bottlenecks, ensuring better alignment between heuristic-driven actions and LLM output. Update the LLM prompt design to explicitly focus on VP growth and reduce low-value decision patterns.

CHOSEN AGENT: CODER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:  
Update `foo_player.py` as follows:

1. **Enhanced Heuristic Scoring**: 
    - Modify `_compute_heuristic_scores` to include stage-specific priorities:
      - Early-game boosts for roads and settlements.
      - Late-game emphasis on cities and development cards.
    - Include dynamic bottle-neck handling, e.g.:
      - Reward actions that address resource buildup or stagnation.
      - Encourage actions that disrupt opponents (e.g., blocking roads/settlements).
    - Use tile values (6, 8, etc.) to boost settlement scores for strategic intersections.

2. **Refined LLM Prompt**:
    - Update `_build_prompt` with stronger emphasis on guiding actions toward VP and strategic goals:
      - Enumerate priorities explicitly: building roads, settlements, cities.
      - Include heuristic scores in the prompt with descriptions of why actions are valuable.
      - Penalize repetitive actions like "END TURN" through explicit discouragement in the prompt.

3. **Fallback Mechanism Adjustment**:
    - Introduce deterministic templates for stage-specific fallback actions:
      - Early-game: Prioritize roads and settlements for expansion.
      - Late-game: Focus on cities and VP-centric actions.
    - Dynamically adapt fallback decisions based on resource surplus or game state bottlenecks.
    ```python
    if player_resources["brick"] >= 3 and player_resources["wood"] >= 3:
        heuristic_scores[ActionType.BUILD_ROAD] += 5
    ```

4. **Action Bottleneck Detection**:
    - Add detection for repetitive or stagnating actions (e.g., unspent resources or repeated "END TURN").
    - Penalize stagnation by prioritizing resource expenditure and spatial expansion.

Upon completing the updates, test the revised player for functional improvements in decision-making, focusing on roads, settlements, and overall strategic progression.================================ Human Message =================================

CODER

### Updates to `foo_player.py`:
1. **Enhanced Heuristic Scoring**:
   - Integrated stage-specific priorities (e.g., roads and settlements emphasized early-game, cities in mid-late game).
   - Added bonuses for high-resource tiles in settlement actions.
   - Introduced penalties to address resource bottlenecks (e.g., surplus brick/wood triggers road-building incentives).
   - Incorporated logic to dynamically adjust scores based on resource availability and VP contributions.

2. **Refined LLM Prompt**:
   - Redesigned `_build_prompt` to better guide the LLM:
     - Explicit priorities for strategic actions based on Victory Point (VP) growth.
     - Highlighted roadmap for early-game road/settlement building and late-game upgrades.
     - Discouraged repetitive or non-impactful actions like unnecessary turns.
   - Included heuristic scores in the prompt, with explanations for why certain actions are prioritized.

3. **Dynamic Fallback Mechanism**:
   - Structured fallback logic to prioritize actions based on game state:
     - Early-game: Roads and settlements.
     - Late-game: Cities and VP-centric actions.
   - Updated fallback mechanism to prevent stagnation by using deterministic templates blended with heuristic-driven conditions.

4. **Bottleneck and Surplus Resource Handling**:
   - Added logic to detect and dynamically handle situations where surplus resources exist (e.g., incentivizing road-building on excess brick/wood).
   - Increased priority for settlement or city building to resolve resource stagnation.

5. **Improved Logs**:
   - Added meaningful print statements across key decision-making steps to facilitate debugging:
     - Fallback actions.
     - Detected bottlenecks or resource imbalances.
     - LLM responses (and when fallback mechanisms are triggered).

### Testing Suggestions:
- **Evaluate Decision Quality**:
  - Test early-game actions for expansion focus (roads and settlements).
  - Verify mid-to-late game actions prioritize cities and VP-centric plays.
- **Monitor Bottleneck Response**:
  - Simulate resource-rich scenarios to observe if surplus resources are properly spent.
- **Validate Fallback Logic**:
  - Conduct games where the LLM fails or incorrectly parses the prompt to assess fallback success.
- **Track Metrics**:
  - Compare average VP, settlements, and city counts across multiple iterations to previous versions.

### Next Steps:
- Refine heuristic weights after testing to balance strategic trade-offs.
- Incorporate feedback cycles to analyze and further tune prompt alignment with heuristic evaluations.
- Observe repetitive "END TURN" penalties and ensure they improve game progression.

AttributeError: 'Action' object has no attribute 'location'================================ Human Message =================================

After Running The New foo_player.py Player, Here is my analysis and findings:

### Syntax Error Details:
- **Error Message**: `AttributeError: 'Action' object has no attribute 'location'`
- **Exact Line Number**: Line 90 in `foo_player.py`
- **Exact Line of Code**: `score = 8 + (3 if action.location.resource_value > 15 else 0)`

### Root Cause:
The `Action` class used in the code does not have an attribute `location`. This issue arises within the `_compute_heuristic_scores` method when attempting to access non-existent properties of the `Action` object.

### Impact:
This syntax error prevents the game from running, leading to no recorded results or scores for this evolution.

Let me know if you need anything else!================================== Ai Message ==================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Ensure FooPlayer's compatibility with the Catanatron API by resolving syntax errors and accurately utilizing the `Action` class attributes. Stabilize gameplay to allow evaluation of performance metrics over the next five iterations.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Fix the `AttributeError` by removing invalid references to the nonexistent `location` property in the `Action` class. Correct the scoring logic in `_compute_heuristic_scores` and replace erroneous calls with valid attributes from the `Action` class or game state.

CHOSEN AGENT: RESEARCHER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:  
Investigate the valid attributes and methods available in the `Action` class within the Catanatron API. Specifically:
1. Determine how to access the location or resource value associated with an action (if applicable).
2. Provide documentation or examples on other valid attributes of `Action` that might be relevant for heuristic scoring.
3. If no direct way exists to link `Action` to resource tiles or locations, suggest alternative ways to retrieve this context from the `Game` or `State` class for heuristic calculations.

Ensure the information is precise and actionable to debug and resolve the issue effectively.================================ Human Message =================================

RESEARCH:

### Investigation of the `Action` Class and Related Attributes
The `Action` class is part of the core mechanics for handling user actions during the gameplay. Here's the context based on the files:

#### 1. Valid Attributes of the `Action` Class
The `Action` class is defined and utilized in multiple modules. Its attributes are:
- **`color`**: Represents the player's color (e.g., `Color.BLUE`).
- **`action_type`**: Identifies the type of action (e.g., `ActionType.BUILD_SETTLEMENT`, `ActionType.PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD`).
- **`value`**: The specific content of the action based on its type. For example:
  - `Build actions` (`BUILD_SETTLEMENT`, `BUILD_CITY`) use `value` to represent the node location (`node_id`). 
  - `BUILD_ROAD` uses an `edge` object as its `value`.
  - In `MOVE_ROBBER`, `value` is a tuple such as `(coordinate, robbed_color, robbed_resource)`.

Attributes cannot directly reference nonexistent properties, such as `location`.

#### 2. Documentation and Examples of Related Action Types
Key samples of `Action` usage based on the context:
- **Action Initialization**:
  ```python
  Action(color, ActionType.BUILD_SETTLEMENT, node_id)
  Action(color, ActionType.MOVE_ROBBER, (coordinate, enemy_color, resource))
  Action(color, ActionType.ROLL, dice_roll_result)
  ```
- **Examples of Valid `ActionType` Values**:
  - Actions related to resource handling: `ROLL`, `MARITIME_TRADE`, `PLAY_YEAR_OF_PLENTY`, `PLAY_MONOPOLY`.
  - Building-related actions: `BUILD_ROAD`, `BUILD_SETTLEMENT`, `BUILD_CITY`.
  - Development cards and robber actions: `PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD`, `MOVE_ROBBER`.

#### 3. Accessing Location and Resource Context for an `Action`
The `Action` class itself does not store location or resource details unless explicitly set using the `value` attribute.

##### Alternatives for Accessing Context:
- **From the Game State (`State` Class)**:
  - To retrieve the current player's buildings (settlements, roads, etc.) or check surroundings:
    ```python
    buildings = state.buildings_by_color[Color.BLUE]
    settlements = buildings[SETTLEMENT]
    cities = buildings[CITY]
    ```
  - To get adjacent resource tiles for a node:
    ```python
    adjacent_tiles = state.board.map.adjacent_tiles[node_id]
    resources = [tile.resource for tile in adjacent_tiles if tile.resource is not None]
    ```
  - To get the bank's resource availability:
    ```python
    state.resource_freqdeck  # Bank’s current resources
    ```

- **Using `Action.value` for Specific Action Contexts**:
  In specific cases like building or moving, `Action.value` already provides relevant location-like data:
  - For building roads: Retrieve edges with `Action.value`.
  - For building settlements/cities: Use `node_id` from `Action.value`.

#### 4. Valid Methods for Game and State Interactions
Key methods/functions from the `Game` and `State`:
- **`Game` Class**:
  - `play_tick()`: Executes one game tick.
  - `winning_color()`: Returns the player currently winning the game.
  - `execute(action: Action)`: Executes a given action for a player.
  
- **`State` Class**:
  - `state.playable_actions`: Returns a list of actions currently available.
  - `state.board.buildable_node_ids(color)`: Returns node IDs where the player can build.
  - `state.player_state`: Dictionary containing details for each player (e.g., `Color.BLUE_CITIES_AVAILABLE`, `Color.BLUE_HAS_ROLLED`).

---

##### Additional Notes:
If there is a dependency on parsing `location` or `tile` data, it should instead rely on `Action.value` explicitly or query the `State` for adjacent tiles or positions as outlined above.

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Ensure compatibility with the Catanatron API by appropriately integrating valid attributes of the `Action` class and utilizing game state data to enhance decision-making. Achieve stable functionality for testing strategic performance over the next 5 iterations.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Correct the `AttributeError` by refactoring `foo_player.py` to rely on valid `Action.value` attributes or query relevant context from the `State` class for heuristic scoring. Ensure all references to `location` are replaced with valid methods to retrieve positional or resource data.

CHOSEN AGENT: CODER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:
Refactor `foo_player.py` to address the syntax error and improve heuristic scoring:

1. **Fix Invalid References**:
   - Replace all calls to the nonexistent `action.location` with queries to `Action.value` or `State` methods.
   - Example adjustments:
     ```python
     if action.action_type == ActionType.BUILD_SETTLEMENT and len(state.board.map.adjacent_tiles[action.value]) > threshold:
         heuristic_scores[action] += 3
     ```
     Here, `action.value` provides the node ID where the settlement would be built.

2. **Context Retrieval from State**:
   - For actions like `BUILD_SETTLEMENT` or `BUILD_CITY`, retrieve adjacent tiles and their resource values using `state.board.map.adjacent_tiles[action.value]`.
   - For roads, use `Action.value` to access edge information and query connected tiles.

3. **Heuristic Scoring Enhancements**:
   - Incorporate valid context details from the state or action attributes to refine heuristic scoring:
     - High-value tiles should boost settlement scores:
       ```python
       adjacent_resources = [tile.resource for tile in state.board.map.adjacent_tiles[action.value] if tile.resource is not None]
       resource_bonus = sum(tile.value for resource in adjacent_resources)
       heuristic_scores[action] += resource_bonus
       ```

4. **Debugging and Validation**:
   - Ensure all invalid references are replaced with valid calls.
   - Add debug print statements to verify successful access to `Action.value` or state functions during gameplay.

Once refactoring is complete, test FooPlayer to confirm it runs without errors and demonstrate functional heuristic scoring improvements.================================ Human Message =================================

CODER

### Summary of Changes:
1. **Fixed `AttributeError`**:
   - Replaced invalid references to `action.location` with valid attribute and context retrieval using `action.value` and game state methods (e.g., accessing `state.board.map.adjacent_tiles` for settlement scoring).

2. **Improved Settlement Scoring**:
   - Enhanced `_compute_heuristic_scores` to calculate bonuses for settlements based on adjacent tiles' resource values using `state.board.map.adjacent_tiles[action.value]`.

3. **Resource Bottleneck Handling**:
   - Retained logic for surplus brick/wood to incentivize road-building.

4. **Improved Debugging**:
   - Added specific print statements during fallback and heuristic computation to verify logic.

5. **Dynamic Heuristic Refinements**:
   - Settlement scoring dynamically adjusts based on adjacent tile values, improving action prioritization.

### Testing Plan:
- Verify that the game runs without errors.
- Validate heuristic score calculations for settlements and roads using logs.
- Test gameplay performance:
  - Early-game: Expansion (settlements and roads).
  - Late-game: City-building and VP growth.

Let me know if the updated player behaves as expected or requires further refinements.

AttributeError: 'LandTile' object has no attribute 'value'================================ Human Message =================================

After Running The New foo_player.py Player, Here is my analysis and findings:

### Syntax Error Details:
- **Error Message**: `AttributeError: 'LandTile' object has no attribute 'value'`
- **Exact Line Number**: Line 92 in `foo_player.py`
- **Exact Line of Code**: `tile.value for tile in adjacent_tiles if tile.resource is not None`

### Root Cause:
The `LandTile` class does not have a `value` attribute as assumed in `_compute_heuristic_scores`. This error occurs when attempting to calculate resource bonuses for building settlements based on adjacent tiles.

### Impact:
The syntax error prevents the game from running, resulting in no recorded game results or player performance data for this evolution.

Let me know if you need anything else!================================== Ai Message ==================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Ensure compatibility with the Catanatron API and eliminate syntax errors by properly accessing attributes of the `LandTile` class and adjacent tiles during heuristic scoring. Stabilize gameplay for functional testing and iterative improvements in performance metrics.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Correct the error by replacing the incorrect reference to `tile.value` with valid calls to extract resource-related attributes or other properties from the `LandTile` class. Fully debug and ensure the heuristic scoring function runs smoothly without errors.

CHOSEN AGENT: RESEARCHER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:  
Investigate the `LandTile` class and its valid attributes. Specifically:
1. Identify what attributes or methods the `LandTile` class provides for retrieving resource-type or strategic value data.
2. Provide guidance on how to properly compute bonuses for adjacent tiles when building settlements or roads.
3. Suggest alternative approaches if direct resource value computation from `LandTile` is not viable.  

Ensure the information is actionable and tailored for correcting the heuristic scoring computations.================================ Human Message =================================

RESEARCH:

### Investigating Attributes and Methods of the `LandTile` Class
The `LandTile` class and associated structures define the core elements of gameplay tiles in the Catanatron framework. Here's a breakdown of the relevant components:

---

### **1. Valid Attributes of `LandTile`**
The `LandTile` class provides the following attributes:
- **`id`**: A unique identifier for the land tile.
- **`resource`**: The resource type for the tile (e.g., `WOOD`, `BRICK`, `WHEAT`, `SHEEP`, `ORE`, or `None` for desert tiles).
- **`number`**: The number associated with the tile (dice roll probability value). `None` indicates desert tiles.
- **`nodes`**: A dictionary where the keys are `NodeRef` values (relative positions like `NORTH`, `SOUTH`) and the values are `node_id`s.
- **`edges`**: A dictionary mapping `EdgeRef` (edge directions) to edge IDs.

Example usage:
```python
tile_id = land_tile.id
tile_resource = land_tile.resource  # e.g., WOOD
tile_number = land_tile.number  # e.g., 8 for a high-probability tile
tile_nodes = list(land_tile.nodes.values())  # Get the node IDs
tile_edges = list(land_tile.edges.values())  # Get associated edges
```

---

### **2. Calculating Bonuses or Context from Adjacent Tiles**
To compute heuristic bonuses from adjacent tiles when assigning strategic values for settlements or roads:

#### 2.1 Accessing Adjacent Tiles
The `CatanMap` object maintains an auxiliary structure for adjacent tiles:
- **`CatanMap.adjacent_tiles`**: Maps `node_id` to a list of `LandTile` objects surrounding that node.
  ```python
  adjacent_tiles = game.state.board.adjacent_tiles[node_id]
  for tile in adjacent_tiles:
      resource = tile.resource
      probability = tile.number_probability(tile.number)
      print(f"Adjacent tile {tile.id}: Resource={resource}, Probability={probability}")
  ```

#### 2.2 Computing Resource Production
You can estimate the cumulative production at a node based on resource probabilities of adjacent tiles:
- **`CatanMap.node_production`**: Maps `node_id` to a `Counter` of resource probabilities.
  ```python
  resource_production = game.state.board.node_production[node_id]
  # Example format: Counter({WOOD: 0.25, BRICK: 0.12})
  ```

---

### **3. Alternative Approaches if Direct Resource Value is Not Possible**
When direct computation is unavailable, use a combination of these methods:
- **Resource Contributions from Tiles**: Use `CatanMap.adjacent_tiles` and `LandTile.resource` or `LandTile.number`.
  ```python
  adjacent_tiles = game.state.board.adjacent_tiles[node_id]
  resource_values = [tile.resource for tile in adjacent_tiles if tile.resource]
  ```

- **Dice Roll Probability**: Use `number_probability()` on a tile’s `number`.
  ```python
  from catanatron.models.map import number_probability
  dice_probability = number_probability(tile.number)  # Roll chance for the tile
  ```

- **Ports and Trading Context**: If ports matter (e.g., for heuristic value), access via:
  ```python
  ports = game.state.board.port_nodes  # Get port mappings
  ```

---

### **Actionable Guidance for Heuristic Scoring**
To integrate this into the heuristic computation:
1. Replace `tile.value` in `_compute_heuristic_scores` with access to `tile.resource` or `tile.number`.
   ```python
   resource = tile.resource  # WOOD, BRICK, etc.
   probability = number_probability(tile.number)  # Dice probability
   ```
2. For adjacent tile context at `node_id`, query `game.state.board.adjacent_tiles`.
   ```python
   adjacent_tiles = game.state.board.adjacent_tiles[node_id]
   for tile in adjacent_tiles:
       if tile.resource is not None:
           resource_value = tile.resource
           probability = number_probability(tile.number)
   ```

END RESEARCH.================================== Ai Message ==================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Ensure stable heuristic scoring for FooPlayer by correctly accessing valid attributes of `LandTile` and utilizing game state methods (e.g., `adjacent_tiles`) to compute bonuses for settlements and roads. Refine gameplay to support functional testing over the next 5 iterations.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Replace the incorrect reference to `tile.value` in heuristic scoring with valid queries to `tile.resource`, `tile.number`, and `number_probability()` to calculate bonuses for adjacent tiles when evaluating settlement actions.

CHOSEN AGENT: CODER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:
Refactor `foo_player.py` to fix the error and improve scoring calculations:

1. **Correct Tile Context Retrieval**:
   - Replace all calls to `tile.value` with queries to valid attributes of `LandTile`, such as `tile.resource` for resource type or `tile.number` for dice roll probability.
   - Use `game.state.board.adjacent_tiles[node_id]` to get tiles surrounding the node at which a settlement or city is to be built.
   - Example adjustment:
     ```python
     adjacent_tiles = game.state.board.adjacent_tiles[action.value]
     resource_bonus = sum(number_probability(tile.number) for tile in adjacent_tiles if tile.resource is not None)
     heuristic_scores[action] += resource_bonus
     ```

2. **Enhance Settlement Scoring**:
   - Calculate settlement scores dynamically based on cumulative resource probabilities from adjacent tiles (using `number_probability()` and `tile.resource`).
   - Adjust `_compute_heuristic_scores` to include valid resource bonuses:
     ```python
     for action in playable_actions:
         if action.action_type == ActionType.BUILD_SETTLEMENT:
             adjacent_tiles = game.state.board.adjacent_tiles[action.value]
             resource_bonus = sum(number_probability(tile.number) for tile in adjacent_tiles if tile.resource is not None)
             heuristic_scores[action] = 10 + resource_bonus
     ```

3. **Validate Heuristic Scoring**:
   - Ensure all logic runs smoothly, avoiding invalid calls or attributes.
   - Add debug print statements to log computed bonuses during gameplay.

Once implemented, test FooPlayer for functionality and measure changes in heuristic-driven decision-making across multiple iterations.================================ Human Message =================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Improve the performance of the `FooPlayer.py` by introducing intelligent strategy logic that leverages the LLM for decision-making. Specifically, aim for a minimum win count of 1 within the next 5 iterations while improving VP, settlements, and measurable gameplay metrics.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Address the issue of the `decide` method defaulting to selecting the first action. Integrate the LLM's `query_llm` functionality to intelligently evaluate actions based on state and strategy.

CHOSEN AGENT: CODER

AGENT OBJECTIVE: 
The current implementation of `FooPlayer` is defaulting to selecting the first action, as evidenced by the repeated log message "Choosing First Action on Default." Modify the `decide` method to leverage the `self.llm.query_llm` functionality for decision-making. Specifically:

1. Replace the current first-action default with an implementation that:
   a. Obtains a list of possible actions from the game state.
   b. Queries the LLM (`self.llm.query_llm`) for the evaluation of these actions.
   c. Selects the most intelligent action based on the LLM's evaluation.

2. Ensure the decision logic is robust and includes handling scenarios such as:
   - No valid actions available.
   - LLM providing ambiguous or conflicting guidance (fallback mechanisms).

3. Include clear comments and logging to observe how the LLM is influencing decision-making.

Once done, provide the modified code to be tested.================================== Ai Message ==================================

CODER

### Changes Made:
1. **Replaced Default Action Selection**:
   - Removed the hardcoded `return playable_actions[0]` that selected the first action by default.

2. **Integrated LLM Decision-Making in `decide`**:
   - Constructed a comprehensive prompt using the `_build_prompt` function to provide the LLM with game state and available actions.
   - Queried the LLM using `self.llm.query_llm(prompt)`.
   - Parsed the LLM's response using the `_parse_llm_response` function to select the most appropriate action from the available options.

3. **Added New Helper Methods**:
   - `_build_prompt`: Constructs a prompt by including the current game state and the list of playable actions.
   - `_parse_llm_response`: Interprets the LLM's response to match it with one of the playable actions. If no match is found, defaults to the first action.

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Included error handling for cases where the LLM query fails or returns an ambiguous response. In such cases, the method defaults to selecting the first action.
   - Added logging to show the LLM's response (`print(f"LLM Response: {llm_response}")`) and fallback mechanisms.

5. **Logging and Debugging**:
   - Added print statements for better debugging and observation:
     - Log when no playable actions are available.
     - Log the LLM's raw response.
     - Log if the response is ambiguous or invalid, and the fallback action is selected.

### Notes for the Next Iteration:
- **Prompt Details**: The current `_build_prompt` function makes a basic serialization of the game state and actions. If the LLM struggles to prioritize or understand the game details, refining this prompt may be necessary.
- **LLM Error Responses**: If runtime timing issues with `query_llm` arise (e.g., long delays or failures), adjustment of query limits or timeouts may be needed.

### Testing Recommendations:
- Test how the LLM chooses actions in various scenarios to verify that the parsing logic aligns with actual gameplay.
- Monitor logs (`LLM Response: ...`) for unexpected behaviors or ambiguous responses.

END CODER================================ Human Message =================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Transition FooPlayer into a competitive player over the next 5 iterations by leveraging enhanced strategy, including heuristic reinforcement, refined LLM prompts, and deterministic fallback mechanisms, and targeting measurable improvements in average VP and win rates.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Implement **segmented contextual prompting** and heuristic-enhanced decision-making into the LLM integration (as per Strategy 1 and 4). Additionally, integrate a **ranked action hierarchy** as a fallback mechanism (Strategy 2).

CHOSEN AGENT: CODER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:  
Modify the `decide` method of `FooPlayer.py` to achieve the following:

1. **Refined LLM Prompt**: 
   - Update the `_build_prompt` function to use **segmented contextual prompting**. Include headers that describe the game state, available resources, and strategic goals. Example structure:
     ```
     Current Game State:
     - Player Stats: {resources}, {settlements}, {cities}, VP: {victory_points}
     - Opponent Stats: {opponent resources/blockades}, etc.
     Goal: Maximize VP while taking advantage of the current game state.
     Available Actions: {list of formatted playable actions}
     Respond with:
     Action: {Selected optimal action}
     Justification: {Reasoning behind the action choice}
     ```

2. **Heuristic Context Integration**:
   - In the `_build_prompt` method, compute heuristic scores (e.g., settlement value, city upgrade value, road extension value) for each action. Integrate these scores into the prompt to help the LLM make better decisions.

3. **Fallback Mechanism**:
   - Enhance `_parse_llm_response` to implement a **ranked action hierarchy** fallback mechanism when the LLM output is invalid or ambiguous. Example hierarchy:
     - Priority Order: Build City > Build Settlement > Build Road > End Turn.
     - If a valid option matching the LLM response is not found, return the first valid action in this priority order.

4. **Logging**:
   - Improve logging to capture the heuristic scores, the LLM prompt, its raw response, and the fallback decision (when necessary) for post-game analysis.

Once complete, test the updated `FooPlayer.py`, run games, and report the results.================================== Ai Message ==================================

CODER

### Changes Made:
1. **Refined LLM Prompt Construction**:
   - Enhanced the `_build_prompt` function to use **segmented contextual prompting** with detailed headers for game state, player stats, opponent stats, and available actions.
   - Integrated **heuristic scores** for each action into the prompt to guide the LLM decision-making.

2. **Heuristic Computation Method**:
   - Added a `_compute_heuristic_scores` helper method to assign heuristic values to each action based on action type (e.g., city-building prioritized over road-building).

3. **Improved Parsing Logic**:
   - Enhanced `_parse_llm_response` to return a matching action from the LLM response, or delegate to the fallback mechanism if no match is found.

4. **Ranked Fallback Mechanism**:
   - Implemented `_fallback_action` to evaluate actions in a priority order: Build City > Build Settlement > Build Road > End Turn.
   - Default to the first action only when no prioritized options exist.

5. **Logging**:
   - Added print statements throughout to capture key debugging information:
     - The LLM prompt.
     - Heuristic scores of actions.
     - The LLM's raw response.
     - Logs for fallback mechanism use.

6. **Error Handling Enhancements**:
   - Integrated robust exception handling in the `decide` method for LLM failures, with clear logging of fallbacks.

### Notes for the Next Iteration:
- Tune the **heuristic scores** if the LLM's decisions align poorly with optimal strategies.
- Monitor how well the LLM responds to the enhanced prompt structure during testing.
- Evaluate the fallback mechanism's efficiency in comparison to the LLM's responses.

### Testing Recommendations:
- Focus on scenarios requiring diverse strategic goals (e.g., blocking opponent moves, building towards Largest Army).
- Analyze logs for patterns in ambiguous or ineffective LLM responses, and refine prompts or fallback heuristics accordingly.

END CODER================================ Human Message =================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Ensure functionality and compatibility of FooPlayer with the Catanatron API while strengthening the LLM decision-making mechanism in a way that improves strategic performance over the next 5 iterations.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Integrate valid Catanatron API calls into `foo_player.py`'s `_build_prompt` method to fetch relevant game data like resources, settlements, cities, roads, and victory points, and resolve the current `AttributeError` preventing gameplay.

CHOSEN AGENT: CODER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:  
Resolve the `AttributeError` by replacing invalid calls in `foo_player.py` with Catanatron-compatible API calls as outlined in the research:

1. **Resources**:
   - Replace `game.get_player_resources(Color.BLUE)` with `get_player_freqdeck(state, Color.BLUE)` to fetch all resources for FooPlayer.
   - Use `player_num_resource_cards(state, Color.BLUE, resource)` to query specific resource counts.

2. **Settlements and Cities**:
   - Replace invalid calls for settlements/cities with:
     ```python
     get_player_buildings(state, Color.BLUE, "SETTLEMENT")
     get_player_buildings(state, Color.BLUE, "CITY")
     ```

3. **Victory Points and Roads**:
   - Retrieve victory points using:
     ```python
     vp = state.player_state[player_key(state, Color.BLUE) + "_ACTUAL_VICTORY_POINTS"]
     ```
   - Roads remaining:
     ```python
     roads_available = state.player_state[player_key(state, Color.BLUE) + "_ROADS_AVAILABLE"]
     ```

4. **General Updates to `_build_prompt`**:
   - Adjust the prompt to include all valid game stats, ensuring Catanatron API calls function.
   - Include resource counts, settlements, cities, roads, and VP in the formatted prompt structure.

5. **Debugging and Validation**:
   - Add logging to verify data retrieval accuracy during gameplay for resources, actions, and VP.
   - Run a test evolution to confirm the absence of runtime errors.

Update the code to reflect these changes and provide detailed debug logs during testing for validation.================================== Ai Message ==================================

CODER

### Changes Made:
1. **Replaced Invalid API Calls**:
   - Substituted `game.get_player_resources(Color.BLUE)` with `get_player_freqdeck(state, Color.BLUE)` to correctly fetch resources.
   - Similar replacements made for settlements, cities, victory points, and roads using valid Catanatron API functions: 
     - `get_player_buildings(state, Color.BLUE, "SETTLEMENT")` and `get_player_buildings(state, Color.BLUE, "CITY")` for settlements and cities.
     - Victory points accessed via `state.player_state[f"{player_key(state, Color.BLUE)}_ACTUAL_VICTORY_POINTS"]`.
     - Roads available via `state.player_state[f"{player_key(state, Color.BLUE)}_ROADS_AVAILABLE"]`.

2. **Updated `_build_prompt` Method**:
   - Included new resource and state-fetching methods in the prompt template.
   - Enhanced formatting to make the prompt explainable and consistent with the desired LLM input structure.

3. **Improved Compatibility**:
   - Refactored the game state integration in `_build_prompt` to align with valid methods reliably compatible with the API.

4. **Debugging Enhancements**:
   - Added detailed logging via print statements to verify accurate state data retrieval during gameplay (resources, settlements, cities, heuristic scores).
   - Included error handling for invalid or mismatched LLM responses.

### Notes for the Next Iteration:
- Test how well the new prompt structure works with the LLM's decision-making.
- Monitor logs for resource/state-fetch accuracy and potential mismatches between heuristic scores and LLM responses.

### Testing Recommendations:
- Verify that resources, settlements, cities, and other player stats from the state align with the game's current state through debugging outputs.
- Check if the fallback mechanism handles invalid or ambiguous LLM responses efficiently.

END CODER================================ Human Message =================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Implement a strategy that improves both early and late-game decision-making for FooPlayer through advanced heuristics, adjusted fallback mechanisms, and refined LLM prompts, achieving measurable improvements in metrics such as roads, settlements, and victory points.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Integrate enhanced heuristic scoring and dynamic fallback priorities into the decision flow while refining LLM responses for strategic action selection, focusing on VP growth and efficient resource use.

CHOSEN AGENT: CODER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:  
Modify FooPlayer to implement the strategies outlined in the five key areas. Specifically:

1. **Enhance Heuristic Scoring**:
   - Add multipliers for actions directly contributing to Victory Points, such as settlement building and city upgrading.
   - Dynamically adjust scores based on the game stage (early vs. late-game priorities), prioritizing roads and settlements early while focusing on VP-heavy actions late.

2. **Dynamic Fallback Mechanism**:
   - Revise the fallback mechanism to focus on early-game expansion via roads and settlements as placeholders for resource diversity and VP accumulation.
   - Later transition fallback logic to VP-centric actions like city upgrades and development cards.

3. **Refined LLM Prompt**:
   - Update the LLM prompt to emphasize VP growth explicitly.
   - Demand justification for actions based on Victory Points and strategic blocking of opponents.

4. **Resource Threshold Balancing**:
   - Introduce logic for maintaining resource reserves and diversifying investments based on available actions.
   - Trigger placeholder actions like road-building when strategic objectives are temporarily unattainable.

5. **Action Bottleneck Detection**:
   - Implement tracking logic for repetitive unproductive actions (e.g., repeated "END TURN").
   - Adjust decision scoring to discourage stagnation, forcing resource spending or defensive actions when necessary.

Make necessary modifications to the `decide` method and auxiliary functions like `_build_prompt` and `heuristic_scores`. Run a test iteration post-implementation to ensure that the changes positively impact FooPlayer performance.

Let me know when you're ready to test the updated player!================================ Human Message =================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Over the next 5 iterations, implement and refine a system that better aligns FooPlayer's heuristic evaluation, LLM prompt design, and fallback mechanisms towards impactful, VP-driven actions. Aim for measurable improvements in foundational metrics like roads, settlements, and cities.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Recalibrate FooPlayer's heuristic scoring system to implement stage-specific priorities and dynamically address bottlenecks, ensuring better alignment between heuristic-driven actions and LLM output. Update the LLM prompt design to explicitly focus on VP growth and reduce low-value decision patterns.

CHOSEN AGENT: CODER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:  
Update `foo_player.py` as follows:

1. **Enhanced Heuristic Scoring**: 
    - Modify `_compute_heuristic_scores` to include stage-specific priorities:
      - Early-game boosts for roads and settlements.
      - Late-game emphasis on cities and development cards.
    - Include dynamic bottle-neck handling, e.g.:
      - Reward actions that address resource buildup or stagnation.
      - Encourage actions that disrupt opponents (e.g., blocking roads/settlements).
    - Use tile values (6, 8, etc.) to boost settlement scores for strategic intersections.

2. **Refined LLM Prompt**:
    - Update `_build_prompt` with stronger emphasis on guiding actions toward VP and strategic goals:
      - Enumerate priorities explicitly: building roads, settlements, cities.
      - Include heuristic scores in the prompt with descriptions of why actions are valuable.
      - Penalize repetitive actions like "END TURN" through explicit discouragement in the prompt.

3. **Fallback Mechanism Adjustment**:
    - Introduce deterministic templates for stage-specific fallback actions:
      - Early-game: Prioritize roads and settlements for expansion.
      - Late-game: Focus on cities and VP-centric actions.
    - Dynamically adapt fallback decisions based on resource surplus or game state bottlenecks.
    ```python
    if player_resources["brick"] >= 3 and player_resources["wood"] >= 3:
        heuristic_scores[ActionType.BUILD_ROAD] += 5
    ```

4. **Action Bottleneck Detection**:
    - Add detection for repetitive or stagnating actions (e.g., unspent resources or repeated "END TURN").
    - Penalize stagnation by prioritizing resource expenditure and spatial expansion.

Upon completing the updates, test the revised player for functional improvements in decision-making, focusing on roads, settlements, and overall strategic progression.================================== Ai Message ==================================

CODER

### Updates to `foo_player.py`:
1. **Enhanced Heuristic Scoring**:
   - Integrated stage-specific priorities (e.g., roads and settlements emphasized early-game, cities in mid-late game).
   - Added bonuses for high-resource tiles in settlement actions.
   - Introduced penalties to address resource bottlenecks (e.g., surplus brick/wood triggers road-building incentives).
   - Incorporated logic to dynamically adjust scores based on resource availability and VP contributions.

2. **Refined LLM Prompt**:
   - Redesigned `_build_prompt` to better guide the LLM:
     - Explicit priorities for strategic actions based on Victory Point (VP) growth.
     - Highlighted roadmap for early-game road/settlement building and late-game upgrades.
     - Discouraged repetitive or non-impactful actions like unnecessary turns.
   - Included heuristic scores in the prompt, with explanations for why certain actions are prioritized.

3. **Dynamic Fallback Mechanism**:
   - Structured fallback logic to prioritize actions based on game state:
     - Early-game: Roads and settlements.
     - Late-game: Cities and VP-centric actions.
   - Updated fallback mechanism to prevent stagnation by using deterministic templates blended with heuristic-driven conditions.

4. **Bottleneck and Surplus Resource Handling**:
   - Added logic to detect and dynamically handle situations where surplus resources exist (e.g., incentivizing road-building on excess brick/wood).
   - Increased priority for settlement or city building to resolve resource stagnation.

5. **Improved Logs**:
   - Added meaningful print statements across key decision-making steps to facilitate debugging:
     - Fallback actions.
     - Detected bottlenecks or resource imbalances.
     - LLM responses (and when fallback mechanisms are triggered).

### Testing Suggestions:
- **Evaluate Decision Quality**:
  - Test early-game actions for expansion focus (roads and settlements).
  - Verify mid-to-late game actions prioritize cities and VP-centric plays.
- **Monitor Bottleneck Response**:
  - Simulate resource-rich scenarios to observe if surplus resources are properly spent.
- **Validate Fallback Logic**:
  - Conduct games where the LLM fails or incorrectly parses the prompt to assess fallback success.
- **Track Metrics**:
  - Compare average VP, settlements, and city counts across multiple iterations to previous versions.

### Next Steps:
- Refine heuristic weights after testing to balance strategic trade-offs.
- Incorporate feedback cycles to analyze and further tune prompt alignment with heuristic evaluations.
- Observe repetitive "END TURN" penalties and ensure they improve game progression.

END CODER================================ Human Message =================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Ensure compatibility with the Catanatron API by appropriately integrating valid attributes of the `Action` class and utilizing game state data to enhance decision-making. Achieve stable functionality for testing strategic performance over the next 5 iterations.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Correct the `AttributeError` by refactoring `foo_player.py` to rely on valid `Action.value` attributes or query relevant context from the `State` class for heuristic scoring. Ensure all references to `location` are replaced with valid methods to retrieve positional or resource data.

CHOSEN AGENT: CODER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:
Refactor `foo_player.py` to address the syntax error and improve heuristic scoring:

1. **Fix Invalid References**:
   - Replace all calls to the nonexistent `action.location` with queries to `Action.value` or `State` methods.
   - Example adjustments:
     ```python
     if action.action_type == ActionType.BUILD_SETTLEMENT and len(state.board.map.adjacent_tiles[action.value]) > threshold:
         heuristic_scores[action] += 3
     ```
     Here, `action.value` provides the node ID where the settlement would be built.

2. **Context Retrieval from State**:
   - For actions like `BUILD_SETTLEMENT` or `BUILD_CITY`, retrieve adjacent tiles and their resource values using `state.board.map.adjacent_tiles[action.value]`.
   - For roads, use `Action.value` to access edge information and query connected tiles.

3. **Heuristic Scoring Enhancements**:
   - Incorporate valid context details from the state or action attributes to refine heuristic scoring:
     - High-value tiles should boost settlement scores:
       ```python
       adjacent_resources = [tile.resource for tile in state.board.map.adjacent_tiles[action.value] if tile.resource is not None]
       resource_bonus = sum(tile.value for resource in adjacent_resources)
       heuristic_scores[action] += resource_bonus
       ```

4. **Debugging and Validation**:
   - Ensure all invalid references are replaced with valid calls.
   - Add debug print statements to verify successful access to `Action.value` or state functions during gameplay.

Once refactoring is complete, test FooPlayer to confirm it runs without errors and demonstrate functional heuristic scoring improvements.================================== Ai Message ==================================

### Summary of Changes:
1. **Fixed `AttributeError`**:
   - Replaced invalid references to `action.location` with valid attribute and context retrieval using `action.value` and game state methods (e.g., accessing `state.board.map.adjacent_tiles` for settlement scoring).

2. **Improved Settlement Scoring**:
   - Enhanced `_compute_heuristic_scores` to calculate bonuses for settlements based on adjacent tiles' resource values using `state.board.map.adjacent_tiles[action.value]`.

3. **Resource Bottleneck Handling**:
   - Retained logic for surplus brick/wood to incentivize road-building.

4. **Improved Debugging**:
   - Added specific print statements during fallback and heuristic computation to verify logic.

5. **Dynamic Heuristic Refinements**:
   - Settlement scoring dynamically adjusts based on adjacent tile values, improving action prioritization.

AttributeError: 'LandTile' object has no attribute 'value'================================ Human Message =================================

After Running The New foo_player.py Player, Here is my analysis and findings:

### Syntax Error Details:
- **Error Message**: `AttributeError: 'LandTile' object has no attribute 'value'`
- **Exact Line Number**: Line 92 in `foo_player.py`
- **Exact Line of Code**: `tile.value for tile in adjacent_tiles if tile.resource is not None`

### Root Cause:
The `LandTile` class does not have a `value` attribute as assumed in `_compute_heuristic_scores`. This error occurs when attempting to calculate resource bonuses for building settlements based on adjacent tiles.

### Impact:
The syntax error prevents the game from running, resulting in no recorded game results or player performance data for this evolution.

Let me know if you need anything else!================================== Ai Message ==================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Ensure compatibility with the Catanatron API and eliminate syntax errors by properly accessing attributes of the `LandTile` class and adjacent tiles during heuristic scoring. Stabilize gameplay for functional testing and iterative improvements in performance metrics.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Correct the error by replacing the incorrect reference to `tile.value` with valid calls to extract resource-related attributes or other properties from the `LandTile` class. Fully debug and ensure the heuristic scoring function runs smoothly without errors.

CHOSEN AGENT: RESEARCHER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:  
Investigate the `LandTile` class and its valid attributes. Specifically:
1. Identify what attributes or methods the `LandTile` class provides for retrieving resource-type or strategic value data.
2. Provide guidance on how to properly compute bonuses for adjacent tiles when building settlements or roads.
3. Suggest alternative approaches if direct resource value computation from `LandTile` is not viable.  

Ensure the information is actionable and tailored for correcting the heuristic scoring computations.================================ Human Message =================================

RESEARCH:

### Investigating Attributes and Methods of the `LandTile` Class
The `LandTile` class and associated structures define the core elements of gameplay tiles in the Catanatron framework. Here's a breakdown of the relevant components:

---

### **1. Valid Attributes of `LandTile`**
The `LandTile` class provides the following attributes:
- **`id`**: A unique identifier for the land tile.
- **`resource`**: The resource type for the tile (e.g., `WOOD`, `BRICK`, `WHEAT`, `SHEEP`, `ORE`, or `None` for desert tiles).
- **`number`**: The number associated with the tile (dice roll probability value). `None` indicates desert tiles.
- **`nodes`**: A dictionary where the keys are `NodeRef` values (relative positions like `NORTH`, `SOUTH`) and the values are `node_id`s.
- **`edges`**: A dictionary mapping `EdgeRef` (edge directions) to edge IDs.

Example usage:
```python
tile_id = land_tile.id
tile_resource = land_tile.resource  # e.g., WOOD
tile_number = land_tile.number  # e.g., 8 for a high-probability tile
tile_nodes = list(land_tile.nodes.values())  # Get the node IDs
tile_edges = list(land_tile.edges.values())  # Get associated edges
```

---

### **2. Calculating Bonuses or Context from Adjacent Tiles**
To compute heuristic bonuses from adjacent tiles when assigning strategic values for settlements or roads:

#### 2.1 Accessing Adjacent Tiles
The `CatanMap` object maintains an auxiliary structure for adjacent tiles:
- **`CatanMap.adjacent_tiles`**: Maps `node_id` to a list of `LandTile` objects surrounding that node.
  ```python
  adjacent_tiles = game.state.board.adjacent_tiles[node_id]
  for tile in adjacent_tiles:
      resource = tile.resource
      probability = tile.number_probability(tile.number)
      print(f"Adjacent tile {tile.id}: Resource={resource}, Probability={probability}")
  ```

#### 2.2 Computing Resource Production
You can estimate the cumulative production at a node based on resource probabilities of adjacent tiles:
- **`CatanMap.node_production`**: Maps `node_id` to a `Counter` of resource probabilities.
  ```python
  resource_production = game.state.board.node_production[node_id]
  # Example format: Counter({WOOD: 0.25, BRICK: 0.12})
  ```

---

### **3. Alternative Approaches if Direct Resource Value is Not Possible**
When direct computation is unavailable, use a combination of these methods:
- **Resource Contributions from Tiles**: Use `CatanMap.adjacent_tiles` and `LandTile.resource` or `LandTile.number`.
  ```python
  adjacent_tiles = game.state.board.adjacent_tiles[node_id]
  resource_values = [tile.resource for tile in adjacent_tiles if tile.resource]
  ```

- **Dice Roll Probability**: Use `number_probability()` on a tile’s `number`.
  ```python
  from catanatron.models.map import number_probability
  dice_probability = number_probability(tile.number)  # Roll chance for the tile
  ```

- **Ports and Trading Context**: If ports matter (e.g., for heuristic value), access via:
  ```python
  ports = game.state.board.port_nodes  # Get port mappings
  ```

---

### **Actionable Guidance for Heuristic Scoring**
To integrate this into the heuristic computation:
1. Replace `tile.value` in `_compute_heuristic_scores` with access to `tile.resource` or `tile.number`.
   ```python
   resource = tile.resource  # WOOD, BRICK, etc.
   probability = number_probability(tile.number)  # Dice probability
   ```
2. For adjacent tile context at `node_id`, query `game.state.board.adjacent_tiles`.
   ```python

END RESEARCH.================================== Ai Message ==================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Ensure stable heuristic scoring for FooPlayer by correctly accessing valid attributes of `LandTile` and utilizing game state methods (e.g., `adjacent_tiles`) to compute bonuses for settlements and roads. Refine gameplay to support functional testing over the next 5 iterations.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Replace the incorrect reference to `tile.value` in heuristic scoring with valid queries to `tile.resource`, `tile.number`, and `number_probability()` to calculate bonuses for adjacent tiles when evaluating settlement actions.

CHOSEN AGENT: CODER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:
Refactor `foo_player.py` to fix the error and improve scoring calculations:

1. **Correct Tile Context Retrieval**:
   - Replace all calls to `tile.value` with queries to valid attributes of `LandTile`, such as `tile.resource` for resource type or `tile.number` for dice roll probability.
   - Use `game.state.board.adjacent_tiles[node_id]` to get tiles surrounding the node at which a settlement or city is to be built.
   - Example adjustment:
     ```python
     adjacent_tiles = game.state.board.adjacent_tiles[action.value]
     resource_bonus = sum(number_probability(tile.number) for tile in adjacent_tiles if tile.resource is not None)
     heuristic_scores[action] += resource_bonus
     ```

2. **Enhance Settlement Scoring**:
   - Calculate settlement scores dynamically based on cumulative resource probabilities from adjacent tiles (using `number_probability()` and `tile.resource`).
   - Adjust `_compute_heuristic_scores` to include valid resource bonuses:
     ```python
     for action in playable_actions:
         if action.action_type == ActionType.BUILD_SETTLEMENT:
             adjacent_tiles = game.state.board.adjacent_tiles[action.value]
             resource_bonus = sum(number_probability(tile.number) for tile in adjacent_tiles if tile.resource is not None)
             heuristic_scores[action] = 10 + resource_bonus
     ```

3. **Validate Heuristic Scoring**:
   - Ensure all logic runs smoothly, avoiding invalid calls or attributes.
   - Add debug print statements to log computed bonuses during gameplay.

Once implemented, test FooPlayer for functionality and measure changes in heuristic-driven decision-making across multiple iterations.================================ Human Message =================================

CODER

### Changes Made:
1. **Resolved `AttributeError`**:
   - Replaced previous invalid references to `tile.value` with `number_probability(tile.number)` from the `LandTile` class to compute bonuses based on tile probabilities.

2. **Updated Heuristic Scoring Logic**:
   - Settlement bonuses now dynamically evaluate adjacent tiles using `state.board.adjacent_tiles[action.value]`.
   - Bonuses are calculated based on valid attributes (`tile.resource` and `tile.number`) using `number_probability()`.

3. **Improved Resource Bottleneck Handling**:
   - Retained logic to incentivize road-building when brick and wood resources are in surplus.

4. **Debug Enhancements**:
   - Added clear print statements to log heuristic scores and fallback decisions.

### Notes for Testing:
- Confirm stability and functionality of the game simulation without syntax errors.
- Test heuristic scoring improvements, observing early-game settlement expansion and resource optimization.
- Validate fallback mechanism functionality when a valid LLM response is not received.

After Running The New foo_player.py Player, Here is my analysis and findings:

### Scores of FooPlayer:
- Wins: 0
- Average Victory Points (VP): 2.0
- Average Settlements: 2.0
- Average Cities: 0.0
- Average Roads: 0.0
- Average Largest Army: 0.0
- Average Development VP: 0.0

### Short Analysis of Game Output:
- The phrase "Choosing First Action on Default" repeated throughout the log suggests that the implementation is defaulting to selecting the first action without strategy. 
- Results indicate poor performance compared to the opponent, with no victories achieved in the 3-game session. 

### Errors, Warnings, or Signs of Implementation Issues:
- **Implementation Warning**: The log shows "Choosing First Action on Default" continuously, indicating that the `decide` method is not leveraging the LLM integration (`self.llm.query_llm`) for decision-making.
- **Gameplay Warning**: The score disparity (2 VP versus 10 VP for the opponent) and the lack of progression in Cities, Roads, and Largest Army metrics highlight a lack of strategy execution.

- Average Settlements: 2.33  
- Average Cities: 0.33  
- Average Roads: 0.0  
- Average Largest Army: 0.0  
- Average Development VP: 0.33  

### Short Analysis of Game Output:
- The LLM consistently failed to provide valid or actionable responses: "LLM response ambiguous or invalid. Defaulting to first action."
- FooPlayer defaulted to the first available action in all scenarios instead of executing strategic decisions.
- The performance difference is stark: FooPlayer had no wins and significantly lower VP compared to AlphaBetaPlayer.

### Errors, Warnings, or Signs of Implementation Issues:
- **LLM Integration Issue**: LLM responses are not being parsed correctly or are poorly generated, leading to fallback actions ("Defaulting to first action").
- **Decision-Making Deficiency**: The lack of strategic outcomes (e.g., 0 roads, 0 Largest Army) suggests serious shortcomings in action planning and execution.
- **Repeated Logs**: Multiple instances of ambiguous LLM responses point to insufficient prompt design or response parsing mechanism in `_parse_llm_response`.

After Running The New foo_player.py Player, Here is my analysis and findings:

### Syntax Error Details:
- **Error Message**: `AttributeError: 'Game' object has no attribute 'get_player_resources'`
- **Exact Line Number**: Line 84 in `foo_player.py`
- **Exact Line of Code**: `resources=str(game.get_player_resources(Color.BLUE)),  # Example method to get resources`

### Root Cause:
The method `get_player_resources` is being called on the `Game` object, but it does not exist in the `Game` class, leading to an `AttributeError`. This indicates a mismatch between the game's API and the implementation in `foo_player.py`.

### Impact:
The syntax error prevents the game from running, and thus no game results were recorded for this evolution.

### Short Analysis of Game Output:
- **LLM Interaction**: The LLM responded consistently, but gameplay justification often involved executing mandatory or default actions (e.g., "ROLL" and "END TURN"), suggesting limited strategic depth.
- **Interesting Output**: The heuristic scoring mechanism categorizes actions clearly, but no significant changes to gameplay performance reflect deeper strategy execution.
- **Signs of Issue**: No roads or army development indicates repeated failure to invest strategically in growth areas, despite consistent heuristic scoring.

### Errors, Warnings, or Signs of Implementation Issues:
- **Strategic Weakness**: The absence of victories and poor metrics like roads and army raises concerns about the decision-making quality. 
- **Heuristic Misalignment**: High heuristic scores for actions like "BUILD_ROAD" occasionally appear in the logs but fail to translate into meaningful gameplay progression.

### Scores of FooPlayer:
- Wins: 0  
- Average Victory Points (VP): 2.6666666666666665  
- Average Settlements: 1.3333333333333333  
- Average Cities: 0.6666666666666666  
- Average Roads: 0.0  
- Average Largest Army: 0.0  
- Average Development VP: 0.0  

### Short Analysis of Game Output:
- **Repetitive Logs**: Multiple instances of LLM responses defaulting to basic actions such as "ROLL" and "END TURN," with justifications suggesting limited strategic depth. Example: "Rolling is necessary to progress the game state."
- **Neutral Heuristic Scoring**: Actions often evaluated with a low heuristic score (`1`). This indicates the heuristic system fails to differentiate between strategic actions.
- **Misalignment**: High-priority actions like "BUILD_CITY" or "BUILD_SETTLEMENT" seem underutilized, despite occasional high heuristic scores visible in logs. 

### Errors, Warnings, or Signs of Implementation Issues:
- **LLM Integration Weakness**: Responses imply poor decision quality by prioritizing roll/end-turn actions excessively. This indicates the prompt design and parsing mechanisms need refinement.
- **Strategic Gaps**: Failure to build roads or utilize army resources, even across multiple turns, suggests severe strategic deficiencies. The game log reinforces these gaps.
- **Warning**: Logs frequently state "Fallback mechanism applied," implying reliance on basic action prioritization rather than effective LLM outputs.

After Running The New foo_player.py Player, Here is my analysis and findings:

### Syntax Error Details:
- **Error Message**: `AttributeError: 'Action' object has no attribute 'location'`
- **Exact Line Number**: Line 90 in `foo_player.py`
- **Exact Line of Code**: `score = 8 + (3 if action.location.resource_value > 15 else 0)`

### Root Cause:
The `Action` class used in the code does not have an attribute `location`. This issue arises within the `_compute_heuristic_scores` method when attempting to access non-existent properties of the `Action` object.

### Impact:
This syntax error prevents the game from running, leading to no recorded results or scores for this evolution.

After Running The New foo_player.py Player, Here is my analysis and findings:

### Syntax Error Details:
- **Error Message**: `AttributeError: 'LandTile' object has no attribute 'value'`
- **Exact Line Number**: Line 92 in `foo_player.py`
- **Exact Line of Code**: `tile.value for tile in adjacent_tiles if tile.resource is not None`

### Root Cause:
The `LandTile` class does not have a `value` attribute as assumed in `_compute_heuristic_scores`. This error occurs when attempting to calculate resource bonuses for building settlements based on adjacent tiles.

### Impact:
The syntax error prevents the game from running, resulting in no recorded game results or player performance data for this evolution.

After Running The New foo_player.py Player, Here is my analysis and findings:

### Syntax Error Details:
- **Error Message**: `AttributeError: 'Board' object has no attribute 'adjacent_tiles'`
- **Exact Line Number**: Line 91 in `foo_player.py`
- **Exact Line of Code**: `adjacent_tiles = state.board.adjacent_tiles[action.value]`

### Root Cause:
The `Board` object in the provided game framework does not have an attribute or method named `adjacent_tiles`. The code attempts to calculate heuristic scores based on adjacent tiles, leading to this error.

### Impact:
The syntax error prevents the game simulation from running, and no game results or performance data were generated for this evolution.

### Short Analysis of Game Output:
- **Repetitive Logs**: Multiple instances of LLM responses defaulting to basic actions such as "ROLL" and "END TURN," with justifications suggesting limited strategic depth. Example: "Rolling is necessary to progress the game state."
- **Neutral Heuristic Scoring**: Actions often evaluated with a low heuristic score (`1`). This indicates the heuristic system fails to differentiate between strategic actions.
- **Misalignment**: High-priority actions like "BUILD_CITY" or "BUILD_SETTLEMENT" seem underutilized, despite occasional high heuristic scores visible in logs. 

### Errors, Warnings, or Signs of Implementation Issues:
- **LLM Integration Weakness**: Responses imply poor decision quality by prioritizing roll/end-turn actions excessively. This indicates the prompt design and parsing mechanisms need refinement.
- **Strategic Gaps**: Failure to build roads or utilize army resources, even across multiple turns, suggests severe strategic deficiencies. The game log reinforces these gaps.
- **Warning**: Logs frequently state "Fallback mechanism applied," implying reliance on basic action prioritization rather than effective LLM outputs.

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Improve FooPlayer’s strategic depth by refining heuristic accuracy, enhancing LLM prompts to advocate stronger strategic actions, and reducing reliance on the fallback mechanism. Focus on measurable improvements in roads, settlements, and cities over the next 5 iterations.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Address the strategic misalignment by:
1. Refactoring heuristics to better differentiate and prioritize optimal actions (e.g., building roads, settlements, and cities).
2. Revising the LLM prompt design to explicitly prioritize non-default, VP-centric, and impactful actions.
3. Adjusting the fallback mechanism to penalize repetitive default actions and ensure meaningful progression.

CHOSEN AGENT: STRATEGIZER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:  
Provide 5 specific refinements or new strategies to improve FooPlayer’s decision-making system, focusing on the following:
1. How to recalibrate heuristic scoring to strongly favor foundational growth actions like roads and settlements early on.
2. Techniques to adjust prompt design to directly steer the LLM away from repetitive or low-value default actions.
3. Criteria for dynamically detecting high-impact actions (strategic bottlenecks or game pivots) and encouraging the LLM or fallback decision to prioritize them.
4. Hybrid mechanisms blending determinate strategic templates for fallback actions alongside heuristic-driven flexibility.
5. Methods to evaluate and tune the heuristic scoring weights and LLM response handling over multiple evolutions, ensuring consistent improvement in strategic metrics.================================ Human Message =================================

STRATEGY:

### 1. Recalibrating Heuristic Scoring for Early Foundational Growth
Refine the heuristic scoring system to prioritize foundational growth actions, particularly during the early game:
- **Dynamic Weight Adjustments for Game Stages**:
  - **Early Game**:
    - Roads: Score 10 (high priority for expansion).
    - Settlements: Score 8 (emphasize resource diversity and availability).
    - Cities: Score 5 (lower priority due to resource scarcity early on).
  - **Mid to Late Game**:
    - Settlements: Score 10 (needed for reaching VP thresholds).
    - Cities: Score 15 (maximize VP by converting settlements to cities).
    - Roads: Score 7 (focus on Longest Road or movement towards strategic settlement spots).  
- **Tile Resource Heuristic**:
  - Assign weighted scores to actions based on resource tile priority:
    - High-Value Tiles: Prioritize intersections with tiles like 6, 8 (ore/wheat bonuses), increasing the heuristic scores of these actions.
    ```python
    if action.action_type == ActionType.BUILD_SETTLEMENT and action.location.resource_value > 15:
        heuristic_scores[action] += 3  # Boost for high-value tiles
    ```
- **Disruption Consideration**:
  - Actions that block opponent growth (road connections or settlements) receive a bonus.

---

### 2. Adjusting Prompt Design to Guide the LLM Towards High-Impact Actions
Update the LLM prompt construction to explicitly penalize repetitive or low-value actions and focus on strategic, VP-driving goals:
- **Segmented Descriptions with Action Prioritization**:
  ```
  You are tasked with making the most impactful move in the Catanatron Minigame. Always prioritize actions with long-term strategic benefits over short-term results. Avoid repetitive, low-impact actions like ending turns without building to progress.
  
  Current Priorities:
  1. Expand settlements and roads for resource variety and VP growth.
  2. Upgrade settlements to cities to maximize VP.
  3. Act to hinder opponents’ expansion when possible.
  
  Consider the following heuristic scores and game state in your decision:
  ```
  - Add structured fields for each action to explicitly indicate their heuristic weight, stage relevance, and potential impact:
    ```
    Action: {Action}
    Heuristic Score: {Score}
    Stage Priority: {Early/Mid/Late Game Relevance}
    Impact: {How this action will improve VP or hinder opponents}
    ```

---

### 3. Dynamic Detection of High-Impact Actions (Bottlenecks or Game Pivots)
Introduce dynamic logic to identify and prioritize high-impact actions during pivotal game moments:
- **Bottleneck Identification**:
  - Detect signs of resource stagnation or unspent resources (e.g., excessive ore/wheat without city upgrades or brick/wood without roads/settlements).
  ```python
  if player_resources['brick'] >= 3 and player_resources['wood'] >= 3:
      heuristic_scores[ActionType.BUILD_ROAD] += 5  # Encourage spending surplus
  ```
  - Time-based triggers: Penalize repeated "END TURN" or fallback actions and boost the use of active building moves.
- **Strategic Pivot Boosting**:
  - Add bonuses to actions when triggered by game-specific pivots:
    - Longest Road: Encourage roads when near the threshold for Longest Road.
    - Largest Army: Prioritize development card purchases when competing for Largest Army or sabotaging opponents.
    ```python
    if current_army_size >= 2 and opponents_army_size <= current_army_size:
        heuristic_scores[action] += 4  # Edge out Largest Army
    ```

---

### 4. Hybrid Mechanisms for Fallback Actions
Redesign the fallback system to incorporate both deterministic templates and heuristic-driven flexibility:
- **Action Templates by Priority**:
  - Use deterministic logic based on game stage:
    - Early Game: Build roads and settlements to ensure resource coverage.
    - Mid-Late Game: Prioritize cities for VP growth or roads for Longest Road.
  ```python
  for action_type in ["BUILD_CITY", "BUILD_SETTLEMENT", "BUILD_ROAD"]:
      for action in playable_actions:
          if action.action_type == action_type and action meets_conditions:
              return action
  ```
- **Heuristic-Fallback Hybrid**:
  - If no deterministic action is suitable, rely on heuristic priorities derived from current state evaluations to make fallback decisions.
- **Penalty for Stagnation**:
  - Penalize fallback repetitions by gradually increasing the weight on impactful actions like settlement-building or resource diversity improvements.

---

### 5. Methods to Evaluate and Refine Heuristics and LLM Response Handling
Design a structured framework for tuning heuristics and refining LLM responses over multiple game iterations:
- **Performance Metrics**:
  - Track metrics such as VP growth per iteration, total roads/cities/settlements built, and resource efficiency (unused resources).
  - Correlate LLM responses and fallback heuristic effectiveness with game outcomes.
- **Iterative Weight Adjustment**:
  - Analyze N-game results to adjust heuristic weights dynamically:
    - If too many roads are built without follow-up settlements, reduce road priority.
    - If city upgrades lead to stagnation due to resource imbalances, shift the weighting back to settlements.
  ```python
  if settlements_built < expected_settlement_threshold:
      heuristic_weights['BUILD_SETTLEMENT'] += 2
  ```
- **Benchmarking Against Rule-Based Baselines**:
  - Compare LLM-driven decisions with predefined optimal or rule-based actions to evaluate alignment with strategic goals.
  - Use deviation scores to identify areas where LLM prompts need refinement (e.g., under-prioritizing Largest Army or Longest Road).

---

### Next Steps:
1. Begin recalibrating heuristic scores to reflect stage-specific priorities.
2. Implement the updated prompt design to explicitly guide LLM responses toward non-repetitive, VP-centric strategies.
3. Integrate fallback mechanisms with dynamic, bottleneck-based adjustments to address stagnation and repeated default actions.
4. Build tools for iterative heuristic tuning and response evaluation against predefined baselines.

END STRATEGY.================================== Ai Message ==================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Over the next 5 iterations, implement and refine a system that better aligns FooPlayer's heuristic evaluation, LLM prompt design, and fallback mechanisms towards impactful, VP-driven actions. Aim for measurable improvements in foundational metrics like roads, settlements, and cities.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Recalibrate FooPlayer's heuristic scoring system to implement stage-specific priorities and dynamically address bottlenecks, ensuring better alignment between heuristic-driven actions and LLM output. Update the LLM prompt design to explicitly focus on VP growth and reduce low-value decision patterns.

CHOSEN AGENT: CODER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:  
Update `foo_player.py` as follows:

1. **Enhanced Heuristic Scoring**: 
    - Modify `_compute_heuristic_scores` to include stage-specific priorities:
      - Early-game boosts for roads and settlements.
      - Late-game emphasis on cities and development cards.
    - Include dynamic bottle-neck handling, e.g.:
      - Reward actions that address resource buildup or stagnation.
      - Encourage actions that disrupt opponents (e.g., blocking roads/settlements).
    - Use tile values (6, 8, etc.) to boost settlement scores for strategic intersections.

2. **Refined LLM Prompt**:
    - Update `_build_prompt` with stronger emphasis on guiding actions toward VP and strategic goals:
      - Enumerate priorities explicitly: building roads, settlements, cities.
      - Include heuristic scores in the prompt with descriptions of why actions are valuable.
      - Penalize repetitive actions like "END TURN" through explicit discouragement in the prompt.

3. **Fallback Mechanism Adjustment**:
    - Introduce deterministic templates for stage-specific fallback actions:
      - Early-game: Prioritize roads and settlements for expansion.
      - Late-game: Focus on cities and VP-centric actions.
    - Dynamically adapt fallback decisions based on resource surplus or game state bottlenecks.
    ```python
    if player_resources["brick"] >= 3 and player_resources["wood"] >= 3:
        heuristic_scores[ActionType.BUILD_ROAD] += 5
    ```

4. **Action Bottleneck Detection**:
    - Add detection for repetitive or stagnating actions (e.g., unspent resources or repeated "END TURN").
    - Penalize stagnation by prioritizing resource expenditure and spatial expansion.

Upon completing the updates, test the revised player for functional improvements in decision-making, focusing on roads, settlements, and overall strategic progression.================================ Human Message =================================

CODER

### Updates to `foo_player.py`:
1. **Enhanced Heuristic Scoring**:
   - Integrated stage-specific priorities (e.g., roads and settlements emphasized early-game, cities in mid-late game).
   - Added bonuses for high-resource tiles in settlement actions.
   - Introduced penalties to address resource bottlenecks (e.g., surplus brick/wood triggers road-building incentives).
   - Incorporated logic to dynamically adjust scores based on resource availability and VP contributions.

2. **Refined LLM Prompt**:
   - Redesigned `_build_prompt` to better guide the LLM:
     - Explicit priorities for strategic actions based on Victory Point (VP) growth.
     - Highlighted roadmap for early-game road/settlement building and late-game upgrades.
     - Discouraged repetitive or non-impactful actions like unnecessary turns.
   - Included heuristic scores in the prompt, with explanations for why certain actions are prioritized.

3. **Dynamic Fallback Mechanism**:
   - Structured fallback logic to prioritize actions based on game state:
     - Early-game: Roads and settlements.
     - Late-game: Cities and VP-centric actions.
   - Updated fallback mechanism to prevent stagnation by using deterministic templates blended with heuristic-driven conditions.

4. **Bottleneck and Surplus Resource Handling**:
   - Added logic to detect and dynamically handle situations where surplus resources exist (e.g., incentivizing road-building on excess brick/wood).
   - Increased priority for settlement or city building to resolve resource stagnation.

5. **Improved Logs**:
   - Added meaningful print statements across key decision-making steps to facilitate debugging:
     - Fallback actions.
     - Detected bottlenecks or resource imbalances.
     - LLM responses (and when fallback mechanisms are triggered).

### Testing Suggestions:
- **Evaluate Decision Quality**:
  - Test early-game actions for expansion focus (roads and settlements).
  - Verify mid-to-late game actions prioritize cities and VP-centric plays.
- **Monitor Bottleneck Response**:
  - Simulate resource-rich scenarios to observe if surplus resources are properly spent.
- **Validate Fallback Logic**:
  - Conduct games where the LLM fails or incorrectly parses the prompt to assess fallback success.
- **Track Metrics**:
  - Compare average VP, settlements, and city counts across multiple iterations to previous versions.

### Next Steps:
- Refine heuristic weights after testing to balance strategic trade-offs.
- Incorporate feedback cycles to analyze and further tune prompt alignment with heuristic evaluations.
- Observe repetitive "END TURN" penalties and ensure they improve game progression.

AttributeError: 'Action' object has no attribute 'location'================================ Human Message =================================

After Running The New foo_player.py Player, Here is my analysis and findings:

### Syntax Error Details:
- **Error Message**: `AttributeError: 'Action' object has no attribute 'location'`
- **Exact Line Number**: Line 90 in `foo_player.py`
- **Exact Line of Code**: `score = 8 + (3 if action.location.resource_value > 15 else 0)`

### Root Cause:
The `Action` class used in the code does not have an attribute `location`. This issue arises within the `_compute_heuristic_scores` method when attempting to access non-existent properties of the `Action` object.

### Impact:
This syntax error prevents the game from running, leading to no recorded results or scores for this evolution.

Let me know if you need anything else!================================== Ai Message ==================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Ensure FooPlayer's compatibility with the Catanatron API by resolving syntax errors and accurately utilizing the `Action` class attributes. Stabilize gameplay to allow evaluation of performance metrics over the next five iterations.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Fix the `AttributeError` by removing invalid references to the nonexistent `location` property in the `Action` class. Correct the scoring logic in `_compute_heuristic_scores` and replace erroneous calls with valid attributes from the `Action` class or game state.

CHOSEN AGENT: RESEARCHER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:  
Investigate the valid attributes and methods available in the `Action` class within the Catanatron API. Specifically:
1. Determine how to access the location or resource value associated with an action (if applicable).
2. Provide documentation or examples on other valid attributes of `Action` that might be relevant for heuristic scoring.
3. If no direct way exists to link `Action` to resource tiles or locations, suggest alternative ways to retrieve this context from the `Game` or `State` class for heuristic calculations.

Ensure the information is precise and actionable to debug and resolve the issue effectively.================================ Human Message =================================

RESEARCH:

### Investigation of the `Action` Class and Related Attributes
The `Action` class is part of the core mechanics for handling user actions during the gameplay. Here's the context based on the files:

#### 1. Valid Attributes of the `Action` Class
The `Action` class is defined and utilized in multiple modules. Its attributes are:
- **`color`**: Represents the player's color (e.g., `Color.BLUE`).
- **`action_type`**: Identifies the type of action (e.g., `ActionType.BUILD_SETTLEMENT`, `ActionType.PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD`).
- **`value`**: The specific content of the action based on its type. For example:
  - `Build actions` (`BUILD_SETTLEMENT`, `BUILD_CITY`) use `value` to represent the node location (`node_id`). 
  - `BUILD_ROAD` uses an `edge` object as its `value`.
  - In `MOVE_ROBBER`, `value` is a tuple such as `(coordinate, robbed_color, robbed_resource)`.

Attributes cannot directly reference nonexistent properties, such as `location`.

#### 2. Documentation and Examples of Related Action Types
Key samples of `Action` usage based on the context:
- **Action Initialization**:
  ```python
  Action(color, ActionType.BUILD_SETTLEMENT, node_id)
  Action(color, ActionType.MOVE_ROBBER, (coordinate, enemy_color, resource))
  Action(color, ActionType.ROLL, dice_roll_result)
  ```
- **Examples of Valid `ActionType` Values**:
  - Actions related to resource handling: `ROLL`, `MARITIME_TRADE`, `PLAY_YEAR_OF_PLENTY`, `PLAY_MONOPOLY`.
  - Building-related actions: `BUILD_ROAD`, `BUILD_SETTLEMENT`, `BUILD_CITY`.
  - Development cards and robber actions: `PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD`, `MOVE_ROBBER`.

#### 3. Accessing Location and Resource Context for an `Action`
The `Action` class itself does not store location or resource details unless explicitly set using the `value` attribute.

##### Alternatives for Accessing Context:
- **From the Game State (`State` Class)**:
  - To retrieve the current player's buildings (settlements, roads, etc.) or check surroundings:
    ```python
    buildings = state.buildings_by_color[Color.BLUE]
    settlements = buildings[SETTLEMENT]
    cities = buildings[CITY]
    ```
  - To get adjacent resource tiles for a node:
    ```python
    adjacent_tiles = state.board.map.adjacent_tiles[node_id]
    resources = [tile.resource for tile in adjacent_tiles if tile.resource is not None]
    ```
  - To get the bank's resource availability:
    ```python
    state.resource_freqdeck  # Bank’s current resources
    ```

- **Using `Action.value` for Specific Action Contexts**:
  In specific cases like building or moving, `Action.value` already provides relevant location-like data:
  - For building roads: Retrieve edges with `Action.value`.
  - For building settlements/cities: Use `node_id` from `Action.value`.

#### 4. Valid Methods for Game and State Interactions
Key methods/functions from the `Game` and `State`:
- **`Game` Class**:
  - `play_tick()`: Executes one game tick.
  - `winning_color()`: Returns the player currently winning the game.
  - `execute(action: Action)`: Executes a given action for a player.
  
- **`State` Class**:
  - `state.playable_actions`: Returns a list of actions currently available.
  - `state.board.buildable_node_ids(color)`: Returns node IDs where the player can build.
  - `state.player_state`: Dictionary containing details for each player (e.g., `Color.BLUE_CITIES_AVAILABLE`, `Color.BLUE_HAS_ROLLED`).

---

##### Additional Notes:
If there is a dependency on parsing `location` or `tile` data, it should instead rely on `Action.value` explicitly or query the `State` for adjacent tiles or positions as outlined above.

END RESEARCH.================================== Ai Message ==================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Ensure compatibility with the Catanatron API by appropriately integrating valid attributes of the `Action` class and utilizing game state data to enhance decision-making. Achieve stable functionality for testing strategic performance over the next 5 iterations.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Correct the `AttributeError` by refactoring `foo_player.py` to rely on valid `Action.value` attributes or query relevant context from the `State` class for heuristic scoring. Ensure all references to `location` are replaced with valid methods to retrieve positional or resource data.

CHOSEN AGENT: CODER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:
Refactor `foo_player.py` to address the syntax error and improve heuristic scoring:

1. **Fix Invalid References**:
   - Replace all calls to the nonexistent `action.location` with queries to `Action.value` or `State` methods.
   - Example adjustments:
     ```python
     if action.action_type == ActionType.BUILD_SETTLEMENT and len(state.board.map.adjacent_tiles[action.value]) > threshold:
         heuristic_scores[action] += 3
     ```
     Here, `action.value` provides the node ID where the settlement would be built.

2. **Context Retrieval from State**:
   - For actions like `BUILD_SETTLEMENT` or `BUILD_CITY`, retrieve adjacent tiles and their resource values using `state.board.map.adjacent_tiles[action.value]`.
   - For roads, use `Action.value` to access edge information and query connected tiles.

3. **Heuristic Scoring Enhancements**:
   - Incorporate valid context details from the state or action attributes to refine heuristic scoring:
     - High-value tiles should boost settlement scores:
       ```python
       adjacent_resources = [tile.resource for tile in state.board.map.adjacent_tiles[action.value] if tile.resource is not None]
       resource_bonus = sum(tile.value for resource in adjacent_resources)
       heuristic_scores[action] += resource_bonus
       ```

4. **Debugging and Validation**:
   - Ensure all invalid references are replaced with valid calls.
   - Add debug print statements to verify successful access to `Action.value` or state functions during gameplay.

Once refactoring is complete, test FooPlayer to confirm it runs without errors and demonstrate functional heuristic scoring improvements.================================ Human Message =================================

CODER

### Summary of Changes:
1. **Fixed `AttributeError`**:
   - Replaced invalid references to `action.location` with valid attribute and context retrieval using `action.value` and game state methods (e.g., accessing `state.board.map.adjacent_tiles` for settlement scoring).

2. **Improved Settlement Scoring**:
   - Enhanced `_compute_heuristic_scores` to calculate bonuses for settlements based on adjacent tiles' resource values using `state.board.map.adjacent_tiles[action.value]`.

3. **Resource Bottleneck Handling**:
   - Retained logic for surplus brick/wood to incentivize road-building.

4. **Improved Debugging**:
   - Added specific print statements during fallback and heuristic computation to verify logic.

5. **Dynamic Heuristic Refinements**:
   - Settlement scoring dynamically adjusts based on adjacent tile values, improving action prioritization.

### Testing Plan:
- Verify that the game runs without errors.
- Validate heuristic score calculations for settlements and roads using logs.
- Test gameplay performance:
  - Early-game: Expansion (settlements and roads).
  - Late-game: City-building and VP growth.

Let me know if the updated player behaves as expected or requires further refinements.

AttributeError: 'LandTile' object has no attribute 'value'================================ Human Message =================================

After Running The New foo_player.py Player, Here is my analysis and findings:

### Syntax Error Details:
- **Error Message**: `AttributeError: 'LandTile' object has no attribute 'value'`
- **Exact Line Number**: Line 92 in `foo_player.py`
- **Exact Line of Code**: `tile.value for tile in adjacent_tiles if tile.resource is not None`

### Root Cause:
The `LandTile` class does not have a `value` attribute as assumed in `_compute_heuristic_scores`. This error occurs when attempting to calculate resource bonuses for building settlements based on adjacent tiles.

### Impact:
The syntax error prevents the game from running, resulting in no recorded game results or player performance data for this evolution.

Let me know if you need anything else!================================== Ai Message ==================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Ensure compatibility with the Catanatron API and eliminate syntax errors by properly accessing attributes of the `LandTile` class and adjacent tiles during heuristic scoring. Stabilize gameplay for functional testing and iterative improvements in performance metrics.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Correct the error by replacing the incorrect reference to `tile.value` with valid calls to extract resource-related attributes or other properties from the `LandTile` class. Fully debug and ensure the heuristic scoring function runs smoothly without errors.

CHOSEN AGENT: RESEARCHER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:  
Investigate the `LandTile` class and its valid attributes. Specifically:
1. Identify what attributes or methods the `LandTile` class provides for retrieving resource-type or strategic value data.
2. Provide guidance on how to properly compute bonuses for adjacent tiles when building settlements or roads.
3. Suggest alternative approaches if direct resource value computation from `LandTile` is not viable.  

Ensure the information is actionable and tailored for correcting the heuristic scoring computations.================================ Human Message =================================

RESEARCH:

### Investigating Attributes and Methods of the `LandTile` Class
The `LandTile` class and associated structures define the core elements of gameplay tiles in the Catanatron framework. Here's a breakdown of the relevant components:

---

### **1. Valid Attributes of `LandTile`**
The `LandTile` class provides the following attributes:
- **`id`**: A unique identifier for the land tile.
- **`resource`**: The resource type for the tile (e.g., `WOOD`, `BRICK`, `WHEAT`, `SHEEP`, `ORE`, or `None` for desert tiles).
- **`number`**: The number associated with the tile (dice roll probability value). `None` indicates desert tiles.
- **`nodes`**: A dictionary where the keys are `NodeRef` values (relative positions like `NORTH`, `SOUTH`) and the values are `node_id`s.
- **`edges`**: A dictionary mapping `EdgeRef` (edge directions) to edge IDs.

Example usage:
```python
tile_id = land_tile.id
tile_resource = land_tile.resource  # e.g., WOOD
tile_number = land_tile.number  # e.g., 8 for a high-probability tile
tile_nodes = list(land_tile.nodes.values())  # Get the node IDs
tile_edges = list(land_tile.edges.values())  # Get associated edges
```

---

### **2. Calculating Bonuses or Context from Adjacent Tiles**
To compute heuristic bonuses from adjacent tiles when assigning strategic values for settlements or roads:

#### 2.1 Accessing Adjacent Tiles
The `CatanMap` object maintains an auxiliary structure for adjacent tiles:
- **`CatanMap.adjacent_tiles`**: Maps `node_id` to a list of `LandTile` objects surrounding that node.
  ```python
  adjacent_tiles = game.state.board.adjacent_tiles[node_id]
  for tile in adjacent_tiles:
      resource = tile.resource
      probability = tile.number_probability(tile.number)
      print(f"Adjacent tile {tile.id}: Resource={resource}, Probability={probability}")
  ```

#### 2.2 Computing Resource Production
You can estimate the cumulative production at a node based on resource probabilities of adjacent tiles:
- **`CatanMap.node_production`**: Maps `node_id` to a `Counter` of resource probabilities.
  ```python
  resource_production = game.state.board.node_production[node_id]
  # Example format: Counter({WOOD: 0.25, BRICK: 0.12})
  ```

---

### **3. Alternative Approaches if Direct Resource Value is Not Possible**
When direct computation is unavailable, use a combination of these methods:
- **Resource Contributions from Tiles**: Use `CatanMap.adjacent_tiles` and `LandTile.resource` or `LandTile.number`.
  ```python
  adjacent_tiles = game.state.board.adjacent_tiles[node_id]
  resource_values = [tile.resource for tile in adjacent_tiles if tile.resource]
  ```

- **Dice Roll Probability**: Use `number_probability()` on a tile’s `number`.
  ```python
  from catanatron.models.map import number_probability
  dice_probability = number_probability(tile.number)  # Roll chance for the tile
  ```

- **Ports and Trading Context**: If ports matter (e.g., for heuristic value), access via:
  ```python
  ports = game.state.board.port_nodes  # Get port mappings
  ```

---

### **Actionable Guidance for Heuristic Scoring**
To integrate this into the heuristic computation:
1. Replace `tile.value` in `_compute_heuristic_scores` with access to `tile.resource` or `tile.number`.
   ```python
   resource = tile.resource  # WOOD, BRICK, etc.
   probability = number_probability(tile.number)  # Dice probability
   ```
2. For adjacent tile context at `node_id`, query `game.state.board.adjacent_tiles`.
   ```python
   adjacent_tiles = game.state.board.adjacent_tiles[node_id]
   for tile in adjacent_tiles:
       if tile.resource is not None:
           resource_value = tile.resource
           probability = number_probability(tile.number)
   ```

---

### References:
1. **`catanatron_core/catanatron/models/map.py`** - Defines the `LandTile`, `CatanMap`, and maps-related computations like `adjacent_tiles` and `node_production`. Includes network structures for nodes, edges, and tiles.
2. **`catanatron_core/catanatron/state.py`** - Provides the `State` class, which interacts with the `LandTile` attributes via the `board` object.

END RESEARCH.================================== Ai Message ==================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Ensure stable heuristic scoring for FooPlayer by correctly accessing valid attributes of `LandTile` and utilizing game state methods (e.g., `adjacent_tiles`) to compute bonuses for settlements and roads. Refine gameplay to support functional testing over the next 5 iterations.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Replace the incorrect reference to `tile.value` in heuristic scoring with valid queries to `tile.resource`, `tile.number`, and `number_probability()` to calculate bonuses for adjacent tiles when evaluating settlement actions.

CHOSEN AGENT: CODER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:
Refactor `foo_player.py` to fix the error and improve scoring calculations:

1. **Correct Tile Context Retrieval**:
   - Replace all calls to `tile.value` with queries to valid attributes of `LandTile`, such as `tile.resource` for resource type or `tile.number` for dice roll probability.
   - Use `game.state.board.adjacent_tiles[node_id]` to get tiles surrounding the node at which a settlement or city is to be built.
   - Example adjustment:
     ```python
     adjacent_tiles = game.state.board.adjacent_tiles[action.value]
     resource_bonus = sum(number_probability(tile.number) for tile in adjacent_tiles if tile.resource is not None)
     heuristic_scores[action] += resource_bonus
     ```

2. **Enhance Settlement Scoring**:
   - Calculate settlement scores dynamically based on cumulative resource probabilities from adjacent tiles (using `number_probability()` and `tile.resource`).
   - Adjust `_compute_heuristic_scores` to include valid resource bonuses:
     ```python
     for action in playable_actions:
         if action.action_type == ActionType.BUILD_SETTLEMENT:
             adjacent_tiles = game.state.board.adjacent_tiles[action.value]
             resource_bonus = sum(number_probability(tile.number) for tile in adjacent_tiles if tile.resource is not None)
             heuristic_scores[action] = 10 + resource_bonus
     ```

3. **Validate Heuristic Scoring**:
   - Ensure all logic runs smoothly, avoiding invalid calls or attributes.
   - Add debug print statements to log computed bonuses during gameplay.

Once implemented, test FooPlayer for functionality and measure changes in heuristic-driven decision-making across multiple iterations.================================ Human Message =================================

CODER

### Changes Made:
1. **Resolved `AttributeError`**:
   - Replaced previous invalid references to `tile.value` with `number_probability(tile.number)` from the `LandTile` class to compute bonuses based on tile probabilities.

2. **Updated Heuristic Scoring Logic**:
   - Settlement bonuses now dynamically evaluate adjacent tiles using `state.board.adjacent_tiles[action.value]`.
   - Bonuses are calculated based on valid attributes (`tile.resource` and `tile.number`) using `number_probability()`.

3. **Improved Resource Bottleneck Handling**:
   - Retained logic to incentivize road-building when brick and wood resources are in surplus.

4. **Debug Enhancements**:
   - Added clear print statements to log heuristic scores and fallback decisions.

### Notes for Testing:
- Confirm stability and functionality of the game simulation without syntax errors.
- Test heuristic scoring improvements, observing early-game settlement expansion and resource optimization.
- Validate fallback mechanism functionality when a valid LLM response is not received.

AttributeError: 'Board' object has no attribute 'adjacent_tiles'================================ Human Message =================================

After Running The New foo_player.py Player, Here is my analysis and findings:

### Syntax Error Details:
- **Error Message**: `AttributeError: 'Board' object has no attribute 'adjacent_tiles'`
- **Exact Line Number**: Line 91 in `foo_player.py`
- **Exact Line of Code**: `adjacent_tiles = state.board.adjacent_tiles[action.value]`

### Root Cause:
The `Board` object in the provided game framework does not have an attribute or method named `adjacent_tiles`. The code attempts to calculate heuristic scores based on adjacent tiles, leading to this error.

### Impact:
The syntax error prevents the game simulation from running, and no game results or performance data were generated for this evolution.

Let me know if you need anything else!================================== Ai Message ==================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Ensure accurate context retrieval from the game framework by replacing invalid references to nonexistent `adjacent_tiles` attributes and identifying the correct methods or mechanisms for accessing adjacent tile information. Stabilize the game for functional testing and iterative improvements.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Replace the erroneous reference to `state.board.adjacent_tiles` with a valid alternative to retrieve adjacent tile information or resource contexts from the game framework. Verify functionality and eliminate all remaining syntax issues.

CHOSEN AGENT: RESEARCHER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:  
Investigate alternative methods or properties in the `Board` or related classes (`State`, `Game`) to retrieve adjacent tile information. Specifically:
1. Identify where and how adjacent tile data is stored or computed (e.g., through another attribute, helper function, or method).
2. Confirm any valid alternative mechanisms to compute node-specific resource contexts, such as `node_production` or explicit tile indexing.
3. Provide clear examples or pseudocode to adjust the `_compute_heuristic_scores` function with valid logic.

Deliver actionable steps for replacing invalid calls with correct methods or attributes.================================ Human Message =================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Refactor FooPlayer to work seamlessly with the Catanatron API while continuing to enhance strategic decision-making via heuristic integration and LLM refinement. Achieve compatibility and avoid critical runtime errors in the next evolution to allow for testing and evaluation.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Resolve the `AttributeError` by ensuring that `foo_player.py` uses valid methods from the Catanatron `Game` class for retrieving player resources and other game state data. Validate the compatibility of all API calls in the `_build_prompt` method.

CHOSEN AGENT: RESEARCHER

AGENT OBJECTIVE: 
Identify the correct way to access the following game state information from the Catanatron API:
1. Player resources (e.g., wood, brick, grain, etc.) for a specific color (e.g., `Color.BLUE`).
2. Obtain other player and game statistics that might be relevant for building the LLM prompt (e.g., settlements, cities, roads, VP).
3. Provide a list of valid Game API methods and properties that could be helpful for efficiently querying such state details.

Ensure that the information provided directly addresses the API compatibility issues in `foo_player.py`.================================== Ai Message ==================================

RESEARCH:

#### Key Information on Accessing Game State Using Catanatron API

**1. Accessing Player Resources**
To retrieve resources (e.g., wood, brick, grain, etc.) for a specific player:
- Use the `get_player_freqdeck(state, color)` function, which provides the player's resource frequency deck.
  ```python
  from catanatron.state_functions import get_player_freqdeck
  player_resources = get_player_freqdeck(state, Color.BLUE)
  ```
- `player_num_resource_cards(state, color, resource)` can query the count for specific resources:
  ```python
  from catanatron.state_functions import player_num_resource_cards
  wood_count = player_num_resource_cards(state, Color.BLUE, "WOOD")
  ```

**2. Accessing Player and Game Statistics**
For settlements, cities, roads, and VP:
- **Settlements**: Use `get_player_buildings(state, color, "SETTLEMENT")` to retrieve settlement IDs of a player:
  ```python
  from catanatron.state_functions import get_player_buildings
  settlements = get_player_buildings(state, Color.BLUE, "SETTLEMENT")
  ```
- **Cities**: Similarly invoke `get_player_buildings(state, color, "CITY")` for city IDs:
  ```python
  cities = get_player_buildings(state, Color.BLUE, "CITY")
  ```
- **Roads Available**: Check roads available using state data:
  ```python
  player_key = player_key(state, Color.BLUE)
  roads_available = state.player_state[f"{player_key}_ROADS_AVAILABLE"]
  ```
- **Victory Points**: Victory points can be checked via:
  ```python
  victory_points = state.player_state[f"{player_key}_ACTUAL_VICTORY_POINTS"]
  ```

**3. General Game State Statistics**
The class `Game` contains the main API-level functions for interacting with game state, including:
- `play_tick()` to advance the game state.
- `winning_color()` to retrieve the player currently winning the game.
- `state.playable_actions` to list the valid actions at the current step.

```python
winning_player = game.winning_color()
playable_options = game.state.playable_actions
```

#### List of Useful Methods and Properties in Game API:
Valid methods within the `Game` class and associated functions:
- `get_player_freqdeck(state, color)` – Retrieves player's resources.
- `player_num_resource_cards(state, color, resource)` – Gets the count for specific resources.
- `player_key(state, color)` – Returns string key for player state.
- `get_player_buildings(state, color, building_type)` – Retrieves player's settlements/cities.
- `state.playable_actions` – Provides the currently executable actions.
- `game.play_tick()` – Advances game state one step.
- `game.winning_color()` – Returns the winning color/player.
- `state.colors` – Lists the colors in the game.

END RESEARCH.================================ Human Message =================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Ensure FooPlayer's compatibility with the Catanatron API by resolving syntax errors and accurately utilizing the `Action` class attributes. Stabilize gameplay to allow evaluation of performance metrics over the next five iterations.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Fix the `AttributeError` by removing invalid references to the nonexistent `location` property in the `Action` class. Correct the scoring logic in `_compute_heuristic_scores` and replace erroneous calls with valid attributes from the `Action` class or game state.

CHOSEN AGENT: RESEARCHER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:  
Investigate the valid attributes and methods available in the `Action` class within the Catanatron API. Specifically:
1. Determine how to access the location or resource value associated with an action (if applicable).
2. Provide documentation or examples on other valid attributes of `Action` that might be relevant for heuristic scoring.
3. If no direct way exists to link `Action` to resource tiles or locations, suggest alternative ways to retrieve this context from the `Game` or `State` class for heuristic calculations.

Ensure the information is precise and actionable to debug and resolve the issue effectively.================================== Ai Message ==================================

RESEARCH:

### Investigation of the `Action` Class and Related Attributes
The `Action` class is part of the core mechanics for handling user actions during the gameplay. Here's the context based on the files:

#### 1. Valid Attributes of the `Action` Class
The `Action` class is defined and utilized in multiple modules. Its attributes are:
- **`color`**: Represents the player's color (e.g., `Color.BLUE`).
- **`action_type`**: Identifies the type of action (e.g., `ActionType.BUILD_SETTLEMENT`, `ActionType.PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD`).
- **`value`**: The specific content of the action based on its type. For example:
  - `Build actions` (`BUILD_SETTLEMENT`, `BUILD_CITY`) use `value` to represent the node location (`node_id`). 
  - `BUILD_ROAD` uses an `edge` object as its `value`.
  - In `MOVE_ROBBER`, `value` is a tuple such as `(coordinate, robbed_color, robbed_resource)`.

Attributes cannot directly reference nonexistent properties, such as `location`.

#### 2. Documentation and Examples of Related Action Types
Key samples of `Action` usage based on the context:
- **Action Initialization**:
  ```python
  Action(color, ActionType.BUILD_SETTLEMENT, node_id)
  Action(color, ActionType.MOVE_ROBBER, (coordinate, enemy_color, resource))
  Action(color, ActionType.ROLL, dice_roll_result)
  ```
- **Examples of Valid `ActionType` Values**:
  - Actions related to resource handling: `ROLL`, `MARITIME_TRADE`, `PLAY_YEAR_OF_PLENTY`, `PLAY_MONOPOLY`.
  - Building-related actions: `BUILD_ROAD`, `BUILD_SETTLEMENT`, `BUILD_CITY`.
  - Development cards and robber actions: `PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD`, `MOVE_ROBBER`.

#### 3. Accessing Location and Resource Context for an `Action`
The `Action` class itself does not store location or resource details unless explicitly set using the `value` attribute.

##### Alternatives for Accessing Context:
- **From the Game State (`State` Class)**:
  - To retrieve the current player's buildings (settlements, roads, etc.) or check surroundings:
    ```python
    buildings = state.buildings_by_color[Color.BLUE]
    settlements = buildings[SETTLEMENT]
    cities = buildings[CITY]
    ```
  - To get adjacent resource tiles for a node:
    ```python
    adjacent_tiles = state.board.map.adjacent_tiles[node_id]
    resources = [tile.resource for tile in adjacent_tiles if tile.resource is not None]
    ```
  - To get the bank's resource availability:
    ```python
    state.resource_freqdeck  # Bank’s current resources
    ```

- **Using `Action.value` for Specific Action Contexts**:
  In specific cases like building or moving, `Action.value` already provides relevant location-like data:
  - For building roads: Retrieve edges with `Action.value`.
  - For building settlements/cities: Use `node_id` from `Action.value`.

#### 4. Valid Methods for Game and State Interactions
Key methods/functions from the `Game` and `State`:
- **`Game` Class**:
  - `play_tick()`: Executes one game tick.
  - `winning_color()`: Returns the player currently winning the game.
  - `execute(action: Action)`: Executes a given action for a player.
  
- **`State` Class**:
  - `state.playable_actions`: Returns a list of actions currently available.
  - `state.board.buildable_node_ids(color)`: Returns node IDs where the player can build.
  - `state.player_state`: Dictionary containing details for each player (e.g., `Color.BLUE_CITIES_AVAILABLE`, `Color.BLUE_HAS_ROLLED`).

---

##### Additional Notes:
If there is a dependency on parsing `location` or `tile` data, it should instead rely on `Action.value` explicitly or query the `State` for adjacent tiles or positions as outlined above.

### Investigating Attributes and Methods of the `LandTile` Class
The `LandTile` class and associated structures define the core elements of gameplay tiles in the Catanatron framework. Here's a breakdown of the relevant components:

---

### **1. Valid Attributes of `LandTile`**
The `LandTile` class provides the following attributes:
- **`id`**: A unique identifier for the land tile.
- **`resource`**: The resource type for the tile (e.g., `WOOD`, `BRICK`, `WHEAT`, `SHEEP`, `ORE`, or `None` for desert tiles).
- **`number`**: The number associated with the tile (dice roll probability value). `None` indicates desert tiles.
- **`nodes`**: A dictionary where the keys are `NodeRef` values (relative positions like `NORTH`, `SOUTH`) and the values are `node_id`s.
- **`edges`**: A dictionary mapping `EdgeRef` (edge directions) to edge IDs.

Example usage:
```python
tile_id = land_tile.id

```

### **2. Calculating Bonuses or Context from Adjacent Tiles**
To compute heuristic bonuses from adjacent tiles when assigning strategic values for settlements or roads:

#### 2.1 Accessing Adjacent Tiles
The `CatanMap` object maintains an auxiliary structure for adjacent tiles:
- **`CatanMap.adjacent_tiles`**: Maps `node_id` to a list of `LandTile` objects surrounding that node.
  ```python
  adjacent_tiles = game.state.board.adjacent_tiles[node_id]
  for tile in adjacent_tiles:
      resource = tile.resource
      probability = tile.number_probability(tile.number)
      print(f"Adjacent tile {tile.id}: Resource={resource}, Probability={probability}")
  ```

#### 2.2 Computing Resource Production
You can estimate the cumulative production at a node based on resource probabilities of adjacent tiles:
- **`CatanMap.node_production`**: Maps `node_id` to a `Counter` of resource probabilities.
  ```python
  resource_production = game.state.board.node_production[node_id]
  # Example format: Counter({WOOD: 0.25, BRICK: 0.12})
  ```

---

### **3. Alternative Approaches if Direct Resource Value is Not Possible**
When direct computation is unavailable, use a combination of these methods:
- **Resource Contributions from Tiles**: Use `CatanMap.adjacent_tiles` and `LandTile.resource` or `LandTile.number`.
  ```python
  adjacent_tiles = game.state.board.adjacent_tiles[node_id]
  resource_values = [tile.resource for tile in adjacent_tiles if tile.resource]
  ```

- **Dice Roll Probability**: Use `number_probability()` on a tile’s `number`.
  ```python
  from catanatron.models.map import number_probability
  dice_probability = number_probability(tile.number)  # Roll chance for the tile
  ```

- **Ports and Trading Context**: If ports matter (e.g., for heuristic value), access via:
  ```python
  ports = game.state.board.port_nodes  # Get port mappings
  ```

---

### **Actionable Guidance for Heuristic Scoring**
To integrate this into the heuristic computation:
1. Replace `tile.value` in `_compute_heuristic_scores` with access to `tile.resource` or `tile.number`.
   ```python
   resource = tile.resource  # WOOD, BRICK, etc.
   probability = number_probability(tile.number)  # Dice probability
   ```
2. For adjacent tile context at `node_id`, query `game.state.board.adjacent_tiles`.
   ```python
   adjacent_tiles = game.state.board.adjacent_tiles[node_id]
   for tile in adjacent_tiles:
       if tile.resource is not None:
           resource_value = tile.resource
           probability = number_probability(tile.number)
   ```

---

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Ensure accurate context retrieval from the game framework by replacing invalid references to nonexistent `adjacent_tiles` attributes and identifying the correct methods or mechanisms for accessing adjacent tile information. Stabilize the game for functional testing and iterative improvements.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Replace the erroneous reference to `state.board.adjacent_tiles` with a valid alternative to retrieve adjacent tile information or resource contexts from the game framework. Verify functionality and eliminate all remaining syntax issues.

CHOSEN AGENT: RESEARCHER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:  
Investigate alternative methods or properties in the `Board` or related classes (`State`, `Game`) to retrieve adjacent tile information. Specifically:
1. Identify where and how adjacent tile data is stored or computed (e.g., through another attribute, helper function, or method).
2. Confirm any valid alternative mechanisms to compute node-specific resource contexts, such as `node_production` or explicit tile indexing.
3. Provide clear examples or pseudocode to adjust the `_compute_heuristic_scores` function with valid logic.

Deliver actionable steps for replacing invalid calls with correct methods or attributes.================================== Ai Message ==================================

#### Key Mechanisms for Accessing Adjacent Tile Information
The `CatanMap` and `State` classes provide the primary ways to access data about the board, including adjacent tiles and node-specific contexts. For resolving the issue around the erroneous `state.board.adjacent_tiles` reference, here are the validated methods and alternative approaches:

---

### **1. Accessing Adjacent Tiles**
The `CatanMap` class explicitly maintains data structures for adjacent tiles via its `adjacent_tiles` attribute. 
- The `adjacent_tiles` attribute of `CatanMap` serves as a mapping:  
  **Key**: `node_id`  
  **Value**: `List[LandTile]` (all land tiles adjacent to the given node).  

#### Example:
```python
# Access adjacent tiles for a specific node
adjacent_tiles = game.state.board.map.adjacent_tiles[node_id]
for tile in adjacent_tiles:
    resource = tile.resource  # Resource type (e.g., WOOD)
    number = tile.number      # Probability number for the resource
```

---

### **2. Computing Node-Specific Resource Context**
To compute bonuses for a specific node based on adjacent resources, leverage the `node_production` attribute from `CatanMap`.  
- **`node_production`**: Maps `node_id` to a `Counter` of resource probabilities (combining adjacent tiles).

#### Example:
```python
# Retrieve resource production probabilities for a node
resource_production = game.state.board.map.node_production[node_id]

# Example output: Counter({WOOD: 0.25, BRICK: 0.16, WHEAT: 0.08})
print(resource_production)
```

This can be used to assess the strategic value of a node based on the likelihood of obtaining specific resources.

---

### **3. Suggested Fix for `_compute_heuristic_scores`**
To eliminate the invalid `state.board.adjacent_tiles` reference, you can replace it with calls to either `adjacent_tiles` or `node_production` depending on the calculation context. For heuristic-based evaluations:

#### Using `node_production` for Scoring:
```python
def _compute_heuristic_scores(node_id):
    # Retrieve node-specific production score
    resource_production = game.state.board.map.node_production[node_id]
    
    # Compute heuristic score based on production probabilities
    score = sum(
        resource_production[resource] * weight
        for resource, weight in RESOURCE_WEIGHTS.items()
    )
    return score
```

#### Using `adjacent_tiles` for Detailed Context:
```python
def _compute_heuristic_scores(node_id):
    # Access adjacent tiles directly for the node
    adjacent_tiles = game.state.board.map.adjacent_tiles[node_id]
    
    # Example: Evaluate based on resources and probabilities
    score = 0
    for tile in adjacent_tiles:
        if tile.resource is not None:
            probability = number_probability(tile.number)
            score += RESOURCE_WEIGHTS[tile.resource] * probability
    return score
```

- **Key Function**: `number_probability(tile.number)` computes the probability of rolling the tile's dice number. 

---

### **4. Other Methods for Alternative Contexts**
Additional utilities that may assist in resource evaluation include:
- **From `CatanMap`**:
  - `land_tiles`: Dictionary of all land tiles by coordinate.
  - `port_nodes`: Mapping of ports to associated nodes.
- **From `State`**:
  - `state.board.buildings`: Dictionary of buildings (e.g., settlements, cities) associated with node IDs.
  - `state.resource_freqdeck`: Provides information on bank resources.

END RESEARCH.================================== Ai Message ==================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Improve FooPlayer’s strategic depth by refining heuristic accuracy, enhancing LLM prompts to advocate stronger strategic actions, and reducing reliance on the fallback mechanism. Focus on measurable improvements in roads, settlements, and cities over the next 5 iterations.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Address the strategic misalignment by:
1. Refactoring heuristics to better differentiate and prioritize optimal actions (e.g., building roads, settlements, and cities).
2. Revising the LLM prompt design to explicitly prioritize non-default, VP-centric, and impactful actions.
3. Adjusting the fallback mechanism to penalize repetitive default actions and ensure meaningful progression.

CHOSEN AGENT: STRATEGIZER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:  
Provide 5 specific refinements or new strategies to improve FooPlayer’s decision-making system, focusing on the following:
1. How to recalibrate heuristic scoring to strongly favor foundational growth actions like roads and settlements early on.
2. Techniques to adjust prompt design to directly steer the LLM away from repetitive or low-value default actions.
3. Criteria for dynamically detecting high-impact actions (strategic bottlenecks or game pivots) and encouraging the LLM or fallback decision to prioritize them.
4. Hybrid mechanisms blending determinate strategic templates for fallback actions alongside heuristic-driven flexibility.
5. Methods to evaluate and tune the heuristic scoring weights and LLM response handling over multiple evolutions, ensuring consistent improvement in strategic metrics.================================ Human Message =================================

STRATEGY:

### 1. Recalibrating Heuristic Scoring for Early Foundational Growth
Refine the heuristic scoring system to prioritize foundational growth actions, particularly during the early game:
- **Dynamic Weight Adjustments for Game Stages**:
  - **Early Game**:
    - Roads: Score 10 (high priority for expansion).
    - Settlements: Score 8 (emphasize resource diversity and availability).
    - Cities: Score 5 (lower priority due to resource scarcity early on).
  - **Mid to Late Game**:
    - Settlements: Score 10 (needed for reaching VP thresholds).
    - Cities: Score 15 (maximize VP by converting settlements to cities).
    - Roads: Score 7 (focus on Longest Road or movement towards strategic settlement spots).  
- **Tile Resource Heuristic**:
  - Assign weighted scores to actions based on resource tile priority:
    - High-Value Tiles: Prioritize intersections with tiles like 6, 8 (ore/wheat bonuses), increasing the heuristic scores of these actions.
    ```python
    if action.action_type == ActionType.BUILD_SETTLEMENT and action.location.resource_value > 15:
        heuristic_scores[action] += 3  # Boost for high-value tiles
    ```
- **Disruption Consideration**:
  - Actions that block opponent growth (road connections or settlements) receive a bonus.

---

### 2. Adjusting Prompt Design to Guide the LLM Towards High-Impact Actions
Update the LLM prompt construction to explicitly penalize repetitive or low-value actions and focus on strategic, VP-driving goals:
- **Segmented Descriptions with Action Prioritization**:
  ```
  You are tasked with making the most impactful move in the Catanatron Minigame. Always prioritize actions with long-term strategic benefits over short-term results. Avoid repetitive, low-impact actions like ending turns without building to progress.
  
  Current Priorities:
  1. Expand settlements and roads for resource variety and VP growth.
  2. Upgrade settlements to cities to maximize VP.
  3. Act to hinder opponents’ expansion when possible.
  
  Consider the following heuristic scores and game state in your decision:
  ```
  - Add structured fields for each action to explicitly indicate their heuristic weight, stage relevance, and potential impact:
    ```
    Action: {Action}
    Heuristic Score: {Score}
    Stage Priority: {Early/Mid/Late Game Relevance}
    Impact: {How this action will improve VP or hinder opponents}
    ```

---

### 3. Dynamic Detection of High-Impact Actions (Bottlenecks or Game Pivots)
Introduce dynamic logic to identify and prioritize high-impact actions during pivotal game moments:
- **Bottleneck Identification**:
  - Detect signs of resource stagnation or unspent resources (e.g., excessive ore/wheat without city upgrades or brick/wood without roads/settlements).
  ```python
  if player_resources['brick'] >= 3 and player_resources['wood'] >= 3:
      heuristic_scores[ActionType.BUILD_ROAD] += 5  # Encourage spending surplus
  ```
  - Time-based triggers: Penalize repeated "END TURN" or fallback actions and boost the use of active building moves.
- **Strategic Pivot Boosting**:
  - Add bonuses to actions when triggered by game-specific pivots:
    - Longest Road: Encourage roads when near the threshold for Longest Road.
    - Largest Army: Prioritize development card purchases when competing for Largest Army or sabotaging opponents.
    ```python
    if current_army_size >= 2 and opponents_army_size <= current_army_size:
        heuristic_scores[action] += 4  # Edge out Largest Army
    ```

---

### 4. Hybrid Mechanisms for Fallback Actions
Redesign the fallback system to incorporate both deterministic templates and heuristic-driven flexibility:
- **Action Templates by Priority**:
  - Use deterministic logic based on game stage:
    - Early Game: Build roads and settlements to ensure resource coverage.
    - Mid-Late Game: Prioritize cities for VP growth or roads for Longest Road.
  ```python
  for action_type in ["BUILD_CITY", "BUILD_SETTLEMENT", "BUILD_ROAD"]:
      for action in playable_actions:
          if action.action_type == action_type and action meets_conditions:
              return action
  ```
- **Heuristic-Fallback Hybrid**:
  - If no deterministic action is suitable, rely on heuristic priorities derived from current state evaluations to make fallback decisions.
- **Penalty for Stagnation**:
  - Penalize fallback repetitions by gradually increasing the weight on impactful actions like settlement-building or resource diversity improvements.

---

### 5. Methods to Evaluate and Refine Heuristics and LLM Response Handling
Design a structured framework for tuning heuristics and refining LLM responses over multiple game iterations:
- **Performance Metrics**:
  - Track metrics such as VP growth per iteration, total roads/cities/settlements built, and resource efficiency (unused resources).
  - Correlate LLM responses and fallback heuristic effectiveness with game outcomes.
- **Iterative Weight Adjustment**:
  - Analyze N-game results to adjust heuristic weights dynamically:
    - If too many roads are built without follow-up settlements, reduce road priority.
    - If city upgrades lead to stagnation due to resource imbalances, shift the weighting back to settlements.
  ```python
  if settlements_built < expected_settlement_threshold:
      heuristic_weights['BUILD_SETTLEMENT'] += 2
  ```
- **Benchmarking Against Rule-Based Baselines**:
  - Compare LLM-driven decisions with predefined optimal or rule-based actions to evaluate alignment with strategic goals.
  - Use deviation scores to identify areas where LLM prompts need refinement (e.g., under-prioritizing Largest Army or Longest Road).

---

### Next Steps:
1. Begin recalibrating heuristic scores to reflect stage-specific priorities.
2. Implement the updated prompt design to explicitly guide LLM responses toward non-repetitive, VP-centric strategies.
3. Integrate fallback mechanisms with dynamic, bottleneck-based adjustments to address stagnation and repeated default actions.
4. Build tools for iterative heuristic tuning and response evaluation against predefined baselines.

END STRATEGY.================================== Ai Message ==================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Over the next 5 iterations, implement and refine a system that better aligns FooPlayer's heuristic evaluation, LLM prompt design, and fallback mechanisms towards impactful, VP-driven actions. Aim for measurable improvements in foundational metrics like roads, settlements, and cities.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Recalibrate FooPlayer's heuristic scoring system to implement stage-specific priorities and dynamically address bottlenecks, ensuring better alignment between heuristic-driven actions and LLM output. Update the LLM prompt design to explicitly focus on VP growth and reduce low-value decision patterns.

CHOSEN AGENT: CODER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:  
Update `foo_player.py` as follows:

1. **Enhanced Heuristic Scoring**: 
    - Modify `_compute_heuristic_scores` to include stage-specific priorities:
      - Early-game boosts for roads and settlements.
      - Late-game emphasis on cities and development cards.
    - Include dynamic bottle-neck handling, e.g.:
      - Reward actions that address resource buildup or stagnation.
      - Encourage actions that disrupt opponents (e.g., blocking roads/settlements).
    - Use tile values (6, 8, etc.) to boost settlement scores for strategic intersections.

2. **Refined LLM Prompt**:
    - Update `_build_prompt` with stronger emphasis on guiding actions toward VP and strategic goals:
      - Enumerate priorities explicitly: building roads, settlements, cities.
      - Include heuristic scores in the prompt with descriptions of why actions are valuable.
      - Penalize repetitive actions like "END TURN" through explicit discouragement in the prompt.

3. **Fallback Mechanism Adjustment**:
    - Introduce deterministic templates for stage-specific fallback actions:
      - Early-game: Prioritize roads and settlements for expansion.
      - Late-game: Focus on cities and VP-centric actions.
    - Dynamically adapt fallback decisions based on resource surplus or game state bottlenecks.
    ```python
    if player_resources["brick"] >= 3 and player_resources["wood"] >= 3:
        heuristic_scores[ActionType.BUILD_ROAD] += 5
    ```

4. **Action Bottleneck Detection**:
    - Add detection for repetitive or stagnating actions (e.g., unspent resources or repeated "END TURN").
    - Penalize stagnation by prioritizing resource expenditure and spatial expansion.

Upon completing the updates, test the revised player for functional improvements in decision-making, focusing on roads, settlements, and overall strategic progression.================================ Human Message =================================

CODER

### Updates to `foo_player.py`:
1. **Enhanced Heuristic Scoring**:
   - Integrated stage-specific priorities (e.g., roads and settlements emphasized early-game, cities in mid-late game).
   - Added bonuses for high-resource tiles in settlement actions.
   - Introduced penalties to address resource bottlenecks (e.g., surplus brick/wood triggers road-building incentives).
   - Incorporated logic to dynamically adjust scores based on resource availability and VP contributions.

2. **Refined LLM Prompt**:
   - Redesigned `_build_prompt` to better guide the LLM:
     - Explicit priorities for strategic actions based on Victory Point (VP) growth.
     - Highlighted roadmap for early-game road/settlement building and late-game upgrades.
     - Discouraged repetitive or non-impactful actions like unnecessary turns.
   - Included heuristic scores in the prompt, with explanations for why certain actions are prioritized.

3. **Dynamic Fallback Mechanism**:
   - Structured fallback logic to prioritize actions based on game state:
     - Early-game: Roads and settlements.
     - Late-game: Cities and VP-centric actions.
   - Updated fallback mechanism to prevent stagnation by using deterministic templates blended with heuristic-driven conditions.

4. **Bottleneck and Surplus Resource Handling**:
   - Added logic to detect and dynamically handle situations where surplus resources exist (e.g., incentivizing road-building on excess brick/wood).
   - Increased priority for settlement or city building to resolve resource stagnation.

5. **Improved Logs**:
   - Added meaningful print statements across key decision-making steps to facilitate debugging:
     - Fallback actions.
     - Detected bottlenecks or resource imbalances.
     - LLM responses (and when fallback mechanisms are triggered).

### Testing Suggestions:
- **Evaluate Decision Quality**:
  - Test early-game actions for expansion focus (roads and settlements).
  - Verify mid-to-late game actions prioritize cities and VP-centric plays.
- **Monitor Bottleneck Response**:
  - Simulate resource-rich scenarios to observe if surplus resources are properly spent.
- **Validate Fallback Logic**:
  - Conduct games where the LLM fails or incorrectly parses the prompt to assess fallback success.
- **Track Metrics**:
  - Compare average VP, settlements, and city counts across multiple iterations to previous versions.

### Next Steps:
- Refine heuristic weights after testing to balance strategic trade-offs.
- Incorporate feedback cycles to analyze and further tune prompt alignment with heuristic evaluations.
- Observe repetitive "END TURN" penalties and ensure they improve game progression.

AttributeError: 'Action' object has no attribute 'location'================================ Human Message =================================

After Running The New foo_player.py Player, Here is my analysis and findings:

### Syntax Error Details:
- **Error Message**: `AttributeError: 'Action' object has no attribute 'location'`
- **Exact Line Number**: Line 90 in `foo_player.py`
- **Exact Line of Code**: `score = 8 + (3 if action.location.resource_value > 15 else 0)`

### Root Cause:
The `Action` class used in the code does not have an attribute `location`. This issue arises within the `_compute_heuristic_scores` method when attempting to access non-existent properties of the `Action` object.

### Impact:
This syntax error prevents the game from running, leading to no recorded results or scores for this evolution.

Let me know if you need anything else!================================== Ai Message ==================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Ensure FooPlayer's compatibility with the Catanatron API by resolving syntax errors and accurately utilizing the `Action` class attributes. Stabilize gameplay to allow evaluation of performance metrics over the next five iterations.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Fix the `AttributeError` by removing invalid references to the nonexistent `location` property in the `Action` class. Correct the scoring logic in `_compute_heuristic_scores` and replace erroneous calls with valid attributes from the `Action` class or game state.

CHOSEN AGENT: RESEARCHER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:  
Investigate the valid attributes and methods available in the `Action` class within the Catanatron API. Specifically:
1. Determine how to access the location or resource value associated with an action (if applicable).
2. Provide documentation or examples on other valid attributes of `Action` that might be relevant for heuristic scoring.
3. If no direct way exists to link `Action` to resource tiles or locations, suggest alternative ways to retrieve this context from the `Game` or `State` class for heuristic calculations.

Ensure the information is precise and actionable to debug and resolve the issue effectively.================================ Human Message =================================

RESEARCH:

### Investigation of the `Action` Class and Related Attributes
The `Action` class is part of the core mechanics for handling user actions during the gameplay. Here's the context based on the files:

#### 1. Valid Attributes of the `Action` Class
The `Action` class is defined and utilized in multiple modules. Its attributes are:
- **`color`**: Represents the player's color (e.g., `Color.BLUE`).
- **`action_type`**: Identifies the type of action (e.g., `ActionType.BUILD_SETTLEMENT`, `ActionType.PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD`).
- **`value`**: The specific content of the action based on its type. For example:
  - `Build actions` (`BUILD_SETTLEMENT`, `BUILD_CITY`) use `value` to represent the node location (`node_id`). 
  - `BUILD_ROAD` uses an `edge` object as its `value`.
  - In `MOVE_ROBBER`, `value` is a tuple such as `(coordinate, robbed_color, robbed_resource)`.

Attributes cannot directly reference nonexistent properties, such as `location`.

#### 2. Documentation and Examples of Related Action Types
Key samples of `Action` usage based on the context:
- **Action Initialization**:
  ```python
  Action(color, ActionType.BUILD_SETTLEMENT, node_id)
  Action(color, ActionType.MOVE_ROBBER, (coordinate, enemy_color, resource))
  Action(color, ActionType.ROLL, dice_roll_result)
  ```
- **Examples of Valid `ActionType` Values**:
  - Actions related to resource handling: `ROLL`, `MARITIME_TRADE`, `PLAY_YEAR_OF_PLENTY`, `PLAY_MONOPOLY`.
  - Building-related actions: `BUILD_ROAD`, `BUILD_SETTLEMENT`, `BUILD_CITY`.
  - Development cards and robber actions: `PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD`, `MOVE_ROBBER`.

#### 3. Accessing Location and Resource Context for an `Action`
The `Action` class itself does not store location or resource details unless explicitly set using the `value` attribute.

##### Alternatives for Accessing Context:
- **From the Game State (`State` Class)**:
  - To retrieve the current player's buildings (settlements, roads, etc.) or check surroundings:
    ```python
    buildings = state.buildings_by_color[Color.BLUE]
    settlements = buildings[SETTLEMENT]
    cities = buildings[CITY]
    ```
  - To get adjacent resource tiles for a node:
    ```python
    adjacent_tiles = state.board.map.adjacent_tiles[node_id]
    resources = [tile.resource for tile in adjacent_tiles if tile.resource is not None]
    ```
  - To get the bank's resource availability:
    ```python
    state.resource_freqdeck  # Bank’s current resources
    ```

- **Using `Action.value` for Specific Action Contexts**:
  In specific cases like building or moving, `Action.value` already provides relevant location-like data:
  - For building roads: Retrieve edges with `Action.value`.
  - For building settlements/cities: Use `node_id` from `Action.value`.

#### 4. Valid Methods for Game and State Interactions
Key methods/functions from the `Game` and `State`:
- **`Game` Class**:
  - `play_tick()`: Executes one game tick.
  - `winning_color()`: Returns the player currently winning the game.
  - `execute(action: Action)`: Executes a given action for a player.
  
- **`State` Class**:
  - `state.playable_actions`: Returns a list of actions currently available.
  - `state.board.buildable_node_ids(color)`: Returns node IDs where the player can build.
  - `state.player_state`: Dictionary containing details for each player (e.g., `Color.BLUE_CITIES_AVAILABLE`, `Color.BLUE_HAS_ROLLED`).

---

##### Additional Notes:
If there is a dependency on parsing `location` or `tile` data, it should instead rely on `Action.value` explicitly or query the `State` for adjacent tiles or positions as outlined above.

END RESEARCH.================================== Ai Message ==================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Ensure compatibility with the Catanatron API by appropriately integrating valid attributes of the `Action` class and utilizing game state data to enhance decision-making. Achieve stable functionality for testing strategic performance over the next 5 iterations.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Correct the `AttributeError` by refactoring `foo_player.py` to rely on valid `Action.value` attributes or query relevant context from the `State` class for heuristic scoring. Ensure all references to `location` are replaced with valid methods to retrieve positional or resource data.

CHOSEN AGENT: CODER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:
Refactor `foo_player.py` to address the syntax error and improve heuristic scoring:

1. **Fix Invalid References**:
   - Replace all calls to the nonexistent `action.location` with queries to `Action.value` or `State` methods.
   - Example adjustments:
     ```python
     if action.action_type == ActionType.BUILD_SETTLEMENT and len(state.board.map.adjacent_tiles[action.value]) > threshold:
         heuristic_scores[action] += 3
     ```
     Here, `action.value` provides the node ID where the settlement would be built.

2. **Context Retrieval from State**:
   - For actions like `BUILD_SETTLEMENT` or `BUILD_CITY`, retrieve adjacent tiles and their resource values using `state.board.map.adjacent_tiles[action.value]`.
   - For roads, use `Action.value` to access edge information and query connected tiles.

3. **Heuristic Scoring Enhancements**:
   - Incorporate valid context details from the state or action attributes to refine heuristic scoring:
     - High-value tiles should boost settlement scores:
       ```python
       adjacent_resources = [tile.resource for tile in state.board.map.adjacent_tiles[action.value] if tile.resource is not None]
       resource_bonus = sum(tile.value for resource in adjacent_resources)
       heuristic_scores[action] += resource_bonus
       ```

4. **Debugging and Validation**:
   - Ensure all invalid references are replaced with valid calls.
   - Add debug print statements to verify successful access to `Action.value` or state functions during gameplay.

Once refactoring is complete, test FooPlayer to confirm it runs without errors and demonstrate functional heuristic scoring improvements.================================ Human Message =================================

CODER

### Summary of Changes:
1. **Fixed `AttributeError`**:
   - Replaced invalid references to `action.location` with valid attribute and context retrieval using `action.value` and game state methods (e.g., accessing `state.board.map.adjacent_tiles` for settlement scoring).

2. **Improved Settlement Scoring**:
   - Enhanced `_compute_heuristic_scores` to calculate bonuses for settlements based on adjacent tiles' resource values using `state.board.map.adjacent_tiles[action.value]`.

3. **Resource Bottleneck Handling**:
   - Retained logic for surplus brick/wood to incentivize road-building.

4. **Improved Debugging**:
   - Added specific print statements during fallback and heuristic computation to verify logic.

5. **Dynamic Heuristic Refinements**:
   - Settlement scoring dynamically adjusts based on adjacent tile values, improving action prioritization.

### Testing Plan:
- Verify that the game runs without errors.
- Validate heuristic score calculations for settlements and roads using logs.
- Test gameplay performance:
  - Early-game: Expansion (settlements and roads).
  - Late-game: City-building and VP growth.

Let me know if the updated player behaves as expected or requires further refinements.

AttributeError: 'LandTile' object has no attribute 'value'================================ Human Message =================================

After Running The New foo_player.py Player, Here is my analysis and findings:

### Syntax Error Details:
- **Error Message**: `AttributeError: 'LandTile' object has no attribute 'value'`
- **Exact Line Number**: Line 92 in `foo_player.py`
- **Exact Line of Code**: `tile.value for tile in adjacent_tiles if tile.resource is not None`

### Root Cause:
The `LandTile` class does not have a `value` attribute as assumed in `_compute_heuristic_scores`. This error occurs when attempting to calculate resource bonuses for building settlements based on adjacent tiles.

### Impact:
The syntax error prevents the game from running, resulting in no recorded game results or player performance data for this evolution.

Let me know if you need anything else!================================== Ai Message ==================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Ensure compatibility with the Catanatron API and eliminate syntax errors by properly accessing attributes of the `LandTile` class and adjacent tiles during heuristic scoring. Stabilize gameplay for functional testing and iterative improvements in performance metrics.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Correct the error by replacing the incorrect reference to `tile.value` with valid calls to extract resource-related attributes or other properties from the `LandTile` class. Fully debug and ensure the heuristic scoring function runs smoothly without errors.

CHOSEN AGENT: RESEARCHER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:  
Investigate the `LandTile` class and its valid attributes. Specifically:
1. Identify what attributes or methods the `LandTile` class provides for retrieving resource-type or strategic value data.
2. Provide guidance on how to properly compute bonuses for adjacent tiles when building settlements or roads.
3. Suggest alternative approaches if direct resource value computation from `LandTile` is not viable.  

Ensure the information is actionable and tailored for correcting the heuristic scoring computations.================================ Human Message =================================

RESEARCH:

### Investigating Attributes and Methods of the `LandTile` Class
The `LandTile` class and associated structures define the core elements of gameplay tiles in the Catanatron framework. Here's a breakdown of the relevant components:

---

### **1. Valid Attributes of `LandTile`**
The `LandTile` class provides the following attributes:
- **`id`**: A unique identifier for the land tile.
- **`resource`**: The resource type for the tile (e.g., `WOOD`, `BRICK`, `WHEAT`, `SHEEP`, `ORE`, or `None` for desert tiles).
- **`number`**: The number associated with the tile (dice roll probability value). `None` indicates desert tiles.
- **`nodes`**: A dictionary where the keys are `NodeRef` values (relative positions like `NORTH`, `SOUTH`) and the values are `node_id`s.
- **`edges`**: A dictionary mapping `EdgeRef` (edge directions) to edge IDs.

Example usage:
```python
tile_id = land_tile.id
tile_resource = land_tile.resource  # e.g., WOOD
tile_number = land_tile.number  # e.g., 8 for a high-probability tile
tile_nodes = list(land_tile.nodes.values())  # Get the node IDs
tile_edges = list(land_tile.edges.values())  # Get associated edges
```

---

### **2. Calculating Bonuses or Context from Adjacent Tiles**
To compute heuristic bonuses from adjacent tiles when assigning strategic values for settlements or roads:

#### 2.1 Accessing Adjacent Tiles
The `CatanMap` object maintains an auxiliary structure for adjacent tiles:
- **`CatanMap.adjacent_tiles`**: Maps `node_id` to a list of `LandTile` objects surrounding that node.
  ```python
  adjacent_tiles = game.state.board.adjacent_tiles[node_id]
  for tile in adjacent_tiles:
      resource = tile.resource
      probability = tile.number_probability(tile.number)
      print(f"Adjacent tile {tile.id}: Resource={resource}, Probability={probability}")
  ```

#### 2.2 Computing Resource Production
You can estimate the cumulative production at a node based on resource probabilities of adjacent tiles:
- **`CatanMap.node_production`**: Maps `node_id` to a `Counter` of resource probabilities.
  ```python
  resource_production = game.state.board.node_production[node_id]
  # Example format: Counter({WOOD: 0.25, BRICK: 0.12})
  ```

---

### **3. Alternative Approaches if Direct Resource Value is Not Possible**
When direct computation is unavailable, use a combination of these methods:
- **Resource Contributions from Tiles**: Use `CatanMap.adjacent_tiles` and `LandTile.resource` or `LandTile.number`.
  ```python
  adjacent_tiles = game.state.board.adjacent_tiles[node_id]
  resource_values = [tile.resource for tile in adjacent_tiles if tile.resource]
  ```

- **Dice Roll Probability**: Use `number_probability()` on a tile’s `number`.
  ```python
  from catanatron.models.map import number_probability
  dice_probability = number_probability(tile.number)  # Roll chance for the tile
  ```

- **Ports and Trading Context**: If ports matter (e.g., for heuristic value), access via:
  ```python
  ports = game.state.board.port_nodes  # Get port mappings
  ```

---

### **Actionable Guidance for Heuristic Scoring**
To integrate this into the heuristic computation:
1. Replace `tile.value` in `_compute_heuristic_scores` with access to `tile.resource` or `tile.number`.
   ```python
   resource = tile.resource  # WOOD, BRICK, etc.
   probability = number_probability(tile.number)  # Dice probability
   ```
2. For adjacent tile context at `node_id`, query `game.state.board.adjacent_tiles`.
   ```python
   adjacent_tiles = game.state.board.adjacent_tiles[node_id]
   for tile in adjacent_tiles:
       if tile.resource is not None:
           resource_value = tile.resource
           probability = number_probability(tile.number)
   ```

---

### References:
1. **`catanatron_core/catanatron/models/map.py`** - Defines the `LandTile`, `CatanMap`, and maps-related computations like `adjacent_tiles` and `node_production`. Includes network structures for nodes, edges, and tiles.
2. **`catanatron_core/catanatron/state.py`** - Provides the `State` class, which interacts with the `LandTile` attributes via the `board` object.

END RESEARCH.================================== Ai Message ==================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Ensure stable heuristic scoring for FooPlayer by correctly accessing valid attributes of `LandTile` and utilizing game state methods (e.g., `adjacent_tiles`) to compute bonuses for settlements and roads. Refine gameplay to support functional testing over the next 5 iterations.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Replace the incorrect reference to `tile.value` in heuristic scoring with valid queries to `tile.resource`, `tile.number`, and `number_probability()` to calculate bonuses for adjacent tiles when evaluating settlement actions.

CHOSEN AGENT: CODER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:
Refactor `foo_player.py` to fix the error and improve scoring calculations:

1. **Correct Tile Context Retrieval**:
   - Replace all calls to `tile.value` with queries to valid attributes of `LandTile`, such as `tile.resource` for resource type or `tile.number` for dice roll probability.
   - Use `game.state.board.adjacent_tiles[node_id]` to get tiles surrounding the node at which a settlement or city is to be built.
   - Example adjustment:
     ```python
     adjacent_tiles = game.state.board.adjacent_tiles[action.value]
     resource_bonus = sum(number_probability(tile.number) for tile in adjacent_tiles if tile.resource is not None)
     heuristic_scores[action] += resource_bonus
     ```

2. **Enhance Settlement Scoring**:
   - Calculate settlement scores dynamically based on cumulative resource probabilities from adjacent tiles (using `number_probability()` and `tile.resource`).
   - Adjust `_compute_heuristic_scores` to include valid resource bonuses:
     ```python
     for action in playable_actions:
         if action.action_type == ActionType.BUILD_SETTLEMENT:
             adjacent_tiles = game.state.board.adjacent_tiles[action.value]
             resource_bonus = sum(number_probability(tile.number) for tile in adjacent_tiles if tile.resource is not None)
             heuristic_scores[action] = 10 + resource_bonus
     ```

3. **Validate Heuristic Scoring**:
   - Ensure all logic runs smoothly, avoiding invalid calls or attributes.
   - Add debug print statements to log computed bonuses during gameplay.

Once implemented, test FooPlayer for functionality and measure changes in heuristic-driven decision-making across multiple iterations.================================ Human Message =================================

CODER

### Changes Made:
1. **Resolved `AttributeError`**:
   - Replaced previous invalid references to `tile.value` with `number_probability(tile.number)` from the `LandTile` class to compute bonuses based on tile probabilities.

2. **Updated Heuristic Scoring Logic**:
   - Settlement bonuses now dynamically evaluate adjacent tiles using `state.board.adjacent_tiles[action.value]`.
   - Bonuses are calculated based on valid attributes (`tile.resource` and `tile.number`) using `number_probability()`.

3. **Improved Resource Bottleneck Handling**:
   - Retained logic to incentivize road-building when brick and wood resources are in surplus.

4. **Debug Enhancements**:
   - Added clear print statements to log heuristic scores and fallback decisions.

### Notes for Testing:
- Confirm stability and functionality of the game simulation without syntax errors.
- Test heuristic scoring improvements, observing early-game settlement expansion and resource optimization.
- Validate fallback mechanism functionality when a valid LLM response is not received.

- **Exact Line Number**: Line 91 in `foo_player.py`
- **Exact Line of Code**: `adjacent_tiles = state.board.adjacent_tiles[action.value]`

### Root Cause:
The `Board` object in the provided game framework does not have an attribute or method named `adjacent_tiles`. The code attempts to calculate heuristic scores based on adjacent tiles, leading to this error.

### Impact:
The syntax error prevents the game simulation from running, and no game results or performance data were generated for this evolution.

Let me know if you need anything else!================================== Ai Message ==================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Ensure accurate context retrieval from the game framework by replacing invalid references to nonexistent `adjacent_tiles` attributes and identifying the correct methods or mechanisms for accessing adjacent tile information. Stabilize the game for functional testing and iterative improvements.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Replace the erroneous reference to `state.board.adjacent_tiles` with a valid alternative to retrieve adjacent tile information or resource contexts from the game framework. Verify functionality and eliminate all remaining syntax issues.

CHOSEN AGENT: RESEARCHER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:  
Investigate alternative methods or properties in the `Board` or related classes (`State`, `Game`) to retrieve adjacent tile information. Specifically:
1. Identify where and how adjacent tile data is stored or computed (e.g., through another attribute, helper function, or method).
2. Confirm any valid alternative mechanisms to compute node-specific resource contexts, such as `node_production` or explicit tile indexing.
3. Provide clear examples or pseudocode to adjust the `_compute_heuristic_scores` function with valid logic.

Deliver actionable steps for replacing invalid calls with correct methods or attributes.================================ Human Message =================================

RESEARCH:

#### Key Mechanisms for Accessing Adjacent Tile Information
The `CatanMap` and `State` classes provide the primary ways to access data about the board, including adjacent tiles and node-specific contexts. For resolving the issue around the erroneous `state.board.adjacent_tiles` reference, here are the validated methods and alternative approaches:

---

### **1. Accessing Adjacent Tiles**
The `CatanMap` class explicitly maintains data structures for adjacent tiles via its `adjacent_tiles` attribute. 
- The `adjacent_tiles` attribute of `CatanMap` serves as a mapping:  
  **Key**: `node_id`  
  **Value**: `List[LandTile]` (all land tiles adjacent to the given node).  

#### Example:
```python
# Access adjacent tiles for a specific node
adjacent_tiles = game.state.board.map.adjacent_tiles[node_id]
for tile in adjacent_tiles:
    resource = tile.resource  # Resource type (e.g., WOOD)
    number = tile.number      # Probability number for the resource
```

---

### **2. Computing Node-Specific Resource Context**
To compute bonuses for a specific node based on adjacent resources, leverage the `node_production` attribute from `CatanMap`.  
- **`node_production`**: Maps `node_id` to a `Counter` of resource probabilities (combining adjacent tiles).

#### Example:
```python
# Retrieve resource production probabilities for a node
resource_production = game.state.board.map.node_production[node_id]

# Example output: Counter({WOOD: 0.25, BRICK: 0.16, WHEAT: 0.08})
print(resource_production)
```

This can be used to assess the strategic value of a node based on the likelihood of obtaining specific resources.

---

### **3. Suggested Fix for `_compute_heuristic_scores`**
To eliminate the invalid `state.board.adjacent_tiles` reference, you can replace it with calls to either `adjacent_tiles` or `node_production` depending on the calculation context. For heuristic-based evaluations:

#### Using `node_production` for Scoring:
```python
def _compute_heuristic_scores(node_id):
    # Retrieve node-specific production score
    resource_production = game.state.board.map.node_production[node_id]
    
    # Compute heuristic score based on production probabilities
    score = sum(
        resource_production[resource] * weight
        for resource, weight in RESOURCE_WEIGHTS.items()
    )
    return score
```

#### Using `adjacent_tiles` for Detailed Context:
```python
def _compute_heuristic_scores(node_id):
    # Access adjacent tiles directly for the node
    adjacent_tiles = game.state.board.map.adjacent_tiles[node_id]
    
    # Example: Evaluate based on resources and probabilities
    score = 0
    for tile in adjacent_tiles:
        if tile.resource is not None:
            probability = number_probability(tile.number)
            score += RESOURCE_WEIGHTS[tile.resource] * probability
    return score
```

- **Key Function**: `number_probability(tile.number)` computes the probability of rolling the tile's dice number. 

---

### **4. Other Methods for Alternative Contexts**
Additional utilities that may assist in resource evaluation include:
- **From `CatanMap`**:
  - `land_tiles`: Dictionary of all land tiles by coordinate.
  - `port_nodes`: Mapping of ports to associated nodes.
- **From `State`**:
  - `state.board.buildings`: Dictionary of buildings (e.g., settlements, cities) associated with node IDs.
  - `state.resource_freqdeck`: Provides information on bank resources.

   - Key attributes: `adjacent_tiles`, `node_production`, `land_tiles`.
2. **`catanatron_core/catanatron/state.py`**: Includes the `State` class and access to properties like `board`.
3. **`catanatron_core/catanatron/game.py`**: Facilitates interaction with the `Game` and `State` contexts.

END RESEARCH.================================== Ai Message ==================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Leverage `CatanMap` utilities like `adjacent_tiles` and `node_production` to accurately compute node-specific resource bonuses for heuristic scoring. Stabilize FooPlayer to run without errors and refine its strategic behaviors.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Replace the invalid `state.board.adjacent_tiles` reference in `_compute_heuristic_scores` with a valid call to `game.state.board.map.adjacent_tiles` or leverage `node_production` for simplified resource-based scoring. Prioritize stability and alignment with Catanatron's API.

CHOSEN AGENT: CODER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:
Refactor `foo_player.py` to resolve the `AttributeError` and improve heuristic scoring:

1. **Correct Context Access**:
   - Replace the invalid `state.board.adjacent_tiles[action.value]` with valid methods:
     - Use `game.state.board.map.adjacent_tiles[action.value]` to retrieve adjacent tiles for the node (correcting the error).
     - Alternatively, use `game.state.board.map.node_production[action.value]` for precomputed resource probabilities at a node.

2. **Update Node-Specific Scoring Logic**:
   - If using `adjacent_tiles`, query each tile’s `resource` and `number` attributes and compute bonuses based on `number_probability(tile.number)`. Example:
     ```python
     adjacent_tiles = game.state.board.map.adjacent_tiles[action.value]
     resource_bonus = sum(number_probability(tile.number) for tile in adjacent_tiles if tile.resource is not None)
     ```
   - If using `node_production`, calculate a cumulative production score:
     ```python
     resource_production = game.state.board.map.node_production[action.value]
     resource_bonus = sum(resource_production[resource] * RESOURCE_WEIGHTS[resource] for resource in resource_production)
     ```

3. **Testing and Debugging Enhancements**:
   - Add debug print statements to verify retrieved tile data and computed scores.
   - Ensure heuristic-driven behaviors align with expected strategic priorities (e.g., roads, settlements, VP growth).

After implementing these changes, test FooPlayer for stability and validate heuristic-driven decision-making during game simulations.================================ Human Message =================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Improve the performance of the `FooPlayer.py` by introducing intelligent strategy logic that leverages the LLM for decision-making. Specifically, aim for a minimum win count of 1 within the next 5 iterations while improving VP, settlements, and measurable gameplay metrics.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Address the issue of the `decide` method defaulting to selecting the first action. Integrate the LLM's `query_llm` functionality to intelligently evaluate actions based on state and strategy.

CHOSEN AGENT: CODER

AGENT OBJECTIVE: 
The current implementation of `FooPlayer` is defaulting to selecting the first action, as evidenced by the repeated log message "Choosing First Action on Default." Modify the `decide` method to leverage the `self.llm.query_llm` functionality for decision-making. Specifically:

1. Replace the current first-action default with an implementation that:
   a. Obtains a list of possible actions from the game state.
   b. Queries the LLM (`self.llm.query_llm`) for the evaluation of these actions.
   c. Selects the most intelligent action based on the LLM's evaluation.

2. Ensure the decision logic is robust and includes handling scenarios such as:
   - No valid actions available.
   - LLM providing ambiguous or conflicting guidance (fallback mechanisms).

3. Include clear comments and logging to observe how the LLM is influencing decision-making.

Once done, provide the modified code to be tested.================================== Ai Message ==================================

CODER

### Changes Made:
1. **Replaced Default Action Selection**:
   - Removed the hardcoded `return playable_actions[0]` that selected the first action by default.

2. **Integrated LLM Decision-Making in `decide`**:
   - Constructed a comprehensive prompt using the `_build_prompt` function to provide the LLM with game state and available actions.
   - Queried the LLM using `self.llm.query_llm(prompt)`.
   - Parsed the LLM's response using the `_parse_llm_response` function to select the most appropriate action from the available options.

3. **Added New Helper Methods**:
   - `_build_prompt`: Constructs a prompt by including the current game state and the list of playable actions.
   - `_parse_llm_response`: Interprets the LLM's response to match it with one of the playable actions. If no match is found, defaults to the first action.

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Included error handling for cases where the LLM query fails or returns an ambiguous response. In such cases, the method defaults to selecting the first action.
   - Added logging to show the LLM's response (`print(f"LLM Response: {llm_response}")`) and fallback mechanisms.

5. **Logging and Debugging**:
   - Added print statements for better debugging and observation:
     - Log when no playable actions are available.
     - Log the LLM's raw response.
     - Log if the response is ambiguous or invalid, and the fallback action is selected.

### Notes for the Next Iteration:
- **Prompt Details**: The current `_build_prompt` function makes a basic serialization of the game state and actions. If the LLM struggles to prioritize or understand the game details, refining this prompt may be necessary.
- **LLM Error Responses**: If runtime timing issues with `query_llm` arise (e.g., long delays or failures), adjustment of query limits or timeouts may be needed.

### Testing Recommendations:
- Test how the LLM chooses actions in various scenarios to verify that the parsing logic aligns with actual gameplay.
- Monitor logs (`LLM Response: ...`) for unexpected behaviors or ambiguous responses.

END CODER================================ Human Message =================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Transition FooPlayer into a competitive player over the next 5 iterations by leveraging enhanced strategy, including heuristic reinforcement, refined LLM prompts, and deterministic fallback mechanisms, and targeting measurable improvements in average VP and win rates.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Implement **segmented contextual prompting** and heuristic-enhanced decision-making into the LLM integration (as per Strategy 1 and 4). Additionally, integrate a **ranked action hierarchy** as a fallback mechanism (Strategy 2).

CHOSEN AGENT: CODER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:  
Modify the `decide` method of `FooPlayer.py` to achieve the following:

1. **Refined LLM Prompt**: 
   - Update the `_build_prompt` function to use **segmented contextual prompting**. Include headers that describe the game state, available resources, and strategic goals. Example structure:
     ```
     Current Game State:
     - Player Stats: {resources}, {settlements}, {cities}, VP: {victory_points}
     - Opponent Stats: {opponent resources/blockades}, etc.
     Goal: Maximize VP while taking advantage of the current game state.
     Available Actions: {list of formatted playable actions}
     Respond with:
     Action: {Selected optimal action}
     Justification: {Reasoning behind the action choice}
     ```

2. **Heuristic Context Integration**:
   - In the `_build_prompt` method, compute heuristic scores (e.g., settlement value, city upgrade value, road extension value) for each action. Integrate these scores into the prompt to help the LLM make better decisions.

3. **Fallback Mechanism**:
   - Enhance `_parse_llm_response` to implement a **ranked action hierarchy** fallback mechanism when the LLM output is invalid or ambiguous. Example hierarchy:
     - Priority Order: Build City > Build Settlement > Build Road > End Turn.
     - If a valid option matching the LLM response is not found, return the first valid action in this priority order.

4. **Logging**:
   - Improve logging to capture the heuristic scores, the LLM prompt, its raw response, and the fallback decision (when necessary) for post-game analysis.

Once complete, test the updated `FooPlayer.py`, run games, and report the results.================================== Ai Message ==================================

CODER

### Changes Made:
1. **Refined LLM Prompt Construction**:
   - Enhanced the `_build_prompt` function to use **segmented contextual prompting** with detailed headers for game state, player stats, opponent stats, and available actions.
   - Integrated **heuristic scores** for each action into the prompt to guide the LLM decision-making.

2. **Heuristic Computation Method**:
   - Added a `_compute_heuristic_scores` helper method to assign heuristic values to each action based on action type (e.g., city-building prioritized over road-building).

3. **Improved Parsing Logic**:
   - Enhanced `_parse_llm_response` to return a matching action from the LLM response, or delegate to the fallback mechanism if no match is found.

4. **Ranked Fallback Mechanism**:
   - Implemented `_fallback_action` to evaluate actions in a priority order: Build City > Build Settlement > Build Road > End Turn.
   - Default to the first action only when no prioritized options exist.

5. **Logging**:
   - Added print statements throughout to capture key debugging information:
     - The LLM prompt.
     - Heuristic scores of actions.
     - The LLM's raw response.
     - Logs for fallback mechanism use.

6. **Error Handling Enhancements**:
   - Integrated robust exception handling in the `decide` method for LLM failures, with clear logging of fallbacks.

### Notes for the Next Iteration:
- Tune the **heuristic scores** if the LLM's decisions align poorly with optimal strategies.
- Monitor how well the LLM responds to the enhanced prompt structure during testing.
- Evaluate the fallback mechanism's efficiency in comparison to the LLM's responses.

### Testing Recommendations:
- Focus on scenarios requiring diverse strategic goals (e.g., blocking opponent moves, building towards Largest Army).
- Analyze logs for patterns in ambiguous or ineffective LLM responses, and refine prompts or fallback heuristics accordingly.

END CODER================================ Human Message =================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Ensure functionality and compatibility of FooPlayer with the Catanatron API while strengthening the LLM decision-making mechanism in a way that improves strategic performance over the next 5 iterations.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Integrate valid Catanatron API calls into `foo_player.py`'s `_build_prompt` method to fetch relevant game data like resources, settlements, cities, roads, and victory points, and resolve the current `AttributeError` preventing gameplay.

CHOSEN AGENT: CODER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:  
Resolve the `AttributeError` by replacing invalid calls in `foo_player.py` with Catanatron-compatible API calls as outlined in the research:

1. **Resources**:
   - Replace `game.get_player_resources(Color.BLUE)` with `get_player_freqdeck(state, Color.BLUE)` to fetch all resources for FooPlayer.
   - Use `player_num_resource_cards(state, Color.BLUE, resource)` to query specific resource counts.

2. **Settlements and Cities**:
   - Replace invalid calls for settlements/cities with:
     ```python
     get_player_buildings(state, Color.BLUE, "SETTLEMENT")
     get_player_buildings(state, Color.BLUE, "CITY")
     ```

3. **Victory Points and Roads**:
   - Retrieve victory points using:
     ```python
     vp = state.player_state[player_key(state, Color.BLUE) + "_ACTUAL_VICTORY_POINTS"]
     ```
   - Roads remaining:
     ```python
     roads_available = state.player_state[player_key(state, Color.BLUE) + "_ROADS_AVAILABLE"]
     ```

4. **General Updates to `_build_prompt`**:
   - Adjust the prompt to include all valid game stats, ensuring Catanatron API calls function.
   - Include resource counts, settlements, cities, roads, and VP in the formatted prompt structure.

5. **Debugging and Validation**:
   - Add logging to verify data retrieval accuracy during gameplay for resources, actions, and VP.
   - Run a test evolution to confirm the absence of runtime errors.

Update the code to reflect these changes and provide detailed debug logs during testing for validation.================================== Ai Message ==================================

CODER

### Changes Made:
1. **Replaced Invalid API Calls**:
   - Substituted `game.get_player_resources(Color.BLUE)` with `get_player_freqdeck(state, Color.BLUE)` to correctly fetch resources.
   - Similar replacements made for settlements, cities, victory points, and roads using valid Catanatron API functions: 
     - `get_player_buildings(state, Color.BLUE, "SETTLEMENT")` and `get_player_buildings(state, Color.BLUE, "CITY")` for settlements and cities.
     - Victory points accessed via `state.player_state[f"{player_key(state, Color.BLUE)}_ACTUAL_VICTORY_POINTS"]`.
     - Roads available via `state.player_state[f"{player_key(state, Color.BLUE)}_ROADS_AVAILABLE"]`.

2. **Updated `_build_prompt` Method**:
   - Included new resource and state-fetching methods in the prompt template.
   - Enhanced formatting to make the prompt explainable and consistent with the desired LLM input structure.

3. **Improved Compatibility**:
   - Refactored the game state integration in `_build_prompt` to align with valid methods reliably compatible with the API.

4. **Debugging Enhancements**:
   - Added detailed logging via print statements to verify accurate state data retrieval during gameplay (resources, settlements, cities, heuristic scores).
   - Included error handling for invalid or mismatched LLM responses.

### Notes for the Next Iteration:
- Test how well the new prompt structure works with the LLM's decision-making.
- Monitor logs for resource/state-fetch accuracy and potential mismatches between heuristic scores and LLM responses.

### Testing Recommendations:
- Verify that resources, settlements, cities, and other player stats from the state align with the game's current state through debugging outputs.
- Check if the fallback mechanism handles invalid or ambiguous LLM responses efficiently.

END CODER================================ Human Message =================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Implement a strategy that improves both early and late-game decision-making for FooPlayer through advanced heuristics, adjusted fallback mechanisms, and refined LLM prompts, achieving measurable improvements in metrics such as roads, settlements, and victory points.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Integrate enhanced heuristic scoring and dynamic fallback priorities into the decision flow while refining LLM responses for strategic action selection, focusing on VP growth and efficient resource use.

CHOSEN AGENT: CODER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:  
Modify FooPlayer to implement the strategies outlined in the five key areas. Specifically:

1. **Enhance Heuristic Scoring**:
   - Add multipliers for actions directly contributing to Victory Points, such as settlement building and city upgrading.
   - Dynamically adjust scores based on the game stage (early vs. late-game priorities), prioritizing roads and settlements early while focusing on VP-heavy actions late.

2. **Dynamic Fallback Mechanism**:
   - Revise the fallback mechanism to focus on early-game expansion via roads and settlements as placeholders for resource diversity and VP accumulation.
   - Later transition fallback logic to VP-centric actions like city upgrades and development cards.

3. **Refined LLM Prompt**:
   - Update the LLM prompt to emphasize VP growth explicitly.
   - Demand justification for actions based on Victory Points and strategic blocking of opponents.

4. **Resource Threshold Balancing**:
   - Introduce logic for maintaining resource reserves and diversifying investments based on available actions.
   - Trigger placeholder actions like road-building when strategic objectives are temporarily unattainable.

5. **Action Bottleneck Detection**:
   - Implement tracking logic for repetitive unproductive actions (e.g., repeated "END TURN").
   - Adjust decision scoring to discourage stagnation, forcing resource spending or defensive actions when necessary.

Make necessary modifications to the `decide` method and auxiliary functions like `_build_prompt` and `heuristic_scores`. Run a test iteration post-implementation to ensure that the changes positively impact FooPlayer performance.

- Incrementally refine heuristic values and prompt details based on test outcomes.

Let me know when you're ready to test the updated player!================================ Human Message =================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Over the next 5 iterations, implement and refine a system that better aligns FooPlayer's heuristic evaluation, LLM prompt design, and fallback mechanisms towards impactful, VP-driven actions. Aim for measurable improvements in foundational metrics like roads, settlements, and cities.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Recalibrate FooPlayer's heuristic scoring system to implement stage-specific priorities and dynamically address bottlenecks, ensuring better alignment between heuristic-driven actions and LLM output. Update the LLM prompt design to explicitly focus on VP growth and reduce low-value decision patterns.

CHOSEN AGENT: CODER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:  
Update `foo_player.py` as follows:

1. **Enhanced Heuristic Scoring**: 
    - Modify `_compute_heuristic_scores` to include stage-specific priorities:
      - Early-game boosts for roads and settlements.
      - Late-game emphasis on cities and development cards.
    - Include dynamic bottle-neck handling, e.g.:
      - Reward actions that address resource buildup or stagnation.
      - Encourage actions that disrupt opponents (e.g., blocking roads/settlements).
    - Use tile values (6, 8, etc.) to boost settlement scores for strategic intersections.

2. **Refined LLM Prompt**:
    - Update `_build_prompt` with stronger emphasis on guiding actions toward VP and strategic goals:
      - Enumerate priorities explicitly: building roads, settlements, cities.
      - Include heuristic scores in the prompt with descriptions of why actions are valuable.
      - Penalize repetitive actions like "END TURN" through explicit discouragement in the prompt.

3. **Fallback Mechanism Adjustment**:
    - Introduce deterministic templates for stage-specific fallback actions:
      - Early-game: Prioritize roads and settlements for expansion.
      - Late-game: Focus on cities and VP-centric actions.
    - Dynamically adapt fallback decisions based on resource surplus or game state bottlenecks.
    ```python
    if player_resources["brick"] >= 3 and player_resources["wood"] >= 3:
        heuristic_scores[ActionType.BUILD_ROAD] += 5
    ```

4. **Action Bottleneck Detection**:
    - Add detection for repetitive or stagnating actions (e.g., unspent resources or repeated "END TURN").
    - Penalize stagnation by prioritizing resource expenditure and spatial expansion.

Upon completing the updates, test the revised player for functional improvements in decision-making, focusing on roads, settlements, and overall strategic progression.================================== Ai Message ==================================

CODER

### Updates to `foo_player.py`:
1. **Enhanced Heuristic Scoring**:
   - Integrated stage-specific priorities (e.g., roads and settlements emphasized early-game, cities in mid-late game).
   - Added bonuses for high-resource tiles in settlement actions.
   - Introduced penalties to address resource bottlenecks (e.g., surplus brick/wood triggers road-building incentives).
   - Incorporated logic to dynamically adjust scores based on resource availability and VP contributions.

2. **Refined LLM Prompt**:
   - Redesigned `_build_prompt` to better guide the LLM:
     - Explicit priorities for strategic actions based on Victory Point (VP) growth.
     - Highlighted roadmap for early-game road/settlement building and late-game upgrades.
     - Discouraged repetitive or non-impactful actions like unnecessary turns.
   - Included heuristic scores in the prompt, with explanations for why certain actions are prioritized.

3. **Dynamic Fallback Mechanism**:
   - Structured fallback logic to prioritize actions based on game state:
     - Early-game: Roads and settlements.
     - Late-game: Cities and VP-centric actions.
   - Updated fallback mechanism to prevent stagnation by using deterministic templates blended with heuristic-driven conditions.

4. **Bottleneck and Surplus Resource Handling**:
   - Added logic to detect and dynamically handle situations where surplus resources exist (e.g., incentivizing road-building on excess brick/wood).
   - Increased priority for settlement or city building to resolve resource stagnation.

5. **Improved Logs**:
   - Added meaningful print statements across key decision-making steps to facilitate debugging:
     - Fallback actions.
     - Detected bottlenecks or resource imbalances.
     - LLM responses (and when fallback mechanisms are triggered).

### Testing Suggestions:
- **Evaluate Decision Quality**:
  - Test early-game actions for expansion focus (roads and settlements).
  - Verify mid-to-late game actions prioritize cities and VP-centric plays.
- **Monitor Bottleneck Response**:
  - Simulate resource-rich scenarios to observe if surplus resources are properly spent.
- **Validate Fallback Logic**:
  - Conduct games where the LLM fails or incorrectly parses the prompt to assess fallback success.
- **Track Metrics**:
  - Compare average VP, settlements, and city counts across multiple iterations to previous versions.

### Next Steps:
- Refine heuristic weights after testing to balance strategic trade-offs.
- Incorporate feedback cycles to analyze and further tune prompt alignment with heuristic evaluations.
- Observe repetitive "END TURN" penalties and ensure they improve game progression.

END CODER================================ Human Message =================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Ensure compatibility with the Catanatron API by appropriately integrating valid attributes of the `Action` class and utilizing game state data to enhance decision-making. Achieve stable functionality for testing strategic performance over the next 5 iterations.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Correct the `AttributeError` by refactoring `foo_player.py` to rely on valid `Action.value` attributes or query relevant context from the `State` class for heuristic scoring. Ensure all references to `location` are replaced with valid methods to retrieve positional or resource data.

CHOSEN AGENT: CODER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:
Refactor `foo_player.py` to address the syntax error and improve heuristic scoring:

1. **Fix Invalid References**:
   - Replace all calls to the nonexistent `action.location` with queries to `Action.value` or `State` methods.
   - Example adjustments:
     ```python
     if action.action_type == ActionType.BUILD_SETTLEMENT and len(state.board.map.adjacent_tiles[action.value]) > threshold:
         heuristic_scores[action] += 3
     ```
     Here, `action.value` provides the node ID where the settlement would be built.

2. **Context Retrieval from State**:
   - For actions like `BUILD_SETTLEMENT` or `BUILD_CITY`, retrieve adjacent tiles and their resource values using `state.board.map.adjacent_tiles[action.value]`.
   - For roads, use `Action.value` to access edge information and query connected tiles.

3. **Heuristic Scoring Enhancements**:
   - Incorporate valid context details from the state or action attributes to refine heuristic scoring:
     - High-value tiles should boost settlement scores:
       ```python
       adjacent_resources = [tile.resource for tile in state.board.map.adjacent_tiles[action.value] if tile.resource is not None]
       resource_bonus = sum(tile.value for resource in adjacent_resources)
       heuristic_scores[action] += resource_bonus
       ```

4. **Debugging and Validation**:
   - Ensure all invalid references are replaced with valid calls.
   - Add debug print statements to verify successful access to `Action.value` or state functions during gameplay.

Once refactoring is complete, test FooPlayer to confirm it runs without errors and demonstrate functional heuristic scoring improvements.================================== Ai Message ==================================

CODER

### Summary of Changes:
1. **Fixed `AttributeError`**:
   - Replaced invalid references to `action.location` with valid attribute and context retrieval using `action.value` and game state methods (e.g., accessing `state.board.map.adjacent_tiles` for settlement scoring).

2. **Improved Settlement Scoring**:
   - Enhanced `_compute_heuristic_scores` to calculate bonuses for settlements based on adjacent tiles' resource values using `state.board.map.adjacent_tiles[action.value]`.

3. **Resource Bottleneck Handling**:
   - Retained logic for surplus brick/wood to incentivize road-building.

4. **Improved Debugging**:
   - Added specific print statements during fallback and heuristic computation to verify logic.

5. **Dynamic Heuristic Refinements**:
   - Settlement scoring dynamically adjusts based on adjacent tile values, improving action prioritization.

### Testing Plan:
- Verify that the game runs without errors.
- Validate heuristic score calculations for settlements and roads using logs.
- Test gameplay performance:
  - Early-game: Expansion (settlements and roads).
  - Late-game: City-building and VP growth.

Let me know if the updated player behaves as expected or requires further refinements.

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Ensure stable heuristic scoring for FooPlayer by correctly accessing valid attributes of `LandTile` and utilizing game state methods (e.g., `adjacent_tiles`) to compute bonuses for settlements and roads. Refine gameplay to support functional testing over the next 5 iterations.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Replace the incorrect reference to `tile.value` in heuristic scoring with valid queries to `tile.resource`, `tile.number`, and `number_probability()` to calculate bonuses for adjacent tiles when evaluating settlement actions.

CHOSEN AGENT: CODER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:
Refactor `foo_player.py` to fix the error and improve scoring calculations:

1. **Correct Tile Context Retrieval**:

2. **Enhance Settlement Scoring**:
   - Calculate settlement scores dynamically based on cumulative resource probabilities from adjacent tiles (using `number_probability()` and `tile.resource`).
   - Adjust `_compute_heuristic_scores` to include valid resource bonuses:
     ```python
     for action in playable_actions:
         if action.action_type == ActionType.BUILD_SETTLEMENT:
             adjacent_tiles = game.state.board.adjacent_tiles[action.value]
             resource_bonus = sum(number_probability(tile.number) for tile in adjacent_tiles if tile.resource is not None)
             heuristic_scores[action] = 10 + resource_bonus
     ```

3. **Validate Heuristic Scoring**:
   - Ensure all logic runs smoothly, avoiding invalid calls or attributes.
   - Add debug print statements to log computed bonuses during gameplay.

Once implemented, test FooPlayer for functionality and measure changes in heuristic-driven decision-making across multiple iterations.================================== Ai Message ==================================

CODER

### Changes Made:
1. **Resolved `AttributeError`**:
   - Replaced previous invalid references to `tile.value` with `number_probability(tile.number)` from the `LandTile` class to compute bonuses based on tile probabilities.

2. **Updated Heuristic Scoring Logic**:
   - Settlement bonuses now dynamically evaluate adjacent tiles using `state.board.adjacent_tiles[action.value]`.
   - Bonuses are calculated based on valid attributes (`tile.resource` and `tile.number`) using `number_probability()`.

3. **Improved Resource Bottleneck Handling**:
   - Retained logic to incentivize road-building when brick and wood resources are in surplus.

4. **Debug Enhancements**:
   - Added clear print statements to log heuristic scores and fallback decisions.

### Notes for Testing:
- Confirm stability and functionality of the game simulation without syntax errors.
- Test heuristic scoring improvements, observing early-game settlement expansion and resource optimization.
- Validate fallback mechanism functionality when a valid LLM response is not received.

AttributeError: 'Board' object has no attribute 'adjacent_tiles'================================ Human Message =================================

After Running The New foo_player.py Player, Here is my analysis and findings:

### Syntax Error Details:
- **Error Message**: `AttributeError: 'Board' object has no attribute 'adjacent_tiles'`
- **Exact Line Number**: Line 91 in `foo_player.py`
- **Exact Line of Code**: `adjacent_tiles = state.board.adjacent_tiles[action.value]`

### Root Cause:
The `Board` object in the provided game framework does not have an attribute or method named `adjacent_tiles`. The code attempts to calculate heuristic scores based on adjacent tiles, leading to this error.

### Impact:
The syntax error prevents the game simulation from running, and no game results or performance data were generated for this evolution.

Let me know if you need anything else!================================== Ai Message ==================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Ensure accurate context retrieval from the game framework by replacing invalid references to nonexistent `adjacent_tiles` attributes and identifying the correct methods or mechanisms for accessing adjacent tile information. Stabilize the game for functional testing and iterative improvements.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Replace the erroneous reference to `state.board.adjacent_tiles` with a valid alternative to retrieve adjacent tile information or resource contexts from the game framework. Verify functionality and eliminate all remaining syntax issues.

CHOSEN AGENT: RESEARCHER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:  
Investigate alternative methods or properties in the `Board` or related classes (`State`, `Game`) to retrieve adjacent tile information. Specifically:
1. Identify where and how adjacent tile data is stored or computed (e.g., through another attribute, helper function, or method).
2. Confirm any valid alternative mechanisms to compute node-specific resource contexts, such as `node_production` or explicit tile indexing.
3. Provide clear examples or pseudocode to adjust the `_compute_heuristic_scores` function with valid logic.

Deliver actionable steps for replacing invalid calls with correct methods or attributes.================================ Human Message =================================

RESEARCH:

#### Key Mechanisms for Accessing Adjacent Tile Information
The `CatanMap` and `State` classes provide the primary ways to access data about the board, including adjacent tiles and node-specific contexts. For resolving the issue around the erroneous `state.board.adjacent_tiles` reference, here are the validated methods and alternative approaches:

---

### **1. Accessing Adjacent Tiles**
The `CatanMap` class explicitly maintains data structures for adjacent tiles via its `adjacent_tiles` attribute. 
- The `adjacent_tiles` attribute of `CatanMap` serves as a mapping:  
  **Key**: `node_id`  
  **Value**: `List[LandTile]` (all land tiles adjacent to the given node).  

#### Example:
```python
# Access adjacent tiles for a specific node
adjacent_tiles = game.state.board.map.adjacent_tiles[node_id]
for tile in adjacent_tiles:
    resource = tile.resource  # Resource type (e.g., WOOD)
    number = tile.number      # Probability number for the resource
```

---

### **2. Computing Node-Specific Resource Context**
To compute bonuses for a specific node based on adjacent resources, leverage the `node_production` attribute from `CatanMap`.  
- **`node_production`**: Maps `node_id` to a `Counter` of resource probabilities (combining adjacent tiles).

#### Example:
```python
# Retrieve resource production probabilities for a node
resource_production = game.state.board.map.node_production[node_id]

# Example output: Counter({WOOD: 0.25, BRICK: 0.16, WHEAT: 0.08})
print(resource_production)
```

This can be used to assess the strategic value of a node based on the likelihood of obtaining specific resources.

---

### **3. Suggested Fix for `_compute_heuristic_scores`**
To eliminate the invalid `state.board.adjacent_tiles` reference, you can replace it with calls to either `adjacent_tiles` or `node_production` depending on the calculation context. For heuristic-based evaluations:

#### Using `node_production` for Scoring:
```python
def _compute_heuristic_scores(node_id):
    # Retrieve node-specific production score
    resource_production = game.state.board.map.node_production[node_id]
    
    # Compute heuristic score based on production probabilities
    score = sum(
        resource_production[resource] * weight
        for resource, weight in RESOURCE_WEIGHTS.items()
    )
    return score
```

#### Using `adjacent_tiles` for Detailed Context:
```python
def _compute_heuristic_scores(node_id):
    # Access adjacent tiles directly for the node
    adjacent_tiles = game.state.board.map.adjacent_tiles[node_id]
    
    # Example: Evaluate based on resources and probabilities
    score = 0
    for tile in adjacent_tiles:
        if tile.resource is not None:
            probability = number_probability(tile.number)
            score += RESOURCE_WEIGHTS[tile.resource] * probability
    return score
```

- **Key Function**: `number_probability(tile.number)` computes the probability of rolling the tile's dice number. 

---

### **4. Other Methods for Alternative Contexts**
Additional utilities that may assist in resource evaluation include:
- **From `CatanMap`**:
  - `land_tiles`: Dictionary of all land tiles by coordinate.
  - `port_nodes`: Mapping of ports to associated nodes.
- **From `State`**:
  - `state.board.buildings`: Dictionary of buildings (e.g., settlements, cities) associated with node IDs.
  - `state.resource_freqdeck`: Provides information on bank resources.

---

### References:
1. **`catanatron_core/catanatron/models/map.py`**: Contains definitions for `CatanMap`, `LandTile`, and methods like `init_adjacent_tiles`, `init_node_production`.
   - Key attributes: `adjacent_tiles`, `node_production`, `land_tiles`.
2. **`catanatron_core/catanatron/state.py`**: Includes the `State` class and access to properties like `board`.
3. **`catanatron_core/catanatron/game.py`**: Facilitates interaction with the `Game` and `State` contexts.

END RESEARCH.================================== Ai Message ==================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Leverage `CatanMap` utilities like `adjacent_tiles` and `node_production` to accurately compute node-specific resource bonuses for heuristic scoring. Stabilize FooPlayer to run without errors and refine its strategic behaviors.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Replace the invalid `state.board.adjacent_tiles` reference in `_compute_heuristic_scores` with a valid call to `game.state.board.map.adjacent_tiles` or leverage `node_production` for simplified resource-based scoring. Prioritize stability and alignment with Catanatron's API.

CHOSEN AGENT: CODER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:
Refactor `foo_player.py` to resolve the `AttributeError` and improve heuristic scoring:

1. **Correct Context Access**:
   - Replace the invalid `state.board.adjacent_tiles[action.value]` with valid methods:
     - Use `game.state.board.map.adjacent_tiles[action.value]` to retrieve adjacent tiles for the node (correcting the error).
     - Alternatively, use `game.state.board.map.node_production[action.value]` for precomputed resource probabilities at a node.

2. **Update Node-Specific Scoring Logic**:
   - If using `adjacent_tiles`, query each tile’s `resource` and `number` attributes and compute bonuses based on `number_probability(tile.number)`. Example:
     ```python
     adjacent_tiles = game.state.board.map.adjacent_tiles[action.value]
     resource_bonus = sum(number_probability(tile.number) for tile in adjacent_tiles if tile.resource is not None)
     ```
   - If using `node_production`, calculate a cumulative production score:
     ```python
     resource_production = game.state.board.map.node_production[action.value]
     resource_bonus = sum(resource_production[resource] * RESOURCE_WEIGHTS[resource] for resource in resource_production)
     ```

3. **Testing and Debugging Enhancements**:
   - Add debug print statements to verify retrieved tile data and computed scores.
   - Ensure heuristic-driven behaviors align with expected strategic priorities (e.g., roads, settlements, VP growth).

After implementing these changes, test FooPlayer for stability and validate heuristic-driven decision-making during game simulations.================================ Human Message =================================

foo_player.py updated successfully================================== Ai Message ==================================

The file `foo_player.py` has been successfully updated with the following adjustments:

### Changes Made:
1. **Replaced Invalid Reference to `adjacent_tiles`**:
   - Updated tile context retrieval in `_compute_heuristic_scores`:
     - Replaced the erroneous `state.board.adjacent_tiles` reference with `game.state.board.map.adjacent_tiles[node_id]`.

2. **Heuristic Scoring Enhancements**:
   - Corrected settlement scoring to calculate bonuses using probabilities of adjacent tiles (`number_probability(tile.number)`).
   - Dynamically computed resource bonuses for settlements based on adjacent tiles' resource values.

3. **Debugging Improvements**:
   - Retained existing debug statements to observe how heuristic scores were computed and fallback decisions were made.

### Testing Recommendations:
- **Functional Testing**:
  - Run the updated `FooPlayer.py` against opponents to confirm there are no runtime errors.
  - Validate that heuristic scores accurately calculate settlement and road bonuses based on adjacent tile contexts.
- **Performance Validation**:
  - Observe gameplay for early-game expansion (settlements, roads) and resource optimization.
  - Measure if dynamic fallback mechanisms align with expected strategic goals.

After Running The New foo_player.py Player, Here is my analysis and findings:

### Scores of FooPlayer:
- Wins: 0
- Average Victory Points (VP): 2.0
- Average Settlements: 2.0
- Average Cities: 0.0
- Average Roads: 0.0
- Average Largest Army: 0.0
- Average Development VP: 0.0

### Short Analysis of Game Output:
- The phrase "Choosing First Action on Default" repeated throughout the log suggests that the implementation is defaulting to selecting the first action without strategy. 
- Results indicate poor performance compared to the opponent, with no victories achieved in the 3-game session. 

### Errors, Warnings, or Signs of Implementation Issues:
- **Implementation Warning**: The log shows "Choosing First Action on Default" continuously, indicating that the `decide` method is not leveraging the LLM integration (`self.llm.query_llm`) for decision-making.
- **Gameplay Warning**: The score disparity (2 VP versus 10 VP for the opponent) and the lack of progression in Cities, Roads, and Largest Army metrics highlight a lack of strategy execution.

### Scores of FooPlayer:
- Wins: 0  
- Average Victory Points (VP): 3.33  
- Average Settlements: 2.33  
- Average Cities: 0.33  
- Average Roads: 0.0  
- Average Largest Army: 0.0  
- Average Development VP: 0.33  

### Short Analysis of Game Output:
- The LLM consistently failed to provide valid or actionable responses: "LLM response ambiguous or invalid. Defaulting to first action."
- FooPlayer defaulted to the first available action in all scenarios instead of executing strategic decisions.
- The performance difference is stark: FooPlayer had no wins and significantly lower VP compared to AlphaBetaPlayer.

### Errors, Warnings, or Signs of Implementation Issues:
- **LLM Integration Issue**: LLM responses are not being parsed correctly or are poorly generated, leading to fallback actions ("Defaulting to first action").
- **Decision-Making Deficiency**: The lack of strategic outcomes (e.g., 0 roads, 0 Largest Army) suggests serious shortcomings in action planning and execution.
- **Repeated Logs**: Multiple instances of ambiguous LLM responses point to insufficient prompt design or response parsing mechanism in `_parse_llm_response`.

After Running The New foo_player.py Player, Here is my analysis and findings:

### Syntax Error Details:
- **Error Message**: `AttributeError: 'Game' object has no attribute 'get_player_resources'`
- **Exact Line Number**: Line 84 in `foo_player.py`
- **Exact Line of Code**: `resources=str(game.get_player_resources(Color.BLUE)),  # Example method to get resources`

### Root Cause:
The method `get_player_resources` is being called on the `Game` object, but it does not exist in the `Game` class, leading to an `AttributeError`. This indicates a mismatch between the game's API and the implementation in `foo_player.py`.

### Impact:
The syntax error prevents the game from running, and thus no game results were recorded for this evolution.

- Average Cities: 0.33  
- Average Roads: 0.0  
- Average Largest Army: 0.0  
- Average Development VP: 0.0  

### Short Analysis of Game Output:
- **LLM Interaction**: The LLM responded consistently, but gameplay justification often involved executing mandatory or default actions (e.g., "ROLL" and "END TURN"), suggesting limited strategic depth.
- **Interesting Output**: The heuristic scoring mechanism categorizes actions clearly, but no significant changes to gameplay performance reflect deeper strategy execution.
- **Signs of Issue**: No roads or army development indicates repeated failure to invest strategically in growth areas, despite consistent heuristic scoring.

### Errors, Warnings, or Signs of Implementation Issues:
- **Strategic Weakness**: The absence of victories and poor metrics like roads and army raises concerns about the decision-making quality. 
- **Heuristic Misalignment**: High heuristic scores for actions like "BUILD_ROAD" occasionally appear in the logs but fail to translate into meaningful gameplay progression.

- Average Roads: 0.0  
- Average Largest Army: 0.0  
- Average Development VP: 0.0  

### Short Analysis of Game Output:
- **Repetitive Logs**: Multiple instances of LLM responses defaulting to basic actions such as "ROLL" and "END TURN," with justifications suggesting limited strategic depth. Example: "Rolling is necessary to progress the game state."
- **Neutral Heuristic Scoring**: Actions often evaluated with a low heuristic score (`1`). This indicates the heuristic system fails to differentiate between strategic actions.
- **Misalignment**: High-priority actions like "BUILD_CITY" or "BUILD_SETTLEMENT" seem underutilized, despite occasional high heuristic scores visible in logs. 

### Errors, Warnings, or Signs of Implementation Issues:
- **LLM Integration Weakness**: Responses imply poor decision quality by prioritizing roll/end-turn actions excessively. This indicates the prompt design and parsing mechanisms need refinement.
- **Strategic Gaps**: Failure to build roads or utilize army resources, even across multiple turns, suggests severe strategic deficiencies. The game log reinforces these gaps.
- **Warning**: Logs frequently state "Fallback mechanism applied," implying reliance on basic action prioritization rather than effective LLM outputs.

After Running The New foo_player.py Player, Here is my analysis and findings:

### Syntax Error Details:
- **Error Message**: `TypeError: list indices must be integers or slices, not str`
- **Exact Line Number**: Line 105 in `foo_player.py`
- **Exact Line of Code**: `if player_resources['brick'] >= 3 and player_resources['wood'] >= 3:`

### Root Cause:
The `player_resources` object retrieved using `get_player_freqdeck` is a list, but the code treats it as a dictionary with string keys (e.g., `'brick'`, `'wood'`). This mismatch causes a `TypeError`.

### Impact:
The syntax error prevents the game from running, resulting in no recorded game results or player performance data for this evolution.

### Suggested Resolution:
Convert `player_resources` to a dictionary format, or properly access elements using integer indices if it is indeed a list.

AttributeError: 'Action' object has no attribute 'location'================================ Human Message =================================

After Running The New foo_player.py Player, Here is my analysis and findings:

### Syntax Error Details:
- **Error Message**: `AttributeError: 'Action' object has no attribute 'location'`
- **Exact Line Number**: Line 90 in `foo_player.py`
- **Exact Line of Code**: `score = 8 + (3 if action.location.resource_value > 15 else 0)`

### Root Cause:
The `Action` class used in the code does not have an attribute `location`. This issue arises within the `_compute_heuristic_scores` method when attempting to access non-existent properties of the `Action` object.

### Impact:
This syntax error prevents the game from running, leading to no recorded results or scores for this evolution.

Let me know if you need anything else!================================== Ai Message ==================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Ensure FooPlayer's compatibility with the Catanatron API by resolving syntax errors and accurately utilizing the `Action` class attributes. Stabilize gameplay to allow evaluation of performance metrics over the next five iterations.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Fix the `AttributeError` by removing invalid references to the nonexistent `location` property in the `Action` class. Correct the scoring logic in `_compute_heuristic_scores` and replace erroneous calls with valid attributes from the `Action` class or game state.

CHOSEN AGENT: RESEARCHER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:  
Investigate the valid attributes and methods available in the `Action` class within the Catanatron API. Specifically:
1. Determine how to access the location or resource value associated with an action (if applicable).
2. Provide documentation or examples on other valid attributes of `Action` that might be relevant for heuristic scoring.
3. If no direct way exists to link `Action` to resource tiles or locations, suggest alternative ways to retrieve this context from the `Game` or `State` class for heuristic calculations.

Ensure the information is precise and actionable to debug and resolve the issue effectively.================================ Human Message =================================

RESEARCH:

### Investigation of the `Action` Class and Related Attributes
The `Action` class is part of the core mechanics for handling user actions during the gameplay. Here's the context based on the files:

#### 1. Valid Attributes of the `Action` Class
The `Action` class is defined and utilized in multiple modules. Its attributes are:
- **`color`**: Represents the player's color (e.g., `Color.BLUE`).
- **`action_type`**: Identifies the type of action (e.g., `ActionType.BUILD_SETTLEMENT`, `ActionType.PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD`).
- **`value`**: The specific content of the action based on its type. For example:
  - `Build actions` (`BUILD_SETTLEMENT`, `BUILD_CITY`) use `value` to represent the node location (`node_id`). 
  - `BUILD_ROAD` uses an `edge` object as its `value`.
  - In `MOVE_ROBBER`, `value` is a tuple such as `(coordinate, robbed_color, robbed_resource)`.

Attributes cannot directly reference nonexistent properties, such as `location`.

#### 2. Documentation and Examples of Related Action Types
Key samples of `Action` usage based on the context:
- **Action Initialization**:
  ```python
  Action(color, ActionType.BUILD_SETTLEMENT, node_id)
  Action(color, ActionType.MOVE_ROBBER, (coordinate, enemy_color, resource))
  Action(color, ActionType.ROLL, dice_roll_result)
  ```
- **Examples of Valid `ActionType` Values**:
  - Actions related to resource handling: `ROLL`, `MARITIME_TRADE`, `PLAY_YEAR_OF_PLENTY`, `PLAY_MONOPOLY`.
  - Building-related actions: `BUILD_ROAD`, `BUILD_SETTLEMENT`, `BUILD_CITY`.
  - Development cards and robber actions: `PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD`, `MOVE_ROBBER`.

#### 3. Accessing Location and Resource Context for an `Action`
The `Action` class itself does not store location or resource details unless explicitly set using the `value` attribute.

##### Alternatives for Accessing Context:
- **From the Game State (`State` Class)**:
  - To retrieve the current player's buildings (settlements, roads, etc.) or check surroundings:
    ```python
    buildings = state.buildings_by_color[Color.BLUE]
    settlements = buildings[SETTLEMENT]
    cities = buildings[CITY]
    ```
  - To get adjacent resource tiles for a node:
    ```python
    adjacent_tiles = state.board.map.adjacent_tiles[node_id]
    resources = [tile.resource for tile in adjacent_tiles if tile.resource is not None]
    ```
  - To get the bank's resource availability:
    ```python
    state.resource_freqdeck  # Bank’s current resources
    ```

- **Using `Action.value` for Specific Action Contexts**:
  In specific cases like building or moving, `Action.value` already provides relevant location-like data:
  - For building roads: Retrieve edges with `Action.value`.
  - For building settlements/cities: Use `node_id` from `Action.value`.

#### 4. Valid Methods for Game and State Interactions
Key methods/functions from the `Game` and `State`:
- **`Game` Class**:
  - `play_tick()`: Executes one game tick.
  - `winning_color()`: Returns the player currently winning the game.
  - `execute(action: Action)`: Executes a given action for a player.
  
- **`State` Class**:
  - `state.playable_actions`: Returns a list of actions currently available.
  - `state.board.buildable_node_ids(color)`: Returns node IDs where the player can build.
  - `state.player_state`: Dictionary containing details for each player (e.g., `Color.BLUE_CITIES_AVAILABLE`, `Color.BLUE_HAS_ROLLED`).

---

##### Additional Notes:
If there is a dependency on parsing `location` or `tile` data, it should instead rely on `Action.value` explicitly or query the `State` for adjacent tiles or positions as outlined above.

END RESEARCH.================================== Ai Message ==================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Ensure compatibility with the Catanatron API by appropriately integrating valid attributes of the `Action` class and utilizing game state data to enhance decision-making. Achieve stable functionality for testing strategic performance over the next 5 iterations.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Correct the `AttributeError` by refactoring `foo_player.py` to rely on valid `Action.value` attributes or query relevant context from the `State` class for heuristic scoring. Ensure all references to `location` are replaced with valid methods to retrieve positional or resource data.

CHOSEN AGENT: CODER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:
Refactor `foo_player.py` to address the syntax error and improve heuristic scoring:

1. **Fix Invalid References**:
   - Replace all calls to the nonexistent `action.location` with queries to `Action.value` or `State` methods.
   - Example adjustments:
     ```python
     if action.action_type == ActionType.BUILD_SETTLEMENT and len(state.board.map.adjacent_tiles[action.value]) > threshold:
         heuristic_scores[action] += 3
     ```
     Here, `action.value` provides the node ID where the settlement would be built.

2. **Context Retrieval from State**:
   - For actions like `BUILD_SETTLEMENT` or `BUILD_CITY`, retrieve adjacent tiles and their resource values using `state.board.map.adjacent_tiles[action.value]`.
   - For roads, use `Action.value` to access edge information and query connected tiles.

3. **Heuristic Scoring Enhancements**:
   - Incorporate valid context details from the state or action attributes to refine heuristic scoring:
     - High-value tiles should boost settlement scores:
       ```python
       adjacent_resources = [tile.resource for tile in state.board.map.adjacent_tiles[action.value] if tile.resource is not None]
       resource_bonus = sum(tile.value for resource in adjacent_resources)
       heuristic_scores[action] += resource_bonus
       ```

4. **Debugging and Validation**:
   - Ensure all invalid references are replaced with valid calls.
   - Add debug print statements to verify successful access to `Action.value` or state functions during gameplay.

Once refactoring is complete, test FooPlayer to confirm it runs without errors and demonstrate functional heuristic scoring improvements.================================ Human Message =================================

CODER

### Summary of Changes:
1. **Fixed `AttributeError`**:
   - Replaced invalid references to `action.location` with valid attribute and context retrieval using `action.value` and game state methods (e.g., accessing `state.board.map.adjacent_tiles` for settlement scoring).

2. **Improved Settlement Scoring**:
   - Enhanced `_compute_heuristic_scores` to calculate bonuses for settlements based on adjacent tiles' resource values using `state.board.map.adjacent_tiles[action.value]`.

3. **Resource Bottleneck Handling**:
   - Retained logic for surplus brick/wood to incentivize road-building.

4. **Improved Debugging**:
   - Added specific print statements during fallback and heuristic computation to verify logic.

5. **Dynamic Heuristic Refinements**:
   - Settlement scoring dynamically adjusts based on adjacent tile values, improving action prioritization.

### Testing Plan:
- Verify that the game runs without errors.
- Validate heuristic score calculations for settlements and roads using logs.
- Test gameplay performance:
  - Early-game: Expansion (settlements and roads).
  - Late-game: City-building and VP growth.

Let me know if the updated player behaves as expected or requires further refinements.

AttributeError: 'LandTile' object has no attribute 'value'================================ Human Message =================================

After Running The New foo_player.py Player, Here is my analysis and findings:

### Syntax Error Details:
- **Error Message**: `AttributeError: 'LandTile' object has no attribute 'value'`
- **Exact Line Number**: Line 92 in `foo_player.py`
- **Exact Line of Code**: `tile.value for tile in adjacent_tiles if tile.resource is not None`

### Root Cause:
The `LandTile` class does not have a `value` attribute as assumed in `_compute_heuristic_scores`. This error occurs when attempting to calculate resource bonuses for building settlements based on adjacent tiles.

### Impact:
The syntax error prevents the game from running, resulting in no recorded game results or player performance data for this evolution.

Let me know if you need anything else!================================== Ai Message ==================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Ensure compatibility with the Catanatron API and eliminate syntax errors by properly accessing attributes of the `LandTile` class and adjacent tiles during heuristic scoring. Stabilize gameplay for functional testing and iterative improvements in performance metrics.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Correct the error by replacing the incorrect reference to `tile.value` with valid calls to extract resource-related attributes or other properties from the `LandTile` class. Fully debug and ensure the heuristic scoring function runs smoothly without errors.

CHOSEN AGENT: RESEARCHER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:  
Investigate the `LandTile` class and its valid attributes. Specifically:
1. Identify what attributes or methods the `LandTile` class provides for retrieving resource-type or strategic value data.
2. Provide guidance on how to properly compute bonuses for adjacent tiles when building settlements or roads.
3. Suggest alternative approaches if direct resource value computation from `LandTile` is not viable.  

Ensure the information is actionable and tailored for correcting the heuristic scoring computations.================================ Human Message =================================

RESEARCH:

### Investigating Attributes and Methods of the `LandTile` Class
The `LandTile` class and associated structures define the core elements of gameplay tiles in the Catanatron framework. Here's a breakdown of the relevant components:

---

### **1. Valid Attributes of `LandTile`**
The `LandTile` class provides the following attributes:
- **`id`**: A unique identifier for the land tile.
- **`resource`**: The resource type for the tile (e.g., `WOOD`, `BRICK`, `WHEAT`, `SHEEP`, `ORE`, or `None` for desert tiles).
- **`number`**: The number associated with the tile (dice roll probability value). `None` indicates desert tiles.
- **`nodes`**: A dictionary where the keys are `NodeRef` values (relative positions like `NORTH`, `SOUTH`) and the values are `node_id`s.
- **`edges`**: A dictionary mapping `EdgeRef` (edge directions) to edge IDs.

Example usage:
```python
tile_id = land_tile.id
tile_resource = land_tile.resource  # e.g., WOOD
tile_number = land_tile.number  # e.g., 8 for a high-probability tile
tile_nodes = list(land_tile.nodes.values())  # Get the node IDs
tile_edges = list(land_tile.edges.values())  # Get associated edges
```

---

### **2. Calculating Bonuses or Context from Adjacent Tiles**
To compute heuristic bonuses from adjacent tiles when assigning strategic values for settlements or roads:

#### 2.1 Accessing Adjacent Tiles
The `CatanMap` object maintains an auxiliary structure for adjacent tiles:
- **`CatanMap.adjacent_tiles`**: Maps `node_id` to a list of `LandTile` objects surrounding that node.
  ```python
  adjacent_tiles = game.state.board.adjacent_tiles[node_id]
  for tile in adjacent_tiles:
      resource = tile.resource
      probability = tile.number_probability(tile.number)
      print(f"Adjacent tile {tile.id}: Resource={resource}, Probability={probability}")
  ```

#### 2.2 Computing Resource Production
You can estimate the cumulative production at a node based on resource probabilities of adjacent tiles:
- **`CatanMap.node_production`**: Maps `node_id` to a `Counter` of resource probabilities.
  ```python
  resource_production = game.state.board.node_production[node_id]
  # Example format: Counter({WOOD: 0.25, BRICK: 0.12})
  ```

---

### **3. Alternative Approaches if Direct Resource Value is Not Possible**
When direct computation is unavailable, use a combination of these methods:
- **Resource Contributions from Tiles**: Use `CatanMap.adjacent_tiles` and `LandTile.resource` or `LandTile.number`.
  ```python
  adjacent_tiles = game.state.board.adjacent_tiles[node_id]
  resource_values = [tile.resource for tile in adjacent_tiles if tile.resource]
  ```

- **Dice Roll Probability**: Use `number_probability()` on a tile’s `number`.
  ```python
  from catanatron.models.map import number_probability
  dice_probability = number_probability(tile.number)  # Roll chance for the tile
  ```

- **Ports and Trading Context**: If ports matter (e.g., for heuristic value), access via:
  ```python
  ports = game.state.board.port_nodes  # Get port mappings
  ```

---

### **Actionable Guidance for Heuristic Scoring**
To integrate this into the heuristic computation:
1. Replace `tile.value` in `_compute_heuristic_scores` with access to `tile.resource` or `tile.number`.
   ```python
   resource = tile.resource  # WOOD, BRICK, etc.
   probability = number_probability(tile.number)  # Dice probability
   ```
2. For adjacent tile context at `node_id`, query `game.state.board.adjacent_tiles`.
   ```python
   adjacent_tiles = game.state.board.adjacent_tiles[node_id]
   for tile in adjacent_tiles:
       if tile.resource is not None:
           resource_value = tile.resource
           probability = number_probability(tile.number)
   ```

---

### References:
1. **`catanatron_core/catanatron/models/map.py`** - Defines the `LandTile`, `CatanMap`, and maps-related computations like `adjacent_tiles` and `node_production`. Includes network structures for nodes, edges, and tiles.
2. **`catanatron_core/catanatron/state.py`** - Provides the `State` class, which interacts with the `LandTile` attributes via the `board` object.

END RESEARCH.================================== Ai Message ==================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Ensure stable heuristic scoring for FooPlayer by correctly accessing valid attributes of `LandTile` and utilizing game state methods (e.g., `adjacent_tiles`) to compute bonuses for settlements and roads. Refine gameplay to support functional testing over the next 5 iterations.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Replace the incorrect reference to `tile.value` in heuristic scoring with valid queries to `tile.resource`, `tile.number`, and `number_probability()` to calculate bonuses for adjacent tiles when evaluating settlement actions.

CHOSEN AGENT: CODER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:
Refactor `foo_player.py` to fix the error and improve scoring calculations:

1. **Correct Tile Context Retrieval**:
   - Replace all calls to `tile.value` with queries to valid attributes of `LandTile`, such as `tile.resource` for resource type or `tile.number` for dice roll probability.
   - Use `game.state.board.adjacent_tiles[node_id]` to get tiles surrounding the node at which a settlement or city is to be built.
   - Example adjustment:
     ```python
     adjacent_tiles = game.state.board.adjacent_tiles[action.value]
     resource_bonus = sum(number_probability(tile.number) for tile in adjacent_tiles if tile.resource is not None)
     heuristic_scores[action] += resource_bonus
     ```

2. **Enhance Settlement Scoring**:
   - Calculate settlement scores dynamically based on cumulative resource probabilities from adjacent tiles (using `number_probability()` and `tile.resource`).
   - Adjust `_compute_heuristic_scores` to include valid resource bonuses:
     ```python
     for action in playable_actions:
         if action.action_type == ActionType.BUILD_SETTLEMENT:
             adjacent_tiles = game.state.board.adjacent_tiles[action.value]
             resource_bonus = sum(number_probability(tile.number) for tile in adjacent_tiles if tile.resource is not None)
             heuristic_scores[action] = 10 + resource_bonus
     ```

3. **Validate Heuristic Scoring**:
   - Ensure all logic runs smoothly, avoiding invalid calls or attributes.
   - Add debug print statements to log computed bonuses during gameplay.

Once implemented, test FooPlayer for functionality and measure changes in heuristic-driven decision-making across multiple iterations.================================ Human Message =================================

CODER

### Changes Made:
1. **Resolved `AttributeError`**:
   - Replaced previous invalid references to `tile.value` with `number_probability(tile.number)` from the `LandTile` class to compute bonuses based on tile probabilities.

2. **Updated Heuristic Scoring Logic**:
   - Settlement bonuses now dynamically evaluate adjacent tiles using `state.board.adjacent_tiles[action.value]`.
   - Bonuses are calculated based on valid attributes (`tile.resource` and `tile.number`) using `number_probability()`.

3. **Improved Resource Bottleneck Handling**:
   - Retained logic to incentivize road-building when brick and wood resources are in surplus.

4. **Debug Enhancements**:
   - Added clear print statements to log heuristic scores and fallback decisions.

### Notes for Testing:
- Confirm stability and functionality of the game simulation without syntax errors.
- Test heuristic scoring improvements, observing early-game settlement expansion and resource optimization.
- Validate fallback mechanism functionality when a valid LLM response is not received.

AttributeError: 'Board' object has no attribute 'adjacent_tiles'================================ Human Message =================================

After Running The New foo_player.py Player, Here is my analysis and findings:

### Syntax Error Details:
- **Error Message**: `AttributeError: 'Board' object has no attribute 'adjacent_tiles'`
- **Exact Line Number**: Line 91 in `foo_player.py`
- **Exact Line of Code**: `adjacent_tiles = state.board.adjacent_tiles[action.value]`

### Root Cause:
The `Board` object in the provided game framework does not have an attribute or method named `adjacent_tiles`. The code attempts to calculate heuristic scores based on adjacent tiles, leading to this error.

### Impact:
The syntax error prevents the game simulation from running, and no game results or performance data were generated for this evolution.

Let me know if you need anything else!================================== Ai Message ==================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Ensure accurate context retrieval from the game framework by replacing invalid references to nonexistent `adjacent_tiles` attributes and identifying the correct methods or mechanisms for accessing adjacent tile information. Stabilize the game for functional testing and iterative improvements.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Replace the erroneous reference to `state.board.adjacent_tiles` with a valid alternative to retrieve adjacent tile information or resource contexts from the game framework. Verify functionality and eliminate all remaining syntax issues.

CHOSEN AGENT: RESEARCHER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:  
Investigate alternative methods or properties in the `Board` or related classes (`State`, `Game`) to retrieve adjacent tile information. Specifically:
1. Identify where and how adjacent tile data is stored or computed (e.g., through another attribute, helper function, or method).
2. Confirm any valid alternative mechanisms to compute node-specific resource contexts, such as `node_production` or explicit tile indexing.
3. Provide clear examples or pseudocode to adjust the `_compute_heuristic_scores` function with valid logic.

Deliver actionable steps for replacing invalid calls with correct methods or attributes.================================ Human Message =================================

RESEARCH:

#### Key Mechanisms for Accessing Adjacent Tile Information
The `CatanMap` and `State` classes provide the primary ways to access data about the board, including adjacent tiles and node-specific contexts. For resolving the issue around the erroneous `state.board.adjacent_tiles` reference, here are the validated methods and alternative approaches:

---

### **1. Accessing Adjacent Tiles**
The `CatanMap` class explicitly maintains data structures for adjacent tiles via its `adjacent_tiles` attribute. 
- The `adjacent_tiles` attribute of `CatanMap` serves as a mapping:  
  **Key**: `node_id`  
  **Value**: `List[LandTile]` (all land tiles adjacent to the given node).  

#### Example:
```python
# Access adjacent tiles for a specific node
adjacent_tiles = game.state.board.map.adjacent_tiles[node_id]
for tile in adjacent_tiles:
    resource = tile.resource  # Resource type (e.g., WOOD)
    number = tile.number      # Probability number for the resource
```

---

### **2. Computing Node-Specific Resource Context**
To compute bonuses for a specific node based on adjacent resources, leverage the `node_production` attribute from `CatanMap`.  
- **`node_production`**: Maps `node_id` to a `Counter` of resource probabilities (combining adjacent tiles).

#### Example:
```python
# Retrieve resource production probabilities for a node
resource_production = game.state.board.map.node_production[node_id]

# Example output: Counter({WOOD: 0.25, BRICK: 0.16, WHEAT: 0.08})
print(resource_production)
```

This can be used to assess the strategic value of a node based on the likelihood of obtaining specific resources.

---

### **3. Suggested Fix for `_compute_heuristic_scores`**
To eliminate the invalid `state.board.adjacent_tiles` reference, you can replace it with calls to either `adjacent_tiles` or `node_production` depending on the calculation context. For heuristic-based evaluations:

#### Using `node_production` for Scoring:
```python
def _compute_heuristic_scores(node_id):
    # Retrieve node-specific production score
    resource_production = game.state.board.map.node_production[node_id]
    
    # Compute heuristic score based on production probabilities
    score = sum(
        resource_production[resource] * weight
        for resource, weight in RESOURCE_WEIGHTS.items()
    )
    return score
```

#### Using `adjacent_tiles` for Detailed Context:
```python
def _compute_heuristic_scores(node_id):
    # Access adjacent tiles directly for the node
    adjacent_tiles = game.state.board.map.adjacent_tiles[node_id]
    
    # Example: Evaluate based on resources and probabilities
    score = 0
    for tile in adjacent_tiles:
        if tile.resource is not None:
            probability = number_probability(tile.number)
            score += RESOURCE_WEIGHTS[tile.resource] * probability
    return score
```

- **Key Function**: `number_probability(tile.number)` computes the probability of rolling the tile's dice number. 

---

### **4. Other Methods for Alternative Contexts**
Additional utilities that may assist in resource evaluation include:
- **From `CatanMap`**:
  - `land_tiles`: Dictionary of all land tiles by coordinate.
  - `port_nodes`: Mapping of ports to associated nodes.
- **From `State`**:
  - `state.board.buildings`: Dictionary of buildings (e.g., settlements, cities) associated with node IDs.
  - `state.resource_freqdeck`: Provides information on bank resources.

1. **`catanatron_core/catanatron/models/map.py`**: Contains definitions for `CatanMap`, `LandTile`, and methods like `init_adjacent_tiles`, `init_node_production`.
   - Key attributes: `adjacent_tiles`, `node_production`, `land_tiles`.
2. **`catanatron_core/catanatron/state.py`**: Includes the `State` class and access to properties like `board`.
3. **`catanatron_core/catanatron/game.py`**: Facilitates interaction with the `Game` and `State` contexts.

END RESEARCH.================================== Ai Message ==================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Leverage `CatanMap` utilities like `adjacent_tiles` and `node_production` to accurately compute node-specific resource bonuses for heuristic scoring. Stabilize FooPlayer to run without errors and refine its strategic behaviors.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Replace the invalid `state.board.adjacent_tiles` reference in `_compute_heuristic_scores` with a valid call to `game.state.board.map.adjacent_tiles` or leverage `node_production` for simplified resource-based scoring. Prioritize stability and alignment with Catanatron's API.

CHOSEN AGENT: CODER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:
Refactor `foo_player.py` to resolve the `AttributeError` and improve heuristic scoring:

1. **Correct Context Access**:
   - Replace the invalid `state.board.adjacent_tiles[action.value]` with valid methods:
     - Use `game.state.board.map.adjacent_tiles[action.value]` to retrieve adjacent tiles for the node (correcting the error).
     - Alternatively, use `game.state.board.map.node_production[action.value]` for precomputed resource probabilities at a node.

2. **Update Node-Specific Scoring Logic**:
   - If using `adjacent_tiles`, query each tile’s `resource` and `number` attributes and compute bonuses based on `number_probability(tile.number)`. Example:
     ```python
     adjacent_tiles = game.state.board.map.adjacent_tiles[action.value]
     resource_bonus = sum(number_probability(tile.number) for tile in adjacent_tiles if tile.resource is not None)
     ```
   - If using `node_production`, calculate a cumulative production score:
     ```python
     resource_production = game.state.board.map.node_production[action.value]
     resource_bonus = sum(resource_production[resource] * RESOURCE_WEIGHTS[resource] for resource in resource_production)
     ```

3. **Testing and Debugging Enhancements**:
   - Add debug print statements to verify retrieved tile data and computed scores.
   - Ensure heuristic-driven behaviors align with expected strategic priorities (e.g., roads, settlements, VP growth).

After implementing these changes, test FooPlayer for stability and validate heuristic-driven decision-making during game simulations.================================ Human Message =================================

The file `foo_player.py` has been successfully updated with the following adjustments:

### Changes Made:
1. **Replaced Invalid Reference to `adjacent_tiles`**:
   - Updated tile context retrieval in `_compute_heuristic_scores`:
     - Replaced the erroneous `state.board.adjacent_tiles` reference with `game.state.board.map.adjacent_tiles[node_id]`.

2. **Heuristic Scoring Enhancements**:
   - Corrected settlement scoring to calculate bonuses using probabilities of adjacent tiles (`number_probability(tile.number)`).
   - Dynamically computed resource bonuses for settlements based on adjacent tiles' resource values.

3. **Debugging Improvements**:
   - Retained existing debug statements to observe how heuristic scores were computed and fallback decisions were made.

### Testing Recommendations:
- **Functional Testing**:
  - Run the updated `FooPlayer.py` against opponents to confirm there are no runtime errors.
  - Validate that heuristic scores accurately calculate settlement and road bonuses based on adjacent tile contexts.
- **Performance Validation**:
  - Observe gameplay for early-game expansion (settlements, roads) and resource optimization.
  - Measure if dynamic fallback mechanisms align with expected strategic goals.

TypeError: list indices must be integers or slices, not str================================ Human Message =================================

After Running The New foo_player.py Player, Here is my analysis and findings:

### Syntax Error Details:
- **Error Message**: `TypeError: list indices must be integers or slices, not str`
- **Exact Line Number**: Line 105 in `foo_player.py`
- **Exact Line of Code**: `if player_resources['brick'] >= 3 and player_resources['wood'] >= 3:`

### Root Cause:
The `player_resources` object retrieved using `get_player_freqdeck` is a list, but the code treats it as a dictionary with string keys (e.g., `'brick'`, `'wood'`). This mismatch causes a `TypeError`.

### Impact:
The syntax error prevents the game from running, resulting in no recorded game results or player performance data for this evolution.

### Suggested Resolution:
Convert `player_resources` to a dictionary format, or properly access elements using integer indices if it is indeed a list.

Let me know if you need anything else!================================== Ai Message ==================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Ensure accurate resource handling by correctly accessing the `player_resources` object in the game framework, eliminating all resource-related syntax errors. Stabilize FooPlayer to enable functional testing and iterative evaluation of strategies.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Resolve the `TypeError` in the `_compute_heuristic_scores` function by identifying the correct format for `player_resources` and updating resource access logic accordingly (either dictionary keys or list indices).

CHOSEN AGENT: RESEARCHER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:  
Investigate the structure and format of the `player_resources` object as retrieved by the `get_player_freqdeck` function or similar mechanisms. Specifically:
1. Determine whether `player_resources` is a list, dictionary, or another format.
2. Identify valid methods or attributes to access specific resource quantities (e.g., brick, wood, etc.).
3. Provide examples or pseudocode for correctly accessing resource quantities and updating the faulty code section in `_compute_heuristic_scores`.

Ensure clarity and comprehensiveness in the findings to address the issue efficiently.================================ Human Message =================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Refactor FooPlayer to work seamlessly with the Catanatron API while continuing to enhance strategic decision-making via heuristic integration and LLM refinement. Achieve compatibility and avoid critical runtime errors in the next evolution to allow for testing and evaluation.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Resolve the `AttributeError` by ensuring that `foo_player.py` uses valid methods from the Catanatron `Game` class for retrieving player resources and other game state data. Validate the compatibility of all API calls in the `_build_prompt` method.

CHOSEN AGENT: RESEARCHER

AGENT OBJECTIVE: 
Identify the correct way to access the following game state information from the Catanatron API:
1. Player resources (e.g., wood, brick, grain, etc.) for a specific color (e.g., `Color.BLUE`).
2. Obtain other player and game statistics that might be relevant for building the LLM prompt (e.g., settlements, cities, roads, VP).
3. Provide a list of valid Game API methods and properties that could be helpful for efficiently querying such state details.

Ensure that the information provided directly addresses the API compatibility issues in `foo_player.py`.================================== Ai Message ==================================

RESEARCH:

#### Key Information on Accessing Game State Using Catanatron API

**1. Accessing Player Resources**
To retrieve resources (e.g., wood, brick, grain, etc.) for a specific player:
- Use the `get_player_freqdeck(state, color)` function, which provides the player's resource frequency deck.
  ```python
  from catanatron.state_functions import get_player_freqdeck
  player_resources = get_player_freqdeck(state, Color.BLUE)
  ```
- `player_num_resource_cards(state, color, resource)` can query the count for specific resources:
  ```python
  from catanatron.state_functions import player_num_resource_cards
  wood_count = player_num_resource_cards(state, Color.BLUE, "WOOD")
  ```

**2. Accessing Player and Game Statistics**
For settlements, cities, roads, and VP:
- **Settlements**: Use `get_player_buildings(state, color, "SETTLEMENT")` to retrieve settlement IDs of a player:
  ```python
  from catanatron.state_functions import get_player_buildings
  settlements = get_player_buildings(state, Color.BLUE, "SETTLEMENT")
  ```
- **Cities**: Similarly invoke `get_player_buildings(state, color, "CITY")` for city IDs:
  ```python
  cities = get_player_buildings(state, Color.BLUE, "CITY")
  ```
- **Roads Available**: Check roads available using state data:
  ```python
  player_key = player_key(state, Color.BLUE)
  roads_available = state.player_state[f"{player_key}_ROADS_AVAILABLE"]
  ```
- **Victory Points**: Victory points can be checked via:
  ```python
  victory_points = state.player_state[f"{player_key}_ACTUAL_VICTORY_POINTS"]
  ```

**3. General Game State Statistics**
The class `Game` contains the main API-level functions for interacting with game state, including:
- `play_tick()` to advance the game state.
- `winning_color()` to retrieve the player currently winning the game.
- `state.playable_actions` to list the valid actions at the current step.

```python
winning_player = game.winning_color()
playable_options = game.state.playable_actions
```

#### List of Useful Methods and Properties in Game API:
Valid methods within the `Game` class and associated functions:
- `get_player_freqdeck(state, color)` – Retrieves player's resources.
- `player_num_resource_cards(state, color, resource)` – Gets the count for specific resources.
- `player_key(state, color)` – Returns string key for player state.
- `get_player_buildings(state, color, building_type)` – Retrieves player's settlements/cities.
- `state.playable_actions` – Provides the currently executable actions.
- `game.play_tick()` – Advances game state one step.
- `game.winning_color()` – Returns the winning color/player.
- `state.colors` – Lists the colors in the game.

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Ensure FooPlayer's compatibility with the Catanatron API by resolving syntax errors and accurately utilizing the `Action` class attributes. Stabilize gameplay to allow evaluation of performance metrics over the next five iterations.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Fix the `AttributeError` by removing invalid references to the nonexistent `location` property in the `Action` class. Correct the scoring logic in `_compute_heuristic_scores` and replace erroneous calls with valid attributes from the `Action` class or game state.

CHOSEN AGENT: RESEARCHER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:  
Investigate the valid attributes and methods available in the `Action` class within the Catanatron API. Specifically:
1. Determine how to access the location or resource value associated with an action (if applicable).
2. Provide documentation or examples on other valid attributes of `Action` that might be relevant for heuristic scoring.
3. If no direct way exists to link `Action` to resource tiles or locations, suggest alternative ways to retrieve this context from the `Game` or `State` class for heuristic calculations.

Ensure the information is precise and actionable to debug and resolve the issue effectively.================================== Ai Message ==================================

RESEARCH:

### Investigation of the `Action` Class and Related Attributes
The `Action` class is part of the core mechanics for handling user actions during the gameplay. Here's the context based on the files:

#### 1. Valid Attributes of the `Action` Class
The `Action` class is defined and utilized in multiple modules. Its attributes are:
- **`color`**: Represents the player's color (e.g., `Color.BLUE`).
- **`action_type`**: Identifies the type of action (e.g., `ActionType.BUILD_SETTLEMENT`, `ActionType.PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD`).
- **`value`**: The specific content of the action based on its type. For example:
  - `Build actions` (`BUILD_SETTLEMENT`, `BUILD_CITY`) use `value` to represent the node location (`node_id`). 
  - `BUILD_ROAD` uses an `edge` object as its `value`.
  - In `MOVE_ROBBER`, `value` is a tuple such as `(coordinate, robbed_color, robbed_resource)`.

Attributes cannot directly reference nonexistent properties, such as `location`.

#### 2. Documentation and Examples of Related Action Types
Key samples of `Action` usage based on the context:
- **Action Initialization**:
  ```python
  Action(color, ActionType.BUILD_SETTLEMENT, node_id)
  Action(color, ActionType.MOVE_ROBBER, (coordinate, enemy_color, resource))
  Action(color, ActionType.ROLL, dice_roll_result)
  ```
- **Examples of Valid `ActionType` Values**:
  - Actions related to resource handling: `ROLL`, `MARITIME_TRADE`, `PLAY_YEAR_OF_PLENTY`, `PLAY_MONOPOLY`.
  - Building-related actions: `BUILD_ROAD`, `BUILD_SETTLEMENT`, `BUILD_CITY`.
  - Development cards and robber actions: `PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD`, `MOVE_ROBBER`.

#### 3. Accessing Location and Resource Context for an `Action`
The `Action` class itself does not store location or resource details unless explicitly set using the `value` attribute.

##### Alternatives for Accessing Context:
- **From the Game State (`State` Class)**:
  - To retrieve the current player's buildings (settlements, roads, etc.) or check surroundings:
    ```python
    buildings = state.buildings_by_color[Color.BLUE]
    settlements = buildings[SETTLEMENT]
    cities = buildings[CITY]
    ```
  - To get adjacent resource tiles for a node:
    ```python
    adjacent_tiles = state.board.map.adjacent_tiles[node_id]
    resources = [tile.resource for tile in adjacent_tiles if tile.resource is not None]
    ```
  - To get the bank's resource availability:
    ```python
    state.resource_freqdeck  # Bank’s current resources
    ```

- **Using `Action.value` for Specific Action Contexts**:
  In specific cases like building or moving, `Action.value` already provides relevant location-like data:
  - For building roads: Retrieve edges with `Action.value`.
  - For building settlements/cities: Use `node_id` from `Action.value`.

#### 4. Valid Methods for Game and State Interactions
Key methods/functions from the `Game` and `State`:
- **`Game` Class**:
  - `play_tick()`: Executes one game tick.
  - `winning_color()`: Returns the player currently winning the game.
  - `execute(action: Action)`: Executes a given action for a player.
  
- **`State` Class**:
  - `state.playable_actions`: Returns a list of actions currently available.
  - `state.board.buildable_node_ids(color)`: Returns node IDs where the player can build.
  - `state.player_state`: Dictionary containing details for each player (e.g., `Color.BLUE_CITIES_AVAILABLE`, `Color.BLUE_HAS_ROLLED`).

---

##### Additional Notes:
If there is a dependency on parsing `location` or `tile` data, it should instead rely on `Action.value` explicitly or query the `State` for adjacent tiles or positions as outlined above.

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Ensure compatibility with the Catanatron API and eliminate syntax errors by properly accessing attributes of the `LandTile` class and adjacent tiles during heuristic scoring. Stabilize gameplay for functional testing and iterative improvements in performance metrics.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Correct the error by replacing the incorrect reference to `tile.value` with valid calls to extract resource-related attributes or other properties from the `LandTile` class. Fully debug and ensure the heuristic scoring function runs smoothly without errors.

CHOSEN AGENT: RESEARCHER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:  
Investigate the `LandTile` class and its valid attributes. Specifically:
1. Identify what attributes or methods the `LandTile` class provides for retrieving resource-type or strategic value data.
2. Provide guidance on how to properly compute bonuses for adjacent tiles when building settlements or roads.
3. Suggest alternative approaches if direct resource value computation from `LandTile` is not viable.  

Ensure the information is actionable and tailored for correcting the heuristic scoring computations.================================== Ai Message ==================================

RESEARCH:

### Investigating Attributes and Methods of the `LandTile` Class
The `LandTile` class and associated structures define the core elements of gameplay tiles in the Catanatron framework. Here's a breakdown of the relevant components:

---

### **1. Valid Attributes of `LandTile`**
The `LandTile` class provides the following attributes:
- **`id`**: A unique identifier for the land tile.
- **`resource`**: The resource type for the tile (e.g., `WOOD`, `BRICK`, `WHEAT`, `SHEEP`, `ORE`, or `None` for desert tiles).
- **`number`**: The number associated with the tile (dice roll probability value). `None` indicates desert tiles.
- **`nodes`**: A dictionary where the keys are `NodeRef` values (relative positions like `NORTH`, `SOUTH`) and the values are `node_id`s.
- **`edges`**: A dictionary mapping `EdgeRef` (edge directions) to edge IDs.

Example usage:
```python
tile_id = land_tile.id
tile_resource = land_tile.resource  # e.g., WOOD
tile_number = land_tile.number  # e.g., 8 for a high-probability tile
tile_nodes = list(land_tile.nodes.values())  # Get the node IDs
tile_edges = list(land_tile.edges.values())  # Get associated edges
```

---

### **2. Calculating Bonuses or Context from Adjacent Tiles**
To compute heuristic bonuses from adjacent tiles when assigning strategic values for settlements or roads:

#### 2.1 Accessing Adjacent Tiles
The `CatanMap` object maintains an auxiliary structure for adjacent tiles:
- **`CatanMap.adjacent_tiles`**: Maps `node_id` to a list of `LandTile` objects surrounding that node.
  ```python
  adjacent_tiles = game.state.board.adjacent_tiles[node_id]
  for tile in adjacent_tiles:
      resource = tile.resource
      probability = tile.number_probability(tile.number)
      print(f"Adjacent tile {tile.id}: Resource={resource}, Probability={probability}")
  ```

#### 2.2 Computing Resource Production
You can estimate the cumulative production at a node based on resource probabilities of adjacent tiles:
- **`CatanMap.node_production`**: Maps `node_id` to a `Counter` of resource probabilities.
  ```python
  resource_production = game.state.board.node_production[node_id]
  # Example format: Counter({WOOD: 0.25, BRICK: 0.12})
  ```

---

### **3. Alternative Approaches if Direct Resource Value is Not Possible**
When direct computation is unavailable, use a combination of these methods:
- **Resource Contributions from Tiles**: Use `CatanMap.adjacent_tiles` and `LandTile.resource` or `LandTile.number`.
  ```python
  adjacent_tiles = game.state.board.adjacent_tiles[node_id]
  resource_values = [tile.resource for tile in adjacent_tiles if tile.resource]
  ```

- **Dice Roll Probability**: Use `number_probability()` on a tile’s `number`.
  ```python
  from catanatron.models.map import number_probability
  dice_probability = number_probability(tile.number)  # Roll chance for the tile
  ```

- **Ports and Trading Context**: If ports matter (e.g., for heuristic value), access via:
  ```python
  ports = game.state.board.port_nodes  # Get port mappings
  ```

---

### **Actionable Guidance for Heuristic Scoring**
To integrate this into the heuristic computation:
1. Replace `tile.value` in `_compute_heuristic_scores` with access to `tile.resource` or `tile.number`.
   ```python
   resource = tile.resource  # WOOD, BRICK, etc.
   probability = number_probability(tile.number)  # Dice probability
   ```
2. For adjacent tile context at `node_id`, query `game.state.board.adjacent_tiles`.
   ```python
   adjacent_tiles = game.state.board.adjacent_tiles[node_id]
   for tile in adjacent_tiles:
       if tile.resource is not None:
           resource_value = tile.resource
           probability = number_probability(tile.number)
   ```

---

END RESEARCH.================================ Human Message =================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Ensure accurate context retrieval from the game framework by replacing invalid references to nonexistent `adjacent_tiles` attributes and identifying the correct methods or mechanisms for accessing adjacent tile information. Stabilize the game for functional testing and iterative improvements.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Replace the erroneous reference to `state.board.adjacent_tiles` with a valid alternative to retrieve adjacent tile information or resource contexts from the game framework. Verify functionality and eliminate all remaining syntax issues.

CHOSEN AGENT: RESEARCHER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:  
Investigate alternative methods or properties in the `Board` or related classes (`State`, `Game`) to retrieve adjacent tile information. Specifically:
1. Identify where and how adjacent tile data is stored or computed (e.g., through another attribute, helper function, or method).
2. Confirm any valid alternative mechanisms to compute node-specific resource contexts, such as `node_production` or explicit tile indexing.
3. Provide clear examples or pseudocode to adjust the `_compute_heuristic_scores` function with valid logic.

Deliver actionable steps for replacing invalid calls with correct methods or attributes.================================== Ai Message ==================================

RESEARCH:

#### Key Mechanisms for Accessing Adjacent Tile Information
The `CatanMap` and `State` classes provide the primary ways to access data about the board, including adjacent tiles and node-specific contexts. For resolving the issue around the erroneous `state.board.adjacent_tiles` reference, here are the validated methods and alternative approaches:

---

### **1. Accessing Adjacent Tiles**
The `CatanMap` class explicitly maintains data structures for adjacent tiles via its `adjacent_tiles` attribute. 
- The `adjacent_tiles` attribute of `CatanMap` serves as a mapping:  
  **Key**: `node_id`  
  **Value**: `List[LandTile]` (all land tiles adjacent to the given node).  

#### Example:
```python
# Access adjacent tiles for a specific node
adjacent_tiles = game.state.board.map.adjacent_tiles[node_id]
for tile in adjacent_tiles:
    resource = tile.resource  # Resource type (e.g., WOOD)
    number = tile.number      # Probability number for the resource
```

---

### **2. Computing Node-Specific Resource Context**
To compute bonuses for a specific node based on adjacent resources, leverage the `node_production` attribute from `CatanMap`.  
- **`node_production`**: Maps `node_id` to a `Counter` of resource probabilities (combining adjacent tiles).

#### Example:
```python
# Retrieve resource production probabilities for a node
resource_production = game.state.board.map.node_production[node_id]

# Example output: Counter({WOOD: 0.25, BRICK: 0.16, WHEAT: 0.08})
print(resource_production)
```

This can be used to assess the strategic value of a node based on the likelihood of obtaining specific resources.

---

### **3. Suggested Fix for `_compute_heuristic_scores`**
To eliminate the invalid `state.board.adjacent_tiles` reference, you can replace it with calls to either `adjacent_tiles` or `node_production` depending on the calculation context. For heuristic-based evaluations:

#### Using `node_production` for Scoring:
```python
def _compute_heuristic_scores(node_id):
    # Retrieve node-specific production score
    resource_production = game.state.board.map.node_production[node_id]
    
    # Compute heuristic score based on production probabilities
    score = sum(
        resource_production[resource] * weight
        for resource, weight in RESOURCE_WEIGHTS.items()
    )
    return score
```

#### Using `adjacent_tiles` for Detailed Context:
```python
def _compute_heuristic_scores(node_id):
    # Access adjacent tiles directly for the node
    adjacent_tiles = game.state.board.map.adjacent_tiles[node_id]
    
    # Example: Evaluate based on resources and probabilities
    score = 0
    for tile in adjacent_tiles:
        if tile.resource is not None:
            probability = number_probability(tile.number)
            score += RESOURCE_WEIGHTS[tile.resource] * probability
    return score
```

- **Key Function**: `number_probability(tile.number)` computes the probability of rolling the tile's dice number. 

---

### **4. Other Methods for Alternative Contexts**
Additional utilities that may assist in resource evaluation include:
- **From `CatanMap`**:
  - `land_tiles`: Dictionary of all land tiles by coordinate.
  - `port_nodes`: Mapping of ports to associated nodes.
- **From `State`**:
  - `state.board.buildings`: Dictionary of buildings (e.g., settlements, cities) associated with node IDs.
  - `state.resource_freqdeck`: Provides information on bank resources.

---

   - Key attributes: `adjacent_tiles`, `node_production`, `land_tiles`.

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Ensure accurate resource handling by correctly accessing the `player_resources` object in the game framework, eliminating all resource-related syntax errors. Stabilize FooPlayer to enable functional testing and iterative evaluation of strategies.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Resolve the `TypeError` in the `_compute_heuristic_scores` function by identifying the correct format for `player_resources` and updating resource access logic accordingly (either dictionary keys or list indices).

CHOSEN AGENT: RESEARCHER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:  
Investigate the structure and format of the `player_resources` object as retrieved by the `get_player_freqdeck` function or similar mechanisms. Specifically:
1. Determine whether `player_resources` is a list, dictionary, or another format.
2. Identify valid methods or attributes to access specific resource quantities (e.g., brick, wood, etc.).
3. Provide examples or pseudocode for correctly accessing resource quantities and updating the faulty code section in `_compute_heuristic_scores`.

Ensure clarity and comprehensiveness in the findings to address the issue efficiently.================================== Ai Message ==================================

RESEARCH:

### Structure and Format of `player_resources` Object
The `player_resources` object, as retrieved by the `get_player_freqdeck()` function in the `state_functions.py` file, is formatted as a **list**. Each entry represents the count of a specific resource type for the player. The order of resources in the list is consistent and predefined:
1. **Wood**
2. **Brick**
3. **Sheep**
4. **Wheat**
5. **Ore**

#### Example Usage:
```python
resources = get_player_freqdeck(state, Color.BLUE)

# Access specific resources
wood_count = resources[0]
brick_count = resources[1]
sheep_count = resources[2]
wheat_count = resources[3]
ore_count = resources[4]
```

---

### Valid Methods for Resource Access
Functions related to resource interactions (defined in `state_functions.py`):
1. **`get_player_freqdeck(state, color)`**: Returns a list with counts of the player's resources in the order `(WOOD, BRICK, SHEEP, WHEAT, ORE)`.
   
2. **`player_num_resource_cards(state, color, card=None)`**:
   - Retrieves the number of total resource cards if no `card` is specified.
   - If a specific resource (`card`) is provided (e.g., `WOOD`), it returns the count of that resource.
   ```python
   total_resources = player_num_resource_cards(state, Color.BLUE)
   wood_count = player_num_resource_cards(state, Color.BLUE, WOOD)
   ```

3. **`player_freqdeck_add(state, color, freqdeck)`**: Adds specified resources to the player's inventory.
   ```python
   freq_addition = [1, 2, 0, 0, 3]  # Adds 1 Wood, 2 Bricks, and 3 Ore
   player_freqdeck_add(state, Color.BLUE, freq_addition)
   ```

4. **`player_freqdeck_subtract(state, color, freqdeck)`**: Subtracts specified resources from the player's inventory.
   ```python
   freq_subtraction = [1, 0, 0, 1, 0]  # Removes 1 Wood and 1 Wheat
   player_freqdeck_subtract(state, Color.BLUE, freq_subtraction)
   ```

---

### Correcting `_compute_heuristic_scores`
#### Faulty Code Section:
Replace erroneous references to resource lookup mechanisms that assume dictionary-like or incorrect formats. The valid approach is indexing into the list returned by `get_player_freqdeck`.

#### Example Refactored Code:
```python
def _compute_heuristic_scores(state, color):
    # Retrieve player frequency deck (resources in hand)
    player_resources = get_player_freqdeck(state, color)

    # Example heuristic: prioritize wheat and ore for city-building
    wheat = player_resources[3]
    ore = player_resources[4]

    # Compute heuristic score based on resource availability
    score = wheat * 1.5 + ore * 2.0  # Weight Wheat: 1.5, Ore: 2.0
    return score
```

---

### References:
1. **`catanatron_core/catanatron/state_functions.py`**:
   - Full implementation of resource functions (e.g., `get_player_freqdeck`, `player_num_resource_cards`, `player_freqdeck_add`, `player_freqdeck_subtract`).

AGENT OBJECTIVE:  
Investigate the valid attributes and methods available in the `Action` class within the Catanatron API. Specifically:
1. Determine how to access the location or resource value associated with an action (if applicable).
2. Provide documentation or examples on other valid attributes of `Action` that might be relevant for heuristic scoring.
3. If no direct way exists to link `Action` to resource tiles or locations, suggest alternative ways to retrieve this context from the `Game` or `State` class for heuristic calculations.

RESEARCH:

### Investigation of the `Action` Class and Related Attributes
The `Action` class is part of the core mechanics for handling user actions during the gameplay. Here's the context based on the files:

#### 1. Valid Attributes of the `Action` Class
The `Action` class is defined and utilized in multiple modules. Its attributes are:
- **`color`**: Represents the player's color (e.g., `Color.BLUE`).
- **`action_type`**: Identifies the type of action (e.g., `ActionType.BUILD_SETTLEMENT`, `ActionType.PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD`).
- **`value`**: The specific content of the action based on its type. For example:
  - `Build actions` (`BUILD_SETTLEMENT`, `BUILD_CITY`) use `value` to represent the node location (`node_id`). 
  - `BUILD_ROAD` uses an `edge` object as its `value`.
  - In `MOVE_ROBBER`, `value` is a tuple such as `(coordinate, robbed_color, robbed_resource)`.

Attributes cannot directly reference nonexistent properties, such as `location`.

#### 2. Documentation and Examples of Related Action Types
Key samples of `Action` usage based on the context:
- **Action Initialization**:
  ```python
  Action(color, ActionType.BUILD_SETTLEMENT, node_id)
  Action(color, ActionType.MOVE_ROBBER, (coordinate, enemy_color, resource))
  Action(color, ActionType.ROLL, dice_roll_result)
  ```
- **Examples of Valid `ActionType` Values**:
  - Actions related to resource handling: `ROLL`, `MARITIME_TRADE`, `PLAY_YEAR_OF_PLENTY`, `PLAY_MONOPOLY`.
  - Building-related actions: `BUILD_ROAD`, `BUILD_SETTLEMENT`, `BUILD_CITY`.
  - Development cards and robber actions: `PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD`, `MOVE_ROBBER`.

#### 3. Accessing Location and Resource Context for an `Action`
The `Action` class itself does not store location or resource details unless explicitly set using the `value` attribute.

##### Alternatives for Accessing Context:
- **From the Game State (`State` Class)**:
  - To retrieve the current player's buildings (settlements, roads, etc.) or check surroundings:
    ```python
    buildings = state.buildings_by_color[Color.BLUE]
    settlements = buildings[SETTLEMENT]
    cities = buildings[CITY]
    ```
  - To get adjacent resource tiles for a node:
    ```python
    adjacent_tiles = state.board.map.adjacent_tiles[node_id]
    resources = [tile.resource for tile in adjacent_tiles if tile.resource is not None]
    ```
  - To get the bank's resource availability:
    ```python
    state.resource_freqdeck  # Bank’s current resources
    ```

- **Using `Action.value` for Specific Action Contexts**:
  In specific cases like building or moving, `Action.value` already provides relevant location-like data:
  - For building roads: Retrieve edges with `Action.value`.
  - For building settlements/cities: Use `node_id` from `Action.value`.

#### 4. Valid Methods for Game and State Interactions
Key methods/functions from the `Game` and `State`:
- **`Game` Class**:
  - `play_tick()`: Executes one game tick.
  - `winning_color()`: Returns the player currently winning the game.
  - `execute(action: Action)`: Executes a given action for a player.
  
- **`State` Class**:
  - `state.playable_actions`: Returns a list of actions currently available.
  - `state.board.buildable_node_ids(color)`: Returns node IDs where the player can build.
  - `state.player_state`: Dictionary containing details for each player (e.g., `Color.BLUE_CITIES_AVAILABLE`, `Color.BLUE_HAS_ROLLED`).

---

##### Additional Notes:
If there is a dependency on parsing `location` or `tile` data, it should instead rely on `Action.value` explicitly or query the `State` for adjacent tiles or positions as outlined above.

END RESEARCH.================================== Ai Message ==================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Ensure compatibility with the Catanatron API by appropriately integrating valid attributes of the `Action` class and utilizing game state data to enhance decision-making. Achieve stable functionality for testing strategic performance over the next 5 iterations.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Correct the `AttributeError` by refactoring `foo_player.py` to rely on valid `Action.value` attributes or query relevant context from the `State` class for heuristic scoring. Ensure all references to `location` are replaced with valid methods to retrieve positional or resource data.

CHOSEN AGENT: CODER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:
Refactor `foo_player.py` to address the syntax error and improve heuristic scoring:

1. **Fix Invalid References**:
   - Replace all calls to the nonexistent `action.location` with queries to `Action.value` or `State` methods.
   - Example adjustments:
     ```python
     if action.action_type == ActionType.BUILD_SETTLEMENT and len(state.board.map.adjacent_tiles[action.value]) > threshold:
         heuristic_scores[action] += 3
     ```
     Here, `action.value` provides the node ID where the settlement would be built.

2. **Context Retrieval from State**:
   - For actions like `BUILD_SETTLEMENT` or `BUILD_CITY`, retrieve adjacent tiles and their resource values using `state.board.map.adjacent_tiles[action.value]`.
   - For roads, use `Action.value` to access edge information and query connected tiles.

3. **Heuristic Scoring Enhancements**:
   - Incorporate valid context details from the state or action attributes to refine heuristic scoring:
     - High-value tiles should boost settlement scores:
       ```python
       adjacent_resources = [tile.resource for tile in state.board.map.adjacent_tiles[action.value] if tile.resource is not None]
       resource_bonus = sum(tile.value for resource in adjacent_resources)
       heuristic_scores[action] += resource_bonus
       ```

4. **Debugging and Validation**:
   - Ensure all invalid references are replaced with valid calls.
   - Add debug print statements to verify successful access to `Action.value` or state functions during gameplay.

Once refactoring is complete, test FooPlayer to confirm it runs without errors and demonstrate functional heuristic scoring improvements.================================ Human Message =================================

CODER

### Summary of Changes:
1. **Fixed `AttributeError`**:
   - Replaced invalid references to `action.location` with valid attribute and context retrieval using `action.value` and game state methods (e.g., accessing `state.board.map.adjacent_tiles` for settlement scoring).

2. **Improved Settlement Scoring**:
   - Enhanced `_compute_heuristic_scores` to calculate bonuses for settlements based on adjacent tiles' resource values using `state.board.map.adjacent_tiles[action.value]`.

3. **Resource Bottleneck Handling**:
   - Retained logic for surplus brick/wood to incentivize road-building.

4. **Improved Debugging**:
   - Added specific print statements during fallback and heuristic computation to verify logic.

5. **Dynamic Heuristic Refinements**:
   - Settlement scoring dynamically adjusts based on adjacent tile values, improving action prioritization.

### Testing Plan:
- Verify that the game runs without errors.
- Validate heuristic score calculations for settlements and roads using logs.
- Test gameplay performance:
  - Early-game: Expansion (settlements and roads).
  - Late-game: City-building and VP growth.

Let me know if the updated player behaves as expected or requires further refinements.

AttributeError: 'LandTile' object has no attribute 'value'================================ Human Message =================================

After Running The New foo_player.py Player, Here is my analysis and findings:

### Syntax Error Details:
- **Error Message**: `AttributeError: 'LandTile' object has no attribute 'value'`
- **Exact Line Number**: Line 92 in `foo_player.py`
- **Exact Line of Code**: `tile.value for tile in adjacent_tiles if tile.resource is not None`

### Root Cause:
The `LandTile` class does not have a `value` attribute as assumed in `_compute_heuristic_scores`. This error occurs when attempting to calculate resource bonuses for building settlements based on adjacent tiles.

### Impact:
The syntax error prevents the game from running, resulting in no recorded game results or player performance data for this evolution.

Let me know if you need anything else!================================== Ai Message ==================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Ensure compatibility with the Catanatron API and eliminate syntax errors by properly accessing attributes of the `LandTile` class and adjacent tiles during heuristic scoring. Stabilize gameplay for functional testing and iterative improvements in performance metrics.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Correct the error by replacing the incorrect reference to `tile.value` with valid calls to extract resource-related attributes or other properties from the `LandTile` class. Fully debug and ensure the heuristic scoring function runs smoothly without errors.

CHOSEN AGENT: RESEARCHER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:  
Investigate the `LandTile` class and its valid attributes. Specifically:
1. Identify what attributes or methods the `LandTile` class provides for retrieving resource-type or strategic value data.
2. Provide guidance on how to properly compute bonuses for adjacent tiles when building settlements or roads.
3. Suggest alternative approaches if direct resource value computation from `LandTile` is not viable.  

Ensure the information is actionable and tailored for correcting the heuristic scoring computations.================================ Human Message =================================

RESEARCH:

### Investigating Attributes and Methods of the `LandTile` Class
The `LandTile` class and associated structures define the core elements of gameplay tiles in the Catanatron framework. Here's a breakdown of the relevant components:

---

### **1. Valid Attributes of `LandTile`**
The `LandTile` class provides the following attributes:
- **`id`**: A unique identifier for the land tile.
- **`resource`**: The resource type for the tile (e.g., `WOOD`, `BRICK`, `WHEAT`, `SHEEP`, `ORE`, or `None` for desert tiles).
- **`number`**: The number associated with the tile (dice roll probability value). `None` indicates desert tiles.
- **`nodes`**: A dictionary where the keys are `NodeRef` values (relative positions like `NORTH`, `SOUTH`) and the values are `node_id`s.
- **`edges`**: A dictionary mapping `EdgeRef` (edge directions) to edge IDs.

Example usage:
```python
tile_id = land_tile.id
tile_resource = land_tile.resource  # e.g., WOOD
tile_number = land_tile.number  # e.g., 8 for a high-probability tile
tile_nodes = list(land_tile.nodes.values())  # Get the node IDs
tile_edges = list(land_tile.edges.values())  # Get associated edges
```

---

### **2. Calculating Bonuses or Context from Adjacent Tiles**
To compute heuristic bonuses from adjacent tiles when assigning strategic values for settlements or roads:

#### 2.1 Accessing Adjacent Tiles
The `CatanMap` object maintains an auxiliary structure for adjacent tiles:
- **`CatanMap.adjacent_tiles`**: Maps `node_id` to a list of `LandTile` objects surrounding that node.
  ```python
  adjacent_tiles = game.state.board.adjacent_tiles[node_id]
  for tile in adjacent_tiles:
      resource = tile.resource
      probability = tile.number_probability(tile.number)
      print(f"Adjacent tile {tile.id}: Resource={resource}, Probability={probability}")
  ```

#### 2.2 Computing Resource Production
You can estimate the cumulative production at a node based on resource probabilities of adjacent tiles:
- **`CatanMap.node_production`**: Maps `node_id` to a `Counter` of resource probabilities.
  ```python
  resource_production = game.state.board.node_production[node_id]
  # Example format: Counter({WOOD: 0.25, BRICK: 0.12})
  ```

---

### **3. Alternative Approaches if Direct Resource Value is Not Possible**
When direct computation is unavailable, use a combination of these methods:
- **Resource Contributions from Tiles**: Use `CatanMap.adjacent_tiles` and `LandTile.resource` or `LandTile.number`.
  ```python
  adjacent_tiles = game.state.board.adjacent_tiles[node_id]
  resource_values = [tile.resource for tile in adjacent_tiles if tile.resource]
  ```

- **Dice Roll Probability**: Use `number_probability()` on a tile’s `number`.
  ```python
  from catanatron.models.map import number_probability
  dice_probability = number_probability(tile.number)  # Roll chance for the tile
  ```

- **Ports and Trading Context**: If ports matter (e.g., for heuristic value), access via:
  ```python
  ports = game.state.board.port_nodes  # Get port mappings
  ```

---

### **Actionable Guidance for Heuristic Scoring**
To integrate this into the heuristic computation:
1. Replace `tile.value` in `_compute_heuristic_scores` with access to `tile.resource` or `tile.number`.
   ```python
   resource = tile.resource  # WOOD, BRICK, etc.
   probability = number_probability(tile.number)  # Dice probability
   ```
2. For adjacent tile context at `node_id`, query `game.state.board.adjacent_tiles`.
   ```python
   adjacent_tiles = game.state.board.adjacent_tiles[node_id]
   for tile in adjacent_tiles:
       if tile.resource is not None:
           resource_value = tile.resource
           probability = number_probability(tile.number)
   ```

END RESEARCH.================================== Ai Message ==================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Ensure stable heuristic scoring for FooPlayer by correctly accessing valid attributes of `LandTile` and utilizing game state methods (e.g., `adjacent_tiles`) to compute bonuses for settlements and roads. Refine gameplay to support functional testing over the next 5 iterations.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Replace the incorrect reference to `tile.value` in heuristic scoring with valid queries to `tile.resource`, `tile.number`, and `number_probability()` to calculate bonuses for adjacent tiles when evaluating settlement actions.

CHOSEN AGENT: CODER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:
Refactor `foo_player.py` to fix the error and improve scoring calculations:

1. **Correct Tile Context Retrieval**:
   - Replace all calls to `tile.value` with queries to valid attributes of `LandTile`, such as `tile.resource` for resource type or `tile.number` for dice roll probability.
   - Use `game.state.board.adjacent_tiles[node_id]` to get tiles surrounding the node at which a settlement or city is to be built.
   - Example adjustment:
     ```python
     adjacent_tiles = game.state.board.adjacent_tiles[action.value]
     resource_bonus = sum(number_probability(tile.number) for tile in adjacent_tiles if tile.resource is not None)
     heuristic_scores[action] += resource_bonus
     ```

2. **Enhance Settlement Scoring**:
   - Calculate settlement scores dynamically based on cumulative resource probabilities from adjacent tiles (using `number_probability()` and `tile.resource`).
   - Adjust `_compute_heuristic_scores` to include valid resource bonuses:
     ```python
     for action in playable_actions:
         if action.action_type == ActionType.BUILD_SETTLEMENT:
             adjacent_tiles = game.state.board.adjacent_tiles[action.value]
             resource_bonus = sum(number_probability(tile.number) for tile in adjacent_tiles if tile.resource is not None)
             heuristic_scores[action] = 10 + resource_bonus
     ```

3. **Validate Heuristic Scoring**:
   - Ensure all logic runs smoothly, avoiding invalid calls or attributes.
   - Add debug print statements to log computed bonuses during gameplay.

Once implemented, test FooPlayer for functionality and measure changes in heuristic-driven decision-making across multiple iterations.================================ Human Message =================================

CODER

### Changes Made:
1. **Resolved `AttributeError`**:
   - Replaced previous invalid references to `tile.value` with `number_probability(tile.number)` from the `LandTile` class to compute bonuses based on tile probabilities.

2. **Updated Heuristic Scoring Logic**:
   - Settlement bonuses now dynamically evaluate adjacent tiles using `state.board.adjacent_tiles[action.value]`.
   - Bonuses are calculated based on valid attributes (`tile.resource` and `tile.number`) using `number_probability()`.

3. **Improved Resource Bottleneck Handling**:
   - Retained logic to incentivize road-building when brick and wood resources are in surplus.

4. **Debug Enhancements**:
   - Added clear print statements to log heuristic scores and fallback decisions.

### Notes for Testing:
- Confirm stability and functionality of the game simulation without syntax errors.
- Test heuristic scoring improvements, observing early-game settlement expansion and resource optimization.
- Validate fallback mechanism functionality when a valid LLM response is not received.

AGENT OBJECTIVE:  
Investigate alternative methods or properties in the `Board` or related classes (`State`, `Game`) to retrieve adjacent tile information. Specifically:
1. Identify where and how adjacent tile data is stored or computed (e.g., through another attribute, helper function, or method).
2. Confirm any valid alternative mechanisms to compute node-specific resource contexts, such as `node_production` or explicit tile indexing.
3. Provide clear examples or pseudocode to adjust the `_compute_heuristic_scores` function with valid logic.

Deliver actionable steps for replacing invalid calls with correct methods or attributes.================================ Human Message =================================

RESEARCH:

#### Key Mechanisms for Accessing Adjacent Tile Information
The `CatanMap` and `State` classes provide the primary ways to access data about the board, including adjacent tiles and node-specific contexts. For resolving the issue around the erroneous `state.board.adjacent_tiles` reference, here are the validated methods and alternative approaches:

---

### **1. Accessing Adjacent Tiles**
The `CatanMap` class explicitly maintains data structures for adjacent tiles via its `adjacent_tiles` attribute. 
- The `adjacent_tiles` attribute of `CatanMap` serves as a mapping:  
  **Key**: `node_id`  
  **Value**: `List[LandTile]` (all land tiles adjacent to the given node).  

#### Example:
```python
# Access adjacent tiles for a specific node
adjacent_tiles = game.state.board.map.adjacent_tiles[node_id]
for tile in adjacent_tiles:
    resource = tile.resource  # Resource type (e.g., WOOD)
    number = tile.number      # Probability number for the resource
```

---

### **2. Computing Node-Specific Resource Context**
To compute bonuses for a specific node based on adjacent resources, leverage the `node_production` attribute from `CatanMap`.  
- **`node_production`**: Maps `node_id` to a `Counter` of resource probabilities (combining adjacent tiles).

#### Example:
```python
# Retrieve resource production probabilities for a node
resource_production = game.state.board.map.node_production[node_id]

# Example output: Counter({WOOD: 0.25, BRICK: 0.16, WHEAT: 0.08})
print(resource_production)
```

This can be used to assess the strategic value of a node based on the likelihood of obtaining specific resources.

---

### **3. Suggested Fix for `_compute_heuristic_scores`**
To eliminate the invalid `state.board.adjacent_tiles` reference, you can replace it with calls to either `adjacent_tiles` or `node_production` depending on the calculation context. For heuristic-based evaluations:

#### Using `node_production` for Scoring:
```python
def _compute_heuristic_scores(node_id):
    # Retrieve node-specific production score
    resource_production = game.state.board.map.node_production[node_id]
    
    # Compute heuristic score based on production probabilities
    score = sum(
        resource_production[resource] * weight
        for resource, weight in RESOURCE_WEIGHTS.items()
    )
    return score
```

#### Using `adjacent_tiles` for Detailed Context:
```python
def _compute_heuristic_scores(node_id):
    # Access adjacent tiles directly for the node
    adjacent_tiles = game.state.board.map.adjacent_tiles[node_id]
    
    # Example: Evaluate based on resources and probabilities
    score = 0
    for tile in adjacent_tiles:
        if tile.resource is not None:
            probability = number_probability(tile.number)
            score += RESOURCE_WEIGHTS[tile.resource] * probability
    return score
```

- **Key Function**: `number_probability(tile.number)` computes the probability of rolling the tile's dice number. 

---

### **4. Other Methods for Alternative Contexts**
Additional utilities that may assist in resource evaluation include:
- **From `CatanMap`**:
  - `land_tiles`: Dictionary of all land tiles by coordinate.
  - `port_nodes`: Mapping of ports to associated nodes.
- **From `State`**:
  - `state.board.buildings`: Dictionary of buildings (e.g., settlements, cities) associated with node IDs.
  - `state.resource_freqdeck`: Provides information on bank resources.

END RESEARCH.================================== Ai Message ==================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Leverage `CatanMap` utilities like `adjacent_tiles` and `node_production` to accurately compute node-specific resource bonuses for heuristic scoring. Stabilize FooPlayer to run without errors and refine its strategic behaviors.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Replace the invalid `state.board.adjacent_tiles` reference in `_compute_heuristic_scores` with a valid call to `game.state.board.map.adjacent_tiles` or leverage `node_production` for simplified resource-based scoring. Prioritize stability and alignment with Catanatron's API.

CHOSEN AGENT: CODER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:
Refactor `foo_player.py` to resolve the `AttributeError` and improve heuristic scoring:

1. **Correct Context Access**:
   - Replace the invalid `state.board.adjacent_tiles[action.value]` with valid methods:
     - Use `game.state.board.map.adjacent_tiles[action.value]` to retrieve adjacent tiles for the node (correcting the error).
     - Alternatively, use `game.state.board.map.node_production[action.value]` for precomputed resource probabilities at a node.

2. **Update Node-Specific Scoring Logic**:
   - If using `adjacent_tiles`, query each tile’s `resource` and `number` attributes and compute bonuses based on `number_probability(tile.number)`. Example:
     ```python
     adjacent_tiles = game.state.board.map.adjacent_tiles[action.value]
     resource_bonus = sum(number_probability(tile.number) for tile in adjacent_tiles if tile.resource is not None)
     ```
   - If using `node_production`, calculate a cumulative production score:
     ```python
     resource_production = game.state.board.map.node_production[action.value]
     resource_bonus = sum(resource_production[resource] * RESOURCE_WEIGHTS[resource] for resource in resource_production)
     ```

3. **Testing and Debugging Enhancements**:
   - Add debug print statements to verify retrieved tile data and computed scores.
   - Ensure heuristic-driven behaviors align with expected strategic priorities (e.g., roads, settlements, VP growth).

After implementing these changes, test FooPlayer for stability and validate heuristic-driven decision-making during game simulations.================================ Human Message =================================

The file `foo_player.py` has been successfully updated with the following adjustments:

### Changes Made:
1. **Replaced Invalid Reference to `adjacent_tiles`**:
   - Updated tile context retrieval in `_compute_heuristic_scores`:
     - Replaced the erroneous `state.board.adjacent_tiles` reference with `game.state.board.map.adjacent_tiles[node_id]`.

2. **Heuristic Scoring Enhancements**:
   - Corrected settlement scoring to calculate bonuses using probabilities of adjacent tiles (`number_probability(tile.number)`).
   - Dynamically computed resource bonuses for settlements based on adjacent tiles' resource values.

3. **Debugging Improvements**:
   - Retained existing debug statements to observe how heuristic scores were computed and fallback decisions were made.

### Testing Recommendations:
- **Functional Testing**:
  - Run the updated `FooPlayer.py` against opponents to confirm there are no runtime errors.
  - Validate that heuristic scores accurately calculate settlement and road bonuses based on adjacent tile contexts.
- **Performance Validation**:
  - Observe gameplay for early-game expansion (settlements, roads) and resource optimization.
  - Measure if dynamic fallback mechanisms align with expected strategic goals.

TypeError: list indices must be integers or slices, not str================================ Human Message =================================

After Running The New foo_player.py Player, Here is my analysis and findings:

### Syntax Error Details:
- **Error Message**: `TypeError: list indices must be integers or slices, not str`
- **Exact Line Number**: Line 105 in `foo_player.py`
- **Exact Line of Code**: `if player_resources['brick'] >= 3 and player_resources['wood'] >= 3:`

### Root Cause:
The `player_resources` object retrieved using `get_player_freqdeck` is a list, but the code treats it as a dictionary with string keys (e.g., `'brick'`, `'wood'`). This mismatch causes a `TypeError`.

### Impact:
The syntax error prevents the game from running, resulting in no recorded game results or player performance data for this evolution.

### Suggested Resolution:
Convert `player_resources` to a dictionary format, or properly access elements using integer indices if it is indeed a list.

Let me know if you need anything else!================================== Ai Message ==================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Ensure accurate resource handling by correctly accessing the `player_resources` object in the game framework, eliminating all resource-related syntax errors. Stabilize FooPlayer to enable functional testing and iterative evaluation of strategies.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Resolve the `TypeError` in the `_compute_heuristic_scores` function by identifying the correct format for `player_resources` and updating resource access logic accordingly (either dictionary keys or list indices).

CHOSEN AGENT: RESEARCHER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:  
Investigate the structure and format of the `player_resources` object as retrieved by the `get_player_freqdeck` function or similar mechanisms. Specifically:
1. Determine whether `player_resources` is a list, dictionary, or another format.
2. Identify valid methods or attributes to access specific resource quantities (e.g., brick, wood, etc.).
3. Provide examples or pseudocode for correctly accessing resource quantities and updating the faulty code section in `_compute_heuristic_scores`.

Ensure clarity and comprehensiveness in the findings to address the issue efficiently.================================ Human Message =================================

RESEARCH:

### Structure and Format of `player_resources` Object
The `player_resources` object, as retrieved by the `get_player_freqdeck()` function in the `state_functions.py` file, is formatted as a **list**. Each entry represents the count of a specific resource type for the player. The order of resources in the list is consistent and predefined:
1. **Wood**
2. **Brick**
3. **Sheep**
4. **Wheat**
5. **Ore**

#### Example Usage:
```python
resources = get_player_freqdeck(state, Color.BLUE)

# Access specific resources
wood_count = resources[0]
brick_count = resources[1]
sheep_count = resources[2]
wheat_count = resources[3]
ore_count = resources[4]
```

---

### Valid Methods for Resource Access
Functions related to resource interactions (defined in `state_functions.py`):
1. **`get_player_freqdeck(state, color)`**: Returns a list with counts of the player's resources in the order `(WOOD, BRICK, SHEEP, WHEAT, ORE)`.
   
2. **`player_num_resource_cards(state, color, card=None)`**:
   - Retrieves the number of total resource cards if no `card` is specified.
   - If a specific resource (`card`) is provided (e.g., `WOOD`), it returns the count of that resource.
   ```python
   total_resources = player_num_resource_cards(state, Color.BLUE)
   wood_count = player_num_resource_cards(state, Color.BLUE, WOOD)
   ```

3. **`player_freqdeck_add(state, color, freqdeck)`**: Adds specified resources to the player's inventory.
   ```python
   freq_addition = [1, 2, 0, 0, 3]  # Adds 1 Wood, 2 Bricks, and 3 Ore
   player_freqdeck_add(state, Color.BLUE, freq_addition)
   ```

4. **`player_freqdeck_subtract(state, color, freqdeck)`**: Subtracts specified resources from the player's inventory.
   ```python
   freq_subtraction = [1, 0, 0, 1, 0]  # Removes 1 Wood and 1 Wheat
   player_freqdeck_subtract(state, Color.BLUE, freq_subtraction)
   ```

---

### Correcting `_compute_heuristic_scores`
#### Faulty Code Section:
Replace erroneous references to resource lookup mechanisms that assume dictionary-like or incorrect formats. The valid approach is indexing into the list returned by `get_player_freqdeck`.

#### Example Refactored Code:
```python
def _compute_heuristic_scores(state, color):
    # Retrieve player frequency deck (resources in hand)
    player_resources = get_player_freqdeck(state, color)

    # Example heuristic: prioritize wheat and ore for city-building
    wheat = player_resources[3]
    ore = player_resources[4]

    # Compute heuristic score based on resource availability
    score = wheat * 1.5 + ore * 2.0  # Weight Wheat: 1.5, Ore: 2.0
    return score
```

END RESEARCH.================================== Ai Message ==================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Ensure accurate resource management in `FooPlayer` by correctly using game framework methods to access and evaluate player resources, stabilizing the system for strategic improvement over the next evolutions.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Replace the incorrect dictionary-like reference (`player_resources['brick']`) with valid list-based indexing when accessing resource quantities. Update `_compute_heuristic_scores` to correctly evaluate resources using the resolved `player_resources` format.

CHOSEN AGENT: CODER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:
Refactor `foo_player.py` to fix the `TypeError` in `_compute_heuristic_scores`:

1. **Resource Retrieval**:
   - Replace the existing `player_resources['brick']` and `player_resources['wood']` references with valid list indices:
     - Brick: `player_resources[1]`
     - Wood: `player_resources[0]`

2. **Correct Scoring Logic**:
   - Adjust the conditional checks for resource availability (e.g., brick, wood) and ensure heuristic scores are calculated accurately using these list indices:
     ```python
     if player_resources[1] >= 3 and player_resources[0] >= 3:  # Brick and Wood
         heuristic_scores[action] += 5
     ```

3. **Testing Enhancements**:
   - Add print statements in `_compute_heuristic_scores` to log the retrieved resource counts and verify the heuristic decisions based on resource availability.

Once the refactoring is complete, test FooPlayer to ensure it runs without errors and validates the corrected resource handling logic.================================ Human Message =================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Improve the performance of the `FooPlayer.py` by introducing intelligent strategy logic that leverages the LLM for decision-making. Specifically, aim for a minimum win count of 1 within the next 5 iterations while improving VP, settlements, and measurable gameplay metrics.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Address the issue of the `decide` method defaulting to selecting the first action. Integrate the LLM's `query_llm` functionality to intelligently evaluate actions based on state and strategy.

CHOSEN AGENT: CODER

AGENT OBJECTIVE: 
The current implementation of `FooPlayer` is defaulting to selecting the first action, as evidenced by the repeated log message "Choosing First Action on Default." Modify the `decide` method to leverage the `self.llm.query_llm` functionality for decision-making. Specifically:

1. Replace the current first-action default with an implementation that:
   a. Obtains a list of possible actions from the game state.
   b. Queries the LLM (`self.llm.query_llm`) for the evaluation of these actions.
   c. Selects the most intelligent action based on the LLM's evaluation.

2. Ensure the decision logic is robust and includes handling scenarios such as:
   - No valid actions available.
   - LLM providing ambiguous or conflicting guidance (fallback mechanisms).

3. Include clear comments and logging to observe how the LLM is influencing decision-making.

Once done, provide the modified code to be tested.================================== Ai Message ==================================

CODER

### Changes Made:
1. **Replaced Default Action Selection**:
   - Removed the hardcoded `return playable_actions[0]` that selected the first action by default.

2. **Integrated LLM Decision-Making in `decide`**:
   - Constructed a comprehensive prompt using the `_build_prompt` function to provide the LLM with game state and available actions.
   - Queried the LLM using `self.llm.query_llm(prompt)`.
   - Parsed the LLM's response using the `_parse_llm_response` function to select the most appropriate action from the available options.

3. **Added New Helper Methods**:
   - `_build_prompt`: Constructs a prompt by including the current game state and the list of playable actions.
   - `_parse_llm_response`: Interprets the LLM's response to match it with one of the playable actions. If no match is found, defaults to the first action.

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Included error handling for cases where the LLM query fails or returns an ambiguous response. In such cases, the method defaults to selecting the first action.
   - Added logging to show the LLM's response (`print(f"LLM Response: {llm_response}")`) and fallback mechanisms.

5. **Logging and Debugging**:
   - Added print statements for better debugging and observation:
     - Log when no playable actions are available.
     - Log the LLM's raw response.
     - Log if the response is ambiguous or invalid, and the fallback action is selected.

### Notes for the Next Iteration:
- **Prompt Details**: The current `_build_prompt` function makes a basic serialization of the game state and actions. If the LLM struggles to prioritize or understand the game details, refining this prompt may be necessary.
- **LLM Error Responses**: If runtime timing issues with `query_llm` arise (e.g., long delays or failures), adjustment of query limits or timeouts may be needed.

### Testing Recommendations:
- Test how the LLM chooses actions in various scenarios to verify that the parsing logic aligns with actual gameplay.
- Monitor logs (`LLM Response: ...`) for unexpected behaviors or ambiguous responses.

END CODER================================ Human Message =================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Transition FooPlayer into a competitive player over the next 5 iterations by leveraging enhanced strategy, including heuristic reinforcement, refined LLM prompts, and deterministic fallback mechanisms, and targeting measurable improvements in average VP and win rates.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Implement **segmented contextual prompting** and heuristic-enhanced decision-making into the LLM integration (as per Strategy 1 and 4). Additionally, integrate a **ranked action hierarchy** as a fallback mechanism (Strategy 2).

CHOSEN AGENT: CODER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:  
Modify the `decide` method of `FooPlayer.py` to achieve the following:

1. **Refined LLM Prompt**: 
   - Update the `_build_prompt` function to use **segmented contextual prompting**. Include headers that describe the game state, available resources, and strategic goals. Example structure:
     ```
     Current Game State:
     - Player Stats: {resources}, {settlements}, {cities}, VP: {victory_points}
     - Opponent Stats: {opponent resources/blockades}, etc.
     Goal: Maximize VP while taking advantage of the current game state.
     Available Actions: {list of formatted playable actions}
     Respond with:
     Action: {Selected optimal action}
     Justification: {Reasoning behind the action choice}
     ```

2. **Heuristic Context Integration**:
   - In the `_build_prompt` method, compute heuristic scores (e.g., settlement value, city upgrade value, road extension value) for each action. Integrate these scores into the prompt to help the LLM make better decisions.

3. **Fallback Mechanism**:
   - Enhance `_parse_llm_response` to implement a **ranked action hierarchy** fallback mechanism when the LLM output is invalid or ambiguous. Example hierarchy:
     - Priority Order: Build City > Build Settlement > Build Road > End Turn.
     - If a valid option matching the LLM response is not found, return the first valid action in this priority order.

4. **Logging**:
   - Improve logging to capture the heuristic scores, the LLM prompt, its raw response, and the fallback decision (when necessary) for post-game analysis.

Once complete, test the updated `FooPlayer.py`, run games, and report the results.================================== Ai Message ==================================

CODER

### Changes Made:
1. **Refined LLM Prompt Construction**:
   - Enhanced the `_build_prompt` function to use **segmented contextual prompting** with detailed headers for game state, player stats, opponent stats, and available actions.
   - Integrated **heuristic scores** for each action into the prompt to guide the LLM decision-making.

2. **Heuristic Computation Method**:
   - Added a `_compute_heuristic_scores` helper method to assign heuristic values to each action based on action type (e.g., city-building prioritized over road-building).

3. **Improved Parsing Logic**:
   - Enhanced `_parse_llm_response` to return a matching action from the LLM response, or delegate to the fallback mechanism if no match is found.

4. **Ranked Fallback Mechanism**:
   - Implemented `_fallback_action` to evaluate actions in a priority order: Build City > Build Settlement > Build Road > End Turn.
   - Default to the first action only when no prioritized options exist.

5. **Logging**:
   - Added print statements throughout to capture key debugging information:
     - The LLM prompt.
     - Heuristic scores of actions.
     - The LLM's raw response.
     - Logs for fallback mechanism use.

6. **Error Handling Enhancements**:
   - Integrated robust exception handling in the `decide` method for LLM failures, with clear logging of fallbacks.

### Notes for the Next Iteration:
- Tune the **heuristic scores** if the LLM's decisions align poorly with optimal strategies.
- Monitor how well the LLM responds to the enhanced prompt structure during testing.
- Evaluate the fallback mechanism's efficiency in comparison to the LLM's responses.

### Testing Recommendations:
- Focus on scenarios requiring diverse strategic goals (e.g., blocking opponent moves, building towards Largest Army).
- Analyze logs for patterns in ambiguous or ineffective LLM responses, and refine prompts or fallback heuristics accordingly.

END CODER================================ Human Message =================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Ensure functionality and compatibility of FooPlayer with the Catanatron API while strengthening the LLM decision-making mechanism in a way that improves strategic performance over the next 5 iterations.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Integrate valid Catanatron API calls into `foo_player.py`'s `_build_prompt` method to fetch relevant game data like resources, settlements, cities, roads, and victory points, and resolve the current `AttributeError` preventing gameplay.

CHOSEN AGENT: CODER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:  
Resolve the `AttributeError` by replacing invalid calls in `foo_player.py` with Catanatron-compatible API calls as outlined in the research:

1. **Resources**:
   - Replace `game.get_player_resources(Color.BLUE)` with `get_player_freqdeck(state, Color.BLUE)` to fetch all resources for FooPlayer.
   - Use `player_num_resource_cards(state, Color.BLUE, resource)` to query specific resource counts.

2. **Settlements and Cities**:
   - Replace invalid calls for settlements/cities with:
     ```python
     get_player_buildings(state, Color.BLUE, "SETTLEMENT")
     get_player_buildings(state, Color.BLUE, "CITY")
     ```

3. **Victory Points and Roads**:
   - Retrieve victory points using:
     ```python
     vp = state.player_state[player_key(state, Color.BLUE) + "_ACTUAL_VICTORY_POINTS"]
     ```
   - Roads remaining:
     ```python
     roads_available = state.player_state[player_key(state, Color.BLUE) + "_ROADS_AVAILABLE"]
     ```

4. **General Updates to `_build_prompt`**:
   - Adjust the prompt to include all valid game stats, ensuring Catanatron API calls function.
   - Include resource counts, settlements, cities, roads, and VP in the formatted prompt structure.

5. **Debugging and Validation**:
   - Add logging to verify data retrieval accuracy during gameplay for resources, actions, and VP.
   - Run a test evolution to confirm the absence of runtime errors.

Update the code to reflect these changes and provide detailed debug logs during testing for validation.================================== Ai Message ==================================

### Changes Made:
1. **Replaced Invalid API Calls**:
   - Substituted `game.get_player_resources(Color.BLUE)` with `get_player_freqdeck(state, Color.BLUE)` to correctly fetch resources.
   - Similar replacements made for settlements, cities, victory points, and roads using valid Catanatron API functions: 
     - `get_player_buildings(state, Color.BLUE, "SETTLEMENT")` and `get_player_buildings(state, Color.BLUE, "CITY")` for settlements and cities.
     - Victory points accessed via `state.player_state[f"{player_key(state, Color.BLUE)}_ACTUAL_VICTORY_POINTS"]`.
     - Roads available via `state.player_state[f"{player_key(state, Color.BLUE)}_ROADS_AVAILABLE"]`.

2. **Updated `_build_prompt` Method**:
   - Included new resource and state-fetching methods in the prompt template.
   - Enhanced formatting to make the prompt explainable and consistent with the desired LLM input structure.

3. **Improved Compatibility**:
   - Refactored the game state integration in `_build_prompt` to align with valid methods reliably compatible with the API.

4. **Debugging Enhancements**:
   - Added detailed logging via print statements to verify accurate state data retrieval during gameplay (resources, settlements, cities, heuristic scores).
   - Included error handling for invalid or mismatched LLM responses.

### Notes for the Next Iteration:
- Test how well the new prompt structure works with the LLM's decision-making.
- Monitor logs for resource/state-fetch accuracy and potential mismatches between heuristic scores and LLM responses.

### Testing Recommendations:
- Verify that resources, settlements, cities, and other player stats from the state align with the game's current state through debugging outputs.
- Check if the fallback mechanism handles invalid or ambiguous LLM responses efficiently.

END CODER================================ Human Message =================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Implement a strategy that improves both early and late-game decision-making for FooPlayer through advanced heuristics, adjusted fallback mechanisms, and refined LLM prompts, achieving measurable improvements in metrics such as roads, settlements, and victory points.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Integrate enhanced heuristic scoring and dynamic fallback priorities into the decision flow while refining LLM responses for strategic action selection, focusing on VP growth and efficient resource use.

CHOSEN AGENT: CODER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:  
Modify FooPlayer to implement the strategies outlined in the five key areas. Specifically:

1. **Enhance Heuristic Scoring**:
   - Add multipliers for actions directly contributing to Victory Points, such as settlement building and city upgrading.
   - Dynamically adjust scores based on the game stage (early vs. late-game priorities), prioritizing roads and settlements early while focusing on VP-heavy actions late.

2. **Dynamic Fallback Mechanism**:
   - Revise the fallback mechanism to focus on early-game expansion via roads and settlements as placeholders for resource diversity and VP accumulation.
   - Later transition fallback logic to VP-centric actions like city upgrades and development cards.

3. **Refined LLM Prompt**:
   - Update the LLM prompt to emphasize VP growth explicitly.
   - Demand justification for actions based on Victory Points and strategic blocking of opponents.

4. **Resource Threshold Balancing**:
   - Introduce logic for maintaining resource reserves and diversifying investments based on available actions.
   - Trigger placeholder actions like road-building when strategic objectives are temporarily unattainable.

5. **Action Bottleneck Detection**:
   - Implement tracking logic for repetitive unproductive actions (e.g., repeated "END TURN").
   - Adjust decision scoring to discourage stagnation, forcing resource spending or defensive actions when necessary.

Make necessary modifications to the `decide` method and auxiliary functions like `_build_prompt` and `heuristic_scores`. Run a test iteration post-implementation to ensure that the changes positively impact FooPlayer performance.

Let me know when you're ready to test the updated player!================================ Human Message =================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Over the next 5 iterations, implement and refine a system that better aligns FooPlayer's heuristic evaluation, LLM prompt design, and fallback mechanisms towards impactful, VP-driven actions. Aim for measurable improvements in foundational metrics like roads, settlements, and cities.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Recalibrate FooPlayer's heuristic scoring system to implement stage-specific priorities and dynamically address bottlenecks, ensuring better alignment between heuristic-driven actions and LLM output. Update the LLM prompt design to explicitly focus on VP growth and reduce low-value decision patterns.

CHOSEN AGENT: CODER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:  
Update `foo_player.py` as follows:

1. **Enhanced Heuristic Scoring**: 
    - Modify `_compute_heuristic_scores` to include stage-specific priorities:
      - Early-game boosts for roads and settlements.
      - Late-game emphasis on cities and development cards.
    - Include dynamic bottle-neck handling, e.g.:
      - Reward actions that address resource buildup or stagnation.
      - Encourage actions that disrupt opponents (e.g., blocking roads/settlements).
    - Use tile values (6, 8, etc.) to boost settlement scores for strategic intersections.

2. **Refined LLM Prompt**:
    - Update `_build_prompt` with stronger emphasis on guiding actions toward VP and strategic goals:
      - Enumerate priorities explicitly: building roads, settlements, cities.
      - Include heuristic scores in the prompt with descriptions of why actions are valuable.
      - Penalize repetitive actions like "END TURN" through explicit discouragement in the prompt.

3. **Fallback Mechanism Adjustment**:
    - Introduce deterministic templates for stage-specific fallback actions:
      - Early-game: Prioritize roads and settlements for expansion.
      - Late-game: Focus on cities and VP-centric actions.
    - Dynamically adapt fallback decisions based on resource surplus or game state bottlenecks.
    ```python
    if player_resources["brick"] >= 3 and player_resources["wood"] >= 3:
        heuristic_scores[ActionType.BUILD_ROAD] += 5
    ```

4. **Action Bottleneck Detection**:
    - Add detection for repetitive or stagnating actions (e.g., unspent resources or repeated "END TURN").
    - Penalize stagnation by prioritizing resource expenditure and spatial expansion.

Upon completing the updates, test the revised player for functional improvements in decision-making, focusing on roads, settlements, and overall strategic progression.================================== Ai Message ==================================

CODER

### Updates to `foo_player.py`:
1. **Enhanced Heuristic Scoring**:
   - Integrated stage-specific priorities (e.g., roads and settlements emphasized early-game, cities in mid-late game).
   - Added bonuses for high-resource tiles in settlement actions.
   - Introduced penalties to address resource bottlenecks (e.g., surplus brick/wood triggers road-building incentives).
   - Incorporated logic to dynamically adjust scores based on resource availability and VP contributions.

2. **Refined LLM Prompt**:
   - Redesigned `_build_prompt` to better guide the LLM:
     - Explicit priorities for strategic actions based on Victory Point (VP) growth.
     - Highlighted roadmap for early-game road/settlement building and late-game upgrades.
     - Discouraged repetitive or non-impactful actions like unnecessary turns.
   - Included heuristic scores in the prompt, with explanations for why certain actions are prioritized.

3. **Dynamic Fallback Mechanism**:
   - Structured fallback logic to prioritize actions based on game state:
     - Early-game: Roads and settlements.
     - Late-game: Cities and VP-centric actions.
   - Updated fallback mechanism to prevent stagnation by using deterministic templates blended with heuristic-driven conditions.

4. **Bottleneck and Surplus Resource Handling**:
   - Added logic to detect and dynamically handle situations where surplus resources exist (e.g., incentivizing road-building on excess brick/wood).
   - Increased priority for settlement or city building to resolve resource stagnation.

5. **Improved Logs**:
   - Added meaningful print statements across key decision-making steps to facilitate debugging:
     - Fallback actions.
     - Detected bottlenecks or resource imbalances.
     - LLM responses (and when fallback mechanisms are triggered).

### Testing Suggestions:
- **Evaluate Decision Quality**:
  - Test early-game actions for expansion focus (roads and settlements).
  - Verify mid-to-late game actions prioritize cities and VP-centric plays.
- **Monitor Bottleneck Response**:
  - Simulate resource-rich scenarios to observe if surplus resources are properly spent.
- **Validate Fallback Logic**:
  - Conduct games where the LLM fails or incorrectly parses the prompt to assess fallback success.
- **Track Metrics**:
  - Compare average VP, settlements, and city counts across multiple iterations to previous versions.

### Next Steps:
- Refine heuristic weights after testing to balance strategic trade-offs.
- Incorporate feedback cycles to analyze and further tune prompt alignment with heuristic evaluations.
- Observe repetitive "END TURN" penalties and ensure they improve game progression.

END CODER================================ Human Message =================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Ensure compatibility with the Catanatron API by appropriately integrating valid attributes of the `Action` class and utilizing game state data to enhance decision-making. Achieve stable functionality for testing strategic performance over the next 5 iterations.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Correct the `AttributeError` by refactoring `foo_player.py` to rely on valid `Action.value` attributes or query relevant context from the `State` class for heuristic scoring. Ensure all references to `location` are replaced with valid methods to retrieve positional or resource data.

CHOSEN AGENT: CODER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:
Refactor `foo_player.py` to address the syntax error and improve heuristic scoring:

1. **Fix Invalid References**:
   - Replace all calls to the nonexistent `action.location` with queries to `Action.value` or `State` methods.
   - Example adjustments:
     ```python
     if action.action_type == ActionType.BUILD_SETTLEMENT and len(state.board.map.adjacent_tiles[action.value]) > threshold:
         heuristic_scores[action] += 3
     ```
     Here, `action.value` provides the node ID where the settlement would be built.

2. **Context Retrieval from State**:
   - For actions like `BUILD_SETTLEMENT` or `BUILD_CITY`, retrieve adjacent tiles and their resource values using `state.board.map.adjacent_tiles[action.value]`.
   - For roads, use `Action.value` to access edge information and query connected tiles.

3. **Heuristic Scoring Enhancements**:
   - Incorporate valid context details from the state or action attributes to refine heuristic scoring:
     - High-value tiles should boost settlement scores:
       ```python
       adjacent_resources = [tile.resource for tile in state.board.map.adjacent_tiles[action.value] if tile.resource is not None]
       resource_bonus = sum(tile.value for resource in adjacent_resources)
       heuristic_scores[action] += resource_bonus
       ```

4. **Debugging and Validation**:
   - Ensure all invalid references are replaced with valid calls.
   - Add debug print statements to verify successful access to `Action.value` or state functions during gameplay.

Once refactoring is complete, test FooPlayer to confirm it runs without errors and demonstrate functional heuristic scoring improvements.================================== Ai Message ==================================

CODER

### Summary of Changes:
1. **Fixed `AttributeError`**:
   - Replaced invalid references to `action.location` with valid attribute and context retrieval using `action.value` and game state methods (e.g., accessing `state.board.map.adjacent_tiles` for settlement scoring).

2. **Improved Settlement Scoring**:
   - Enhanced `_compute_heuristic_scores` to calculate bonuses for settlements based on adjacent tiles' resource values using `state.board.map.adjacent_tiles[action.value]`.

3. **Resource Bottleneck Handling**:
   - Retained logic for surplus brick/wood to incentivize road-building.

4. **Improved Debugging**:
   - Added specific print statements during fallback and heuristic computation to verify logic.

5. **Dynamic Heuristic Refinements**:
   - Settlement scoring dynamically adjusts based on adjacent tile values, improving action prioritization.

### Testing Plan:
- Verify that the game runs without errors.
- Validate heuristic score calculations for settlements and roads using logs.
- Test gameplay performance:
  - Early-game: Expansion (settlements and roads).
  - Late-game: City-building and VP growth.

Let me know if the updated player behaves as expected or requires further refinements.

END CODER================================ Human Message =================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Ensure stable heuristic scoring for FooPlayer by correctly accessing valid attributes of `LandTile` and utilizing game state methods (e.g., `adjacent_tiles`) to compute bonuses for settlements and roads. Refine gameplay to support functional testing over the next 5 iterations.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Replace the incorrect reference to `tile.value` in heuristic scoring with valid queries to `tile.resource`, `tile.number`, and `number_probability()` to calculate bonuses for adjacent tiles when evaluating settlement actions.

CHOSEN AGENT: CODER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:
Refactor `foo_player.py` to fix the error and improve scoring calculations:

1. **Correct Tile Context Retrieval**:
   - Replace all calls to `tile.value` with queries to valid attributes of `LandTile`, such as `tile.resource` for resource type or `tile.number` for dice roll probability.
   - Use `game.state.board.adjacent_tiles[node_id]` to get tiles surrounding the node at which a settlement or city is to be built.
   - Example adjustment:
     ```python
     adjacent_tiles = game.state.board.adjacent_tiles[action.value]
     resource_bonus = sum(number_probability(tile.number) for tile in adjacent_tiles if tile.resource is not None)
     heuristic_scores[action] += resource_bonus
     ```

2. **Enhance Settlement Scoring**:
   - Calculate settlement scores dynamically based on cumulative resource probabilities from adjacent tiles (using `number_probability()` and `tile.resource`).
   - Adjust `_compute_heuristic_scores` to include valid resource bonuses:
     ```python
     for action in playable_actions:
         if action.action_type == ActionType.BUILD_SETTLEMENT:
             adjacent_tiles = game.state.board.adjacent_tiles[action.value]
             resource_bonus = sum(number_probability(tile.number) for tile in adjacent_tiles if tile.resource is not None)
             heuristic_scores[action] = 10 + resource_bonus
     ```

3. **Validate Heuristic Scoring**:
   - Ensure all logic runs smoothly, avoiding invalid calls or attributes.
   - Add debug print statements to log computed bonuses during gameplay.

Once implemented, test FooPlayer for functionality and measure changes in heuristic-driven decision-making across multiple iterations.================================== Ai Message ==================================

CODER

### Changes Made:
1. **Resolved `AttributeError`**:
   - Replaced previous invalid references to `tile.value` with `number_probability(tile.number)` from the `LandTile` class to compute bonuses based on tile probabilities.

2. **Updated Heuristic Scoring Logic**:
   - Settlement bonuses now dynamically evaluate adjacent tiles using `state.board.adjacent_tiles[action.value]`.
   - Bonuses are calculated based on valid attributes (`tile.resource` and `tile.number`) using `number_probability()`.

3. **Improved Resource Bottleneck Handling**:
   - Retained logic to incentivize road-building when brick and wood resources are in surplus.

4. **Debug Enhancements**:
   - Added clear print statements to log heuristic scores and fallback decisions.

### Notes for Testing:
- Confirm stability and functionality of the game simulation without syntax errors.
- Test heuristic scoring improvements, observing early-game settlement expansion and resource optimization.
- Validate fallback mechanism functionality when a valid LLM response is not received.

END CODER================================ Human Message =================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Leverage `CatanMap` utilities like `adjacent_tiles` and `node_production` to accurately compute node-specific resource bonuses for heuristic scoring. Stabilize FooPlayer to run without errors and refine its strategic behaviors.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Replace the invalid `state.board.adjacent_tiles` reference in `_compute_heuristic_scores` with a valid call to `game.state.board.map.adjacent_tiles` or leverage `node_production` for simplified resource-based scoring. Prioritize stability and alignment with Catanatron's API.

CHOSEN AGENT: CODER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:
Refactor `foo_player.py` to resolve the `AttributeError` and improve heuristic scoring:

1. **Correct Context Access**:
   - Replace the invalid `state.board.adjacent_tiles[action.value]` with valid methods:
     - Use `game.state.board.map.adjacent_tiles[action.value]` to retrieve adjacent tiles for the node (correcting the error).
     - Alternatively, use `game.state.board.map.node_production[action.value]` for precomputed resource probabilities at a node.

2. **Update Node-Specific Scoring Logic**:
   - If using `adjacent_tiles`, query each tile’s `resource` and `number` attributes and compute bonuses based on `number_probability(tile.number)`. Example:
     ```python
     adjacent_tiles = game.state.board.map.adjacent_tiles[action.value]
     resource_bonus = sum(number_probability(tile.number) for tile in adjacent_tiles if tile.resource is not None)
     ```
   - If using `node_production`, calculate a cumulative production score:
     ```python
     resource_production = game.state.board.map.node_production[action.value]
     resource_bonus = sum(resource_production[resource] * RESOURCE_WEIGHTS[resource] for resource in resource_production)
     ```

3. **Testing and Debugging Enhancements**:
   - Add debug print statements to verify retrieved tile data and computed scores.
   - Ensure heuristic-driven behaviors align with expected strategic priorities (e.g., roads, settlements, VP growth).

After implementing these changes, test FooPlayer for stability and validate heuristic-driven decision-making during game simulations.================================== Ai Message ==================================

TypeError: list indices must be integers or slices, not str================================ Human Message =================================

After Running The New foo_player.py Player, Here is my analysis and findings:

### Syntax Error Details:
- **Error Message**: `TypeError: list indices must be integers or slices, not str`
- **Exact Line Number**: Line 105 in `foo_player.py`
- **Exact Line of Code**: `if player_resources['brick'] >= 3 and player_resources['wood'] >= 3:`

### Root Cause:
The `player_resources` object retrieved using `get_player_freqdeck` is a list, but the code treats it as a dictionary with string keys (e.g., `'brick'`, `'wood'`). This mismatch causes a `TypeError`.

### Impact:
The syntax error prevents the game from running, resulting in no recorded game results or player performance data for this evolution.

### Suggested Resolution:
Convert `player_resources` to a dictionary format, or properly access elements using integer indices if it is indeed a list.

Let me know if you need anything else!================================== Ai Message ==================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Ensure accurate resource handling by correctly accessing the `player_resources` object in the game framework, eliminating all resource-related syntax errors. Stabilize FooPlayer to enable functional testing and iterative evaluation of strategies.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Resolve the `TypeError` in the `_compute_heuristic_scores` function by identifying the correct format for `player_resources` and updating resource access logic accordingly (either dictionary keys or list indices).

CHOSEN AGENT: RESEARCHER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:  
Investigate the structure and format of the `player_resources` object as retrieved by the `get_player_freqdeck` function or similar mechanisms. Specifically:
1. Determine whether `player_resources` is a list, dictionary, or another format.
2. Identify valid methods or attributes to access specific resource quantities (e.g., brick, wood, etc.).
3. Provide examples or pseudocode for correctly accessing resource quantities and updating the faulty code section in `_compute_heuristic_scores`.

Ensure clarity and comprehensiveness in the findings to address the issue efficiently.================================ Human Message =================================

RESEARCH:

### Structure and Format of `player_resources` Object
The `player_resources` object, as retrieved by the `get_player_freqdeck()` function in the `state_functions.py` file, is formatted as a **list**. Each entry represents the count of a specific resource type for the player. The order of resources in the list is consistent and predefined:
1. **Wood**
2. **Brick**
3. **Sheep**
4. **Wheat**
5. **Ore**

#### Example Usage:
```python
resources = get_player_freqdeck(state, Color.BLUE)

# Access specific resources
wood_count = resources[0]
brick_count = resources[1]
sheep_count = resources[2]
wheat_count = resources[3]
ore_count = resources[4]
```

---

### Valid Methods for Resource Access
Functions related to resource interactions (defined in `state_functions.py`):
1. **`get_player_freqdeck(state, color)`**: Returns a list with counts of the player's resources in the order `(WOOD, BRICK, SHEEP, WHEAT, ORE)`.
   
2. **`player_num_resource_cards(state, color, card=None)`**:
   - Retrieves the number of total resource cards if no `card` is specified.
   - If a specific resource (`card`) is provided (e.g., `WOOD`), it returns the count of that resource.
   ```python
   total_resources = player_num_resource_cards(state, Color.BLUE)
   wood_count = player_num_resource_cards(state, Color.BLUE, WOOD)
   ```

3. **`player_freqdeck_add(state, color, freqdeck)`**: Adds specified resources to the player's inventory.
   ```python
   freq_addition = [1, 2, 0, 0, 3]  # Adds 1 Wood, 2 Bricks, and 3 Ore
   player_freqdeck_add(state, Color.BLUE, freq_addition)
   ```

4. **`player_freqdeck_subtract(state, color, freqdeck)`**: Subtracts specified resources from the player's inventory.
   ```python
   freq_subtraction = [1, 0, 0, 1, 0]  # Removes 1 Wood and 1 Wheat
   player_freqdeck_subtract(state, Color.BLUE, freq_subtraction)
   ```

---

### Correcting `_compute_heuristic_scores`
#### Faulty Code Section:
Replace erroneous references to resource lookup mechanisms that assume dictionary-like or incorrect formats. The valid approach is indexing into the list returned by `get_player_freqdeck`.

#### Example Refactored Code:
```python
def _compute_heuristic_scores(state, color):
    # Retrieve player frequency deck (resources in hand)
    player_resources = get_player_freqdeck(state, color)

    # Example heuristic: prioritize wheat and ore for city-building
    wheat = player_resources[3]
    ore = player_resources[4]

    # Compute heuristic score based on resource availability
    score = wheat * 1.5 + ore * 2.0  # Weight Wheat: 1.5, Ore: 2.0
    return score
```

---

### References:
1. **`catanatron_core/catanatron/state_functions.py`**:
   - Full implementation of resource functions (e.g., `get_player_freqdeck`, `player_num_resource_cards`, `player_freqdeck_add`, `player_freqdeck_subtract`).
2. **`catanatron_core/catanatron/models/player.py`**:
   - Defines player structure but primarily interacts with the game's logic for decisions.

END RESEARCH.================================== Ai Message ==================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Ensure accurate resource management in `FooPlayer` by correctly using game framework methods to access and evaluate player resources, stabilizing the system for strategic improvement over the next evolutions.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Replace the incorrect dictionary-like reference (`player_resources['brick']`) with valid list-based indexing when accessing resource quantities. Update `_compute_heuristic_scores` to correctly evaluate resources using the resolved `player_resources` format.

CHOSEN AGENT: CODER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:
Refactor `foo_player.py` to fix the `TypeError` in `_compute_heuristic_scores`:

1. **Resource Retrieval**:
   - Replace the existing `player_resources['brick']` and `player_resources['wood']` references with valid list indices:
     - Brick: `player_resources[1]`
     - Wood: `player_resources[0]`

2. **Correct Scoring Logic**:
   - Adjust the conditional checks for resource availability (e.g., brick, wood) and ensure heuristic scores are calculated accurately using these list indices:
     ```python
     if player_resources[1] >= 3 and player_resources[0] >= 3:  # Brick and Wood
         heuristic_scores[action] += 5
     ```

3. **Testing Enhancements**:
   - Add print statements in `_compute_heuristic_scores` to log the retrieved resource counts and verify the heuristic decisions based on resource availability.

Once the refactoring is complete, test FooPlayer to ensure it runs without errors and validates the corrected resource handling logic.================================ Human Message =================================

### Updates Applied:
1. **Fixed Resource Access Logic**:
   - Corrected resource indexing errors in `_compute_heuristic_scores`:
     - Replaced dictionary-like access with proper list indices for `player_resources` (e.g., `[0]` for wood and `[1]` for brick).
     - Ensured proper referencing for ore and wheat when computing development card scores.

2. **Correct Context Retrieval for Adjacent Tiles**:
   - Replaced incorrect `state.board.adjacent_tiles` with `game.state.board.map.adjacent_tiles[node_id]` for settlement scoring.
   - Verified correct tile-level bonuses using `number_probability(tile.number)`.

3. **Enhanced Heuristic Scoring**:
   - Refined settlement evaluation to dynamically compute resource bonuses based on tile probabilities of adjacent nodes.
   - Adjusted road-building heuristics to prioritize spending surplus brick and wood.

4. **Debug and Stability**:
   - Ensured functional fallback mechanisms for invalid or ambiguous LLM responses.
   - Added robust resource handling with fail-safe mechanisms to avoid runtime errors.

### Notes for Testing:
1. Ensure the game simulation runs without `TypeError` or similar errors.
2. Validate heuristic calculations during settlement and road-building to confirm alignment with strategic priorities.
3. Observe resource-based bottleneck handling and fallback mechanisms' behavior when LLM responses fail.

After Running The New foo_player.py Player, Here is my analysis and findings:

### Scores of FooPlayer:
- Wins: 0
- Average Victory Points (VP): 2.0
- Average Settlements: 2.0
- Average Cities: 0.0
- Average Roads: 0.0
- Average Largest Army: 0.0
- Average Development VP: 0.0

### Short Analysis of Game Output:
- The phrase "Choosing First Action on Default" repeated throughout the log suggests that the implementation is defaulting to selecting the first action without strategy. 
- Results indicate poor performance compared to the opponent, with no victories achieved in the 3-game session. 

### Errors, Warnings, or Signs of Implementation Issues:
- **Implementation Warning**: The log shows "Choosing First Action on Default" continuously, indicating that the `decide` method is not leveraging the LLM integration (`self.llm.query_llm`) for decision-making.
- **Gameplay Warning**: The score disparity (2 VP versus 10 VP for the opponent) and the lack of progression in Cities, Roads, and Largest Army metrics highlight a lack of strategy execution.

- Wins: 0  
- Average Victory Points (VP): 3.33  
- Average Settlements: 2.33  
- Average Cities: 0.33  
- Average Roads: 0.0  
- Average Largest Army: 0.0  
- Average Development VP: 0.33  

### Short Analysis of Game Output:
- The LLM consistently failed to provide valid or actionable responses: "LLM response ambiguous or invalid. Defaulting to first action."
- FooPlayer defaulted to the first available action in all scenarios instead of executing strategic decisions.
- The performance difference is stark: FooPlayer had no wins and significantly lower VP compared to AlphaBetaPlayer.

### Errors, Warnings, or Signs of Implementation Issues:
- **LLM Integration Issue**: LLM responses are not being parsed correctly or are poorly generated, leading to fallback actions ("Defaulting to first action").
- **Decision-Making Deficiency**: The lack of strategic outcomes (e.g., 0 roads, 0 Largest Army) suggests serious shortcomings in action planning and execution.
- **Repeated Logs**: Multiple instances of ambiguous LLM responses point to insufficient prompt design or response parsing mechanism in `_parse_llm_response`.

After Running The New foo_player.py Player, Here is my analysis and findings:

### Syntax Error Details:
- **Error Message**: `AttributeError: 'Game' object has no attribute 'get_player_resources'`
- **Exact Line Number**: Line 84 in `foo_player.py`
- **Exact Line of Code**: `resources=str(game.get_player_resources(Color.BLUE)),  # Example method to get resources`

### Root Cause:
The method `get_player_resources` is being called on the `Game` object, but it does not exist in the `Game` class, leading to an `AttributeError`. This indicates a mismatch between the game's API and the implementation in `foo_player.py`.

### Impact:
The syntax error prevents the game from running, and thus no game results were recorded for this evolution.

- Average Cities: 0.33  
- Average Roads: 0.0

### Short Analysis of Game Output:
- **LLM Interaction**: The LLM responded consistently, but gameplay justification often involved executing mandatory or default actions (e.g., "ROLL" and "END TURN"), suggesting limited strategic depth.
- **Interesting Output**: The heuristic scoring mechanism categorizes actions clearly, but no significant changes to gameplay performance reflect deeper strategy execution.
- **Signs of Issue**: No roads or army development indicates repeated failure to invest strategically in growth areas, despite consistent heuristic scoring.

### Errors, Warnings, or Signs of Implementation Issues:
- **Strategic Weakness**: The absence of victories and poor metrics like roads and army raises concerns about the decision-making quality. 
- **Heuristic Misalignment**: High heuristic scores for actions like "BUILD_ROAD" occasionally appear in the logs but fail to translate into meaningful gameplay progression.

### Short Analysis of Game Output:
- **Repetitive Logs**: Multiple instances of LLM responses defaulting to basic actions such as "ROLL" and "END TURN," with justifications suggesting limited strategic depth. Example: "Rolling is necessary to progress the game state."
- **Neutral Heuristic Scoring**: Actions often evaluated with a low heuristic score (`1`). This indicates the heuristic system fails to differentiate between strategic actions.
- **Misalignment**: High-priority actions like "BUILD_CITY" or "BUILD_SETTLEMENT" seem underutilized, despite occasional high heuristic scores visible in logs. 

### Errors, Warnings, or Signs of Implementation Issues:
- **LLM Integration Weakness**: Responses imply poor decision quality by prioritizing roll/end-turn actions excessively. This indicates the prompt design and parsing mechanisms need refinement.
- **Strategic Gaps**: Failure to build roads or utilize army resources, even across multiple turns, suggests severe strategic deficiencies. The game log reinforces these gaps.
- **Warning**: Logs frequently state "Fallback mechanism applied," implying reliance on basic action prioritization rather than effective LLM outputs.

This is the current game_output.txt file

pe=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

**Justification:**  
Given the current game state:
1. You lack sufficient resources to take impactful actions (e.g., building a settlement, road, or upgrading to a city). The resource pool [0, 3, 1, 0, 2] does not permit major progress based on standard Catan gameplay rules.
2. Playing a Knight Card in this scenario has a heuristic score of 1, matching the score for ending the turn. However, there is no immediate strategic advantage to deploying the Knight Card. There is nothing to block, steal, or redirect at this moment that aligns with the stated priorities (maximize VP and expansion strategies).
3. Ending the turn efficiently cycles to your next turn, stopping you from delaying progress and allowing you to gather more resources via dice rolls or trades on subsequent turns.

While both actions have the same heuristic score, "end turn" helps maintain momentum without squandering potentially valuable tools (like the Knight Card) for minimal return.
LLM Response: Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

Justification: Rolling the dice helps advance the game state by producing resources, which are essential for building settlements, roads, or upgrading to cities—all key actions for maximizing Victory Points. Though playing a Knight card could block opponents, there is no strategic advantage to doing so right now, as resource generation is the most pressing objective for growth. Since both actions have equal heuristic scores, rolling aligns better with the early-game priority to expand for resource diversity.
LLM Response: ### Action:
**Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('ORE', 'ORE', 'ORE', 'ORE', 'WHEAT'))**

### Justification:
1. **Resource Optimization for VP Growth:**
   - You currently have 0 wheat, which is crucial for building **settlements** (1 wheat, 1 wood, 1 brick, 1 sheep) or upgrading settlements to **cities** (2 wheat, 3 ore).
   - Trading 4 ore for 1 wheat balances your resource pool and enables you to plan for settlement expansion or city upgrades.

2. **Aligning with Catanatron Priorities:**
   - The top priority is building settlements and roads early. These require resource diversity (brick, wood, sheep, and wheat), and you’re missing wheat to progress. Collecting wheat now positions you to act efficiently in future turns.
   - Upgrading settlements to cities (priority #2) also requires wheat and ore. Although you don’t currently have settlements, securing wheat for this purpose keeps your path to VP growth on track.

3. **Avoiding Low-impact Actions:**
   - Ending the turn without trading wastes an opportunity to improve resource diversity.
   - Playing the knight card doesn’t contribute directly to VP growth or resource optimization at this stage.
   - Other maritime trade options (wood, sheep, brick) are less beneficial because you already have ample sheep and brick, and wood doesn’t directly aid city upgrades or settlement building.

In summary, trading for wheat supports resource diversity and keeps you aligned with priority #1, setting the stage for settlement expansion and eventual city upgrades for higher VP returns.
LLM Response: **Action:** Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

**Justification:**  
Given the game state, you currently have insufficient resources to build a settlement (which requires a mix of resources like brick, wood, wheat, and sheep) or upgrade a settlement to a city (which requires 2 wheat and 3 ore). Your resource pool ([0, 3, 3, 1, 0]) lacks the necessary diversity to take significant actions, and no other impactful choice is available at this moment. 

The only other action, "PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD," has a low heuristic score (1), and no clear advantage is provided by playing it now, as it does not directly contribute to VP growth or resource acquisition. Ending your turn allows you to gather new resources during the next round, potentially enabling stronger actions to boost VP. This avoids wasting limited card options or resources that might be strategically useful later.
LLM Response: Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

Justification: Rolling the dice is the most impactful action in this scenario because it progresses the game by generating resources, which are essential for building settlements, roads, and upgrading to cities. Since the current resource pool is insufficient to execute strategic objectives (e.g., building settlements or upgrading to cities), rolling is necessary to obtain the resources needed to take meaningful next steps toward maximizing VP. Playing the knight card at this time is a low-impact choice as there is no indication in the game state that blocking opponents or stealing resources via the robber is strategically urgent. Thus, rolling the dice aligns with the objective of resource accumulation and advancing toward higher-priority actions for VP growth.
LLM Response: ### Action:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUY_DEVELOPMENT_CARD: 'BUY_DEVELOPMENT_CARD'>, value=None)

### Justification:
The primary objective is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently, and the heuristic score for buying a development card (score = 7) outweighs all other options. Here's the reasoning step-by-step:

1. **Resource Analysis**:  
   You have sufficient resources to buy a development card (1 Ore, 1 Wheat, 1 Sheep). This aligns with utilizing resources effectively instead of stockpiling them unnecessarily.

2. **Action Prioritization**:  
   While building settlements or upgrading to cities is ideal for early/mid-game VP growth, no immediate action here allows for these. Roads are also currently irrelevant as there are no unclaimed intersections or paths for settlement expansion listed in the game state. Thus, the focus shifts to secondary actions for VP growth, like obtaining development cards.

3. **Development Cards' Benefits**:  
   Development cards can provide:
   - **Victory Points**: Adding to your VP total directly.
   - **Knights**: Contributing towards the largest army and gaining VP later.
   - Other bonuses: Road building or resource monopolization.
   Thus, they are a high-value investment when other actions are not immediately productive.

4. **Discarding Less Impactful Actions**:
   - **Maritime Trade**: Trading four bricks for one resource is inefficient and does not directly contribute to VP or strategic expansion presently.
   - **End Turn**: Wasting your turn without taking proactive actions to utilize resources is suboptimal.
   - **Play Knight Card**: No strategic benefit currently unless it helps you claim the largest army (which this situation does not suggest).

By buying a development card, you take a proactive and impactful step toward growing your Victory Points directly (through VP cards) or indirectly (through knights or other card benefits).
LLM Response: Given the current game state and priorities, I'll evaluate the possible actions to determine the optimal choice.

### Analysis:
1. **Current Resources**: [0 BRICK, 5 WHEAT, 2 WOOD, 0 ORE, 1 SHEEP]
   - At this time, you lack BRICK, which is necessary for building roads and settlements. Maritime trade could help acquire a BRICK or another needed resource.
   - WHEAT (5) is abundant, allowing for potential trades to diversify resources.
2. **Victory Points and Expansion**:
   - With no available settlements and only cities on the board, the highest priority should be either expanding for resource diversity (building settlements or roads) or preparing for further upgrades.
   - Roads are a prerequisite for building new settlements, so gathering BRICK and WOOD should be prioritized.

3. **Available Actions**:
   - **Play Knight Card**: No immediate benefit given the board state.
   - **End Turn**: Premature and does not advance the game.
   - **Maritime Trade for SHEEP, WHEAT, WOOD, ORE**: Not helpful unless a settlement or road can be built this turn.
   - **Maritime Trade for BRICK**: Logical action, as it sets up road building. Roads are a critical step toward building settlements, which directly increases VP.

4. **Goal Alignment**:
   - Building roads and settlements aligns with Priority 1 (expansion for resource diversity).
   - Maritime Trade for BRICK stands out as the optimal action, as you can then accumulate resources for roads and settlements.

---

### Recommendation:

**Action**: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('BRICK', 'BRICK', 'BRICK', 'BRICK', 'BRICK'))

**Justification**:
- Trading WHEAT to acquire BRICK allows you to prepare for road construction immediately or in future turns.
- Roads are essential for expanding to new settlement locations, which grants resource diversity and VP growth.
- This action adheres to your goal of efficiently maximizing VP by prioritizing expansion over ending the turn or performing low-impact actions.

LLM response ambiguous or invalid. Defaulting to fallback mechanism.
Fallback: Chose action Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None) based on priority order.
LLM Response: ### Action: `Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.DISCARD: 'DISCARD'>, value=None)`

### Justification:
In the present game state, there appears to be only one action available (`DISCARD`) with a heuristic score of 1. While discarding resources appears counterintuitive to progressing Victory Points (VP), it is a forced action in this case due to game mechanics, likely triggered by exceeding the resource limit after the Robber was activated. Discarding specific resources might enable future strategic adjustments to better align with the priorities:

1. Analyzing current resources: [0, 5, 2, 0, 1], where:
   - 0: Brick
   - 5: Wood
   - 2: Sheep
   - 0: Wheat
   - 1: Ore

   You are disproportionately heavy on wood (5). By discarding excess wood, you can balance your resource pool while retaining diversity, allowing more flexibility for building settlements or roads after this round.

2. Immediate priorities:
   - Since there’s an imbalance in resource distribution and the heuristic score points to `DISCARD`, this action is necessary. Afterward, we can refocus on saving for settlements or roads, as these are the most VP-efficient moves early in the game.

**Note**: Once the discard is complete, your resource strategy should shift toward obtaining brick and wheat to enable foundational settlement-building actions.
LLM Response: **Action:** Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)  
**Justification:** Rolling is the optimal choice because it allows resources to be generated for all players, including yourself. Since your current resource situation is insufficient to build settlements, roads, or upgrade cities (you lack diversity and quantity), rolling the dice creates the potential to obtain the necessary resources. Playing a Knight Card would currently have minimal impact, as its heuristic score is equally low and it doesn't directly contribute to VP growth or resource acquisition in your current game state. Rolling aligns with priority #1 (expanding resource diversity).
LLM Response: Based on the provided game state and priorities, let's evaluate the situation:

**Game Analysis:**
- **Resources:** You currently have [0, 2, 1, 2, 0] (brick, wood, sheep, wheat, ore). You're low on brick and ore, which are essential for settlements and cities.
- **Settlements:** None yet. Building settlements would expand your resource diversity and is key for stage 1 of your strategy.
- **Cities:** You already have two cities (hexes 23 and 16), which strengthens your resource generation but means expansion is necessary to secure diversity.
- **VP Focus:** You are at 7 VP and need to continue an upward path toward winning (10 VP or more typically wins a game).
- **Actions:** The only immediate choices are playing a Knight card or ending your turn.

**Action Evaluation:**
1. **Play Knight Card:** This allows you to move the robber to block an opponent's resource generation. Using this strategically on a key opponent's highest-producing tile could slow their progress. However, there’s no clear mention of opponent strength or their tiles in the game state, so the impact is ambiguous. Additionally, it does not directly contribute to your own VP growth unless it helps you chase Largest Army.
2. **End Turn:** Without the ability to build roads, settlements, or trade, ending the turn is the default low-impact action. However, avoiding unnecessary turn-ending is crucial to maintain momentum.

**Optimal Move:**

**Action:** Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD: 'PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD'>, value=None)

**Justification:**
- Playing the Knight card allows you to reposition the robber and potentially block a strong opponent's progress by cutting their resource generation. This can be strategically advantageous in the longer term.
- This action also contributes to pursuing the **Largest Army bonus (+2 VP)** if you accumulate 3 Knight card plays. It is less passive than simply ending your turn and aligns better with the goal of maximizing your VP efficiently.
LLM Response: ### Action:
`Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MOVE_ROBBER: 'MOVE_ROBBER'>, value=((1, -1, 0), <Color.RED: 'RED'>, None))`

---

### Justification:

1. **Strategic Priority 1: Block Opponent Progress**
   - Moving the robber to a hex controlled by **Color.RED** reduces their ability to gather resources, particularly if the hex they rely on frequently is targeted. This action directly interferes with their ability to build settlements or upgrade cities, indirectly strengthening our position.
   - The `(1, -1, 0)` hex seems to be a valid target as it is one of many locations where **Color.RED** operates. It’s ideal to prioritize interfering with **Color.RED** because no other players are explicitly mentioned as threats.

2. **Avoiding Low-Impact Actions**
   - Moving the robber to a hex not controlled by anyone or to an empty location (e.g., `((0, 0, 0), None, None)` or other hexes with `None`) does not create an immediate impact on resource dynamics, making it a suboptimal choice. This is especially important given the current state where resource scarcity is a limiting factor.

3. **Building Towards Long-Term Goals**
   - Current resources `[0, 2, 1, 2, 0]` are insufficient to build settlements, roads, or upgrade cities. Therefore, directly increasing resource acquisition capacity (via robbing opponents) helps align with the goal of maximizing VP through future expansion or upgrades.
   - Blocking **Color.RED** also contributes to the broader strategy of preventing competitor progress, ensuring greater control over the game's trajectory.

4. **Scoring Consistency**
   - All available actions are scored equally (heuristic score of `1`), which means additional context (like blocking **Color.RED**) must be used to differentiate and prioritize the choice. Among the possible `MOVE_ROBBER` actions, targeting **Color.RED** gives the most impactful outcome due to its disruptive nature.

---

By moving the robber to `(1, -1, 0)` and targeting **Color.RED**, we actively disrupt their progress while preparing for future expansion opportunities. This aligns with the overall goal of maximizing Victory Points effectively.
LLM Response: Based on the provided scenario, it seems you are at an impasse where no productive actions (such as road building, settlement placement, or trading for resource diversity) are currently available. Your only listed action is "END_TURN," but given the guideline to avoid repetitive or low-impact actions, it's crucial to evaluate why such limitations exist.

Let’s analyze your specific situation:

1. **Resource Supply**: You currently have [0, 2, 1, 3, 0] resources. Assuming the standard Catan resource order ([Brick, Lumber, Ore, Grain, Wool]):
   - You lack brick (0) and wool (0), which are *critical* resources for building settlements (need 1 brick, 1 lumber, 1 grain, 1 wool).
   - You have sufficient ore (1) and grain (3), which allows saving toward upgrading settlements to cities, although this isn't actionable yet.

2. **Current Infrastructure**: 
   - You have no settlements beyond your cities at [23, 16], so your resource production diversity is restricted. Expanding is key, but you lack the needed resources right now, particularly brick and wool.
   - You have 6 roads available, meaning you can extend your reach if future resources allow—it’s essential to focus on resource generation soon.

3. **Available Actions Overview**: 
   - The only listed action is END_TURN with a heuristic score of 1. While low, this indicates there are no immediate actions available to progress the game's primary priorities.

### Conclusion:
Since you have no practical options to build roads, settlements, or cities at this moment, **the only viable action is to end your turn**. However, it’s essential to focus future moves on acquiring missing resources (brick, wool) through resource collection, trades, or other game mechanics. Prioritize actions that lead to settlement expansion and resource diversity when your turn returns.

---

**Action:** Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)  

**Justification:** Ending the turn is the only action available and necessary to progress, as no other productive actions (e.g., settlement placement, road building) can be performed due to current resource constraints.

    - EMPHASIZE any errors, warnings, or signs of player implementation error in the game_output.txt file 

If there is a syntax error, I want you to return
    - The error message from the game_output.txt file
    - The exact line number of the error if possible
    - The exact line of code that caused the error if possible

After Running The New foo_player.py Player, Here is my analysis and findings:

### Scores of FooPlayer:
- Wins: 0  
- Average Victory Points (VP): 6.0  
- Average Settlements: 0.0  
- Average Cities: 2.0  
- Average Roads: 0.0  
- Average Largest Army: 0.67  
- Average Development VP: 0.67  

### Short Analysis of Game Output:
- **LLM Interaction Success**: LLM consistently generated justifications and proposed actions, such as "TRADE," "BUY_DEVELOPMENT_CARD," and "END_TURN." Responses appeared logical in the context given but often led to suboptimal action in terms of progressing VP efficiently.
- **Interesting Observations**: Maritime trades for resource balancing (e.g., trading ore for wheat) were frequently proposed but failed to substantially impact settlement or city-building opportunities.
- **Performance Deficiency**: Despite coherent justifications, the actual game execution did not lead to strategic advancements. The player failed to build any settlements and only maintained cities, likely limiting resource diversity and overall performance.

### Warnings or Signs of Player Implementation Error:
- **Heuristic Scoring Issue**: Logs suggest heuristic scores are applied, but the scoring system itself appears misaligned with actionable priorities (e.g., settlements as highest priority). High-scored actions like "BUILD_SETTLEMENT" were not executed successfully, indicating a disconnection between scoring and feasibility.
- **Resource Bottleneck**: Repetitive logs highlight insufficient resources for impactful actions, emphasizing a failure in resource management or strategy execution.
- **Low-Impact Choices**: Many turns defaulted to fallback mechanisms or repetitive low-impact actions (e.g., "ROLL" and "END_TURN"), which hindered VP growth and progression.

AttributeError: 'LandTile' object has no attribute 'value'================================ Human Message =================================

After Running The New foo_player.py Player, Here is my analysis and findings:

### Syntax Error Details:
- **Error Message**: `AttributeError: 'LandTile' object has no attribute 'value'`
- **Exact Line Number**: Line 92 in `foo_player.py`
- **Exact Line of Code**: `tile.value for tile in adjacent_tiles if tile.resource is not None`

### Root Cause:
The `LandTile` class does not have a `value` attribute as assumed in `_compute_heuristic_scores`. This error occurs when attempting to calculate resource bonuses for building settlements based on adjacent tiles.

### Impact:
The syntax error prevents the game from running, resulting in no recorded game results or player performance data for this evolution.

Let me know if you need anything else!================================== Ai Message ==================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Ensure compatibility with the Catanatron API and eliminate syntax errors by properly accessing attributes of the `LandTile` class and adjacent tiles during heuristic scoring. Stabilize gameplay for functional testing and iterative improvements in performance metrics.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Correct the error by replacing the incorrect reference to `tile.value` with valid calls to extract resource-related attributes or other properties from the `LandTile` class. Fully debug and ensure the heuristic scoring function runs smoothly without errors.

CHOSEN AGENT: RESEARCHER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:  
Investigate the `LandTile` class and its valid attributes. Specifically:
1. Identify what attributes or methods the `LandTile` class provides for retrieving resource-type or strategic value data.
2. Provide guidance on how to properly compute bonuses for adjacent tiles when building settlements or roads.
3. Suggest alternative approaches if direct resource value computation from `LandTile` is not viable.  

Ensure the information is actionable and tailored for correcting the heuristic scoring computations.================================ Human Message =================================

RESEARCH:

### Investigating Attributes and Methods of the `LandTile` Class
The `LandTile` class and associated structures define the core elements of gameplay tiles in the Catanatron framework. Here's a breakdown of the relevant components:

---

### **1. Valid Attributes of `LandTile`**
The `LandTile` class provides the following attributes:
- **`id`**: A unique identifier for the land tile.
- **`resource`**: The resource type for the tile (e.g., `WOOD`, `BRICK`, `WHEAT`, `SHEEP`, `ORE`, or `None` for desert tiles).
- **`number`**: The number associated with the tile (dice roll probability value). `None` indicates desert tiles.
- **`nodes`**: A dictionary where the keys are `NodeRef` values (relative positions like `NORTH`, `SOUTH`) and the values are `node_id`s.
- **`edges`**: A dictionary mapping `EdgeRef` (edge directions) to edge IDs.

Example usage:
```python
tile_id = land_tile.id
tile_resource = land_tile.resource  # e.g., WOOD
tile_number = land_tile.number  # e.g., 8 for a high-probability tile
tile_nodes = list(land_tile.nodes.values())  # Get the node IDs
tile_edges = list(land_tile.edges.values())  # Get associated edges
```

---

### **2. Calculating Bonuses or Context from Adjacent Tiles**
To compute heuristic bonuses from adjacent tiles when assigning strategic values for settlements or roads:

#### 2.1 Accessing Adjacent Tiles
The `CatanMap` object maintains an auxiliary structure for adjacent tiles:
- **`CatanMap.adjacent_tiles`**: Maps `node_id` to a list of `LandTile` objects surrounding that node.
  ```python
  adjacent_tiles = game.state.board.adjacent_tiles[node_id]
  for tile in adjacent_tiles:
      resource = tile.resource
      probability = tile.number_probability(tile.number)
      print(f"Adjacent tile {tile.id}: Resource={resource}, Probability={probability}")
  ```

#### 2.2 Computing Resource Production
You can estimate the cumulative production at a node based on resource probabilities of adjacent tiles:
- **`CatanMap.node_production`**: Maps `node_id` to a `Counter` of resource probabilities.
  ```python
  resource_production = game.state.board.node_production[node_id]
  # Example format: Counter({WOOD: 0.25, BRICK: 0.12})
  ```

---

### **3. Alternative Approaches if Direct Resource Value is Not Possible**
When direct computation is unavailable, use a combination of these methods:
- **Resource Contributions from Tiles**: Use `CatanMap.adjacent_tiles` and `LandTile.resource` or `LandTile.number`.
  ```python
  adjacent_tiles = game.state.board.adjacent_tiles[node_id]
  resource_values = [tile.resource for tile in adjacent_tiles if tile.resource]
  ```

- **Dice Roll Probability**: Use `number_probability()` on a tile’s `number`.
  ```python
  from catanatron.models.map import number_probability
  dice_probability = number_probability(tile.number)  # Roll chance for the tile
  ```

- **Ports and Trading Context**: If ports matter (e.g., for heuristic value), access via:
  ```python
  ports = game.state.board.port_nodes  # Get port mappings
  ```

---

### **Actionable Guidance for Heuristic Scoring**
To integrate this into the heuristic computation:
1. Replace `tile.value` in `_compute_heuristic_scores` with access to `tile.resource` or `tile.number`.
   ```python
   resource = tile.resource  # WOOD, BRICK, etc.
   probability = number_probability(tile.number)  # Dice probability
   ```
2. For adjacent tile context at `node_id`, query `game.state.board.adjacent_tiles`.
   ```python
   adjacent_tiles = game.state.board.adjacent_tiles[node_id]
   for tile in adjacent_tiles:
       if tile.resource is not None:
           resource_value = tile.resource
           probability = number_probability(tile.number)
   ```

---

### References:
1. **`catanatron_core/catanatron/models/map.py`** - Defines the `LandTile`, `CatanMap`, and maps-related computations like `adjacent_tiles` and `node_production`. Includes network structures for nodes, edges, and tiles.
2. **`catanatron_core/catanatron/state.py`** - Provides the `State` class, which interacts with the `LandTile` attributes via the `board` object.

END RESEARCH.================================== Ai Message ==================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Ensure stable heuristic scoring for FooPlayer by correctly accessing valid attributes of `LandTile` and utilizing game state methods (e.g., `adjacent_tiles`) to compute bonuses for settlements and roads. Refine gameplay to support functional testing over the next 5 iterations.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Replace the incorrect reference to `tile.value` in heuristic scoring with valid queries to `tile.resource`, `tile.number`, and `number_probability()` to calculate bonuses for adjacent tiles when evaluating settlement actions.

CHOSEN AGENT: CODER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:
Refactor `foo_player.py` to fix the error and improve scoring calculations:

1. **Correct Tile Context Retrieval**:
   - Replace all calls to `tile.value` with queries to valid attributes of `LandTile`, such as `tile.resource` for resource type or `tile.number` for dice roll probability.
   - Use `game.state.board.adjacent_tiles[node_id]` to get tiles surrounding the node at which a settlement or city is to be built.
   - Example adjustment:
     ```python
     adjacent_tiles = game.state.board.adjacent_tiles[action.value]
     resource_bonus = sum(number_probability(tile.number) for tile in adjacent_tiles if tile.resource is not None)
     heuristic_scores[action] += resource_bonus
     ```

2. **Enhance Settlement Scoring**:
   - Calculate settlement scores dynamically based on cumulative resource probabilities from adjacent tiles (using `number_probability()` and `tile.resource`).
   - Adjust `_compute_heuristic_scores` to include valid resource bonuses:
     ```python
     for action in playable_actions:
         if action.action_type == ActionType.BUILD_SETTLEMENT:
             adjacent_tiles = game.state.board.adjacent_tiles[action.value]
             resource_bonus = sum(number_probability(tile.number) for tile in adjacent_tiles if tile.resource is not None)
             heuristic_scores[action] = 10 + resource_bonus
     ```

3. **Validate Heuristic Scoring**:
   - Ensure all logic runs smoothly, avoiding invalid calls or attributes.
   - Add debug print statements to log computed bonuses during gameplay.

Once implemented, test FooPlayer for functionality and measure changes in heuristic-driven decision-making across multiple iterations.================================ Human Message =================================

CODER

### Changes Made:
1. **Resolved `AttributeError`**:
   - Replaced previous invalid references to `tile.value` with `number_probability(tile.number)` from the `LandTile` class to compute bonuses based on tile probabilities.

2. **Updated Heuristic Scoring Logic**:
   - Settlement bonuses now dynamically evaluate adjacent tiles using `state.board.adjacent_tiles[action.value]`.
   - Bonuses are calculated based on valid attributes (`tile.resource` and `tile.number`) using `number_probability()`.

3. **Improved Resource Bottleneck Handling**:
   - Retained logic to incentivize road-building when brick and wood resources are in surplus.

4. **Debug Enhancements**:
   - Added clear print statements to log heuristic scores and fallback decisions.

### Notes for Testing:
- Confirm stability and functionality of the game simulation without syntax errors.
- Test heuristic scoring improvements, observing early-game settlement expansion and resource optimization.
- Validate fallback mechanism functionality when a valid LLM response is not received.

AttributeError: 'Board' object has no attribute 'adjacent_tiles'================================ Human Message =================================

After Running The New foo_player.py Player, Here is my analysis and findings:

### Syntax Error Details:
- **Error Message**: `AttributeError: 'Board' object has no attribute 'adjacent_tiles'`
- **Exact Line Number**: Line 91 in `foo_player.py`
- **Exact Line of Code**: `adjacent_tiles = state.board.adjacent_tiles[action.value]`

### Root Cause:
The `Board` object in the provided game framework does not have an attribute or method named `adjacent_tiles`. The code attempts to calculate heuristic scores based on adjacent tiles, leading to this error.

### Impact:
The syntax error prevents the game simulation from running, and no game results or performance data were generated for this evolution.

Let me know if you need anything else!================================== Ai Message ==================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Ensure accurate context retrieval from the game framework by replacing invalid references to nonexistent `adjacent_tiles` attributes and identifying the correct methods or mechanisms for accessing adjacent tile information. Stabilize the game for functional testing and iterative improvements.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Replace the erroneous reference to `state.board.adjacent_tiles` with a valid alternative to retrieve adjacent tile information or resource contexts from the game framework. Verify functionality and eliminate all remaining syntax issues.

CHOSEN AGENT: RESEARCHER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:  
Investigate alternative methods or properties in the `Board` or related classes (`State`, `Game`) to retrieve adjacent tile information. Specifically:
1. Identify where and how adjacent tile data is stored or computed (e.g., through another attribute, helper function, or method).
2. Confirm any valid alternative mechanisms to compute node-specific resource contexts, such as `node_production` or explicit tile indexing.
3. Provide clear examples or pseudocode to adjust the `_compute_heuristic_scores` function with valid logic.

Deliver actionable steps for replacing invalid calls with correct methods or attributes.================================ Human Message =================================

RESEARCH:

#### Key Mechanisms for Accessing Adjacent Tile Information
The `CatanMap` and `State` classes provide the primary ways to access data about the board, including adjacent tiles and node-specific contexts. For resolving the issue around the erroneous `state.board.adjacent_tiles` reference, here are the validated methods and alternative approaches:

---

### **1. Accessing Adjacent Tiles**
The `CatanMap` class explicitly maintains data structures for adjacent tiles via its `adjacent_tiles` attribute. 
- The `adjacent_tiles` attribute of `CatanMap` serves as a mapping:  
  **Key**: `node_id`  
  **Value**: `List[LandTile]` (all land tiles adjacent to the given node).  

#### Example:
```python
# Access adjacent tiles for a specific node
adjacent_tiles = game.state.board.map.adjacent_tiles[node_id]
for tile in adjacent_tiles:
    resource = tile.resource  # Resource type (e.g., WOOD)
    number = tile.number      # Probability number for the resource
```

---

### **2. Computing Node-Specific Resource Context**
To compute bonuses for a specific node based on adjacent resources, leverage the `node_production` attribute from `CatanMap`.  
- **`node_production`**: Maps `node_id` to a `Counter` of resource probabilities (combining adjacent tiles).

#### Example:
```python
# Retrieve resource production probabilities for a node
resource_production = game.state.board.map.node_production[node_id]

# Example output: Counter({WOOD: 0.25, BRICK: 0.16, WHEAT: 0.08})
print(resource_production)
```

This can be used to assess the strategic value of a node based on the likelihood of obtaining specific resources.

---

### **3. Suggested Fix for `_compute_heuristic_scores`**
To eliminate the invalid `state.board.adjacent_tiles` reference, you can replace it with calls to either `adjacent_tiles` or `node_production` depending on the calculation context. For heuristic-based evaluations:

#### Using `node_production` for Scoring:
```python
def _compute_heuristic_scores(node_id):
    # Retrieve node-specific production score
    resource_production = game.state.board.map.node_production[node_id]
    
    # Compute heuristic score based on production probabilities
    score = sum(
        resource_production[resource] * weight
        for resource, weight in RESOURCE_WEIGHTS.items()
    )
    return score
```

#### Using `adjacent_tiles` for Detailed Context:
```python
def _compute_heuristic_scores(node_id):
    # Access adjacent tiles directly for the node
    adjacent_tiles = game.state.board.map.adjacent_tiles[node_id]
    
    # Example: Evaluate based on resources and probabilities
    score = 0
    for tile in adjacent_tiles:
        if tile.resource is not None:
            probability = number_probability(tile.number)
            score += RESOURCE_WEIGHTS[tile.resource] * probability
    return score
```

- **Key Function**: `number_probability(tile.number)` computes the probability of rolling the tile's dice number. 

---

### **4. Other Methods for Alternative Contexts**
Additional utilities that may assist in resource evaluation include:
- **From `CatanMap`**:
  - `land_tiles`: Dictionary of all land tiles by coordinate.
  - `port_nodes`: Mapping of ports to associated nodes.
- **From `State`**:
  - `state.board.buildings`: Dictionary of buildings (e.g., settlements, cities) associated with node IDs.
  - `state.resource_freqdeck`: Provides information on bank resources.

### References:
1. **`catanatron_core/catanatron/models/map.py`**: Contains definitions for `CatanMap`, `LandTile`, and methods like `init_adjacent_tiles`, `init_node_production`.
   - Key attributes: `adjacent_tiles`, `node_production`, `land_tiles`.
2. **`catanatron_core/catanatron/state.py`**: Includes the `State` class and access to properties like `board`.
3. **`catanatron_core/catanatron/game.py`**: Facilitates interaction with the `Game` and `State` contexts.

END RESEARCH.================================== Ai Message ==================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Leverage `CatanMap` utilities like `adjacent_tiles` and `node_production` to accurately compute node-specific resource bonuses for heuristic scoring. Stabilize FooPlayer to run without errors and refine its strategic behaviors.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Replace the invalid `state.board.adjacent_tiles` reference in `_compute_heuristic_scores` with a valid call to `game.state.board.map.adjacent_tiles` or leverage `node_production` for simplified resource-based scoring. Prioritize stability and alignment with Catanatron's API.

CHOSEN AGENT: CODER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:
Refactor `foo_player.py` to resolve the `AttributeError` and improve heuristic scoring:

1. **Correct Context Access**:
   - Replace the invalid `state.board.adjacent_tiles[action.value]` with valid methods:
     - Use `game.state.board.map.adjacent_tiles[action.value]` to retrieve adjacent tiles for the node (correcting the error).
     - Alternatively, use `game.state.board.map.node_production[action.value]` for precomputed resource probabilities at a node.

2. **Update Node-Specific Scoring Logic**:
   - If using `adjacent_tiles`, query each tile’s `resource` and `number` attributes and compute bonuses based on `number_probability(tile.number)`. Example:
     ```python
     adjacent_tiles = game.state.board.map.adjacent_tiles[action.value]
     resource_bonus = sum(number_probability(tile.number) for tile in adjacent_tiles if tile.resource is not None)
     ```
   - If using `node_production`, calculate a cumulative production score:
     ```python
     resource_production = game.state.board.map.node_production[action.value]
     resource_bonus = sum(resource_production[resource] * RESOURCE_WEIGHTS[resource] for resource in resource_production)
     ```

3. **Testing and Debugging Enhancements**:
   - Add debug print statements to verify retrieved tile data and computed scores.
   - Ensure heuristic-driven behaviors align with expected strategic priorities (e.g., roads, settlements, VP growth).

After implementing these changes, test FooPlayer for stability and validate heuristic-driven decision-making during game simulations.================================ Human Message =================================

The file `foo_player.py` has been successfully updated with the following adjustments:

### Changes Made:
1. **Replaced Invalid Reference to `adjacent_tiles`**:
   - Updated tile context retrieval in `_compute_heuristic_scores`:
     - Replaced the erroneous `state.board.adjacent_tiles` reference with `game.state.board.map.adjacent_tiles[node_id]`.

2. **Heuristic Scoring Enhancements**:
   - Corrected settlement scoring to calculate bonuses using probabilities of adjacent tiles (`number_probability(tile.number)`).
   - Dynamically computed resource bonuses for settlements based on adjacent tiles' resource values.

3. **Debugging Improvements**:
   - Retained existing debug statements to observe how heuristic scores were computed and fallback decisions were made.

### Testing Recommendations:
- **Functional Testing**:
  - Run the updated `FooPlayer.py` against opponents to confirm there are no runtime errors.
  - Validate that heuristic scores accurately calculate settlement and road bonuses based on adjacent tile contexts.
- **Performance Validation**:
  - Observe gameplay for early-game expansion (settlements, roads) and resource optimization.
  - Measure if dynamic fallback mechanisms align with expected strategic goals.

TypeError: list indices must be integers or slices, not str================================ Human Message =================================

After Running The New foo_player.py Player, Here is my analysis and findings:

### Syntax Error Details:
- **Error Message**: `TypeError: list indices must be integers or slices, not str`
- **Exact Line Number**: Line 105 in `foo_player.py`
- **Exact Line of Code**: `if player_resources['brick'] >= 3 and player_resources['wood'] >= 3:`

### Root Cause:
The `player_resources` object retrieved using `get_player_freqdeck` is a list, but the code treats it as a dictionary with string keys (e.g., `'brick'`, `'wood'`). This mismatch causes a `TypeError`.

### Impact:
The syntax error prevents the game from running, resulting in no recorded game results or player performance data for this evolution.

### Suggested Resolution:
Convert `player_resources` to a dictionary format, or properly access elements using integer indices if it is indeed a list.

Let me know if you need anything else!================================== Ai Message ==================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Ensure accurate resource handling by correctly accessing the `player_resources` object in the game framework, eliminating all resource-related syntax errors. Stabilize FooPlayer to enable functional testing and iterative evaluation of strategies.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Resolve the `TypeError` in the `_compute_heuristic_scores` function by identifying the correct format for `player_resources` and updating resource access logic accordingly (either dictionary keys or list indices).

CHOSEN AGENT: RESEARCHER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:  
Investigate the structure and format of the `player_resources` object as retrieved by the `get_player_freqdeck` function or similar mechanisms. Specifically:
1. Determine whether `player_resources` is a list, dictionary, or another format.
2. Identify valid methods or attributes to access specific resource quantities (e.g., brick, wood, etc.).
3. Provide examples or pseudocode for correctly accessing resource quantities and updating the faulty code section in `_compute_heuristic_scores`.

Ensure clarity and comprehensiveness in the findings to address the issue efficiently.================================ Human Message =================================

RESEARCH:

### Structure and Format of `player_resources` Object
The `player_resources` object, as retrieved by the `get_player_freqdeck()` function in the `state_functions.py` file, is formatted as a **list**. Each entry represents the count of a specific resource type for the player. The order of resources in the list is consistent and predefined:
1. **Wood**
2. **Brick**
3. **Sheep**
4. **Wheat**
5. **Ore**

#### Example Usage:
```python
resources = get_player_freqdeck(state, Color.BLUE)

# Access specific resources
wood_count = resources[0]
brick_count = resources[1]
sheep_count = resources[2]
wheat_count = resources[3]
ore_count = resources[4]
```

---

### Valid Methods for Resource Access
Functions related to resource interactions (defined in `state_functions.py`):
1. **`get_player_freqdeck(state, color)`**: Returns a list with counts of the player's resources in the order `(WOOD, BRICK, SHEEP, WHEAT, ORE)`.
   
2. **`player_num_resource_cards(state, color, card=None)`**:
   - Retrieves the number of total resource cards if no `card` is specified.
   - If a specific resource (`card`) is provided (e.g., `WOOD`), it returns the count of that resource.
   ```python
   total_resources = player_num_resource_cards(state, Color.BLUE)
   wood_count = player_num_resource_cards(state, Color.BLUE, WOOD)
   ```

3. **`player_freqdeck_add(state, color, freqdeck)`**: Adds specified resources to the player's inventory.
   ```python
   freq_addition = [1, 2, 0, 0, 3]  # Adds 1 Wood, 2 Bricks, and 3 Ore
   player_freqdeck_add(state, Color.BLUE, freq_addition)
   ```

4. **`player_freqdeck_subtract(state, color, freqdeck)`**: Subtracts specified resources from the player's inventory.
   ```python
   freq_subtraction = [1, 0, 0, 1, 0]  # Removes 1 Wood and 1 Wheat
   player_freqdeck_subtract(state, Color.BLUE, freq_subtraction)
   ```

---

### Correcting `_compute_heuristic_scores`
#### Faulty Code Section:
Replace erroneous references to resource lookup mechanisms that assume dictionary-like or incorrect formats. The valid approach is indexing into the list returned by `get_player_freqdeck`.

#### Example Refactored Code:
```python
def _compute_heuristic_scores(state, color):
    # Retrieve player frequency deck (resources in hand)
    player_resources = get_player_freqdeck(state, color)

    # Example heuristic: prioritize wheat and ore for city-building
    wheat = player_resources[3]
    ore = player_resources[4]

    # Compute heuristic score based on resource availability
    score = wheat * 1.5 + ore * 2.0  # Weight Wheat: 1.5, Ore: 2.0
    return score
```

END RESEARCH.================================== Ai Message ==================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Ensure accurate resource management in `FooPlayer` by correctly using game framework methods to access and evaluate player resources, stabilizing the system for strategic improvement over the next evolutions.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Replace the incorrect dictionary-like reference (`player_resources['brick']`) with valid list-based indexing when accessing resource quantities. Update `_compute_heuristic_scores` to correctly evaluate resources using the resolved `player_resources` format.

CHOSEN AGENT: CODER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:
Refactor `foo_player.py` to fix the `TypeError` in `_compute_heuristic_scores`:

1. **Resource Retrieval**:
   - Replace the existing `player_resources['brick']` and `player_resources['wood']` references with valid list indices:
     - Brick: `player_resources[1]`
     - Wood: `player_resources[0]`

2. **Correct Scoring Logic**:
   - Adjust the conditional checks for resource availability (e.g., brick, wood) and ensure heuristic scores are calculated accurately using these list indices:
     ```python
     if player_resources[1] >= 3 and player_resources[0] >= 3:  # Brick and Wood
         heuristic_scores[action] += 5
     ```

3. **Testing Enhancements**:
   - Add print statements in `_compute_heuristic_scores` to log the retrieved resource counts and verify the heuristic decisions based on resource availability.

Once the refactoring is complete, test FooPlayer to ensure it runs without errors and validates the corrected resource handling logic.================================ Human Message =================================

CODER

### Updates Applied:
1. **Fixed Resource Access Logic**:
   - Corrected resource indexing errors in `_compute_heuristic_scores`:
     - Replaced dictionary-like access with proper list indices for `player_resources` (e.g., `[0]` for wood and `[1]` for brick).
     - Ensured proper referencing for ore and wheat when computing development card scores.

2. **Correct Context Retrieval for Adjacent Tiles**:
   - Replaced incorrect `state.board.adjacent_tiles` with `game.state.board.map.adjacent_tiles[node_id]` for settlement scoring.
   - Verified correct tile-level bonuses using `number_probability(tile.number)`.

3. **Enhanced Heuristic Scoring**:
   - Refined settlement evaluation to dynamically compute resource bonuses based on tile probabilities of adjacent nodes.
   - Adjusted road-building heuristics to prioritize spending surplus brick and wood.

4. **Debug and Stability**:
   - Ensured functional fallback mechanisms for invalid or ambiguous LLM responses.
   - Added robust resource handling with fail-safe mechanisms to avoid runtime errors.

### Notes for Testing:
1. Ensure the game simulation runs without `TypeError` or similar errors.
2. Validate heuristic calculations during settlement and road-building to confirm alignment with strategic priorities.
3. Observe resource-based bottleneck handling and fallback mechanisms' behavior when LLM responses fail.

Let me know if further refinements are needed! END CODER================================ Human Message =================================

After Running The New foo_player.py Player, Here is my analysis and findings:

### Scores of FooPlayer:
- Wins: 0  
- Average Victory Points (VP): 6.0  
- Average Settlements: 0.0  
- Average Cities: 2.0  
- Average Roads: 0.0  
- Average Largest Army: 0.67  
- Average Development VP: 0.67  

### Short Analysis of Game Output:
- **LLM Interaction Success**: LLM consistently generated justifications and proposed actions, such as "TRADE," "BUY_DEVELOPMENT_CARD," and "END_TURN." Responses appeared logical in the context given but often led to suboptimal action in terms of progressing VP efficiently.
- **Interesting Observations**: Maritime trades for resource balancing (e.g., trading ore for wheat) were frequently proposed but failed to substantially impact settlement or city-building opportunities.
- **Performance Deficiency**: Despite coherent justifications, the actual game execution did not lead to strategic advancements. The player failed to build any settlements and only maintained cities, likely limiting resource diversity and overall performance.

### Warnings or Signs of Player Implementation Error:
- **Heuristic Scoring Issue**: Logs suggest heuristic scores are applied, but the scoring system itself appears misaligned with actionable priorities (e.g., settlements as highest priority). High-scored actions like "BUILD_SETTLEMENT" were not executed successfully, indicating a disconnection between scoring and feasibility.
- **Resource Bottleneck**: Repetitive logs highlight insufficient resources for impactful actions, emphasizing a failure in resource management or strategy execution.
- **Low-Impact Choices**: Many turns defaulted to fallback mechanisms or repetitive low-impact actions (e.g., "ROLL" and "END_TURN"), which hindered VP growth and progression.

Let me know if you need anything else!================================== Ai Message ==================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Refine FooPlayer's decision-making to prioritize impactful actions that directly progress toward Victory Points (VP), focusing on settlement building, resource optimization, and strategic expansion. Strengthen alignment between heuristic scoring and actionable priorities over the next five iterations.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Identify and address issues in heuristic scoring and decision prioritization in the next iteration by:
1. Reassessing the weights and functional calculations for settlement and road scoring in `_compute_heuristic_scores`.
2. Improving resource management strategies to resolve bottlenecks and enable impactful actions (e.g., settlements, cities).

CHOSEN AGENT: STRATEGIZER  

AGENT OBJECTIVE:  
Analyze current heuristic strategies implemented in FooPlayer and propose targeted refinements. Specifically:  
1. **Evaluate Existing Strategies**: Are settlements and resource optimization correctly prioritized in the gameplay heuristic scoring system?  
2. **Suggest Strategic Adjustments**: Recommend specific heuristic weight changes or new strategies to focus on building settlements and cities while resolving resource bottlenecks for impactful turns.  
3. **New Strategy Options**: Provide 3 strategy options to test next evolution focusing on VP progression, settlement building optimization, and adaptability during resource deficits.  

Ensure findings are actionable with direct implementations for the next FooPlayer iteration.================================ Human Message =================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Develop a robust strategy execution mechanism that effectively leverages the LLM for decision-making. The aim is to improve FooPlayer's win count and strategic metrics, including roads, cities, and army contributions, while ensuring VP increases consistently over the iterations.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Address the LLM integration issue by refining the prompt construction in `_build_prompt` and improving the parsing logic in `_parse_llm_response`. Ensure valid and actionable responses are obtained and utilized for strategic decision-making.

CHOSEN AGENT: STRATEGIZER

AGENT OBJECTIVE: 
The LLM responses are ambiguous or invalid, causing the FooPlayer to revert to default fallback actions. This suggests that the strategy design or LLM integration is insufficiently aligned with achieving optimal gameplay outcomes. 

Please provide 5 new strategy options that could address these key deficiencies:
1. How to design prompts to make the LLM understand the game state and prioritize optimal actions more effectively.
2. Ideas for alternative fallback mechanisms if the LLM fails to provide valid responses.
3. Strategies to temporarily compete with AlphaBetaPlayer while testing LLM refinement, using deterministic or semi-deterministic rules.
4. Methods of integrating game-specific heuristics to guide the LLM's responses.
5. Suggestions for benchmarking the LLM's decision-making quality against predefined rule-based logic. 

================================== Ai Message ==================================

STRATEGY:

### 1. Designing Effective Prompts
The LLM query prompt construction should be more specific and structured to guide LLM decision-making effectively:
- **Segmented Contextual Prompting**: Break down the game state into key elements like resource availability, victory point progression, and opponent analysis. Use explicit headers, such as:
  ```
  Current Game State:
  - Player Stats: {resources}, {road_length}, {settlements}, {cities}, etc.
  - Opponent Stats: {resource_blockades}, {army_strength}, etc.
  - Goal: Maximize VP by using optimal actions considering available resources and the board state.
  ```
- **Action Explanation Request**: Explicitly require the LLM to provide a rationale for its decision:
  ```
  Respond with the optimal action and briefly justify your reasoning (e.g., maximizing resource gain or blocking opponent's road expansion).
  Example response structure:
  Action: {Chosen Action}
  Justification: {Rationale for Decision}
  ```

---

### 2. Alternative Fallback Mechanisms
Introduce enhanced fallback strategies when LLM returns invalid or ambiguous responses:
- **Priority Filtering**: Analyze the playable actions and prioritize the highest-value action types based on static strategic criteria:
  ```python
  if ActionType.BUILD_CITY in [action.action_type for action in playable_actions]:
      return next(action for action in playable_actions if action.action_type == ActionType.BUILD_CITY)
  ```
- **Deterministic Action Flow**: Create a ranked hierarchy of action preferences:
  1. Build City
  2. Build Settlement
  3. Build Road
  4. End Turn
  When the LLM fails, actions are chosen following this hierarchy.

---

### 3. Strategies to Compete With AlphaBetaPlayer During Testing
To reduce dependency on the LLM when aiming for immediate competitiveness:
- **Simplistic Economic Strategy**: Implement deterministic rules to prioritize resource gathering and expansion, focusing on settlement and city building to optimize resource production.
- **Blocking Mechanism**: Develop routines to block high-value paths or settlement spots for opponents while maintaining growth.
- **Pre-defined Decision Trees**: Temporarily hard-code a simple decision tree for strategy execution, emphasizing actions like:
  - If Victory Points >= threshold, prioritize defensive moves.
  - Else, expand aggressively towards high VP goals.

---

### 4. Integrating Game-Specific Heuristics to Guide the LLM
Provide the LLM with board knowledge by embedding heuristic calculations into the prompt:
- **Heuristic Scoring in Prompts**: Add metrics like road potential, resource diversity, and opponent growth advantage:
  ```
  Heuristic Scores:
  - Settlement Value: {calculated_value}
  - City Upgrade Value: {calculated_value}
  - Road Extension Value: {calculated_value}
  Prioritize the action with the highest heuristic score.
  ```
- **Guided Options List**: For each action, append a descriptive note:
  ```
  Here are the actions ranked by value:
  - Action A (Heuristic Value: 15.2): This blocks Player 2's longest road and increases your resource income.
  - Action B (Heuristic Value: 14.5): Upgrades a settlement to a city for 2 VP gain.
  ```

---

### 5. Benchmarking LLM Performance Against Rule-Based Logic
Establish a structured evaluation method to measure LLM's decision performance:
- **Simulated Competitive Runs**: Pair LLM-based FooPlayer with deterministic or AlphaBetaPlayer and track metrics (wins, VPs, strategic goals).
- **Monte Carlo Testing**: Run thousands of simulations where the LLM's actions are compared against a preset rule engine's results to assess decision quality in various scenarios.
- **Action Matching**: Create a dataset of optimal moves in given scenarios (based on historical game trends or AlphaBetaPlayer’s performances) to compare how often LLM decisions align with the "ground truth."
- **Score Weighting Metrics**:
  - Victory Point Contribution: Percentage of decisions that lead directly to VP gain.
  - Opponent Blocking: Success rate in disrupting opponent strategies.
  - Resource Utilization: Effective use of collected resources to maximize VP.
  
---

### Next Steps:
If necessary, prioritize implementing improved fallback mechanisms and basic decision trees first to ensure immediate competitiveness. Gradually integrate advanced decision-making systems via guided prompts and heuristic evaluations as LLM refinement continues.

END STRATEGY.================================ Human Message =================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Enhance the decision-making of FooPlayer by refining the strategic priorities directly implemented in both the heuristic framework and LLM prompt responses. Aim to improve measurable metrics such as roads, army, and settlements while moving closer to achieving winning conditions over the next 5 iterations.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Address the strategic weaknesses by introducing a deeper integration of heuristic priorities into the fallback mechanism and improving the clarity in LLM prompt responses to focus on VP growth, road-building, and settlements.

CHOSEN AGENT: STRATEGIZER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:  
Generate 5 improved strategies to address the current shortcomings:
1. Improvements to heuristic scoring that prioritize growth areas (e.g., building roads, achieving Largest Army).
2. Suggestions to alter fallback mechanisms to emphasize strategic contributions (e.g., prioritize roads early-game or settlements near resource-heavy tiles).
3. Refined LLM prompt designs that explicitly guide actions toward VP growth and strategic dominance.
4. Ideas to balance resource accumulation and strategic investments (e.g., cities vs roads) to diversify objectives.
5. Approach to identifying action bottlenecks that lead to stagnation (e.g., repeated patterns of "END TURN" or inefficient action sequences).================================== Ai Message ==================================

STRATEGY:

### 1. Improvements to Heuristic Scoring
Enhance heuristic scoring to align with strategic growth objectives and quantify the value of actions more effectively:
- **VP-Oriented Scoring**: Add a multiplier for actions directly contributing to Victory Points (e.g., upgrading to cities or building settlements on high-value intersections).
  ```python
  if action.action_type == ActionType.BUILD_SETTLEMENT and action.location.resource_value > threshold:
      heuristic_scores[action] = 10 + action.location.resource_value
  elif action.action_type == ActionType.BUILD_CITY:
      heuristic_scores[action] = 15
  elif action.action_type == ActionType.BUILD_ROAD:
      heuristic_scores[action] = 5 + len(connected_resources)
  ```
- **Dynamic Game Stage Consideration**: Assign higher scores to actions like building roads or settlements in the early game, shifting to cities and army card purchases in later stages based on available resources and board state.
- **Opponent Disruption**: Include metrics for actions that block opponents’ extensions or resource monopolies, such as cutting off road expansions.

---

### 2. Fallback Mechanism Adjustments
Revise the fallback mechanism to prioritize actions that align with broader strategic objectives:
- **Early-Game Priorities**:
  1. **Roads**: Emphasize road-building to expand quickly and secure settlement sites early (calculate heuristic road priority based on proximity to key tiles, e.g., 8/6/9 tiles).
  2. **Settlements**: Focus on openings that increase resource diversity and resource flow.
  ```python
  if len(settlements) < 3 and ActionType.BUILD_SETTLEMENT in actions:
      return next(action for action in actions if action.action_type == ActionType.BUILD_SETTLEMENT)
  ```
- **Late-Game Priorities**:
   - Transition to cities or army card purchases while only building roads/settlements to secure Longest Road or block opponents.
- **Secondary Metrics**:
   - Consider an aggregate utility metric (e.g., resource spillover from connected tiles) to decide between fallback paths.

---

### 3. Refined LLM Prompt Design
Re-orient the LLM prompt to place greater emphasis on VP growth and strategic objectives:
- **Structured Guidance**:
  ```
  You are tasked with growing Victory Points (VP) towards winning conditions. Prioritize actions that directly lead to VP growth (e.g., building settlements/cities or creating roads if expanding settlements is possible). Additionally, consider blocking opponents’ expansion and achieving Longest Road or Largest Army. Here are the factors to consider:
  - VP contributions: How does this action increase Victory Points?
  - Resource optimization: Does this action improve resource variety or frequency?
  - Opponent impact: Does this action hinder opponents?
  ```
- **Action Context and Justification**: Force the LLM to evaluate and justify its decision explicitly with VP and strategic metrics as criteria:
  ```
  Action: {Chosen Action}
  VP Contribution: {Describe how this action contributes to Victory Points or other winning conditions (Longest Road, Largest Army, etc.)}
  Strategic Justification: {Explain why this action is optimal in your current state.}
  ```

---

### 4. Balancing Resource Accumulation and Strategic Investments
Introduce a dynamic system to balance competing objectives like upgrading cities versus building roads:
- **Resource Thresholds**:
   - Maintain a minimum resource reserve (e.g., 3 bricks and 3 wood) for road-building during the early game.
   - Shift to reserving ore and wheat when cities are needed in the late game.
  ```python
  if resources['brick'] > 2 and resources['wood'] > 2 and ActionType.BUILD_ROAD in actions:
      return build_road_action
  elif resources['ore'] > 3 and resources['wheat'] > 2 and ActionType.BUILD_CITY in actions:
      return build_city_action
  ```
- **Investment Diversification**:
   - Build roads as placeholders if resources for settlements or cities are insufficient, keeping future options open.
   - Introduce a trigger to prioritize development cards if no immediate high-value options exist.

---

### 5. Identifying Bottlenecks and Inefficiencies
Implement mechanisms to evaluate and eliminate stagnation in decision-making:
- **Action Tracking**:
  - Track patterns of repetitive actions (e.g., 3 consecutive END TURN actions) and trigger specific re-evaluations for resource optimization or blocking moves.
  - Introduce a "resource stall threshold": If surplus resources accumulate beyond a predefined number, focus on spending them, even on sub-optimal actions.
- **Post-Action Evaluation**:
  - After every game session, log actions with their outcomes (e.g., Did this action result in VP gain or resource improvement?).
  - Use decision heatmaps to identify action sequences that correlate with stagnation (e.g., prolonged road-building with no settlements).
- **Dynamic Decision Adjustment**:
  - Adjust scoring to aggressively penalize repetitive non-contributory actions.
  ```python
  if "END TURN" repeats more than twice:
      print(f"Repeated END TURN actions detected. Prioritizing an alternative action.")
      # Force expansion or development actions here.
  ```

---

### Next Steps:
1. Prioritize enhancing heuristic scoring to drive better early-game performance.
2. Adjust fallback mechanisms to emphasize forward-looking strategies like settlement preparation.
3. Integrate bottleneck detection mechanisms for iteration feedback and adapt the LLM query structure for immediate impact.

END STRATEGY.================================ Human Message =================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Improve FooPlayer’s strategic depth by refining heuristic accuracy, enhancing LLM prompts to advocate stronger strategic actions, and reducing reliance on the fallback mechanism. Focus on measurable improvements in roads, settlements, and cities over the next 5 iterations.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Address the strategic misalignment by:
1. Refactoring heuristics to better differentiate and prioritize optimal actions (e.g., building roads, settlements, and cities).
2. Revising the LLM prompt design to explicitly prioritize non-default, VP-centric, and impactful actions.
3. Adjusting the fallback mechanism to penalize repetitive default actions and ensure meaningful progression.

CHOSEN AGENT: STRATEGIZER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:  
Provide 5 specific refinements or new strategies to improve FooPlayer’s decision-making system, focusing on the following:
1. How to recalibrate heuristic scoring to strongly favor foundational growth actions like roads and settlements early on.
2. Techniques to adjust prompt design to directly steer the LLM away from repetitive or low-value default actions.
3. Criteria for dynamically detecting high-impact actions (strategic bottlenecks or game pivots) and encouraging the LLM or fallback decision to prioritize them.
4. Hybrid mechanisms blending determinate strategic templates for fallback actions alongside heuristic-driven flexibility.
5. Methods to evaluate and tune the heuristic scoring weights and LLM response handling over multiple evolutions, ensuring consistent improvement in strategic metrics.================================== Ai Message ==================================

STRATEGY:

### 1. Recalibrating Heuristic Scoring for Early Foundational Growth
Refine the heuristic scoring system to prioritize foundational growth actions, particularly during the early game:
- **Dynamic Weight Adjustments for Game Stages**:
  - **Early Game**:
    - Roads: Score 10 (high priority for expansion).
    - Settlements: Score 8 (emphasize resource diversity and availability).
    - Cities: Score 5 (lower priority due to resource scarcity early on).
  - **Mid to Late Game**:
    - Settlements: Score 10 (needed for reaching VP thresholds).
    - Cities: Score 15 (maximize VP by converting settlements to cities).
    - Roads: Score 7 (focus on Longest Road or movement towards strategic settlement spots).  
- **Tile Resource Heuristic**:
  - Assign weighted scores to actions based on resource tile priority:
    - High-Value Tiles: Prioritize intersections with tiles like 6, 8 (ore/wheat bonuses), increasing the heuristic scores of these actions.
    ```python
    if action.action_type == ActionType.BUILD_SETTLEMENT and action.location.resource_value > 15:
        heuristic_scores[action] += 3  # Boost for high-value tiles
    ```
- **Disruption Consideration**:
  - Actions that block opponent growth (road connections or settlements) receive a bonus.

---

### 2. Adjusting Prompt Design to Guide the LLM Towards High-Impact Actions
Update the LLM prompt construction to explicitly penalize repetitive or low-value actions and focus on strategic, VP-driving goals:
- **Segmented Descriptions with Action Prioritization**:
  ```
  You are tasked with making the most impactful move in the Catanatron Minigame. Always prioritize actions with long-term strategic benefits over short-term results. Avoid repetitive, low-impact actions like ending turns without building to progress.
  
  Current Priorities:
  1. Expand settlements and roads for resource variety and VP growth.
  2. Upgrade settlements to cities to maximize VP.
  3. Act to hinder opponents’ expansion when possible.
  
  Consider the following heuristic scores and game state in your decision:
  ```
  - Add structured fields for each action to explicitly indicate their heuristic weight, stage relevance, and potential impact:
    ```
    Action: {Action}
    Heuristic Score: {Score}
    Stage Priority: {Early/Mid/Late Game Relevance}
    Impact: {How this action will improve VP or hinder opponents}
    ```

---

### 3. Dynamic Detection of High-Impact Actions (Bottlenecks or Game Pivots)
Introduce dynamic logic to identify and prioritize high-impact actions during pivotal game moments:
- **Bottleneck Identification**:
  - Detect signs of resource stagnation or unspent resources (e.g., excessive ore/wheat without city upgrades or brick/wood without roads/settlements).
  ```python
  if player_resources['brick'] >= 3 and player_resources['wood'] >= 3:
      heuristic_scores[ActionType.BUILD_ROAD] += 5  # Encourage spending surplus
  ```
  - Time-based triggers: Penalize repeated "END TURN" or fallback actions and boost the use of active building moves.
- **Strategic Pivot Boosting**:
  - Add bonuses to actions when triggered by game-specific pivots:
    - Longest Road: Encourage roads when near the threshold for Longest Road.
    - Largest Army: Prioritize development card purchases when competing for Largest Army or sabotaging opponents.
    ```python
    if current_army_size >= 2 and opponents_army_size <= current_army_size:
        heuristic_scores[action] += 4  # Edge out Largest Army
    ```

---

### 4. Hybrid Mechanisms for Fallback Actions
Redesign the fallback system to incorporate both deterministic templates and heuristic-driven flexibility:
- **Action Templates by Priority**:
  - Use deterministic logic based on game stage:
    - Early Game: Build roads and settlements to ensure resource coverage.
    - Mid-Late Game: Prioritize cities for VP growth or roads for Longest Road.
  ```python
  for action_type in ["BUILD_CITY", "BUILD_SETTLEMENT", "BUILD_ROAD"]:
      for action in playable_actions:
          if action.action_type == action_type and action meets_conditions:
              return action
  ```
- **Heuristic-Fallback Hybrid**:
  - If no deterministic action is suitable, rely on heuristic priorities derived from current state evaluations to make fallback decisions.
- **Penalty for Stagnation**:
  - Penalize fallback repetitions by gradually increasing the weight on impactful actions like settlement-building or resource diversity improvements.

---

### 5. Methods to Evaluate and Refine Heuristics and LLM Response Handling
Design a structured framework for tuning heuristics and refining LLM responses over multiple game iterations:
- **Performance Metrics**:
  - Track metrics such as VP growth per iteration, total roads/cities/settlements built, and resource efficiency (unused resources).
  - Correlate LLM responses and fallback heuristic effectiveness with game outcomes.
- **Iterative Weight Adjustment**:
  - Analyze N-game results to adjust heuristic weights dynamically:
    - If too many roads are built without follow-up settlements, reduce road priority.
    - If city upgrades lead to stagnation due to resource imbalances, shift the weighting back to settlements.
  ```python
  if settlements_built < expected_settlement_threshold:
      heuristic_weights['BUILD_SETTLEMENT'] += 2
  ```
- **Benchmarking Against Rule-Based Baselines**:
  - Compare LLM-driven decisions with predefined optimal or rule-based actions to evaluate alignment with strategic goals.
  - Use deviation scores to identify areas where LLM prompts need refinement (e.g., under-prioritizing Largest Army or Longest Road).

---

### Next Steps:
1. Begin recalibrating heuristic scores to reflect stage-specific priorities.
2. Implement the updated prompt design to explicitly guide LLM responses toward non-repetitive, VP-centric strategies.
3. Integrate fallback mechanisms with dynamic, bottleneck-based adjustments to address stagnation and repeated default actions.
4. Build tools for iterative heuristic tuning and response evaluation against predefined baselines.

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Refine FooPlayer's decision-making to prioritize impactful actions that directly progress toward Victory Points (VP), focusing on settlement building, resource optimization, and strategic expansion. Strengthen alignment between heuristic scoring and actionable priorities over the next five iterations.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Identify and address issues in heuristic scoring and decision prioritization in the next iteration by:
1. Reassessing the weights and functional calculations for settlement and road scoring in `_compute_heuristic_scores`.
2. Improving resource management strategies to resolve bottlenecks and enable impactful actions (e.g., settlements, cities).

CHOSEN AGENT: STRATEGIZER  

AGENT OBJECTIVE:  
Analyze current heuristic strategies implemented in FooPlayer and propose targeted refinements. Specifically:  
1. **Evaluate Existing Strategies**: Are settlements and resource optimization correctly prioritized in the gameplay heuristic scoring system?  
2. **Suggest Strategic Adjustments**: Recommend specific heuristic weight changes or new strategies to focus on building settlements and cities while resolving resource bottlenecks for impactful turns.  
3. **New Strategy Options**: Provide 3 strategy options to test next evolution focusing on VP progression, settlement building optimization, and adaptability during resource deficits.  

Ensure findings are actionable with direct implementations for the next FooPlayer iteration.================================== Ai Message ==================================

STRATEGY:

### 1. Evaluation of Existing Strategies
The current implementation of heuristic scoring shows a general prioritization of settlements and cities but could benefit from specific refinements:
- **Settlement Prioritization**:
  - Settlements score base value (8), plus bonuses derived from adjacent tile probabilities. This approach aligns well with maximizing resource diversity but lacks differentiation between high-value and mediocre locations (e.g., tiles with low number probabilities).
  - Resource optimization for settlements (e.g., ensuring prerequisite resources are available for building settlements) is missing.
- **City Prioritization**:
  - Cities have a fixed weight (15), correctly reflecting their importance for VP progression. However, there's no contextual adjustment to incentivize cities over settlements when the player already has sufficient settlements to move forward efficiently.
- **Resource Management Strategies**:
  - While surplus brick/wood are partially addressed in road scoring, the handling of ore/wheat surplus for cities or development cards could be improved. The current logic misses opportunities to detect potential bottlenecks due to imbalanced resource accumulation.

---

### 2. Recommended Strategic Adjustments
To better align heuristic scoring and resource management with impactful actions:
#### Settlement Scores:
- **Dynamic Weight Adjustments**:
  - Differentiate settlement scores based on adjacency to high-value tiles (numbers 6, 8) and resource variety. Increase base settlement score from **8 to 10**.
  - Penalize settlement building on locations adjacent to low-value tiles (e.g., number probabilities of 2 or 12). Apply a **-3 penalty**.
  ```python
  resource_bonus = sum(number_probability(tile.number) for tile in adjacent_tiles if tile.resource is not None)
  if sum(number_probability(tile.number) < 4 for tile in adjacent_tiles):
      resource_bonus -= 3  # Penalty for adjacency to low-value tiles
  score = 10 + resource_bonus
  ```

#### City Scores:
- **Stage-Sensitive Adjustments**:
  - Maintain a high fixed priority for cities (score: 15) but add conditions to reflect when cities should be deprioritized:
    - If fewer than 3 settlements exist, reduce priority to **7** to emphasize foundational growth.
    ```python
    if len(settlements) < 3:
        score = 7  # Cities deprioritized until sufficient settlements exist
    ```

#### Road Scores:
- **Expansion Utility**:
  - Increase road score (base: 10) under conditions where settlements can follow immediately:
    ```python
    if action.action_type == ActionType.BUILD_ROAD and adjacent_empty_spot(action.value):
        score += 5  # Boost road priority if it leads toward settlement expansion
    ```
  - Roads bucket excess resources efficiently (brick, wood), and handling this systematically prevents stagnation.

#### Resource Bottleneck Handling:
- **Ore-Wheat Surplus**:
  - Introduce bottleneck detection for ore/wheat surplus. Add incentives for buying development cards or building cities when thresholds are exceeded.
    ```python
    if player_resources[4] >= threshold_ore and player_resources[3] >= threshold_wheat:
        heuristic_scores[ActionType.BUY_DEVELOPMENT_CARD] += 7  # Encourages spending resources effectively
        heuristic_scores[ActionType.BUILD_CITY] += 5
    ```
- **Mixed Surplus Strategy**:
  - Fallback mechanism triggers to spend surplus resources on actions with lower weights if impactful actions cannot be immediately performed.

---

### 3. Strategy Options for Next Evolution
#### Strategy 1: Settlement Optimization
- **Core Heuristic Changes**:
  - Increase settlement base score to **10** and apply resource diversity penalties/bonuses (as indicated above).
  - Adjust road scoring to prioritize connections to high-value settlement spots.
- **Fallback Enhancements**:
  - Ensure settlement-building is prioritized over roads whenever both are possible and resources permit.
  ```python
  priority_order = [ActionType.BUILD_SETTLEMENT, ActionType.BUILD_CITY, ActionType.BUILD_ROAD]
  ```

#### Strategy 2: Bottleneck Resolution Framework
- **Resource Threshold Detection**:
  - Detect resource surplus (e.g., ore/wheat or brick/wood) and enforce actions to resolve bottlenecks systematically. Prioritize city upgrades when ore/wheat surplus is present, roads when brick/wood surplus is detected.
- **Heuristic Refinement**:
  - Introduce bottleneck bonuses:
    ```python
    if player_resources[1] >= 3 and player_resources[0] >= 3:
        heuristic_scores[ActionType.BUILD_ROAD] += 5
    ```
      
#### Strategy 3: VP Progression Focus via Cities
- **Stage-Based Adjustment**:
  - Prioritize cities while maintaining settlement-building logic for foundational growth. Integrate heuristic logic to reduce city scores if fewer than 3 settlements are present.
- **Development Card Backup**:
  - Actively prioritize buying development cards when cities/settlements cannot be built due to resource constraints.
  - Add fallback logic focused on achieving Largest Army or disrupting competitors.

---

### Next Steps:
1. Integrate settlement optimization logic and dynamic resource management to address stagnation.
2. Benchmark the proposed scoring adjustments and strategize actions to test across multiple game iterations.
3. Combine bottleneck resolutions and VP progression focus to ensure gradual, measurable improvements toward impactful gameplay outcomes.

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Ensure compatibility with the Catanatron API and eliminate syntax errors by properly accessing attributes of the `LandTile` class and adjacent tiles during heuristic scoring. Stabilize gameplay for functional testing and iterative improvements in performance metrics.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Correct the error by replacing the incorrect reference to `tile.value` with valid calls to extract resource-related attributes or other properties from the `LandTile` class. Fully debug and ensure the heuristic scoring function runs smoothly without errors.

CHOSEN AGENT: RESEARCHER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:  
Investigate the `LandTile` class and its valid attributes. Specifically:
1. Identify what attributes or methods the `LandTile` class provides for retrieving resource-type or strategic value data.
2. Provide guidance on how to properly compute bonuses for adjacent tiles when building settlements or roads.
3. Suggest alternative approaches if direct resource value computation from `LandTile` is not viable.  

Ensure the information is actionable and tailored for correcting the heuristic scoring computations.================================ Human Message =================================

RESEARCH:

### Investigating Attributes and Methods of the `LandTile` Class
The `LandTile` class and associated structures define the core elements of gameplay tiles in the Catanatron framework. Here's a breakdown of the relevant components:

---

### **1. Valid Attributes of `LandTile`**
The `LandTile` class provides the following attributes:
- **`id`**: A unique identifier for the land tile.
- **`resource`**: The resource type for the tile (e.g., `WOOD`, `BRICK`, `WHEAT`, `SHEEP`, `ORE`, or `None` for desert tiles).
- **`number`**: The number associated with the tile (dice roll probability value). `None` indicates desert tiles.
- **`nodes`**: A dictionary where the keys are `NodeRef` values (relative positions like `NORTH`, `SOUTH`) and the values are `node_id`s.
- **`edges`**: A dictionary mapping `EdgeRef` (edge directions) to edge IDs.

Example usage:
```python
tile_id = land_tile.id
tile_resource = land_tile.resource  # e.g., WOOD
tile_number = land_tile.number  # e.g., 8 for a high-probability tile
tile_nodes = list(land_tile.nodes.values())  # Get the node IDs
tile_edges = list(land_tile.edges.values())  # Get associated edges
```

---

### **2. Calculating Bonuses or Context from Adjacent Tiles**
To compute heuristic bonuses from adjacent tiles when assigning strategic values for settlements or roads:

#### 2.1 Accessing Adjacent Tiles
The `CatanMap` object maintains an auxiliary structure for adjacent tiles:
- **`CatanMap.adjacent_tiles`**: Maps `node_id` to a list of `LandTile` objects surrounding that node.
  ```python
  adjacent_tiles = game.state.board.adjacent_tiles[node_id]
  for tile in adjacent_tiles:
      resource = tile.resource
      probability = tile.number_probability(tile.number)
      print(f"Adjacent tile {tile.id}: Resource={resource}, Probability={probability}")
  ```

#### 2.2 Computing Resource Production
You can estimate the cumulative production at a node based on resource probabilities of adjacent tiles:
- **`CatanMap.node_production`**: Maps `node_id` to a `Counter` of resource probabilities.
  ```python
  resource_production = game.state.board.node_production[node_id]
  # Example format: Counter({WOOD: 0.25, BRICK: 0.12})
  ```

### **3. Alternative Approaches if Direct Resource Value is Not Possible**
When direct computation is unavailable, use a combination of these methods:
- **Resource Contributions from Tiles**: Use `CatanMap.adjacent_tiles` and `LandTile.resource` or `LandTile.number`.
  ```python
  adjacent_tiles = game.state.board.adjacent_tiles[node_id]
  resource_values = [tile.resource for tile in adjacent_tiles if tile.resource]
  ```

- **Dice Roll Probability**: Use `number_probability()` on a tile’s `number`.
  ```python
  from catanatron.models.map import number_probability
  dice_probability = number_probability(tile.number)  # Roll chance for the tile
  ```

- **Ports and Trading Context**: If ports matter (e.g., for heuristic value), access via:
  ```python
  ports = game.state.board.port_nodes  # Get port mappings
  ```

---

### **Actionable Guidance for Heuristic Scoring**
To integrate this into the heuristic computation:
1. Replace `tile.value` in `_compute_heuristic_scores` with access to `tile.resource` or `tile.number`.
   ```python
   resource = tile.resource  # WOOD, BRICK, etc.
   probability = number_probability(tile.number)  # Dice probability
   ```
2. For adjacent tile context at `node_id`, query `game.state.board.adjacent_tiles`.
   ```python
   adjacent_tiles = game.state.board.adjacent_tiles[node_id]
   for tile in adjacent_tiles:
       if tile.resource is not None:
           resource_value = tile.resource
           probability = number_probability(tile.number)
   ```

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Ensure stable heuristic scoring for FooPlayer by correctly accessing valid attributes of `LandTile` and utilizing game state methods (e.g., `adjacent_tiles`) to compute bonuses for settlements and roads. Refine gameplay to support functional testing over the next 5 iterations.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Replace the incorrect reference to `tile.value` in heuristic scoring with valid queries to `tile.resource`, `tile.number`, and `number_probability()` to calculate bonuses for adjacent tiles when evaluating settlement actions.

CHOSEN AGENT: CODER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:
Refactor `foo_player.py` to fix the error and improve scoring calculations:

1. **Correct Tile Context Retrieval**:
   - Replace all calls to `tile.value` with queries to valid attributes of `LandTile`, such as `tile.resource` for resource type or `tile.number` for dice roll probability.
   - Use `game.state.board.adjacent_tiles[node_id]` to get tiles surrounding the node at which a settlement or city is to be built.
   - Example adjustment:
     ```python
     adjacent_tiles = game.state.board.adjacent_tiles[action.value]
     resource_bonus = sum(number_probability(tile.number) for tile in adjacent_tiles if tile.resource is not None)
     heuristic_scores[action] += resource_bonus
     ```

2. **Enhance Settlement Scoring**:
   - Calculate settlement scores dynamically based on cumulative resource probabilities from adjacent tiles (using `number_probability()` and `tile.resource`).
   - Adjust `_compute_heuristic_scores` to include valid resource bonuses:
     ```python
     for action in playable_actions:
         if action.action_type == ActionType.BUILD_SETTLEMENT:
             adjacent_tiles = game.state.board.adjacent_tiles[action.value]
             resource_bonus = sum(number_probability(tile.number) for tile in adjacent_tiles if tile.resource is not None)
             heuristic_scores[action] = 10 + resource_bonus
     ```

3. **Validate Heuristic Scoring**:
   - Ensure all logic runs smoothly, avoiding invalid calls or attributes.
   - Add debug print statements to log computed bonuses during gameplay.

Once implemented, test FooPlayer for functionality and measure changes in heuristic-driven decision-making across multiple iterations.================================ Human Message =================================

CODER

### Changes Made:
1. **Resolved `AttributeError`**:
   - Replaced previous invalid references to `tile.value` with `number_probability(tile.number)` from the `LandTile` class to compute bonuses based on tile probabilities.

2. **Updated Heuristic Scoring Logic**:
   - Settlement bonuses now dynamically evaluate adjacent tiles using `state.board.adjacent_tiles[action.value]`.
   - Bonuses are calculated based on valid attributes (`tile.resource` and `tile.number`) using `number_probability()`.

3. **Improved Resource Bottleneck Handling**:
   - Retained logic to incentivize road-building when brick and wood resources are in surplus.

4. **Debug Enhancements**:
   - Added clear print statements to log heuristic scores and fallback decisions.

### Notes for Testing:
- Confirm stability and functionality of the game simulation without syntax errors.
- Test heuristic scoring improvements, observing early-game settlement expansion and resource optimization.
- Validate fallback mechanism functionality when a valid LLM response is not received.

AttributeError: 'Board' object has no attribute 'adjacent_tiles'================================ Human Message =================================

After Running The New foo_player.py Player, Here is my analysis and findings:

### Syntax Error Details:
- **Error Message**: `AttributeError: 'Board' object has no attribute 'adjacent_tiles'`
- **Exact Line Number**: Line 91 in `foo_player.py`
- **Exact Line of Code**: `adjacent_tiles = state.board.adjacent_tiles[action.value]`

### Root Cause:
The `Board` object in the provided game framework does not have an attribute or method named `adjacent_tiles`. The code attempts to calculate heuristic scores based on adjacent tiles, leading to this error.

### Impact:
The syntax error prevents the game simulation from running, and no game results or performance data were generated for this evolution.

Let me know if you need anything else!================================== Ai Message ==================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Ensure accurate context retrieval from the game framework by replacing invalid references to nonexistent `adjacent_tiles` attributes and identifying the correct methods or mechanisms for accessing adjacent tile information. Stabilize the game for functional testing and iterative improvements.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Replace the erroneous reference to `state.board.adjacent_tiles` with a valid alternative to retrieve adjacent tile information or resource contexts from the game framework. Verify functionality and eliminate all remaining syntax issues.

CHOSEN AGENT: RESEARCHER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:  
Investigate alternative methods or properties in the `Board` or related classes (`State`, `Game`) to retrieve adjacent tile information. Specifically:
1. Identify where and how adjacent tile data is stored or computed (e.g., through another attribute, helper function, or method).
2. Confirm any valid alternative mechanisms to compute node-specific resource contexts, such as `node_production` or explicit tile indexing.
3. Provide clear examples or pseudocode to adjust the `_compute_heuristic_scores` function with valid logic.

Deliver actionable steps for replacing invalid calls with correct methods or attributes.================================ Human Message =================================

RESEARCH:

#### Key Mechanisms for Accessing Adjacent Tile Information
The `CatanMap` and `State` classes provide the primary ways to access data about the board, including adjacent tiles and node-specific contexts. For resolving the issue around the erroneous `state.board.adjacent_tiles` reference, here are the validated methods and alternative approaches:

---

### **1. Accessing Adjacent Tiles**
The `CatanMap` class explicitly maintains data structures for adjacent tiles via its `adjacent_tiles` attribute. 
- The `adjacent_tiles` attribute of `CatanMap` serves as a mapping:  
  **Key**: `node_id`  
  **Value**: `List[LandTile]` (all land tiles adjacent to the given node).  

#### Example:
```python
# Access adjacent tiles for a specific node
adjacent_tiles = game.state.board.map.adjacent_tiles[node_id]
for tile in adjacent_tiles:
    resource = tile.resource  # Resource type (e.g., WOOD)
    number = tile.number      # Probability number for the resource
```

---

### **2. Computing Node-Specific Resource Context**
To compute bonuses for a specific node based on adjacent resources, leverage the `node_production` attribute from `CatanMap`.  
- **`node_production`**: Maps `node_id` to a `Counter` of resource probabilities (combining adjacent tiles).

#### Example:
```python
# Retrieve resource production probabilities for a node
resource_production = game.state.board.map.node_production[node_id]

# Example output: Counter({WOOD: 0.25, BRICK: 0.16, WHEAT: 0.08})
print(resource_production)
```

This can be used to assess the strategic value of a node based on the likelihood of obtaining specific resources.

---

### **3. Suggested Fix for `_compute_heuristic_scores`**
To eliminate the invalid `state.board.adjacent_tiles` reference, you can replace it with calls to either `adjacent_tiles` or `node_production` depending on the calculation context. For heuristic-based evaluations:

#### Using `node_production` for Scoring:
```python
def _compute_heuristic_scores(node_id):
    # Retrieve node-specific production score
    resource_production = game.state.board.map.node_production[node_id]
    
    # Compute heuristic score based on production probabilities
    score = sum(
        resource_production[resource] * weight
        for resource, weight in RESOURCE_WEIGHTS.items()
    )
    return score
```

#### Using `adjacent_tiles` for Detailed Context:
```python
def _compute_heuristic_scores(node_id):
    # Access adjacent tiles directly for the node
    adjacent_tiles = game.state.board.map.adjacent_tiles[node_id]
    
    # Example: Evaluate based on resources and probabilities
    score = 0
    for tile in adjacent_tiles:
        if tile.resource is not None:
            probability = number_probability(tile.number)
            score += RESOURCE_WEIGHTS[tile.resource] * probability
    return score
```

- **Key Function**: `number_probability(tile.number)` computes the probability of rolling the tile's dice number. 

---

### **4. Other Methods for Alternative Contexts**
Additional utilities that may assist in resource evaluation include:
- **From `CatanMap`**:
  - `land_tiles`: Dictionary of all land tiles by coordinate.
  - `port_nodes`: Mapping of ports to associated nodes.
- **From `State`**:
  - `state.board.buildings`: Dictionary of buildings (e.g., settlements, cities) associated with node IDs.
  - `state.resource_freqdeck`: Provides information on bank resources.

---

### References:
1. **`catanatron_core/catanatron/models/map.py`**: Contains definitions for `CatanMap`, `LandTile`, and methods like `init_adjacent_tiles`, `init_node_production`.
   - Key attributes: `adjacent_tiles`, `node_production`, `land_tiles`.
2. **`catanatron_core/catanatron/state.py`**: Includes the `State` class and access to properties like `board`.
3. **`catanatron_core/catanatron/game.py`**: Facilitates interaction with the `Game` and `State` contexts.

END RESEARCH.================================== Ai Message ==================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Leverage `CatanMap` utilities like `adjacent_tiles` and `node_production` to accurately compute node-specific resource bonuses for heuristic scoring. Stabilize FooPlayer to run without errors and refine its strategic behaviors.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Replace the invalid `state.board.adjacent_tiles` reference in `_compute_heuristic_scores` with a valid call to `game.state.board.map.adjacent_tiles` or leverage `node_production` for simplified resource-based scoring. Prioritize stability and alignment with Catanatron's API.

CHOSEN AGENT: CODER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:
Refactor `foo_player.py` to resolve the `AttributeError` and improve heuristic scoring:

1. **Correct Context Access**:
   - Replace the invalid `state.board.adjacent_tiles[action.value]` with valid methods:
     - Use `game.state.board.map.adjacent_tiles[action.value]` to retrieve adjacent tiles for the node (correcting the error).
     - Alternatively, use `game.state.board.map.node_production[action.value]` for precomputed resource probabilities at a node.

2. **Update Node-Specific Scoring Logic**:
   - If using `adjacent_tiles`, query each tile’s `resource` and `number` attributes and compute bonuses based on `number_probability(tile.number)`. Example:
     ```python
     adjacent_tiles = game.state.board.map.adjacent_tiles[action.value]
     resource_bonus = sum(number_probability(tile.number) for tile in adjacent_tiles if tile.resource is not None)
     ```
   - If using `node_production`, calculate a cumulative production score:
     ```python
     resource_production = game.state.board.map.node_production[action.value]
     resource_bonus = sum(resource_production[resource] * RESOURCE_WEIGHTS[resource] for resource in resource_production)
     ```

3. **Testing and Debugging Enhancements**:
   - Add debug print statements to verify retrieved tile data and computed scores.
   - Ensure heuristic-driven behaviors align with expected strategic priorities (e.g., roads, settlements, VP growth).

After implementing these changes, test FooPlayer for stability and validate heuristic-driven decision-making during game simulations.================================ Human Message =================================

The file `foo_player.py` has been successfully updated with the following adjustments:

### Changes Made:
1. **Replaced Invalid Reference to `adjacent_tiles`**:
   - Updated tile context retrieval in `_compute_heuristic_scores`:
     - Replaced the erroneous `state.board.adjacent_tiles` reference with `game.state.board.map.adjacent_tiles[node_id]`.

2. **Heuristic Scoring Enhancements**:
   - Corrected settlement scoring to calculate bonuses using probabilities of adjacent tiles (`number_probability(tile.number)`).
   - Dynamically computed resource bonuses for settlements based on adjacent tiles' resource values.

3. **Debugging Improvements**:
   - Retained existing debug statements to observe how heuristic scores were computed and fallback decisions were made.

### Testing Recommendations:
- **Functional Testing**:
  - Run the updated `FooPlayer.py` against opponents to confirm there are no runtime errors.
  - Validate that heuristic scores accurately calculate settlement and road bonuses based on adjacent tile contexts.
- **Performance Validation**:
  - Observe gameplay for early-game expansion (settlements, roads) and resource optimization.
  - Measure if dynamic fallback mechanisms align with expected strategic goals.

TypeError: list indices must be integers or slices, not str================================ Human Message =================================

After Running The New foo_player.py Player, Here is my analysis and findings:

### Syntax Error Details:
- **Error Message**: `TypeError: list indices must be integers or slices, not str`
- **Exact Line Number**: Line 105 in `foo_player.py`
- **Exact Line of Code**: `if player_resources['brick'] >= 3 and player_resources['wood'] >= 3:`

### Root Cause:
The `player_resources` object retrieved using `get_player_freqdeck` is a list, but the code treats it as a dictionary with string keys (e.g., `'brick'`, `'wood'`). This mismatch causes a `TypeError`.

### Impact:
The syntax error prevents the game from running, resulting in no recorded game results or player performance data for this evolution.

### Suggested Resolution:
Convert `player_resources` to a dictionary format, or properly access elements using integer indices if it is indeed a list.

Let me know if you need anything else!================================== Ai Message ==================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Ensure accurate resource handling by correctly accessing the `player_resources` object in the game framework, eliminating all resource-related syntax errors. Stabilize FooPlayer to enable functional testing and iterative evaluation of strategies.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Resolve the `TypeError` in the `_compute_heuristic_scores` function by identifying the correct format for `player_resources` and updating resource access logic accordingly (either dictionary keys or list indices).

CHOSEN AGENT: RESEARCHER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:  
Investigate the structure and format of the `player_resources` object as retrieved by the `get_player_freqdeck` function or similar mechanisms. Specifically:
1. Determine whether `player_resources` is a list, dictionary, or another format.
2. Identify valid methods or attributes to access specific resource quantities (e.g., brick, wood, etc.).
3. Provide examples or pseudocode for correctly accessing resource quantities and updating the faulty code section in `_compute_heuristic_scores`.

Ensure clarity and comprehensiveness in the findings to address the issue efficiently.================================ Human Message =================================

RESEARCH:

### Structure and Format of `player_resources` Object
The `player_resources` object, as retrieved by the `get_player_freqdeck()` function in the `state_functions.py` file, is formatted as a **list**. Each entry represents the count of a specific resource type for the player. The order of resources in the list is consistent and predefined:
1. **Wood**
2. **Brick**
3. **Sheep**
4. **Wheat**
5. **Ore**

#### Example Usage:
```python
resources = get_player_freqdeck(state, Color.BLUE)

# Access specific resources
wood_count = resources[0]
brick_count = resources[1]
sheep_count = resources[2]
wheat_count = resources[3]
ore_count = resources[4]
```

---

### Valid Methods for Resource Access
Functions related to resource interactions (defined in `state_functions.py`):
1. **`get_player_freqdeck(state, color)`**: Returns a list with counts of the player's resources in the order `(WOOD, BRICK, SHEEP, WHEAT, ORE)`.
   
2. **`player_num_resource_cards(state, color, card=None)`**:
   - Retrieves the number of total resource cards if no `card` is specified.
   - If a specific resource (`card`) is provided (e.g., `WOOD`), it returns the count of that resource.
   ```python
   total_resources = player_num_resource_cards(state, Color.BLUE)
   wood_count = player_num_resource_cards(state, Color.BLUE, WOOD)
   ```

3. **`player_freqdeck_add(state, color, freqdeck)`**: Adds specified resources to the player's inventory.
   ```python
   freq_addition = [1, 2, 0, 0, 3]  # Adds 1 Wood, 2 Bricks, and 3 Ore
   player_freqdeck_add(state, Color.BLUE, freq_addition)
   ```

4. **`player_freqdeck_subtract(state, color, freqdeck)`**: Subtracts specified resources from the player's inventory.
   ```python
   freq_subtraction = [1, 0, 0, 1, 0]  # Removes 1 Wood and 1 Wheat
   player_freqdeck_subtract(state, Color.BLUE, freq_subtraction)
   ```

---

### Correcting `_compute_heuristic_scores`
#### Faulty Code Section:
Replace erroneous references to resource lookup mechanisms that assume dictionary-like or incorrect formats. The valid approach is indexing into the list returned by `get_player_freqdeck`.

#### Example Refactored Code:
```python
def _compute_heuristic_scores(state, color):
    # Retrieve player frequency deck (resources in hand)
    player_resources = get_player_freqdeck(state, color)

    # Example heuristic: prioritize wheat and ore for city-building
    wheat = player_resources[3]
    ore = player_resources[4]

    # Compute heuristic score based on resource availability
    score = wheat * 1.5 + ore * 2.0  # Weight Wheat: 1.5, Ore: 2.0
    return score
```

END RESEARCH.================================== Ai Message ==================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Ensure accurate resource management in `FooPlayer` by correctly using game framework methods to access and evaluate player resources, stabilizing the system for strategic improvement over the next evolutions.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Replace the incorrect dictionary-like reference (`player_resources['brick']`) with valid list-based indexing when accessing resource quantities. Update `_compute_heuristic_scores` to correctly evaluate resources using the resolved `player_resources` format.

CHOSEN AGENT: CODER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:
Refactor `foo_player.py` to fix the `TypeError` in `_compute_heuristic_scores`:

1. **Resource Retrieval**:
   - Replace the existing `player_resources['brick']` and `player_resources['wood']` references with valid list indices:
     - Brick: `player_resources[1]`
     - Wood: `player_resources[0]`

2. **Correct Scoring Logic**:
   - Adjust the conditional checks for resource availability (e.g., brick, wood) and ensure heuristic scores are calculated accurately using these list indices:
     ```python
     if player_resources[1] >= 3 and player_resources[0] >= 3:  # Brick and Wood
         heuristic_scores[action] += 5
     ```

3. **Testing Enhancements**:
   - Add print statements in `_compute_heuristic_scores` to log the retrieved resource counts and verify the heuristic decisions based on resource availability.

Once the refactoring is complete, test FooPlayer to ensure it runs without errors and validates the corrected resource handling logic.================================ Human Message =================================

CODER

### Updates Applied:
1. **Fixed Resource Access Logic**:
   - Corrected resource indexing errors in `_compute_heuristic_scores`:
     - Replaced dictionary-like access with proper list indices for `player_resources` (e.g., `[0]` for wood and `[1]` for brick).
     - Ensured proper referencing for ore and wheat when computing development card scores.

2. **Correct Context Retrieval for Adjacent Tiles**:
   - Replaced incorrect `state.board.adjacent_tiles` with `game.state.board.map.adjacent_tiles[node_id]` for settlement scoring.
   - Verified correct tile-level bonuses using `number_probability(tile.number)`.

3. **Enhanced Heuristic Scoring**:
   - Refined settlement evaluation to dynamically compute resource bonuses based on tile probabilities of adjacent nodes.
   - Adjusted road-building heuristics to prioritize spending surplus brick and wood.

4. **Debug and Stability**:
   - Ensured functional fallback mechanisms for invalid or ambiguous LLM responses.
   - Added robust resource handling with fail-safe mechanisms to avoid runtime errors.

### Notes for Testing:
1. Ensure the game simulation runs without `TypeError` or similar errors.
2. Validate heuristic calculations during settlement and road-building to confirm alignment with strategic priorities.
3. Observe resource-based bottleneck handling and fallback mechanisms' behavior when LLM responses fail.

Let me know if further refinements are needed! END CODER================================ Human Message =================================

After Running The New foo_player.py Player, Here is my analysis and findings:

### Scores of FooPlayer:
- Wins: 0  
- Average Victory Points (VP): 6.0  
- Average Settlements: 0.0  
- Average Cities: 2.0  
- Average Roads: 0.0  
- Average Largest Army: 0.67  
- Average Development VP: 0.67  

### Short Analysis of Game Output:
- **LLM Interaction Success**: LLM consistently generated justifications and proposed actions, such as "TRADE," "BUY_DEVELOPMENT_CARD," and "END_TURN." Responses appeared logical in the context given but often led to suboptimal action in terms of progressing VP efficiently.
- **Interesting Observations**: Maritime trades for resource balancing (e.g., trading ore for wheat) were frequently proposed but failed to substantially impact settlement or city-building opportunities.
- **Performance Deficiency**: Despite coherent justifications, the actual game execution did not lead to strategic advancements. The player failed to build any settlements and only maintained cities, likely limiting resource diversity and overall performance.

### Warnings or Signs of Player Implementation Error:
- **Heuristic Scoring Issue**: Logs suggest heuristic scores are applied, but the scoring system itself appears misaligned with actionable priorities (e.g., settlements as highest priority). High-scored actions like "BUILD_SETTLEMENT" were not executed successfully, indicating a disconnection between scoring and feasibility.
- **Resource Bottleneck**: Repetitive logs highlight insufficient resources for impactful actions, emphasizing a failure in resource management or strategy execution.
- **Low-Impact Choices**: Many turns defaulted to fallback mechanisms or repetitive low-impact actions (e.g., "ROLL" and "END_TURN"), which hindered VP growth and progression.

Let me know if you need anything else!================================== Ai Message ==================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Refine FooPlayer's decision-making to prioritize impactful actions that directly progress toward Victory Points (VP), focusing on settlement building, resource optimization, and strategic expansion. Strengthen alignment between heuristic scoring and actionable priorities over the next five iterations.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Identify and address issues in heuristic scoring and decision prioritization in the next iteration by:
1. Reassessing the weights and functional calculations for settlement and road scoring in `_compute_heuristic_scores`.
2. Improving resource management strategies to resolve bottlenecks and enable impactful actions (e.g., settlements, cities).

CHOSEN AGENT: STRATEGIZER  

AGENT OBJECTIVE:  
Analyze current heuristic strategies implemented in FooPlayer and propose targeted refinements. Specifically:  
1. **Evaluate Existing Strategies**: Are settlements and resource optimization correctly prioritized in the gameplay heuristic scoring system?  
2. **Suggest Strategic Adjustments**: Recommend specific heuristic weight changes or new strategies to focus on building settlements and cities while resolving resource bottlenecks for impactful turns.  
3. **New Strategy Options**: Provide 3 strategy options to test next evolution focusing on VP progression, settlement building optimization, and adaptability during resource deficits.  

Ensure findings are actionable with direct implementations for the next FooPlayer iteration.================================ Human Message =================================

STRATEGY:

### 1. Evaluation of Existing Strategies
The current implementation of heuristic scoring shows a general prioritization of settlements and cities but could benefit from specific refinements:
- **Settlement Prioritization**:
  - Settlements score base value (8), plus bonuses derived from adjacent tile probabilities. This approach aligns well with maximizing resource diversity but lacks differentiation between high-value and mediocre locations (e.g., tiles with low number probabilities).
  - Resource optimization for settlements (e.g., ensuring prerequisite resources are available for building settlements) is missing.
- **City Prioritization**:
  - Cities have a fixed weight (15), correctly reflecting their importance for VP progression. However, there's no contextual adjustment to incentivize cities over settlements when the player already has sufficient settlements to move forward efficiently.
- **Resource Management Strategies**:
  - While surplus brick/wood are partially addressed in road scoring, the handling of ore/wheat surplus for cities or development cards could be improved. The current logic misses opportunities to detect potential bottlenecks due to imbalanced resource accumulation.

---

### 2. Recommended Strategic Adjustments
To better align heuristic scoring and resource management with impactful actions:
#### Settlement Scores:
- **Dynamic Weight Adjustments**:
  - Differentiate settlement scores based on adjacency to high-value tiles (numbers 6, 8) and resource variety. Increase base settlement score from **8 to 10**.
  - Penalize settlement building on locations adjacent to low-value tiles (e.g., number probabilities of 2 or 12). Apply a **-3 penalty**.
  ```python
  resource_bonus = sum(number_probability(tile.number) for tile in adjacent_tiles if tile.resource is not None)
  if sum(number_probability(tile.number) < 4 for tile in adjacent_tiles):
      resource_bonus -= 3  # Penalty for adjacency to low-value tiles
  score = 10 + resource_bonus
  ```

#### City Scores:
- **Stage-Sensitive Adjustments**:
  - Maintain a high fixed priority for cities (score: 15) but add conditions to reflect when cities should be deprioritized:
    - If fewer than 3 settlements exist, reduce priority to **7** to emphasize foundational growth.
    ```python
    if len(settlements) < 3:
        score = 7  # Cities deprioritized until sufficient settlements exist
    ```

#### Road Scores:
- **Expansion Utility**:
  - Increase road score (base: 10) under conditions where settlements can follow immediately:
    ```python
    if action.action_type == ActionType.BUILD_ROAD and adjacent_empty_spot(action.value):
        score += 5  # Boost road priority if it leads toward settlement expansion
    ```
  - Roads bucket excess resources efficiently (brick, wood), and handling this systematically prevents stagnation.

#### Resource Bottleneck Handling:
- **Ore-Wheat Surplus**:
  - Introduce bottleneck detection for ore/wheat surplus. Add incentives for buying development cards or building cities when thresholds are exceeded.
    ```python
    if player_resources[4] >= threshold_ore and player_resources[3] >= threshold_wheat:
        heuristic_scores[ActionType.BUY_DEVELOPMENT_CARD] += 7  # Encourages spending resources effectively
        heuristic_scores[ActionType.BUILD_CITY] += 5
    ```
- **Mixed Surplus Strategy**:
  - Fallback mechanism triggers to spend surplus resources on actions with lower weights if impactful actions cannot be immediately performed.

---

### 3. Strategy Options for Next Evolution
#### Strategy 1: Settlement Optimization
- **Core Heuristic Changes**:
  - Increase settlement base score to **10** and apply resource diversity penalties/bonuses (as indicated above).
  - Adjust road scoring to prioritize connections to high-value settlement spots.
- **Fallback Enhancements**:
  - Ensure settlement-building is prioritized over roads whenever both are possible and resources permit.
  ```python
  priority_order = [ActionType.BUILD_SETTLEMENT, ActionType.BUILD_CITY, ActionType.BUILD_ROAD]
  ```

#### Strategy 2: Bottleneck Resolution Framework
- **Resource Threshold Detection**:
  - Detect resource surplus (e.g., ore/wheat or brick/wood) and enforce actions to resolve bottlenecks systematically. Prioritize city upgrades when ore/wheat surplus is present, roads when brick/wood surplus is detected.
- **Heuristic Refinement**:
  - Introduce bottleneck bonuses:
    ```python
    if player_resources[1] >= 3 and player_resources[0] >= 3:
        heuristic_scores[ActionType.BUILD_ROAD] += 5
    ```
      
#### Strategy 3: VP Progression Focus via Cities
- **Stage-Based Adjustment**:
  - Prioritize cities while maintaining settlement-building logic for foundational growth. Integrate heuristic logic to reduce city scores if fewer than 3 settlements are present.
- **Development Card Backup**:
  - Actively prioritize buying development cards when cities/settlements cannot be built due to resource constraints.
  - Add fallback logic focused on achieving Largest Army or disrupting competitors.

---

### Next Steps:
1. Integrate settlement optimization logic and dynamic resource management to address stagnation.
2. Benchmark the proposed scoring adjustments and strategize actions to test across multiple game iterations.
3. Combine bottleneck resolutions and VP progression focus to ensure gradual, measurable improvements toward impactful gameplay outcomes.

END STRATEGY.================================== Ai Message ==================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Optimize heuristic-driven actions in FooPlayer by implementing refined settlement prioritization, resource bottleneck resolution mechanisms, and VP progression strategies. Test improvements to settlement, city, and road-building actions over the next five iterations.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Implement **Strategy 1: Settlement Optimization** in FooPlayer to improve gameplay by:
1. Diversifying settlement scores based on high/low tile probability and adjacency resource variety.
2. Adjusting road-scoring logic to prioritize building roads that enable potential settlement expansion.
3. Refining the fallback mechanism to prioritize substantive actions (settlements, cities, roads) over low-impact turns.

CHOSEN AGENT: CODER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:
Refactor `foo_player.py` to follow the directives of **Strategy 1: Settlement Optimization**:

1. **Dynamic Settlement Scoring**:
   - Increase settlement base score to 10.
   - Adjust scoring logic for settlements based on tile probability values and penalties for adjacent low-probability tiles. For example:
     ```python
     resource_bonus = sum(number_probability(tile.number) for tile in adjacent_tiles if tile.resource is not None)
     if sum(1 for tile in adjacent_tiles if number_probability(tile.number) < 4) >= 1:
         resource_bonus -= 3  # Penalize low-value locations
     heuristic_scores[action] = 10 + resource_bonus
     ```

2. **Improved Road Scoring**:
   - Increase road score if the road enables immediate or future settlement building. Example:
     ```python
     if action.action_type == ActionType.BUILD_ROAD and adjacent_empty_node(action.value):
         heuristic_scores[action] += 5  # Incentivize road near buildable settlement spots
     ```

3. **Prioritization Order**:
   - Implement fallback logic to prioritize impactful actions in this order:
     - Settlements > Cities > Roads > Development Cards > Trades.
     Add debug logs where fallback is triggered to ensure visibility into the decision-making process.

Once these changes are implemented, run the updated FooPlayer and measure its success across game simulations. Aim to validate settlement optimization and ensure alignment between heuristic scoring, resource availability, and strategic decision-making.================================ Human Message =================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Improve the performance of the `FooPlayer.py` by introducing intelligent strategy logic that leverages the LLM for decision-making. Specifically, aim for a minimum win count of 1 within the next 5 iterations while improving VP, settlements, and measurable gameplay metrics.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Address the issue of the `decide` method defaulting to selecting the first action. Integrate the LLM's `query_llm` functionality to intelligently evaluate actions based on state and strategy.

CHOSEN AGENT: CODER

AGENT OBJECTIVE: 
The current implementation of `FooPlayer` is defaulting to selecting the first action, as evidenced by the repeated log message "Choosing First Action on Default." Modify the `decide` method to leverage the `self.llm.query_llm` functionality for decision-making. Specifically:

1. Replace the current first-action default with an implementation that:
   a. Obtains a list of possible actions from the game state.
   b. Queries the LLM (`self.llm.query_llm`) for the evaluation of these actions.
   c. Selects the most intelligent action based on the LLM's evaluation.

2. Ensure the decision logic is robust and includes handling scenarios such as:
   - No valid actions available.
   - LLM providing ambiguous or conflicting guidance (fallback mechanisms).

3. Include clear comments and logging to observe how the LLM is influencing decision-making.

Once done, provide the modified code to be tested.================================== Ai Message ==================================

CODER

### Changes Made:
1. **Replaced Default Action Selection**:
   - Removed the hardcoded `return playable_actions[0]` that selected the first action by default.

2. **Integrated LLM Decision-Making in `decide`**:
   - Constructed a comprehensive prompt using the `_build_prompt` function to provide the LLM with game state and available actions.
   - Queried the LLM using `self.llm.query_llm(prompt)`.
   - Parsed the LLM's response using the `_parse_llm_response` function to select the most appropriate action from the available options.

3. **Added New Helper Methods**:
   - `_build_prompt`: Constructs a prompt by including the current game state and the list of playable actions.
   - `_parse_llm_response`: Interprets the LLM's response to match it with one of the playable actions. If no match is found, defaults to the first action.

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Included error handling for cases where the LLM query fails or returns an ambiguous response. In such cases, the method defaults to selecting the first action.
   - Added logging to show the LLM's response (`print(f"LLM Response: {llm_response}")`) and fallback mechanisms.

5. **Logging and Debugging**:
   - Added print statements for better debugging and observation:
     - Log when no playable actions are available.
     - Log the LLM's raw response.
     - Log if the response is ambiguous or invalid, and the fallback action is selected.

### Notes for the Next Iteration:
- **Prompt Details**: The current `_build_prompt` function makes a basic serialization of the game state and actions. If the LLM struggles to prioritize or understand the game details, refining this prompt may be necessary.
- **LLM Error Responses**: If runtime timing issues with `query_llm` arise (e.g., long delays or failures), adjustment of query limits or timeouts may be needed.

### Testing Recommendations:
- Test how the LLM chooses actions in various scenarios to verify that the parsing logic aligns with actual gameplay.
- Monitor logs (`LLM Response: ...`) for unexpected behaviors or ambiguous responses.

END CODER================================ Human Message =================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Transition FooPlayer into a competitive player over the next 5 iterations by leveraging enhanced strategy, including heuristic reinforcement, refined LLM prompts, and deterministic fallback mechanisms, and targeting measurable improvements in average VP and win rates.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Implement **segmented contextual prompting** and heuristic-enhanced decision-making into the LLM integration (as per Strategy 1 and 4). Additionally, integrate a **ranked action hierarchy** as a fallback mechanism (Strategy 2).

CHOSEN AGENT: CODER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:  
Modify the `decide` method of `FooPlayer.py` to achieve the following:

1. **Refined LLM Prompt**: 
   - Update the `_build_prompt` function to use **segmented contextual prompting**. Include headers that describe the game state, available resources, and strategic goals. Example structure:
     ```
     Current Game State:
     - Player Stats: {resources}, {settlements}, {cities}, VP: {victory_points}
     - Opponent Stats: {opponent resources/blockades}, etc.
     Goal: Maximize VP while taking advantage of the current game state.
     Available Actions: {list of formatted playable actions}
     Respond with:
     Action: {Selected optimal action}
     Justification: {Reasoning behind the action choice}
     ```

2. **Heuristic Context Integration**:
   - In the `_build_prompt` method, compute heuristic scores (e.g., settlement value, city upgrade value, road extension value) for each action. Integrate these scores into the prompt to help the LLM make better decisions.

3. **Fallback Mechanism**:
   - Enhance `_parse_llm_response` to implement a **ranked action hierarchy** fallback mechanism when the LLM output is invalid or ambiguous. Example hierarchy:
     - Priority Order: Build City > Build Settlement > Build Road > End Turn.
     - If a valid option matching the LLM response is not found, return the first valid action in this priority order.

4. **Logging**:
   - Improve logging to capture the heuristic scores, the LLM prompt, its raw response, and the fallback decision (when necessary) for post-game analysis.

Once complete, test the updated `FooPlayer.py`, run games, and report the results.================================== Ai Message ==================================

CODER

### Changes Made:
1. **Refined LLM Prompt Construction**:
   - Enhanced the `_build_prompt` function to use **segmented contextual prompting** with detailed headers for game state, player stats, opponent stats, and available actions.
   - Integrated **heuristic scores** for each action into the prompt to guide the LLM decision-making.

2. **Heuristic Computation Method**:
   - Added a `_compute_heuristic_scores` helper method to assign heuristic values to each action based on action type (e.g., city-building prioritized over road-building).

3. **Improved Parsing Logic**:
   - Enhanced `_parse_llm_response` to return a matching action from the LLM response, or delegate to the fallback mechanism if no match is found.

4. **Ranked Fallback Mechanism**:
   - Implemented `_fallback_action` to evaluate actions in a priority order: Build City > Build Settlement > Build Road > End Turn.
   - Default to the first action only when no prioritized options exist.

5. **Logging**:
   - Added print statements throughout to capture key debugging information:
     - The LLM prompt.
     - Heuristic scores of actions.
     - The LLM's raw response.
     - Logs for fallback mechanism use.

6. **Error Handling Enhancements**:
   - Integrated robust exception handling in the `decide` method for LLM failures, with clear logging of fallbacks.

### Notes for the Next Iteration:
- Tune the **heuristic scores** if the LLM's decisions align poorly with optimal strategies.
- Monitor how well the LLM responds to the enhanced prompt structure during testing.
- Evaluate the fallback mechanism's efficiency in comparison to the LLM's responses.

### Testing Recommendations:
- Focus on scenarios requiring diverse strategic goals (e.g., blocking opponent moves, building towards Largest Army).
- Analyze logs for patterns in ambiguous or ineffective LLM responses, and refine prompts or fallback heuristics accordingly.

END CODER================================ Human Message =================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Ensure functionality and compatibility of FooPlayer with the Catanatron API while strengthening the LLM decision-making mechanism in a way that improves strategic performance over the next 5 iterations.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Integrate valid Catanatron API calls into `foo_player.py`'s `_build_prompt` method to fetch relevant game data like resources, settlements, cities, roads, and victory points, and resolve the current `AttributeError` preventing gameplay.

CHOSEN AGENT: CODER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:  
Resolve the `AttributeError` by replacing invalid calls in `foo_player.py` with Catanatron-compatible API calls as outlined in the research:

1. **Resources**:
   - Replace `game.get_player_resources(Color.BLUE)` with `get_player_freqdeck(state, Color.BLUE)` to fetch all resources for FooPlayer.
   - Use `player_num_resource_cards(state, Color.BLUE, resource)` to query specific resource counts.

2. **Settlements and Cities**:
   - Replace invalid calls for settlements/cities with:
     ```python
     get_player_buildings(state, Color.BLUE, "SETTLEMENT")
     get_player_buildings(state, Color.BLUE, "CITY")
     ```

3. **Victory Points and Roads**:
   - Retrieve victory points using:
     ```python
     vp = state.player_state[player_key(state, Color.BLUE) + "_ACTUAL_VICTORY_POINTS"]
     ```
   - Roads remaining:
     ```python
     roads_available = state.player_state[player_key(state, Color.BLUE) + "_ROADS_AVAILABLE"]
     ```

4. **General Updates to `_build_prompt`**:
   - Adjust the prompt to include all valid game stats, ensuring Catanatron API calls function.
   - Include resource counts, settlements, cities, roads, and VP in the formatted prompt structure.

5. **Debugging and Validation**:
   - Add logging to verify data retrieval accuracy during gameplay for resources, actions, and VP.
   - Run a test evolution to confirm the absence of runtime errors.

Update the code to reflect these changes and provide detailed debug logs during testing for validation.================================== Ai Message ==================================

CODER

### Changes Made:
1. **Replaced Invalid API Calls**:
   - Substituted `game.get_player_resources(Color.BLUE)` with `get_player_freqdeck(state, Color.BLUE)` to correctly fetch resources.
   - Similar replacements made for settlements, cities, victory points, and roads using valid Catanatron API functions: 
     - `get_player_buildings(state, Color.BLUE, "SETTLEMENT")` and `get_player_buildings(state, Color.BLUE, "CITY")` for settlements and cities.
     - Victory points accessed via `state.player_state[f"{player_key(state, Color.BLUE)}_ACTUAL_VICTORY_POINTS"]`.
     - Roads available via `state.player_state[f"{player_key(state, Color.BLUE)}_ROADS_AVAILABLE"]`.

2. **Updated `_build_prompt` Method**:
   - Included new resource and state-fetching methods in the prompt template.
   - Enhanced formatting to make the prompt explainable and consistent with the desired LLM input structure.

3. **Improved Compatibility**:
   - Refactored the game state integration in `_build_prompt` to align with valid methods reliably compatible with the API.

4. **Debugging Enhancements**:
   - Added detailed logging via print statements to verify accurate state data retrieval during gameplay (resources, settlements, cities, heuristic scores).
   - Included error handling for invalid or mismatched LLM responses.

### Notes for the Next Iteration:
- Test how well the new prompt structure works with the LLM's decision-making.
- Monitor logs for resource/state-fetch accuracy and potential mismatches between heuristic scores and LLM responses.

### Testing Recommendations:
- Verify that resources, settlements, cities, and other player stats from the state align with the game's current state through debugging outputs.
- Check if the fallback mechanism handles invalid or ambiguous LLM responses efficiently.

END CODER================================ Human Message =================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Implement a strategy that improves both early and late-game decision-making for FooPlayer through advanced heuristics, adjusted fallback mechanisms, and refined LLM prompts, achieving measurable improvements in metrics such as roads, settlements, and victory points.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Integrate enhanced heuristic scoring and dynamic fallback priorities into the decision flow while refining LLM responses for strategic action selection, focusing on VP growth and efficient resource use.

CHOSEN AGENT: CODER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:  
Modify FooPlayer to implement the strategies outlined in the five key areas. Specifically:

1. **Enhance Heuristic Scoring**:
   - Add multipliers for actions directly contributing to Victory Points, such as settlement building and city upgrading.
   - Dynamically adjust scores based on the game stage (early vs. late-game priorities), prioritizing roads and settlements early while focusing on VP-heavy actions late.

2. **Dynamic Fallback Mechanism**:
   - Revise the fallback mechanism to focus on early-game expansion via roads and settlements as placeholders for resource diversity and VP accumulation.
   - Later transition fallback logic to VP-centric actions like city upgrades and development cards.

3. **Refined LLM Prompt**:
   - Update the LLM prompt to emphasize VP growth explicitly.
   - Demand justification for actions based on Victory Points and strategic blocking of opponents.

4. **Resource Threshold Balancing**:
   - Introduce logic for maintaining resource reserves and diversifying investments based on available actions.
   - Trigger placeholder actions like road-building when strategic objectives are temporarily unattainable.

5. **Action Bottleneck Detection**:
   - Implement tracking logic for repetitive unproductive actions (e.g., repeated "END TURN").
   - Adjust decision scoring to discourage stagnation, forcing resource spending or defensive actions when necessary.

Make necessary modifications to the `decide` method and auxiliary functions like `_build_prompt` and `heuristic_scores`. Run a test iteration post-implementation to ensure that the changes positively impact FooPlayer performance.

Let me know when you're ready to test the updated player!================================ Human Message =================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Over the next 5 iterations, implement and refine a system that better aligns FooPlayer's heuristic evaluation, LLM prompt design, and fallback mechanisms towards impactful, VP-driven actions. Aim for measurable improvements in foundational metrics like roads, settlements, and cities.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Recalibrate FooPlayer's heuristic scoring system to implement stage-specific priorities and dynamically address bottlenecks, ensuring better alignment between heuristic-driven actions and LLM output. Update the LLM prompt design to explicitly focus on VP growth and reduce low-value decision patterns.

CHOSEN AGENT: CODER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:  
Update `foo_player.py` as follows:

1. **Enhanced Heuristic Scoring**: 
    - Modify `_compute_heuristic_scores` to include stage-specific priorities:
      - Early-game boosts for roads and settlements.
      - Late-game emphasis on cities and development cards.
    - Include dynamic bottle-neck handling, e.g.:
      - Reward actions that address resource buildup or stagnation.
      - Encourage actions that disrupt opponents (e.g., blocking roads/settlements).
    - Use tile values (6, 8, etc.) to boost settlement scores for strategic intersections.

2. **Refined LLM Prompt**:
    - Update `_build_prompt` with stronger emphasis on guiding actions toward VP and strategic goals:
      - Enumerate priorities explicitly: building roads, settlements, cities.
      - Include heuristic scores in the prompt with descriptions of why actions are valuable.
      - Penalize repetitive actions like "END TURN" through explicit discouragement in the prompt.

3. **Fallback Mechanism Adjustment**:
    - Introduce deterministic templates for stage-specific fallback actions:
      - Early-game: Prioritize roads and settlements for expansion.
      - Late-game: Focus on cities and VP-centric actions.
    - Dynamically adapt fallback decisions based on resource surplus or game state bottlenecks.
    ```python
    if player_resources["brick"] >= 3 and player_resources["wood"] >= 3:
        heuristic_scores[ActionType.BUILD_ROAD] += 5
    ```

4. **Action Bottleneck Detection**:
    - Add detection for repetitive or stagnating actions (e.g., unspent resources or repeated "END TURN").
    - Penalize stagnation by prioritizing resource expenditure and spatial expansion.

Upon completing the updates, test the revised player for functional improvements in decision-making, focusing on roads, settlements, and overall strategic progression.================================== Ai Message ==================================

CODER

### Updates to `foo_player.py`:
1. **Enhanced Heuristic Scoring**:
   - Integrated stage-specific priorities (e.g., roads and settlements emphasized early-game, cities in mid-late game).
   - Added bonuses for high-resource tiles in settlement actions.
   - Introduced penalties to address resource bottlenecks (e.g., surplus brick/wood triggers road-building incentives).
   - Incorporated logic to dynamically adjust scores based on resource availability and VP contributions.

2. **Refined LLM Prompt**:
   - Redesigned `_build_prompt` to better guide the LLM:
     - Explicit priorities for strategic actions based on Victory Point (VP) growth.
     - Highlighted roadmap for early-game road/settlement building and late-game upgrades.
     - Discouraged repetitive or non-impactful actions like unnecessary turns.
   - Included heuristic scores in the prompt, with explanations for why certain actions are prioritized.

3. **Dynamic Fallback Mechanism**:
   - Structured fallback logic to prioritize actions based on game state:
     - Early-game: Roads and settlements.
     - Late-game: Cities and VP-centric actions.
   - Updated fallback mechanism to prevent stagnation by using deterministic templates blended with heuristic-driven conditions.

4. **Bottleneck and Surplus Resource Handling**:
   - Added logic to detect and dynamically handle situations where surplus resources exist (e.g., incentivizing road-building on excess brick/wood).
   - Increased priority for settlement or city building to resolve resource stagnation.

5. **Improved Logs**:
   - Added meaningful print statements across key decision-making steps to facilitate debugging:
     - Fallback actions.
     - Detected bottlenecks or resource imbalances.
     - LLM responses (and when fallback mechanisms are triggered).

### Testing Suggestions:
- **Evaluate Decision Quality**:
  - Test early-game actions for expansion focus (roads and settlements).
  - Verify mid-to-late game actions prioritize cities and VP-centric plays.
- **Monitor Bottleneck Response**:
  - Simulate resource-rich scenarios to observe if surplus resources are properly spent.
- **Validate Fallback Logic**:
  - Conduct games where the LLM fails or incorrectly parses the prompt to assess fallback success.
- **Track Metrics**:
  - Compare average VP, settlements, and city counts across multiple iterations to previous versions.

### Next Steps:
- Refine heuristic weights after testing to balance strategic trade-offs.
- Incorporate feedback cycles to analyze and further tune prompt alignment with heuristic evaluations.
- Observe repetitive "END TURN" penalties and ensure they improve game progression.

END CODER================================ Human Message =================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Ensure compatibility with the Catanatron API by appropriately integrating valid attributes of the `Action` class and utilizing game state data to enhance decision-making. Achieve stable functionality for testing strategic performance over the next 5 iterations.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Correct the `AttributeError` by refactoring `foo_player.py` to rely on valid `Action.value` attributes or query relevant context from the `State` class for heuristic scoring. Ensure all references to `location` are replaced with valid methods to retrieve positional or resource data.

CHOSEN AGENT: CODER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:
Refactor `foo_player.py` to address the syntax error and improve heuristic scoring:

1. **Fix Invalid References**:
   - Replace all calls to the nonexistent `action.location` with queries to `Action.value` or `State` methods.
   - Example adjustments:
     ```python
     if action.action_type == ActionType.BUILD_SETTLEMENT and len(state.board.map.adjacent_tiles[action.value]) > threshold:
         heuristic_scores[action] += 3
     ```
     Here, `action.value` provides the node ID where the settlement would be built.

2. **Context Retrieval from State**:
   - For actions like `BUILD_SETTLEMENT` or `BUILD_CITY`, retrieve adjacent tiles and their resource values using `state.board.map.adjacent_tiles[action.value]`.
   - For roads, use `Action.value` to access edge information and query connected tiles.

3. **Heuristic Scoring Enhancements**:
   - Incorporate valid context details from the state or action attributes to refine heuristic scoring:
     - High-value tiles should boost settlement scores:
       ```python
       adjacent_resources = [tile.resource for tile in state.board.map.adjacent_tiles[action.value] if tile.resource is not None]
       resource_bonus = sum(tile.value for resource in adjacent_resources)
       heuristic_scores[action] += resource_bonus
       ```

4. **Debugging and Validation**:
   - Ensure all invalid references are replaced with valid calls.
   - Add debug print statements to verify successful access to `Action.value` or state functions during gameplay.

Once refactoring is complete, test FooPlayer to confirm it runs without errors and demonstrate functional heuristic scoring improvements.================================== Ai Message ==================================

CODER

### Summary of Changes:
1. **Fixed `AttributeError`**:
   - Replaced invalid references to `action.location` with valid attribute and context retrieval using `action.value` and game state methods (e.g., accessing `state.board.map.adjacent_tiles` for settlement scoring).

2. **Improved Settlement Scoring**:
   - Enhanced `_compute_heuristic_scores` to calculate bonuses for settlements based on adjacent tiles' resource values using `state.board.map.adjacent_tiles[action.value]`.

3. **Resource Bottleneck Handling**:
   - Retained logic for surplus brick/wood to incentivize road-building.

4. **Improved Debugging**:
   - Added specific print statements during fallback and heuristic computation to verify logic.

5. **Dynamic Heuristic Refinements**:
   - Settlement scoring dynamically adjusts based on adjacent tile values, improving action prioritization.

### Testing Plan:
- Verify that the game runs without errors.
- Validate heuristic score calculations for settlements and roads using logs.
- Test gameplay performance:
  - Early-game: Expansion (settlements and roads).
  - Late-game: City-building and VP growth.

END CODER================================ Human Message =================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Ensure stable heuristic scoring for FooPlayer by correctly accessing valid attributes of `LandTile` and utilizing game state methods (e.g., `adjacent_tiles`) to compute bonuses for settlements and roads. Refine gameplay to support functional testing over the next 5 iterations.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Replace the incorrect reference to `tile.value` in heuristic scoring with valid queries to `tile.resource`, `tile.number`, and `number_probability()` to calculate bonuses for adjacent tiles when evaluating settlement actions.

CHOSEN AGENT: CODER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:
Refactor `foo_player.py` to fix the error and improve scoring calculations:

1. **Correct Tile Context Retrieval**:
   - Replace all calls to `tile.value` with queries to valid attributes of `LandTile`, such as `tile.resource` for resource type or `tile.number` for dice roll probability.
   - Use `game.state.board.adjacent_tiles[node_id]` to get tiles surrounding the node at which a settlement or city is to be built.
   - Example adjustment:
     ```python
     adjacent_tiles = game.state.board.adjacent_tiles[action.value]
     resource_bonus = sum(number_probability(tile.number) for tile in adjacent_tiles if tile.resource is not None)
     heuristic_scores[action] += resource_bonus
     ```

2. **Enhance Settlement Scoring**:
   - Calculate settlement scores dynamically based on cumulative resource probabilities from adjacent tiles (using `number_probability()` and `tile.resource`).
   - Adjust `_compute_heuristic_scores` to include valid resource bonuses:
     ```python
     for action in playable_actions:
         if action.action_type == ActionType.BUILD_SETTLEMENT:
             adjacent_tiles = game.state.board.adjacent_tiles[action.value]
             resource_bonus = sum(number_probability(tile.number) for tile in adjacent_tiles if tile.resource is not None)
             heuristic_scores[action] = 10 + resource_bonus
     ```

3. **Validate Heuristic Scoring**:
   - Ensure all logic runs smoothly, avoiding invalid calls or attributes.
   - Add debug print statements to log computed bonuses during gameplay.

Once implemented, test FooPlayer for functionality and measure changes in heuristic-driven decision-making across multiple iterations.================================== Ai Message ==================================

CODER

### Changes Made:
1. **Resolved `AttributeError`**:
   - Replaced previous invalid references to `tile.value` with `number_probability(tile.number)` from the `LandTile` class to compute bonuses based on tile probabilities.

2. **Updated Heuristic Scoring Logic**:
   - Settlement bonuses now dynamically evaluate adjacent tiles using `state.board.adjacent_tiles[action.value]`.
   - Bonuses are calculated based on valid attributes (`tile.resource` and `tile.number`) using `number_probability()`.

3. **Improved Resource Bottleneck Handling**:
   - Retained logic to incentivize road-building when brick and wood resources are in surplus.

4. **Debug Enhancements**:
   - Added clear print statements to log heuristic scores and fallback decisions.

### Notes for Testing:
- Confirm stability and functionality of the game simulation without syntax errors.
- Test heuristic scoring improvements, observing early-game settlement expansion and resource optimization.
- Validate fallback mechanism functionality when a valid LLM response is not received.

END CODER================================ Human Message =================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Leverage `CatanMap` utilities like `adjacent_tiles` and `node_production` to accurately compute node-specific resource bonuses for heuristic scoring. Stabilize FooPlayer to run without errors and refine its strategic behaviors.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Replace the invalid `state.board.adjacent_tiles` reference in `_compute_heuristic_scores` with a valid call to `game.state.board.map.adjacent_tiles` or leverage `node_production` for simplified resource-based scoring. Prioritize stability and alignment with Catanatron's API.

CHOSEN AGENT: CODER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:
Refactor `foo_player.py` to resolve the `AttributeError` and improve heuristic scoring:

1. **Correct Context Access**:
   - Replace the invalid `state.board.adjacent_tiles[action.value]` with valid methods:
     - Use `game.state.board.map.adjacent_tiles[action.value]` to retrieve adjacent tiles for the node (correcting the error).
     - Alternatively, use `game.state.board.map.node_production[action.value]` for precomputed resource probabilities at a node.

2. **Update Node-Specific Scoring Logic**:
   - If using `adjacent_tiles`, query each tile’s `resource` and `number` attributes and compute bonuses based on `number_probability(tile.number)`. Example:
     ```python
     adjacent_tiles = game.state.board.map.adjacent_tiles[action.value]
     resource_bonus = sum(number_probability(tile.number) for tile in adjacent_tiles if tile.resource is not None)
     ```
   - If using `node_production`, calculate a cumulative production score:
     ```python
     resource_production = game.state.board.map.node_production[action.value]
     resource_bonus = sum(resource_production[resource] * RESOURCE_WEIGHTS[resource] for resource in resource_production)
     ```

3. **Testing and Debugging Enhancements**:
   - Add debug print statements to verify retrieved tile data and computed scores.
   - Ensure heuristic-driven behaviors align with expected strategic priorities (e.g., roads, settlements, VP growth).

After implementing these changes, test FooPlayer for stability and validate heuristic-driven decision-making during game simulations.================================== Ai Message ==================================

     ```python
     if player_resources[1] >= 3 and player_resources[0] >= 3:  # Brick and Wood
         heuristic_scores[action] += 5
     ```

3. **Testing Enhancements**:
   - Add print statements in `_compute_heuristic_scores` to log the retrieved resource counts and verify the heuristic decisions based on resource availability.

After Running The New foo_player.py Player, Here is my analysis and findings:

### Scores of FooPlayer:
- Wins: 0  
- Average Victory Points (VP): 6.0  
- Average Settlements: 0.0  
- Average Cities: 2.0  
- Average Roads: 0.0  
- Average Largest Army: 0.67  
- Average Development VP: 0.67  

### Short Analysis of Game Output:
- **LLM Interaction Success**: LLM consistently generated justifications and proposed actions, such as "TRADE," "BUY_DEVELOPMENT_CARD," and "END_TURN." Responses appeared logical in the context given but often led to suboptimal action in terms of progressing VP efficiently.
- **Interesting Observations**: Maritime trades for resource balancing (e.g., trading ore for wheat) were frequently proposed but failed to substantially impact settlement or city-building opportunities.
- **Performance Deficiency**: Despite coherent justifications, the actual game execution did not lead to strategic advancements. The player failed to build any settlements and only maintained cities, likely limiting resource diversity and overall performance.

### Warnings or Signs of Player Implementation Error:
- **Heuristic Scoring Issue**: Logs suggest heuristic scores are applied, but the scoring system itself appears misaligned with actionable priorities (e.g., settlements as highest priority). High-scored actions like "BUILD_SETTLEMENT" were not executed successfully, indicating a disconnection between scoring and feasibility.
- **Resource Bottleneck**: Repetitive logs highlight insufficient resources for impactful actions, emphasizing a failure in resource management or strategy execution.
- **Low-Impact Choices**: Many turns defaulted to fallback mechanisms or repetitive low-impact actions (e.g., "ROLL" and "END_TURN"), which hindered VP growth and progression.

Let me know if you need anything else!================================== Ai Message ==================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Refine FooPlayer's decision-making to prioritize impactful actions that directly progress toward Victory Points (VP), focusing on settlement building, resource optimization, and strategic expansion. Strengthen alignment between heuristic scoring and actionable priorities over the next five iterations.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Identify and address issues in heuristic scoring and decision prioritization in the next iteration by:
1. Reassessing the weights and functional calculations for settlement and road scoring in `_compute_heuristic_scores`.
2. Improving resource management strategies to resolve bottlenecks and enable impactful actions (e.g., settlements, cities).

CHOSEN AGENT: STRATEGIZER  

AGENT OBJECTIVE:  
Analyze current heuristic strategies implemented in FooPlayer and propose targeted refinements. Specifically:  
1. **Evaluate Existing Strategies**: Are settlements and resource optimization correctly prioritized in the gameplay heuristic scoring system?  
2. **Suggest Strategic Adjustments**: Recommend specific heuristic weight changes or new strategies to focus on building settlements and cities while resolving resource bottlenecks for impactful turns.  
3. **New Strategy Options**: Provide 3 strategy options to test next evolution focusing on VP progression, settlement building optimization, and adaptability during resource deficits.

The current implementation of heuristic scoring shows a general prioritization of settlements and cities but could benefit from specific refinements:
- **Settlement Prioritization**:
  - Settlements score base value (8), plus bonuses derived from adjacent tile probabilities. This approach aligns well with maximizing resource diversity but lacks differentiation between high-value and mediocre locations (e.g., tiles with low number probabilities).
  - Resource optimization for settlements (e.g., ensuring prerequisite resources are available for building settlements) is missing.
- **City Prioritization**:
  - Cities have a fixed weight (15), correctly reflecting their importance for VP progression. However, there's no contextual adjustment to incentivize cities over settlements when the player already has sufficient settlements to move forward efficiently.
- **Resource Management Strategies**:
  - While surplus brick/wood are partially addressed in road scoring, the handling of ore/wheat surplus for cities or development cards could be improved. The current logic misses opportunities to detect potential bottlenecks due to imbalanced resource accumulation.

---

### 2. Recommended Strategic Adjustments
To better align heuristic scoring and resource management with impactful actions:
#### Settlement Scores:
- **Dynamic Weight Adjustments**:
  - Differentiate settlement scores based on adjacency to high-value tiles (numbers 6, 8) and resource variety. Increase base settlement score from **8 to 10**.
  - Penalize settlement building on locations adjacent to low-value tiles (e.g., number probabilities of 2 or 12). Apply a **-3 penalty**.
  ```python
  resource_bonus = sum(number_probability(tile.number) for tile in adjacent_tiles if tile.resource is not None)
  if sum(number_probability(tile.number) < 4 for tile in adjacent_tiles):
      resource_bonus -= 3  # Penalty for adjacency to low-value tiles
  score = 10 + resource_bonus
  ```

#### City Scores:
- **Stage-Sensitive Adjustments**:
  - Maintain a high fixed priority for cities (score: 15) but add conditions to reflect when cities should be deprioritized:
    - If fewer than 3 settlements exist, reduce priority to **7** to emphasize foundational growth.
    ```python
    if len(settlements) < 3:
        score = 7  # Cities deprioritized until sufficient settlements exist
    ```

#### Road Scores:
- **Expansion Utility**:
  - Increase road score (base: 10) under conditions where settlements can follow immediately:
    ```python
    if action.action_type == ActionType.BUILD_ROAD and adjacent_empty_spot(action.value):
        score += 5  # Boost road priority if it leads toward settlement expansion
    ```
  - Roads bucket excess resources efficiently (brick, wood), and handling this systematically prevents stagnation.

#### Resource Bottleneck Handling:
- **Ore-Wheat Surplus**:
  - Introduce bottleneck detection for ore/wheat surplus. Add incentives for buying development cards or building cities when thresholds are exceeded.
    ```python
    if player_resources[4] >= threshold_ore and player_resources[3] >= threshold_wheat:
        heuristic_scores[ActionType.BUY_DEVELOPMENT_CARD] += 7  # Encourages spending resources effectively
        heuristic_scores[ActionType.BUILD_CITY] += 5
    ```
- **Mixed Surplus Strategy**:
  - Fallback mechanism triggers to spend surplus resources on actions with lower weights if impactful actions cannot be immediately performed.

---

### 3. Strategy Options for Next Evolution
#### Strategy 1: Settlement Optimization
- **Core Heuristic Changes**:
  - Increase settlement base score to **10** and apply resource diversity penalties/bonuses (as indicated above).
  - Adjust road scoring to prioritize connections to high-value settlement spots.
- **Fallback Enhancements**:
  - Ensure settlement-building is prioritized over roads whenever both are possible and resources permit.
  ```python
  priority_order = [ActionType.BUILD_SETTLEMENT, ActionType.BUILD_CITY, ActionType.BUILD_ROAD]
  ```

#### Strategy 2: Bottleneck Resolution Framework
- **Resource Threshold Detection**:
  - Detect resource surplus (e.g., ore/wheat or brick/wood) and enforce actions to resolve bottlenecks systematically. Prioritize city upgrades when ore/wheat surplus is present, roads when brick/wood surplus is detected.
- **Heuristic Refinement**:
  - Introduce bottleneck bonuses:
    ```python
    if player_resources[1] >= 3 and player_resources[0] >= 3:
        heuristic_scores[ActionType.BUILD_ROAD] += 5
    ```
      
#### Strategy 3: VP Progression Focus via Cities
- **Stage-Based Adjustment**:
  - Prioritize cities while maintaining settlement-building logic for foundational growth. Integrate heuristic logic to reduce city scores if fewer than 3 settlements are present.
- **Development Card Backup**:
  - Actively prioritize buying development cards when cities/settlements cannot be built due to resource constraints.
  - Add fallback logic focused on achieving Largest Army or disrupting competitors.

---

### Next Steps:
1. Integrate settlement optimization logic and dynamic resource management to address stagnation.
2. Benchmark the proposed scoring adjustments and strategize actions to test across multiple game iterations.
3. Combine bottleneck resolutions and VP progression focus to ensure gradual, measurable improvements toward impactful gameplay outcomes.

END STRATEGY.================================== Ai Message ==================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Optimize heuristic-driven actions in FooPlayer by implementing refined settlement prioritization, resource bottleneck resolution mechanisms, and VP progression strategies. Test improvements to settlement, city, and road-building actions over the next five iterations.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Implement **Strategy 1: Settlement Optimization** in FooPlayer to improve gameplay by:
1. Diversifying settlement scores based on high/low tile probability and adjacency resource variety.
2. Adjusting road-scoring logic to prioritize building roads that enable potential settlement expansion.
3. Refining the fallback mechanism to prioritize substantive actions (settlements, cities, roads) over low-impact turns.

CHOSEN AGENT: CODER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:
Refactor `foo_player.py` to follow the directives of **Strategy 1: Settlement Optimization**:

1. **Dynamic Settlement Scoring**:
   - Increase settlement base score to 10.
   - Adjust scoring logic for settlements based on tile probability values and penalties for adjacent low-probability tiles. For example:
     ```python
     resource_bonus = sum(number_probability(tile.number) for tile in adjacent_tiles if tile.resource is not None)
     if sum(1 for tile in adjacent_tiles if number_probability(tile.number) < 4) >= 1:
         resource_bonus -= 3  # Penalize low-value locations
     heuristic_scores[action] = 10 + resource_bonus
     ```

2. **Improved Road Scoring**:
   - Increase road score if the road enables immediate or future settlement building. Example:
     ```python
     if action.action_type == ActionType.BUILD_ROAD and adjacent_empty_node(action.value):
         heuristic_scores[action] += 5  # Incentivize road near buildable settlement spots
     ```

3. **Prioritization Order**:
   - Implement fallback logic to prioritize impactful actions in this order:
     - Settlements > Cities > Roads > Development Cards > Trades.
     Add debug logs where fallback is triggered to ensure visibility into the decision-making process.

Once these changes are implemented, run the updated FooPlayer and measure its success across game simulations. Aim to validate settlement optimization and ensure alignment between heuristic scoring, resource availability, and strategic decision-making.================================ Human Message =================================

CODER

### Updates Applied:
1. **Enhanced Settlement Scoring**:
   - Increased base settlement score to 10.
   - Incorporated adjacency bonuses using `number_probability(tile.number)` and penalized low-value locations where probabilities were <4.

2. **Improved Road Scoring**:
   - Modified road scoring to prioritize roads enabling settlement expansion using the `_adjacent_empty_node` helper method.
   - Assigned higher scores (15) for road actions leading to potential settlement spots.

3. **Dynamic City Scoring**:
   - Adjusted city scores to prioritize foundational settlement growth by reducing city priority to 7 if fewer than 3 settlements exist.

4. **Resource Bottleneck Handling**:
   - Improved handling of surplus resources, adding bonuses for road-building when brick/wood are abundant.
   - Encouraged development card purchases during ore/wheat surplus periods.

5. **Adjacency Node Check**:
   - Added `_adjacent_empty_node` helper method to dynamically check for available settlement spots connected to proposed road-building actions.

6. **Fallback Improvements**:
   - Updated fallback mechanism to reflect the new prioritization order: settlements > cities > roads > development cards > low-impact actions.

7. **Debug Enhancements**:
   - Added logs to track decision-making and fallback actions for visibility into player strategy.

### Notes for Testing:
- Validate stability during gameplay to confirm the absence of runtime errors.
- Monitor strategic upgrades (e.g., settlement expansion, city-building prioritization) via logs.
- Evaluate performance improvements over previous iterations, focusing on VP progression and settlement counts.

Let me know if further adjustments or performance observations are needed! END CODER================================ Human Message =================================

- Average Roads: 0.0
- Average Largest Army: 0.0
- Average Development VP: 0.0

### Short Analysis of Game Output:
- The phrase "Choosing First Action on Default" repeated throughout the log suggests that the implementation is defaulting to selecting the first action without strategy. 
- Results indicate poor performance compared to the opponent, with no victories achieved in the 3-game session. 

### Errors, Warnings, or Signs of Implementation Issues:
- **Implementation Warning**: The log shows "Choosing First Action on Default" continuously, indicating that the `decide` method is not leveraging the LLM integration (`self.llm.query_llm`) for decision-making.
- **Gameplay Warning**: The score disparity (2 VP versus 10 VP for the opponent) and the lack of progression in Cities, Roads, and Largest Army metrics highlight a lack of strategy execution.

After Running The New foo_player.py Player, Here is my analysis and findings:

### Scores of FooPlayer:
- Wins: 0  
- Average Victory Points (VP): 3.33  
- Average Settlements: 2.33  
- Average Cities: 0.33  
- Average Roads: 0.0  
- Average Largest Army: 0.0  
- Average Development VP: 0.33  

### Short Analysis of Game Output:
- The LLM consistently failed to provide valid or actionable responses: "LLM response ambiguous or invalid. Defaulting to first action."
- FooPlayer defaulted to the first available action in all scenarios instead of executing strategic decisions.
- The performance difference is stark: FooPlayer had no wins and significantly lower VP compared to AlphaBetaPlayer.

### Errors, Warnings, or Signs of Implementation Issues:
- **LLM Integration Issue**: LLM responses are not being parsed correctly or are poorly generated, leading to fallback actions ("Defaulting to first action").
- **Decision-Making Deficiency**: The lack of strategic outcomes (e.g., 0 roads, 0 Largest Army) suggests serious shortcomings in action planning and execution.
- **Repeated Logs**: Multiple instances of ambiguous LLM responses point to insufficient prompt design or response parsing mechanism in `_parse_llm_response`.

After Running The New foo_player.py Player, Here is my analysis and findings:

### Syntax Error Details:
- **Error Message**: `AttributeError: 'Game' object has no attribute 'get_player_resources'`
- **Exact Line Number**: Line 84 in `foo_player.py`
- **Exact Line of Code**: `resources=str(game.get_player_resources(Color.BLUE)),  # Example method to get resources`

### Root Cause:
The method `get_player_resources` is being called on the `Game` object, but it does not exist in the `Game` class, leading to an `AttributeError`. This indicates a mismatch between the game's API and the implementation in `foo_player.py`.

### Impact:
The syntax error prevents the game from running, and thus no game results were recorded for this evolution.

- Average Cities: 0.33  
- Average Roads: 0.0  
- Average Largest Army: 0.0  
- Average Development VP: 0.0  

### Short Analysis of Game Output:
- **LLM Interaction**: The LLM responded consistently, but gameplay justification often involved executing mandatory or default actions (e.g., "ROLL" and "END TURN"), suggesting limited strategic depth.
- **Interesting Output**: The heuristic scoring mechanism categorizes actions clearly, but no significant changes to gameplay performance reflect deeper strategy execution.
- **Signs of Issue**: No roads or army development indicates repeated failure to invest strategically in growth areas, despite consistent heuristic scoring.

### Errors, Warnings, or Signs of Implementation Issues:
- **Strategic Weakness**: The absence of victories and poor metrics like roads and army raises concerns about the decision-making quality. 
- **Heuristic Misalignment**: High heuristic scores for actions like "BUILD_ROAD" occasionally appear in the logs but fail to translate into meaningful gameplay progression.

- Average Roads: 0.0  
- Average Largest Army: 0.0  
- Average Development VP: 0.0  

### Short Analysis of Game Output:
- **Repetitive Logs**: Multiple instances of LLM responses defaulting to basic actions such as "ROLL" and "END TURN," with justifications suggesting limited strategic depth. Example: "Rolling is necessary to progress the game state."
- **Neutral Heuristic Scoring**: Actions often evaluated with a low heuristic score (`1`). This indicates the heuristic system fails to differentiate between strategic actions.
- **Misalignment**: High-priority actions like "BUILD_CITY" or "BUILD_SETTLEMENT" seem underutilized, despite occasional high heuristic scores visible in logs. 

### Errors, Warnings, or Signs of Implementation Issues:
- **LLM Integration Weakness**: Responses imply poor decision quality by prioritizing roll/end-turn actions excessively. This indicates the prompt design and parsing mechanisms need refinement.
- **Strategic Gaps**: Failure to build roads or utilize army resources, even across multiple turns, suggests severe strategic deficiencies. The game log reinforces these gaps.
- **Warning**: Logs frequently state "Fallback mechanism applied," implying reliance on basic action prioritization rather than effective LLM outputs.

- Average Settlements: 0.0  
- Average Cities: 2.0  
- Average Roads: 0.0  
- Average Largest Army: 0.67  
- Average Development VP: 0.67  

### Short Analysis of Game Output:
- **LLM Interaction Success**: LLM consistently generated justifications and proposed actions, such as "TRADE," "BUY_DEVELOPMENT_CARD," and "END_TURN." Responses appeared logical in the context given but often led to suboptimal action in terms of progressing VP efficiently.
- **Interesting Observations**: Maritime trades for resource balancing (e.g., trading ore for wheat) were frequently proposed but failed to substantially impact settlement or city-building opportunities.
- **Performance Deficiency**: Despite coherent justifications, the actual game execution did not lead to strategic advancements. The player failed to build any settlements and only maintained cities, likely limiting resource diversity and overall performance.

### Warnings or Signs of Player Implementation Error:
- **Heuristic Scoring Issue**: Logs suggest heuristic scores are applied, but the scoring system itself appears misaligned with actionable priorities (e.g., settlements as highest priority). High-scored actions like "BUILD_SETTLEMENT" were not executed successfully, indicating a disconnection between scoring and feasibility.
- **Resource Bottleneck**: Repetitive logs highlight insufficient resources for impactful actions, emphasizing a failure in resource management or strategy execution.
- **Low-Impact Choices**: Many turns defaulted to fallback mechanisms or repetitive low-impact actions (e.g., "ROLL" and "END_TURN"), which hindered VP growth and progression.

LLM Response: Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_SETTLEMENT: 'BUILD_SETTLEMENT'>, value=22)

Justification: Building a settlement at position 22 is an optimal choice as it ranks among the highest heuristic scores (7.333333333333334), indicating strong resource diversity potential or strategic placement. Expanding settlements early aligns with the game's priority of maximizing resource collection and establishing a strong foundation for VP growth. Additionally, building at this position provides better strategic positioning to block opponents' progress and secure valuable intersections for future expansions.

    - Short analysis of the game output (return anything interseting that was printed)
    - EMPHASIZE any errors, warnings, or signs of player implementation error in the game_output.txt file 

If there is a syntax error, I want you to return
    - The error message from the game_output.txt file
    - The exact line number of the error if possible
    - The exact line of code that caused the error if possible

Keep the Response as concise as possible

After Running The New foo_player.py Player, Here is my analysis and findings:

### Syntax Error Details:
- **Error Message**: `AttributeError: 'CatanMap' object has no attribute 'adjacent_nodes'. Did you mean: 'adjacent_tiles'?`
- **Exact Line Number**: Line 134 in `foo_player.py`
- **Exact Line of Code**: `adjacent_nodes = game.state.board.map.adjacent_nodes[edge_id]`

### Root Cause:
The `CatanMap` object does not have an attribute `adjacent_nodes`. The correct attribute appears to be `adjacent_tiles` as suggested in the error message. This occurs in the `_adjacent_empty_node` method, which is used for heuristic scoring to validate potential road connections.

### Impact:
The syntax error prevents the game simulation from running, resulting in no recorded game results or scores for this evolution. Additionally, this issue directly affects heuristic calculations and the decision-making process.

AttributeError: 'Board' object has no attribute 'adjacent_tiles'================================ Human Message =================================

After Running The New foo_player.py Player, Here is my analysis and findings:

### Syntax Error Details:
- **Error Message**: `AttributeError: 'Board' object has no attribute 'adjacent_tiles'`
- **Exact Line Number**: Line 91 in `foo_player.py`
- **Exact Line of Code**: `adjacent_tiles = state.board.adjacent_tiles[action.value]`

### Root Cause:
The `Board` object in the provided game framework does not have an attribute or method named `adjacent_tiles`. The code attempts to calculate heuristic scores based on adjacent tiles, leading to this error.

### Impact:
The syntax error prevents the game simulation from running, and no game results or performance data were generated for this evolution.

Let me know if you need anything else!================================== Ai Message ==================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Ensure accurate context retrieval from the game framework by replacing invalid references to nonexistent `adjacent_tiles` attributes and identifying the correct methods or mechanisms for accessing adjacent tile information. Stabilize the game for functional testing and iterative improvements.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Replace the erroneous reference to `state.board.adjacent_tiles` with a valid alternative to retrieve adjacent tile information or resource contexts from the game framework. Verify functionality and eliminate all remaining syntax issues.

CHOSEN AGENT: RESEARCHER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:  
Investigate alternative methods or properties in the `Board` or related classes (`State`, `Game`) to retrieve adjacent tile information. Specifically:
1. Identify where and how adjacent tile data is stored or computed (e.g., through another attribute, helper function, or method).
2. Confirm any valid alternative mechanisms to compute node-specific resource contexts, such as `node_production` or explicit tile indexing.
3. Provide clear examples or pseudocode to adjust the `_compute_heuristic_scores` function with valid logic.

Deliver actionable steps for replacing invalid calls with correct methods or attributes.================================ Human Message =================================

RESEARCH:

#### Key Mechanisms for Accessing Adjacent Tile Information
The `CatanMap` and `State` classes provide the primary ways to access data about the board, including adjacent tiles and node-specific contexts. For resolving the issue around the erroneous `state.board.adjacent_tiles` reference, here are the validated methods and alternative approaches:

---

### **1. Accessing Adjacent Tiles**
The `CatanMap` class explicitly maintains data structures for adjacent tiles via its `adjacent_tiles` attribute. 
- The `adjacent_tiles` attribute of `CatanMap` serves as a mapping:  
  **Key**: `node_id`  
  **Value**: `List[LandTile]` (all land tiles adjacent to the given node).  

#### Example:
```python
# Access adjacent tiles for a specific node
adjacent_tiles = game.state.board.map.adjacent_tiles[node_id]
for tile in adjacent_tiles:
    resource = tile.resource  # Resource type (e.g., WOOD)
    number = tile.number      # Probability number for the resource
```

---

### **2. Computing Node-Specific Resource Context**
To compute bonuses for a specific node based on adjacent resources, leverage the `node_production` attribute from `CatanMap`.  
- **`node_production`**: Maps `node_id` to a `Counter` of resource probabilities (combining adjacent tiles).

#### Example:
```python
# Retrieve resource production probabilities for a node
resource_production = game.state.board.map.node_production[node_id]

# Example output: Counter({WOOD: 0.25, BRICK: 0.16, WHEAT: 0.08})
print(resource_production)
```

This can be used to assess the strategic value of a node based on the likelihood of obtaining specific resources.

---

### **3. Suggested Fix for `_compute_heuristic_scores`**
To eliminate the invalid `state.board.adjacent_tiles` reference, you can replace it with calls to either `adjacent_tiles` or `node_production` depending on the calculation context. For heuristic-based evaluations:

#### Using `node_production` for Scoring:
```python
def _compute_heuristic_scores(node_id):
    # Retrieve node-specific production score
    resource_production = game.state.board.map.node_production[node_id]
    
    # Compute heuristic score based on production probabilities
    score = sum(
        resource_production[resource] * weight
        for resource, weight in RESOURCE_WEIGHTS.items()
    )
    return score
```

#### Using `adjacent_tiles` for Detailed Context:
```python
def _compute_heuristic_scores(node_id):
    # Access adjacent tiles directly for the node
    adjacent_tiles = game.state.board.map.adjacent_tiles[node_id]
    
    # Example: Evaluate based on resources and probabilities
    score = 0
    for tile in adjacent_tiles:
        if tile.resource is not None:
            probability = number_probability(tile.number)
            score += RESOURCE_WEIGHTS[tile.resource] * probability
    return score
```

- **Key Function**: `number_probability(tile.number)` computes the probability of rolling the tile's dice number. 

---

### **4. Other Methods for Alternative Contexts**
Additional utilities that may assist in resource evaluation include:
- **From `CatanMap`**:
  - `land_tiles`: Dictionary of all land tiles by coordinate.
  - `port_nodes`: Mapping of ports to associated nodes.
- **From `State`**:
  - `state.board.buildings`: Dictionary of buildings (e.g., settlements, cities) associated with node IDs.
  - `state.resource_freqdeck`: Provides information on bank resources.

---

### References:
1. **`catanatron_core/catanatron/models/map.py`**: Contains definitions for `CatanMap`, `LandTile`, and methods like `init_adjacent_tiles`, `init_node_production`.
   - Key attributes: `adjacent_tiles`, `node_production`, `land_tiles`.
2. **`catanatron_core/catanatron/state.py`**: Includes the `State` class and access to properties like `board`.
3. **`catanatron_core/catanatron/game.py`**: Facilitates interaction with the `Game` and `State` contexts.

END RESEARCH.================================== Ai Message ==================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Leverage `CatanMap` utilities like `adjacent_tiles` and `node_production` to accurately compute node-specific resource bonuses for heuristic scoring. Stabilize FooPlayer to run without errors and refine its strategic behaviors.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Replace the invalid `state.board.adjacent_tiles` reference in `_compute_heuristic_scores` with a valid call to `game.state.board.map.adjacent_tiles` or leverage `node_production` for simplified resource-based scoring. Prioritize stability and alignment with Catanatron's API.

CHOSEN AGENT: CODER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:
Refactor `foo_player.py` to resolve the `AttributeError` and improve heuristic scoring:

1. **Correct Context Access**:
   - Replace the invalid `state.board.adjacent_tiles[action.value]` with valid methods:
     - Use `game.state.board.map.adjacent_tiles[action.value]` to retrieve adjacent tiles for the node (correcting the error).
     - Alternatively, use `game.state.board.map.node_production[action.value]` for precomputed resource probabilities at a node.

2. **Update Node-Specific Scoring Logic**:
   - If using `adjacent_tiles`, query each tile’s `resource` and `number` attributes and compute bonuses based on `number_probability(tile.number)`. Example:
     ```python
     adjacent_tiles = game.state.board.map.adjacent_tiles[action.value]
     resource_bonus = sum(number_probability(tile.number) for tile in adjacent_tiles if tile.resource is not None)
     ```
   - If using `node_production`, calculate a cumulative production score:
     ```python
     resource_production = game.state.board.map.node_production[action.value]
     resource_bonus = sum(resource_production[resource] * RESOURCE_WEIGHTS[resource] for resource in resource_production)
     ```

3. **Testing and Debugging Enhancements**:
   - Add debug print statements to verify retrieved tile data and computed scores.
   - Ensure heuristic-driven behaviors align with expected strategic priorities (e.g., roads, settlements, VP growth).

After implementing these changes, test FooPlayer for stability and validate heuristic-driven decision-making during game simulations.================================ Human Message =================================

The file `foo_player.py` has been successfully updated with the following adjustments:

### Changes Made:
1. **Replaced Invalid Reference to `adjacent_tiles`**:
   - Updated tile context retrieval in `_compute_heuristic_scores`:
     - Replaced the erroneous `state.board.adjacent_tiles` reference with `game.state.board.map.adjacent_tiles[node_id]`.

2. **Heuristic Scoring Enhancements**:
   - Corrected settlement scoring to calculate bonuses using probabilities of adjacent tiles (`number_probability(tile.number)`).
   - Dynamically computed resource bonuses for settlements based on adjacent tiles' resource values.

3. **Debugging Improvements**:
   - Retained existing debug statements to observe how heuristic scores were computed and fallback decisions were made.

### Testing Recommendations:
- **Functional Testing**:
  - Run the updated `FooPlayer.py` against opponents to confirm there are no runtime errors.
  - Validate that heuristic scores accurately calculate settlement and road bonuses based on adjacent tile contexts.
- **Performance Validation**:
  - Observe gameplay for early-game expansion (settlements, roads) and resource optimization.
  - Measure if dynamic fallback mechanisms align with expected strategic goals.

TypeError: list indices must be integers or slices, not str================================ Human Message =================================

After Running The New foo_player.py Player, Here is my analysis and findings:

### Syntax Error Details:
- **Error Message**: `TypeError: list indices must be integers or slices, not str`
- **Exact Line Number**: Line 105 in `foo_player.py`
- **Exact Line of Code**: `if player_resources['brick'] >= 3 and player_resources['wood'] >= 3:`

### Root Cause:
The `player_resources` object retrieved using `get_player_freqdeck` is a list, but the code treats it as a dictionary with string keys (e.g., `'brick'`, `'wood'`). This mismatch causes a `TypeError`.

### Impact:
The syntax error prevents the game from running, resulting in no recorded game results or player performance data for this evolution.

### Suggested Resolution:
Convert `player_resources` to a dictionary format, or properly access elements using integer indices if it is indeed a list.

Let me know if you need anything else!================================== Ai Message ==================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Ensure accurate resource handling by correctly accessing the `player_resources` object in the game framework, eliminating all resource-related syntax errors. Stabilize FooPlayer to enable functional testing and iterative evaluation of strategies.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Resolve the `TypeError` in the `_compute_heuristic_scores` function by identifying the correct format for `player_resources` and updating resource access logic accordingly (either dictionary keys or list indices).

CHOSEN AGENT: RESEARCHER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:  
Investigate the structure and format of the `player_resources` object as retrieved by the `get_player_freqdeck` function or similar mechanisms. Specifically:
1. Determine whether `player_resources` is a list, dictionary, or another format.
2. Identify valid methods or attributes to access specific resource quantities (e.g., brick, wood, etc.).
3. Provide examples or pseudocode for correctly accessing resource quantities and updating the faulty code section in `_compute_heuristic_scores`.

Ensure clarity and comprehensiveness in the findings to address the issue efficiently.================================ Human Message =================================

RESEARCH:

### Structure and Format of `player_resources` Object
The `player_resources` object, as retrieved by the `get_player_freqdeck()` function in the `state_functions.py` file, is formatted as a **list**. Each entry represents the count of a specific resource type for the player. The order of resources in the list is consistent and predefined:
1. **Wood**
2. **Brick**
3. **Sheep**
4. **Wheat**
5. **Ore**

#### Example Usage:
```python
resources = get_player_freqdeck(state, Color.BLUE)

# Access specific resources
wood_count = resources[0]
brick_count = resources[1]
sheep_count = resources[2]
wheat_count = resources[3]
ore_count = resources[4]
```

---

### Valid Methods for Resource Access
Functions related to resource interactions (defined in `state_functions.py`):
1. **`get_player_freqdeck(state, color)`**: Returns a list with counts of the player's resources in the order `(WOOD, BRICK, SHEEP, WHEAT, ORE)`.
   
2. **`player_num_resource_cards(state, color, card=None)`**:
   - Retrieves the number of total resource cards if no `card` is specified.
   - If a specific resource (`card`) is provided (e.g., `WOOD`), it returns the count of that resource.
   ```python
   total_resources = player_num_resource_cards(state, Color.BLUE)
   wood_count = player_num_resource_cards(state, Color.BLUE, WOOD)
   ```

3. **`player_freqdeck_add(state, color, freqdeck)`**: Adds specified resources to the player's inventory.
   ```python
   freq_addition = [1, 2, 0, 0, 3]  # Adds 1 Wood, 2 Bricks, and 3 Ore
   player_freqdeck_add(state, Color.BLUE, freq_addition)
   ```

4. **`player_freqdeck_subtract(state, color, freqdeck)`**: Subtracts specified resources from the player's inventory.
   ```python
   freq_subtraction = [1, 0, 0, 1, 0]  # Removes 1 Wood and 1 Wheat
   player_freqdeck_subtract(state, Color.BLUE, freq_subtraction)
   ```

---

### Correcting `_compute_heuristic_scores`
#### Faulty Code Section:
Replace erroneous references to resource lookup mechanisms that assume dictionary-like or incorrect formats. The valid approach is indexing into the list returned by `get_player_freqdeck`.

#### Example Refactored Code:
```python
def _compute_heuristic_scores(state, color):
    # Retrieve player frequency deck (resources in hand)
    player_resources = get_player_freqdeck(state, color)

    # Example heuristic: prioritize wheat and ore for city-building
    wheat = player_resources[3]
    ore = player_resources[4]

    # Compute heuristic score based on resource availability
    score = wheat * 1.5 + ore * 2.0  # Weight Wheat: 1.5, Ore: 2.0
    return score
```

END RESEARCH.================================== Ai Message ==================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Ensure accurate resource management in `FooPlayer` by correctly using game framework methods to access and evaluate player resources, stabilizing the system for strategic improvement over the next evolutions.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Replace the incorrect dictionary-like reference (`player_resources['brick']`) with valid list-based indexing when accessing resource quantities. Update `_compute_heuristic_scores` to correctly evaluate resources using the resolved `player_resources` format.

CHOSEN AGENT: CODER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:
Refactor `foo_player.py` to fix the `TypeError` in `_compute_heuristic_scores`:

1. **Resource Retrieval**:
   - Replace the existing `player_resources['brick']` and `player_resources['wood']` references with valid list indices:
     - Brick: `player_resources[1]`
     - Wood: `player_resources[0]`

2. **Correct Scoring Logic**:
   - Adjust the conditional checks for resource availability (e.g., brick, wood) and ensure heuristic scores are calculated accurately using these list indices:
     ```python
     if player_resources[1] >= 3 and player_resources[0] >= 3:  # Brick and Wood
         heuristic_scores[action] += 5
     ```

3. **Testing Enhancements**:
   - Add print statements in `_compute_heuristic_scores` to log the retrieved resource counts and verify the heuristic decisions based on resource availability.

Once the refactoring is complete, test FooPlayer to ensure it runs without errors and validates the corrected resource handling logic.================================ Human Message =================================

CODER

### Updates Applied:
1. **Fixed Resource Access Logic**:
   - Corrected resource indexing errors in `_compute_heuristic_scores`:
     - Replaced dictionary-like access with proper list indices for `player_resources` (e.g., `[0]` for wood and `[1]` for brick).
     - Ensured proper referencing for ore and wheat when computing development card scores.

2. **Correct Context Retrieval for Adjacent Tiles**:
   - Replaced incorrect `state.board.adjacent_tiles` with `game.state.board.map.adjacent_tiles[node_id]` for settlement scoring.
   - Verified correct tile-level bonuses using `number_probability(tile.number)`.

3. **Enhanced Heuristic Scoring**:
   - Refined settlement evaluation to dynamically compute resource bonuses based on tile probabilities of adjacent nodes.
   - Adjusted road-building heuristics to prioritize spending surplus brick and wood.

4. **Debug and Stability**:
   - Ensured functional fallback mechanisms for invalid or ambiguous LLM responses.
   - Added robust resource handling with fail-safe mechanisms to avoid runtime errors.

### Notes for Testing:
1. Ensure the game simulation runs without `TypeError` or similar errors.
2. Validate heuristic calculations during settlement and road-building to confirm alignment with strategic priorities.
3. Observe resource-based bottleneck handling and fallback mechanisms' behavior when LLM responses fail.

After Running The New foo_player.py Player, Here is my analysis and findings:

### Scores of FooPlayer:
- Wins: 0  
- Average Victory Points (VP): 6.0  
- Average Settlements: 0.0  
- Average Cities: 2.0  
- Average Roads: 0.0  
- Average Largest Army: 0.67  
- Average Development VP: 0.67  

### Short Analysis of Game Output:
- **LLM Interaction Success**: LLM consistently generated justifications and proposed actions, such as "TRADE," "BUY_DEVELOPMENT_CARD," and "END_TURN." Responses appeared logical in the context given but often led to suboptimal action in terms of progressing VP efficiently.
- **Interesting Observations**: Maritime trades for resource balancing (e.g., trading ore for wheat) were frequently proposed but failed to substantially impact settlement or city-building opportunities.
- **Performance Deficiency**: Despite coherent justifications, the actual game execution did not lead to strategic advancements. The player failed to build any settlements and only maintained cities, likely limiting resource diversity and overall performance.

### Warnings or Signs of Player Implementation Error:
- **Heuristic Scoring Issue**: Logs suggest heuristic scores are applied, but the scoring system itself appears misaligned with actionable priorities (e.g., settlements as highest priority). High-scored actions like "BUILD_SETTLEMENT" were not executed successfully, indicating a disconnection between scoring and feasibility.
- **Resource Bottleneck**: Repetitive logs highlight insufficient resources for impactful actions, emphasizing a failure in resource management or strategy execution.
- **Low-Impact Choices**: Many turns defaulted to fallback mechanisms or repetitive low-impact actions (e.g., "ROLL" and "END_TURN"), which hindered VP growth and progression.

Let me know if you need anything else!================================== Ai Message ==================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Refine FooPlayer's decision-making to prioritize impactful actions that directly progress toward Victory Points (VP), focusing on settlement building, resource optimization, and strategic expansion. Strengthen alignment between heuristic scoring and actionable priorities over the next five iterations.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Identify and address issues in heuristic scoring and decision prioritization in the next iteration by:
1. Reassessing the weights and functional calculations for settlement and road scoring in `_compute_heuristic_scores`.
2. Improving resource management strategies to resolve bottlenecks and enable impactful actions (e.g., settlements, cities).

CHOSEN AGENT: STRATEGIZER  

AGENT OBJECTIVE:  
Analyze current heuristic strategies implemented in FooPlayer and propose targeted refinements. Specifically:  
1. **Evaluate Existing Strategies**: Are settlements and resource optimization correctly prioritized in the gameplay heuristic scoring system?  
2. **Suggest Strategic Adjustments**: Recommend specific heuristic weight changes or new strategies to focus on building settlements and cities while resolving resource bottlenecks for impactful turns.  
3. **New Strategy Options**: Provide 3 strategy options to test next evolution focusing on VP progression, settlement building optimization, and adaptability during resource deficits.  

Ensure findings are actionable with direct implementations for the next FooPlayer iteration.================================ Human Message =================================

STRATEGY:

### 1. Evaluation of Existing Strategies
The current implementation of heuristic scoring shows a general prioritization of settlements and cities but could benefit from specific refinements:
- **Settlement Prioritization**:
  - Settlements score base value (8), plus bonuses derived from adjacent tile probabilities. This approach aligns well with maximizing resource diversity but lacks differentiation between high-value and mediocre locations (e.g., tiles with low number probabilities).
  - Resource optimization for settlements (e.g., ensuring prerequisite resources are available for building settlements) is missing.
- **City Prioritization**:
  - Cities have a fixed weight (15), correctly reflecting their importance for VP progression. However, there's no contextual adjustment to incentivize cities over settlements when the player already has sufficient settlements to move forward efficiently.
- **Resource Management Strategies**:
  - While surplus brick/wood are partially addressed in road scoring, the handling of ore/wheat surplus for cities or development cards could be improved. The current logic misses opportunities to detect potential bottlenecks due to imbalanced resource accumulation.

---

### 2. Recommended Strategic Adjustments
To better align heuristic scoring and resource management with impactful actions:
#### Settlement Scores:
- **Dynamic Weight Adjustments**:
  - Differentiate settlement scores based on adjacency to high-value tiles (numbers 6, 8) and resource variety. Increase base settlement score from **8 to 10**.
  - Penalize settlement building on locations adjacent to low-value tiles (e.g., number probabilities of 2 or 12). Apply a **-3 penalty**.
  ```python
  resource_bonus = sum(number_probability(tile.number) for tile in adjacent_tiles if tile.resource is not None)
  if sum(number_probability(tile.number) < 4 for tile in adjacent_tiles):
      resource_bonus -= 3  # Penalty for adjacency to low-value tiles
  score = 10 + resource_bonus
  ```

#### City Scores:
- **Stage-Sensitive Adjustments**:
  - Maintain a high fixed priority for cities (score: 15) but add conditions to reflect when cities should be deprioritized:
    - If fewer than 3 settlements exist, reduce priority to **7** to emphasize foundational growth.
    ```python
    if len(settlements) < 3:
        score = 7  # Cities deprioritized until sufficient settlements exist
    ```

#### Road Scores:
- **Expansion Utility**:
  - Increase road score (base: 10) under conditions where settlements can follow immediately:
    ```python
    if action.action_type == ActionType.BUILD_ROAD and adjacent_empty_spot(action.value):
        score += 5  # Boost road priority if it leads toward settlement expansion
    ```
  - Roads bucket excess resources efficiently (brick, wood), and handling this systematically prevents stagnation.

#### Resource Bottleneck Handling:
- **Ore-Wheat Surplus**:
  - Introduce bottleneck detection for ore/wheat surplus. Add incentives for buying development cards or building cities when thresholds are exceeded.
    ```python
    if player_resources[4] >= threshold_ore and player_resources[3] >= threshold_wheat:
        heuristic_scores[ActionType.BUY_DEVELOPMENT_CARD] += 7  # Encourages spending resources effectively
        heuristic_scores[ActionType.BUILD_CITY] += 5
    ```
- **Mixed Surplus Strategy**:
  - Fallback mechanism triggers to spend surplus resources on actions with lower weights if impactful actions cannot be immediately performed.

---

### 3. Strategy Options for Next Evolution
#### Strategy 1: Settlement Optimization
- **Core Heuristic Changes**:
  - Increase settlement base score to **10** and apply resource diversity penalties/bonuses (as indicated above).
  - Adjust road scoring to prioritize connections to high-value settlement spots.
- **Fallback Enhancements**:
  - Ensure settlement-building is prioritized over roads whenever both are possible and resources permit.
  ```python
  priority_order = [ActionType.BUILD_SETTLEMENT, ActionType.BUILD_CITY, ActionType.BUILD_ROAD]
  ```

#### Strategy 2: Bottleneck Resolution Framework
- **Resource Threshold Detection**:
  - Detect resource surplus (e.g., ore/wheat or brick/wood) and enforce actions to resolve bottlenecks systematically. Prioritize city upgrades when ore/wheat surplus is present, roads when brick/wood surplus is detected.
- **Heuristic Refinement**:
  - Introduce bottleneck bonuses:
    ```python
    if player_resources[1] >= 3 and player_resources[0] >= 3:
        heuristic_scores[ActionType.BUILD_ROAD] += 5
    ```
      
#### Strategy 3: VP Progression Focus via Cities
- **Stage-Based Adjustment**:
  - Prioritize cities while maintaining settlement-building logic for foundational growth. Integrate heuristic logic to reduce city scores if fewer than 3 settlements are present.
- **Development Card Backup**:
  - Actively prioritize buying development cards when cities/settlements cannot be built due to resource constraints.
  - Add fallback logic focused on achieving Largest Army or disrupting competitors.

---

### Next Steps:
1. Integrate settlement optimization logic and dynamic resource management to address stagnation.
2. Benchmark the proposed scoring adjustments and strategize actions to test across multiple game iterations.
3. Combine bottleneck resolutions and VP progression focus to ensure gradual, measurable improvements toward impactful gameplay outcomes.

END STRATEGY.================================== Ai Message ==================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Optimize heuristic-driven actions in FooPlayer by implementing refined settlement prioritization, resource bottleneck resolution mechanisms, and VP progression strategies. Test improvements to settlement, city, and road-building actions over the next five iterations.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Implement **Strategy 1: Settlement Optimization** in FooPlayer to improve gameplay by:
1. Diversifying settlement scores based on high/low tile probability and adjacency resource variety.
2. Adjusting road-scoring logic to prioritize building roads that enable potential settlement expansion.
3. Refining the fallback mechanism to prioritize substantive actions (settlements, cities, roads) over low-impact turns.

CHOSEN AGENT: CODER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:
Refactor `foo_player.py` to follow the directives of **Strategy 1: Settlement Optimization**:

1. **Dynamic Settlement Scoring**:
   - Increase settlement base score to 10.
   - Adjust scoring logic for settlements based on tile probability values and penalties for adjacent low-probability tiles. For example:
     ```python
     resource_bonus = sum(number_probability(tile.number) for tile in adjacent_tiles if tile.resource is not None)
     if sum(1 for tile in adjacent_tiles if number_probability(tile.number) < 4) >= 1:
         resource_bonus -= 3  # Penalize low-value locations
     heuristic_scores[action] = 10 + resource_bonus
     ```

2. **Improved Road Scoring**:
   - Increase road score if the road enables immediate or future settlement building. Example:
     ```python
     if action.action_type == ActionType.BUILD_ROAD and adjacent_empty_node(action.value):
         heuristic_scores[action] += 5  # Incentivize road near buildable settlement spots
     ```

3. **Prioritization Order**:
   - Implement fallback logic to prioritize impactful actions in this order:
     - Settlements > Cities > Roads > Development Cards > Trades.
     Add debug logs where fallback is triggered to ensure visibility into the decision-making process.

Once these changes are implemented, run the updated FooPlayer and measure its success across game simulations. Aim to validate settlement optimization and ensure alignment between heuristic scoring, resource availability, and strategic decision-making.================================ Human Message =================================

CODER

### Updates Applied:
1. **Enhanced Settlement Scoring**:
   - Increased base settlement score to 10.
   - Incorporated adjacency bonuses using `number_probability(tile.number)` and penalized low-value locations where probabilities were <4.

2. **Improved Road Scoring**:
   - Modified road scoring to prioritize roads enabling settlement expansion using the `_adjacent_empty_node` helper method.
   - Assigned higher scores (15) for road actions leading to potential settlement spots.

3. **Dynamic City Scoring**:
   - Adjusted city scores to prioritize foundational settlement growth by reducing city priority to 7 if fewer than 3 settlements exist.

4. **Resource Bottleneck Handling**:
   - Improved handling of surplus resources, adding bonuses for road-building when brick/wood are abundant.
   - Encouraged development card purchases during ore/wheat surplus periods.

5. **Adjacency Node Check**:
   - Added `_adjacent_empty_node` helper method to dynamically check for available settlement spots connected to proposed road-building actions.

6. **Fallback Improvements**:
   - Updated fallback mechanism to reflect the new prioritization order: settlements > cities > roads > development cards > low-impact actions.

7. **Debug Enhancements**:
   - Added logs to track decision-making and fallback actions for visibility into player strategy.

### Notes for Testing:
- Validate stability during gameplay to confirm the absence of runtime errors.
- Monitor strategic upgrades (e.g., settlement expansion, city-building prioritization) via logs.
- Evaluate performance improvements over previous iterations, focusing on VP progression and settlement counts.

GAME RESULTS:

LLM Response: Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_SETTLEMENT: 'BUILD_SETTLEMENT'>, value=22)

Justification: Building a settlement at position 22 is an optimal choice as it ranks among the highest heuristic scores (7.333333333333334), indicating strong resource diversity potential or strategic placement. Expanding settlements early aligns with the game's priority of maximizing resource collection and establishing a strong foundation for VP growth. Additionally, building at this position provides better strategic positioning to block opponents' progress and secure valuable intersections for future expansions.

AttributeError: 'CatanMap' object has no attribute 'adjacent_nodes'. Did you mean: 'adjacent_tiles'?================================ Human Message =================================

After Running The New foo_player.py Player, Here is my analysis and findings:

### Syntax Error Details:
- **Error Message**: `AttributeError: 'CatanMap' object has no attribute 'adjacent_nodes'. Did you mean: 'adjacent_tiles'?`
- **Exact Line Number**: Line 134 in `foo_player.py`
- **Exact Line of Code**: `adjacent_nodes = game.state.board.map.adjacent_nodes[edge_id]`

### Root Cause:
The `CatanMap` object does not have an attribute `adjacent_nodes`. The correct attribute appears to be `adjacent_tiles` as suggested in the error message. This occurs in the `_adjacent_empty_node` method, which is used for heuristic scoring to validate potential road connections.

### Impact:
The syntax error prevents the game simulation from running, resulting in no recorded game results or scores for this evolution. Additionally, this issue directly affects heuristic calculations and the decision-making process.

Let me know if you need anything else!================================== Ai Message ==================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Correct the handling of road adjacency logic in the `_adjacent_empty_node` method by replacing the invalid `adjacent_nodes` reference with a functional alternative. Restore FooPlayer's functionality and ensure accurate decision-making in road-building heuristics over the next iterations.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Investigate the proper mechanism or data structure in `CatanMap` for determining adjacent nodes to a specific edge (or road) and refactor `_adjacent_empty_node` to utilize this correctly.

CHOSEN AGENT: RESEARCHER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:  
Investigate and validate the correct way to determine adjacent nodes for a given edge (`edge_id`) in the Catanatron framework. Specifically:
1. Identify the correct attribute or method in `CatanMap` or related classes (e.g., `State`, `Game`) to retrieve adjacent node IDs for an edge.
2. Provide pseudocode or usage examples for constructing the `_adjacent_empty_node` function, ensuring functionality and alignment with the game framework.
3. Highlight if further adjustments are needed to accurately compute adjacent nodes for road-building heuristics.

Deliver actionable findings to directly resolve the AttributeError in `_adjacent_empty_node`.================================ Human Message =================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Refactor FooPlayer to work seamlessly with the Catanatron API while continuing to enhance strategic decision-making via heuristic integration and LLM refinement. Achieve compatibility and avoid critical runtime errors in the next evolution to allow for testing and evaluation.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Resolve the `AttributeError` by ensuring that `foo_player.py` uses valid methods from the Catanatron `Game` class for retrieving player resources and other game state data. Validate the compatibility of all API calls in the `_build_prompt` method.

CHOSEN AGENT: RESEARCHER

AGENT OBJECTIVE: 
Identify the correct way to access the following game state information from the Catanatron API:
1. Player resources (e.g., wood, brick, grain, etc.) for a specific color (e.g., `Color.BLUE`).
2. Obtain other player and game statistics that might be relevant for building the LLM prompt (e.g., settlements, cities, roads, VP).
3. Provide a list of valid Game API methods and properties that could be helpful for efficiently querying such state details.

Ensure that the information provided directly addresses the API compatibility issues in `foo_player.py`.================================== Ai Message ==================================

RESEARCH:

#### Key Information on Accessing Game State Using Catanatron API

**1. Accessing Player Resources**
To retrieve resources (e.g., wood, brick, grain, etc.) for a specific player:
- Use the `get_player_freqdeck(state, color)` function, which provides the player's resource frequency deck.
  ```python
  from catanatron.state_functions import get_player_freqdeck
  player_resources = get_player_freqdeck(state, Color.BLUE)
  ```
- `player_num_resource_cards(state, color, resource)` can query the count for specific resources:
  ```python
  from catanatron.state_functions import player_num_resource_cards
  wood_count = player_num_resource_cards(state, Color.BLUE, "WOOD")
  ```

**2. Accessing Player and Game Statistics**
For settlements, cities, roads, and VP:
- **Settlements**: Use `get_player_buildings(state, color, "SETTLEMENT")` to retrieve settlement IDs of a player:
  ```python
  from catanatron.state_functions import get_player_buildings
  settlements = get_player_buildings(state, Color.BLUE, "SETTLEMENT")
  ```
- **Cities**: Similarly invoke `get_player_buildings(state, color, "CITY")` for city IDs:
  ```python
  cities = get_player_buildings(state, Color.BLUE, "CITY")
  ```
- **Roads Available**: Check roads available using state data:
  ```python
  player_key = player_key(state, Color.BLUE)
  roads_available = state.player_state[f"{player_key}_ROADS_AVAILABLE"]
  ```
- **Victory Points**: Victory points can be checked via:
  ```python
  victory_points = state.player_state[f"{player_key}_ACTUAL_VICTORY_POINTS"]
  ```

**3. General Game State Statistics**
The class `Game` contains the main API-level functions for interacting with game state, including:
- `play_tick()` to advance the game state.
- `winning_color()` to retrieve the player currently winning the game.
- `state.playable_actions` to list the valid actions at the current step.

```python
winning_player = game.winning_color()
playable_options = game.state.playable_actions
```

#### List of Useful Methods and Properties in Game API:
Valid methods within the `Game` class and associated functions:
- `get_player_freqdeck(state, color)` – Retrieves player's resources.
- `player_num_resource_cards(state, color, resource)` – Gets the count for specific resources.
- `player_key(state, color)` – Returns string key for player state.
- `get_player_buildings(state, color, building_type)` – Retrieves player's settlements/cities.
- `state.playable_actions` – Provides the currently executable actions.
- `game.play_tick()` – Advances game state one step.
- `game.winning_color()` – Returns the winning color/player.
- `state.colors` – Lists the colors in the game.

**References:**
1. `catanatron_core/catanatron/game.py` - Contains the Game class and `play_tick`, `winning_color`, `state.playable_actions`.

END RESEARCH.================================ Human Message =================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Ensure FooPlayer's compatibility with the Catanatron API by resolving syntax errors and accurately utilizing the `Action` class attributes. Stabilize gameplay to allow evaluation of performance metrics over the next five iterations.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Fix the `AttributeError` by removing invalid references to the nonexistent `location` property in the `Action` class. Correct the scoring logic in `_compute_heuristic_scores` and replace erroneous calls with valid attributes from the `Action` class or game state.

CHOSEN AGENT: RESEARCHER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:  
Investigate the valid attributes and methods available in the `Action` class within the Catanatron API. Specifically:
1. Determine how to access the location or resource value associated with an action (if applicable).
2. Provide documentation or examples on other valid attributes of `Action` that might be relevant for heuristic scoring.
3. If no direct way exists to link `Action` to resource tiles or locations, suggest alternative ways to retrieve this context from the `Game` or `State` class for heuristic calculations.

Ensure the information is precise and actionable to debug and resolve the issue effectively.================================== Ai Message ==================================

RESEARCH:

### Investigation of the `Action` Class and Related Attributes
The `Action` class is part of the core mechanics for handling user actions during the gameplay. Here's the context based on the files:

#### 1. Valid Attributes of the `Action` Class
The `Action` class is defined and utilized in multiple modules. Its attributes are:
- **`color`**: Represents the player's color (e.g., `Color.BLUE`).
- **`action_type`**: Identifies the type of action (e.g., `ActionType.BUILD_SETTLEMENT`, `ActionType.PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD`).
- **`value`**: The specific content of the action based on its type. For example:
  - `Build actions` (`BUILD_SETTLEMENT`, `BUILD_CITY`) use `value` to represent the node location (`node_id`). 
  - `BUILD_ROAD` uses an `edge` object as its `value`.
  - In `MOVE_ROBBER`, `value` is a tuple such as `(coordinate, robbed_color, robbed_resource)`.

Attributes cannot directly reference nonexistent properties, such as `location`.

#### 2. Documentation and Examples of Related Action Types
Key samples of `Action` usage based on the context:
- **Action Initialization**:
  ```python
  Action(color, ActionType.BUILD_SETTLEMENT, node_id)
  Action(color, ActionType.MOVE_ROBBER, (coordinate, enemy_color, resource))
  Action(color, ActionType.ROLL, dice_roll_result)
  ```
- **Examples of Valid `ActionType` Values**:
  - Actions related to resource handling: `ROLL`, `MARITIME_TRADE`, `PLAY_YEAR_OF_PLENTY`, `PLAY_MONOPOLY`.
  - Building-related actions: `BUILD_ROAD`, `BUILD_SETTLEMENT`, `BUILD_CITY`.
  - Development cards and robber actions: `PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD`, `MOVE_ROBBER`.

#### 3. Accessing Location and Resource Context for an `Action`
The `Action` class itself does not store location or resource details unless explicitly set using the `value` attribute.

##### Alternatives for Accessing Context:
- **From the Game State (`State` Class)**:
  - To retrieve the current player's buildings (settlements, roads, etc.) or check surroundings:
    ```python
    buildings = state.buildings_by_color[Color.BLUE]
    settlements = buildings[SETTLEMENT]
    cities = buildings[CITY]
    ```
  - To get adjacent resource tiles for a node:
    ```python
    adjacent_tiles = state.board.map.adjacent_tiles[node_id]
    resources = [tile.resource for tile in adjacent_tiles if tile.resource is not None]
    ```
  - To get the bank's resource availability:
    ```python
    state.resource_freqdeck  # Bank’s current resources
    ```

- **Using `Action.value` for Specific Action Contexts**:
  In specific cases like building or moving, `Action.value` already provides relevant location-like data:
  - For building roads: Retrieve edges with `Action.value`.
  - For building settlements/cities: Use `node_id` from `Action.value`.

#### 4. Valid Methods for Game and State Interactions
Key methods/functions from the `Game` and `State`:
- **`Game` Class**:
  - `play_tick()`: Executes one game tick.
  - `winning_color()`: Returns the player currently winning the game.
  - `execute(action: Action)`: Executes a given action for a player.
  
- **`State` Class**:
  - `state.playable_actions`: Returns a list of actions currently available.
  - `state.board.buildable_node_ids(color)`: Returns node IDs where the player can build.
  - `state.player_state`: Dictionary containing details for each player (e.g., `Color.BLUE_CITIES_AVAILABLE`, `Color.BLUE_HAS_ROLLED`).

---

##### Additional Notes:
If there is a dependency on parsing `location` or `tile` data, it should instead rely on `Action.value` explicitly or query the `State` for adjacent tiles or positions as outlined above.

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Ensure compatibility with the Catanatron API and eliminate syntax errors by properly accessing attributes of the `LandTile` class and adjacent tiles during heuristic scoring. Stabilize gameplay for functional testing and iterative improvements in performance metrics.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Correct the error by replacing the incorrect reference to `tile.value` with valid calls to extract resource-related attributes or other properties from the `LandTile` class. Fully debug and ensure the heuristic scoring function runs smoothly without errors.

CHOSEN AGENT: RESEARCHER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:  
Investigate the `LandTile` class and its valid attributes. Specifically:
1. Identify what attributes or methods the `LandTile` class provides for retrieving resource-type or strategic value data.
2. Provide guidance on how to properly compute bonuses for adjacent tiles when building settlements or roads.
3. Suggest alternative approaches if direct resource value computation from `LandTile` is not viable.  

Ensure the information is actionable and tailored for correcting the heuristic scoring computations.================================== Ai Message ==================================

RESEARCH:

### Investigating Attributes and Methods of the `LandTile` Class
The `LandTile` class and associated structures define the core elements of gameplay tiles in the Catanatron framework. Here's a breakdown of the relevant components:

---

### **1. Valid Attributes of `LandTile`**
The `LandTile` class provides the following attributes:
- **`id`**: A unique identifier for the land tile.
- **`resource`**: The resource type for the tile (e.g., `WOOD`, `BRICK`, `WHEAT`, `SHEEP`, `ORE`, or `None` for desert tiles).
- **`number`**: The number associated with the tile (dice roll probability value). `None` indicates desert tiles.
- **`nodes`**: A dictionary where the keys are `NodeRef` values (relative positions like `NORTH`, `SOUTH`) and the values are `node_id`s.
- **`edges`**: A dictionary mapping `EdgeRef` (edge directions) to edge IDs.

Example usage:
```python
tile_id = land_tile.id
tile_resource = land_tile.resource  # e.g., WOOD
tile_number = land_tile.number  # e.g., 8 for a high-probability tile
tile_nodes = list(land_tile.nodes.values())  # Get the node IDs
tile_edges = list(land_tile.edges.values())  # Get associated edges
```

---

### **2. Calculating Bonuses or Context from Adjacent Tiles**
To compute heuristic bonuses from adjacent tiles when assigning strategic values for settlements or roads:

#### 2.1 Accessing Adjacent Tiles
The `CatanMap` object maintains an auxiliary structure for adjacent tiles:
- **`CatanMap.adjacent_tiles`**: Maps `node_id` to a list of `LandTile` objects surrounding that node.
  ```python
  adjacent_tiles = game.state.board.adjacent_tiles[node_id]
  for tile in adjacent_tiles:
      resource = tile.resource
      probability = tile.number_probability(tile.number)
      print(f"Adjacent tile {tile.id}: Resource={resource}, Probability={probability}")
  ```

#### 2.2 Computing Resource Production
You can estimate the cumulative production at a node based on resource probabilities of adjacent tiles:
- **`CatanMap.node_production`**: Maps `node_id` to a `Counter` of resource probabilities.
  ```python
  resource_production = game.state.board.node_production[node_id]
  # Example format: Counter({WOOD: 0.25, BRICK: 0.12})
  ```

---

### **3. Alternative Approaches if Direct Resource Value is Not Possible**
When direct computation is unavailable, use a combination of these methods:
- **Resource Contributions from Tiles**: Use `CatanMap.adjacent_tiles` and `LandTile.resource` or `LandTile.number`.
  ```python
  adjacent_tiles = game.state.board.adjacent_tiles[node_id]
  resource_values = [tile.resource for tile in adjacent_tiles if tile.resource]
  ```

- **Dice Roll Probability**: Use `number_probability()` on a tile’s `number`.
  ```python
  from catanatron.models.map import number_probability
  dice_probability = number_probability(tile.number)  # Roll chance for the tile
  ```

- **Ports and Trading Context**: If ports matter (e.g., for heuristic value), access via:
  ```python
  ports = game.state.board.port_nodes  # Get port mappings
  ```

---

### **Actionable Guidance for Heuristic Scoring**
To integrate this into the heuristic computation:
1. Replace `tile.value` in `_compute_heuristic_scores` with access to `tile.resource` or `tile.number`.
   ```python
   resource = tile.resource  # WOOD, BRICK, etc.
   probability = number_probability(tile.number)  # Dice probability
   ```
2. For adjacent tile context at `node_id`, query `game.state.board.adjacent_tiles`.
   ```python
   adjacent_tiles = game.state.board.adjacent_tiles[node_id]
   for tile in adjacent_tiles:
       if tile.resource is not None:
           resource_value = tile.resource
           probability = number_probability(tile.number)
   ```

---

CHOSEN AGENT: RESEARCHER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:  
Investigate alternative methods or properties in the `Board` or related classes (`State`, `Game`) to retrieve adjacent tile information. Specifically:
1. Identify where and how adjacent tile data is stored or computed (e.g., through another attribute, helper function, or method).
2. Confirm any valid alternative mechanisms to compute node-specific resource contexts, such as `node_production` or explicit tile indexing.
3. Provide clear examples or pseudocode to adjust the `_compute_heuristic_scores` function with valid logic.

Deliver actionable steps for replacing invalid calls with correct methods or attributes.================================== Ai Message ==================================

RESEARCH:

#### Key Mechanisms for Accessing Adjacent Tile Information
The `CatanMap` and `State` classes provide the primary ways to access data about the board, including adjacent tiles and node-specific contexts. For resolving the issue around the erroneous `state.board.adjacent_tiles` reference, here are the validated methods and alternative approaches:

---

### **1. Accessing Adjacent Tiles**
The `CatanMap` class explicitly maintains data structures for adjacent tiles via its `adjacent_tiles` attribute. 
- The `adjacent_tiles` attribute of `CatanMap` serves as a mapping:  
  **Key**: `node_id`  
  **Value**: `List[LandTile]` (all land tiles adjacent to the given node).  

#### Example:
```python
# Access adjacent tiles for a specific node
adjacent_tiles = game.state.board.map.adjacent_tiles[node_id]
for tile in adjacent_tiles:
    resource = tile.resource  # Resource type (e.g., WOOD)
    number = tile.number      # Probability number for the resource
```

---

### **2. Computing Node-Specific Resource Context**
To compute bonuses for a specific node based on adjacent resources, leverage the `node_production` attribute from `CatanMap`.  
- **`node_production`**: Maps `node_id` to a `Counter` of resource probabilities (combining adjacent tiles).

#### Example:
```python
# Retrieve resource production probabilities for a node
resource_production = game.state.board.map.node_production[node_id]

# Example output: Counter({WOOD: 0.25, BRICK: 0.16, WHEAT: 0.08})
print(resource_production)
```

This can be used to assess the strategic value of a node based on the likelihood of obtaining specific resources.

---

### **3. Suggested Fix for `_compute_heuristic_scores`**
To eliminate the invalid `state.board.adjacent_tiles` reference, you can replace it with calls to either `adjacent_tiles` or `node_production` depending on the calculation context. For heuristic-based evaluations:

#### Using `node_production` for Scoring:
```python
def _compute_heuristic_scores(node_id):
    # Retrieve node-specific production score
    resource_production = game.state.board.map.node_production[node_id]
    
    # Compute heuristic score based on production probabilities
    score = sum(
        resource_production[resource] * weight
        for resource, weight in RESOURCE_WEIGHTS.items()
    )
    return score
```

#### Using `adjacent_tiles` for Detailed Context:
```python
def _compute_heuristic_scores(node_id):
    # Access adjacent tiles directly for the node
    adjacent_tiles = game.state.board.map.adjacent_tiles[node_id]
    
    # Example: Evaluate based on resources and probabilities
    score = 0
    for tile in adjacent_tiles:
        if tile.resource is not None:
            probability = number_probability(tile.number)
            score += RESOURCE_WEIGHTS[tile.resource] * probability
    return score
```

- **Key Function**: `number_probability(tile.number)` computes the probability of rolling the tile's dice number. 

---

### **4. Other Methods for Alternative Contexts**
Additional utilities that may assist in resource evaluation include:
- **From `CatanMap`**:
  - `land_tiles`: Dictionary of all land tiles by coordinate.
  - `port_nodes`: Mapping of ports to associated nodes.
- **From `State`**:
  - `state.board.buildings`: Dictionary of buildings (e.g., settlements, cities) associated with node IDs.
  - `state.resource_freqdeck`: Provides information on bank resources.

CHOSEN AGENT: RESEARCHER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:  
Investigate the structure and format of the `player_resources` object as retrieved by the `get_player_freqdeck` function or similar mechanisms. Specifically:
1. Determine whether `player_resources` is a list, dictionary, or another format.
2. Identify valid methods or attributes to access specific resource quantities (e.g., brick, wood, etc.).
3. Provide examples or pseudocode for correctly accessing resource quantities and updating the faulty code section in `_compute_heuristic_scores`.

Ensure clarity and comprehensiveness in the findings to address the issue efficiently.================================== Ai Message ==================================

RESEARCH:

### Structure and Format of `player_resources` Object
The `player_resources` object, as retrieved by the `get_player_freqdeck()` function in the `state_functions.py` file, is formatted as a **list**. Each entry represents the count of a specific resource type for the player. The order of resources in the list is consistent and predefined:
1. **Wood**
2. **Brick**
3. **Sheep**
4. **Wheat**
5. **Ore**

#### Example Usage:
```python
resources = get_player_freqdeck(state, Color.BLUE)

# Access specific resources
wood_count = resources[0]
brick_count = resources[1]
sheep_count = resources[2]
wheat_count = resources[3]
ore_count = resources[4]
```

---

### Valid Methods for Resource Access
Functions related to resource interactions (defined in `state_functions.py`):
1. **`get_player_freqdeck(state, color)`**: Returns a list with counts of the player's resources in the order `(WOOD, BRICK, SHEEP, WHEAT, ORE)`.
   
2. **`player_num_resource_cards(state, color, card=None)`**:
   - Retrieves the number of total resource cards if no `card` is specified.
   - If a specific resource (`card`) is provided (e.g., `WOOD`), it returns the count of that resource.
   ```python
   total_resources = player_num_resource_cards(state, Color.BLUE)
   wood_count = player_num_resource_cards(state, Color.BLUE, WOOD)
   ```

3. **`player_freqdeck_add(state, color, freqdeck)`**: Adds specified resources to the player's inventory.
   ```python
   freq_addition = [1, 2, 0, 0, 3]  # Adds 1 Wood, 2 Bricks, and 3 Ore
   player_freqdeck_add(state, Color.BLUE, freq_addition)
   ```

4. **`player_freqdeck_subtract(state, color, freqdeck)`**: Subtracts specified resources from the player's inventory.
   ```python
   freq_subtraction = [1, 0, 0, 1, 0]  # Removes 1 Wood and 1 Wheat
   player_freqdeck_subtract(state, Color.BLUE, freq_subtraction)
   ```

---

### Correcting `_compute_heuristic_scores`
#### Faulty Code Section:
Replace erroneous references to resource lookup mechanisms that assume dictionary-like or incorrect formats. The valid approach is indexing into the list returned by `get_player_freqdeck`.

#### Example Refactored Code:
```python
def _compute_heuristic_scores(state, color):
    # Retrieve player frequency deck (resources in hand)
    player_resources = get_player_freqdeck(state, color)

    # Example heuristic: prioritize wheat and ore for city-building
    wheat = player_resources[3]
    ore = player_resources[4]

    # Compute heuristic score based on resource availability
    score = wheat * 1.5 + ore * 2.0  # Weight Wheat: 1.5, Ore: 2.0
    return score
```

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Correct the handling of road adjacency logic in the `_adjacent_empty_node` method by replacing the invalid `adjacent_nodes` reference with a functional alternative. Restore FooPlayer's functionality and ensure accurate decision-making in road-building heuristics over the next iterations.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Investigate the proper mechanism or data structure in `CatanMap` for determining adjacent nodes to a specific edge (or road) and refactor `_adjacent_empty_node` to utilize this correctly.

CHOSEN AGENT: RESEARCHER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:  
Investigate and validate the correct way to determine adjacent nodes for a given edge (`edge_id`) in the Catanatron framework. Specifically:
1. Identify the correct attribute or method in `CatanMap` or related classes (e.g., `State`, `Game`) to retrieve adjacent node IDs for an edge.
2. Provide pseudocode or usage examples for constructing the `_adjacent_empty_node` function, ensuring functionality and alignment with the game framework.
3. Highlight if further adjustments are needed to accurately compute adjacent nodes for road-building heuristics.

Deliver actionable findings to directly resolve the AttributeError in `_adjacent_empty_node`.================================== Ai Message ==================================

        players (List[Player]): DEPRECATED. Reference to list of players.
            Use .colors instead, and move this reference to the Game class.
            Deprecated because we want this class to only contain state
            information that can be easily copiable.
        board (Board): Board state. Settlement locations, cities,
            roads, ect... See Board class.
        player_state (Dict[str, Any]): See PLAYER_INITIAL_STATE. It will
            contain one of each key in PLAYER_INITIAL_STATE but prefixed
            with "P<index_of_player>".
            Example: { P0_HAS_ROAD: False, P1_SETTLEMENTS_AVAILABLE: 18, ... }
        color_to_index (Dict[Color, int]): Color to seating location cache
        colors (Tuple[Color]): Represents seating order.
        resource_freqdeck (List[int]): Represents resource cards in the bank.
            Each element is the amount of [WOOD, BRICK, SHEEP, WHEAT, ORE].
        development_listdeck (List[FastDevCard]): Represents development cards in
            the bank. Already shuffled.
        buildings_by_color (Dict[Color, Dict[FastBuildingType, List]]): Cache of
            buildings. Can be used like: `buildings_by_color[Color.RED][SETTLEMENT]`
            to get a list of all node ids where RED has settlements.
        actions (List[Action]): Log of all actions taken. Fully-specified actions.
        num_turns (int): number of turns thus far
        current_player_index (int): index per colors array of player that should be
            making a decision now. Not necesarilly the same as current_turn_index
            because there are out-of-turn decisions like discarding.
        current_turn_index (int): index per colors array of player whose turn is it.
        current_prompt (ActionPrompt): DEPRECATED. Not needed; use is_initial_build_phase,
            is_moving_knight, etc... instead.
        is_discarding (bool): If current player needs to discard.
        is_moving_knight (bool): If current player needs to move robber.
        is_road_building (bool): If current player needs to build free roads per Road
            Building dev card.
        free_roads_available (int): Number of roads available left in Road Building

### Addressing the Road Adjacency Logic in `_adjacent_empty_node`

#### **1. Valid Mechanism for Determining Adjacent Nodes to an Edge**
The `Board` and `CatanMap` classes provide data structures and methods for locating adjacent nodes to edges. Specifically:
- **`STATIC_GRAPH`** in `Board`: A `networkx.Graph` object representing all nodes and edges on the map. This graph supports queries to find neighbors of any node or edge.
- **`STATIC_GRAPH.neighbors(node_id)`**: Returns a generator of immediate neighbors for a specific `node_id`.
  ```python
  neighbors = STATIC_GRAPH.neighbors(node_id)
  ```

#### **2. Querying Adjacent Nodes for Road Placement**
For adjacent nodes along edges, you can:
1. Find the connected endpoints of an edge using the stored graph.
2. Invert the edge if necessary (`edge_id = tuple(sorted([node_a, node_b]))`) to account for directional representation.

#### Example for Retrieving Adjacent Empty Nodes:
- Query neighbors that are unoccupied (not yet built upon):
  ```python
  def _adjacent_empty_node(edge_id, board):
      adjacent_nodes = []
      for node in edge_id:  # Iterate over both nodes of the edge
          neighbors = STATIC_GRAPH.neighbors(node)
          # Filter empty nodes (no buildings)
          empty_neighbors = [
              neighbor for neighbor in neighbors 
              if neighbor not in board.buildings
          ]
          adjacent_nodes.extend(empty_neighbors)
      return adjacent_nodes
  ```

---

#### **3. Incorporating the Adjacency Logic in `_adjacent_empty_node`**
To correct the `_adjacent_empty_node` logic in `FooPlayer`, use the validated code structure:
- Reference the `Board.buildings` dictionary to check if a node is occupied (whether there’s a building present).
- Use `STATIC_GRAPH.neighbors(node_id)` to identify adjacent nodes.

#### Refactored Code:
```python
def _adjacent_empty_node(edge_id, board):
    """
    Finds empty nodes adjacent to the given edge.
    
    Args:
        edge_id (Tuple[int, int]): The edge defined by two node IDs.
        board (Board): Current game board state.
        
    Returns:
        List[int]: Node IDs of all adjacent empty nodes.
    """
    adjacent_nodes = []
    for node in edge_id:  # For both nodes of the edge
        neighbors = STATIC_GRAPH.neighbors(node)  # Get connected nodes
        # Check if the neighbor node is empty (no building present)
        empty_neighbors = [
            neighbor for neighbor in neighbors 
            if neighbor not in board.buildings
        ]
        adjacent_nodes.extend(empty_neighbors)  # Add empty nodes to result
    return adjacent_nodes
```

---

#### **4. Alternative Approaches**
If `STATIC_GRAPH` is unavailable, you can reconstruct adjacency logic using board's `map` attributes:
1. Retrieve `node_id` pairs directly from `CatanMap` edge-to-node mapping:
   ```python
   def _adjacent_empty_node(edge_id, board):
       node_a, node_b = edge_id
       empty_nodes = []
       for node in (node_a, node_b):
           adjacent_nodes = [
               n for n in board.map.land_nodes
               if n != node and n not in board.buildings
           ]
           empty_nodes.extend(adjacent_nodes)
       return empty_nodes
   ```
2. This method is slower but works without `networkx` dependencies.

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Ensure accurate context retrieval from the game framework by replacing invalid references to nonexistent `adjacent_tiles` attributes and identifying the correct methods or mechanisms for accessing adjacent tile information. Stabilize the game for functional testing and iterative improvements.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Replace the erroneous reference to `state.board.adjacent_tiles` with a valid alternative to retrieve adjacent tile information or resource contexts from the game framework. Verify functionality and eliminate all remaining syntax issues.

CHOSEN AGENT: RESEARCHER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:  
Investigate alternative methods or properties in the `Board` or related classes (`State`, `Game`) to retrieve adjacent tile information. Specifically:
1. Identify where and how adjacent tile data is stored or computed (e.g., through another attribute, helper function, or method).
2. Confirm any valid alternative mechanisms to compute node-specific resource contexts, such as `node_production` or explicit tile indexing.
3. Provide clear examples or pseudocode to adjust the `_compute_heuristic_scores` function with valid logic.

Deliver actionable steps for replacing invalid calls with correct methods or attributes.================================ Human Message =================================

RESEARCH:

#### Key Mechanisms for Accessing Adjacent Tile Information
The `CatanMap` and `State` classes provide the primary ways to access data about the board, including adjacent tiles and node-specific contexts. For resolving the issue around the erroneous `state.board.adjacent_tiles` reference, here are the validated methods and alternative approaches:

---

### **1. Accessing Adjacent Tiles**
The `CatanMap` class explicitly maintains data structures for adjacent tiles via its `adjacent_tiles` attribute. 
- The `adjacent_tiles` attribute of `CatanMap` serves as a mapping:  
  **Key**: `node_id`  
  **Value**: `List[LandTile]` (all land tiles adjacent to the given node).  

#### Example:
```python
# Access adjacent tiles for a specific node
adjacent_tiles = game.state.board.map.adjacent_tiles[node_id]
for tile in adjacent_tiles:
    resource = tile.resource  # Resource type (e.g., WOOD)
    number = tile.number      # Probability number for the resource
```

---

### **2. Computing Node-Specific Resource Context**
To compute bonuses for a specific node based on adjacent resources, leverage the `node_production` attribute from `CatanMap`.  
- **`node_production`**: Maps `node_id` to a `Counter` of resource probabilities (combining adjacent tiles).

#### Example:
```python
# Retrieve resource production probabilities for a node
resource_production = game.state.board.map.node_production[node_id]

# Example output: Counter({WOOD: 0.25, BRICK: 0.16, WHEAT: 0.08})
print(resource_production)
```

This can be used to assess the strategic value of a node based on the likelihood of obtaining specific resources.

---

### **3. Suggested Fix for `_compute_heuristic_scores`**
To eliminate the invalid `state.board.adjacent_tiles` reference, you can replace it with calls to either `adjacent_tiles` or `node_production` depending on the calculation context. For heuristic-based evaluations:

#### Using `node_production` for Scoring:
```python
def _compute_heuristic_scores(node_id):
    # Retrieve node-specific production score
    resource_production = game.state.board.map.node_production[node_id]
    
    # Compute heuristic score based on production probabilities
    score = sum(
        resource_production[resource] * weight
        for resource, weight in RESOURCE_WEIGHTS.items()
    )
    return score
```

#### Using `adjacent_tiles` for Detailed Context:
```python
def _compute_heuristic_scores(node_id):
    # Access adjacent tiles directly for the node
    adjacent_tiles = game.state.board.map.adjacent_tiles[node_id]
    
    # Example: Evaluate based on resources and probabilities
    score = 0
    for tile in adjacent_tiles:
        if tile.resource is not None:
            probability = number_probability(tile.number)
            score += RESOURCE_WEIGHTS[tile.resource] * probability
    return score
```

- **Key Function**: `number_probability(tile.number)` computes the probability of rolling the tile's dice number. 

---

### **4. Other Methods for Alternative Contexts**
Additional utilities that may assist in resource evaluation include:
- **From `CatanMap`**:
  - `land_tiles`: Dictionary of all land tiles by coordinate.
  - `port_nodes`: Mapping of ports to associated nodes.
- **From `State`**:
  - `state.board.buildings`: Dictionary of buildings (e.g., settlements, cities) associated with node IDs.
  - `state.resource_freqdeck`: Provides information on bank resources.

---

### References:
1. **`catanatron_core/catanatron/models/map.py`**: Contains definitions for `CatanMap`, `LandTile`, and methods like `init_adjacent_tiles`, `init_node_production`.
   - Key attributes: `adjacent_tiles`, `node_production`, `land_tiles`.
2. **`catanatron_core/catanatron/state.py`**: Includes the `State` class and access to properties like `board`.
3. **`catanatron_core/catanatron/game.py`**: Facilitates interaction with the `Game` and `State` contexts.

END RESEARCH.================================== Ai Message ==================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Leverage `CatanMap` utilities like `adjacent_tiles` and `node_production` to accurately compute node-specific resource bonuses for heuristic scoring. Stabilize FooPlayer to run without errors and refine its strategic behaviors.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Replace the invalid `state.board.adjacent_tiles` reference in `_compute_heuristic_scores` with a valid call to `game.state.board.map.adjacent_tiles` or leverage `node_production` for simplified resource-based scoring. Prioritize stability and alignment with Catanatron's API.

CHOSEN AGENT: CODER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:
Refactor `foo_player.py` to resolve the `AttributeError` and improve heuristic scoring:

1. **Correct Context Access**:
   - Replace the invalid `state.board.adjacent_tiles[action.value]` with valid methods:
     - Use `game.state.board.map.adjacent_tiles[action.value]` to retrieve adjacent tiles for the node (correcting the error).
     - Alternatively, use `game.state.board.map.node_production[action.value]` for precomputed resource probabilities at a node.

2. **Update Node-Specific Scoring Logic**:
   - If using `adjacent_tiles`, query each tile’s `resource` and `number` attributes and compute bonuses based on `number_probability(tile.number)`. Example:
     ```python
     adjacent_tiles = game.state.board.map.adjacent_tiles[action.value]
     resource_bonus = sum(number_probability(tile.number) for tile in adjacent_tiles if tile.resource is not None)
     ```
   - If using `node_production`, calculate a cumulative production score:
     ```python
     resource_production = game.state.board.map.node_production[action.value]
     resource_bonus = sum(resource_production[resource] * RESOURCE_WEIGHTS[resource] for resource in resource_production)
     ```

3. **Testing and Debugging Enhancements**:
   - Add debug print statements to verify retrieved tile data and computed scores.
   - Ensure heuristic-driven behaviors align with expected strategic priorities (e.g., roads, settlements, VP growth).

After implementing these changes, test FooPlayer for stability and validate heuristic-driven decision-making during game simulations.================================ Human Message =================================

The file `foo_player.py` has been successfully updated with the following adjustments:

### Changes Made:
1. **Replaced Invalid Reference to `adjacent_tiles`**:
   - Updated tile context retrieval in `_compute_heuristic_scores`:
     - Replaced the erroneous `state.board.adjacent_tiles` reference with `game.state.board.map.adjacent_tiles[node_id]`.

2. **Heuristic Scoring Enhancements**:
   - Corrected settlement scoring to calculate bonuses using probabilities of adjacent tiles (`number_probability(tile.number)`).
   - Dynamically computed resource bonuses for settlements based on adjacent tiles' resource values.

3. **Debugging Improvements**:
   - Retained existing debug statements to observe how heuristic scores were computed and fallback decisions were made.

### Testing Recommendations:
- **Functional Testing**:
  - Run the updated `FooPlayer.py` against opponents to confirm there are no runtime errors.
  - Validate that heuristic scores accurately calculate settlement and road bonuses based on adjacent tile contexts.
- **Performance Validation**:
  - Observe gameplay for early-game expansion (settlements, roads) and resource optimization.
  - Measure if dynamic fallback mechanisms align with expected strategic goals.

TypeError: list indices must be integers or slices, not str================================ Human Message =================================

After Running The New foo_player.py Player, Here is my analysis and findings:

### Syntax Error Details:
- **Error Message**: `TypeError: list indices must be integers or slices, not str`
- **Exact Line Number**: Line 105 in `foo_player.py`
- **Exact Line of Code**: `if player_resources['brick'] >= 3 and player_resources['wood'] >= 3:`

### Root Cause:
The `player_resources` object retrieved using `get_player_freqdeck` is a list, but the code treats it as a dictionary with string keys (e.g., `'brick'`, `'wood'`). This mismatch causes a `TypeError`.

### Impact:
The syntax error prevents the game from running, resulting in no recorded game results or player performance data for this evolution.

### Suggested Resolution:
Convert `player_resources` to a dictionary format, or properly access elements using integer indices if it is indeed a list.

Let me know if you need anything else!================================== Ai Message ==================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Ensure accurate resource handling by correctly accessing the `player_resources` object in the game framework, eliminating all resource-related syntax errors. Stabilize FooPlayer to enable functional testing and iterative evaluation of strategies.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Resolve the `TypeError` in the `_compute_heuristic_scores` function by identifying the correct format for `player_resources` and updating resource access logic accordingly (either dictionary keys or list indices).

CHOSEN AGENT: RESEARCHER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:  
Investigate the structure and format of the `player_resources` object as retrieved by the `get_player_freqdeck` function or similar mechanisms. Specifically:
1. Determine whether `player_resources` is a list, dictionary, or another format.
2. Identify valid methods or attributes to access specific resource quantities (e.g., brick, wood, etc.).
3. Provide examples or pseudocode for correctly accessing resource quantities and updating the faulty code section in `_compute_heuristic_scores`.

Ensure clarity and comprehensiveness in the findings to address the issue efficiently.================================ Human Message =================================

RESEARCH:

### Structure and Format of `player_resources` Object
The `player_resources` object, as retrieved by the `get_player_freqdeck()` function in the `state_functions.py` file, is formatted as a **list**. Each entry represents the count of a specific resource type for the player. The order of resources in the list is consistent and predefined:
1. **Wood**
2. **Brick**
3. **Sheep**
4. **Wheat**
5. **Ore**

#### Example Usage:
```python
resources = get_player_freqdeck(state, Color.BLUE)

# Access specific resources
wood_count = resources[0]
brick_count = resources[1]
sheep_count = resources[2]
wheat_count = resources[3]
ore_count = resources[4]
```

---

### Valid Methods for Resource Access
Functions related to resource interactions (defined in `state_functions.py`):
1. **`get_player_freqdeck(state, color)`**: Returns a list with counts of the player's resources in the order `(WOOD, BRICK, SHEEP, WHEAT, ORE)`.
   
2. **`player_num_resource_cards(state, color, card=None)`**:
   - Retrieves the number of total resource cards if no `card` is specified.
   - If a specific resource (`card`) is provided (e.g., `WOOD`), it returns the count of that resource.
   ```python
   total_resources = player_num_resource_cards(state, Color.BLUE)
   wood_count = player_num_resource_cards(state, Color.BLUE, WOOD)
   ```

3. **`player_freqdeck_add(state, color, freqdeck)`**: Adds specified resources to the player's inventory.
   ```python
   freq_addition = [1, 2, 0, 0, 3]  # Adds 1 Wood, 2 Bricks, and 3 Ore
   player_freqdeck_add(state, Color.BLUE, freq_addition)
   ```

4. **`player_freqdeck_subtract(state, color, freqdeck)`**: Subtracts specified resources from the player's inventory.
   ```python
   freq_subtraction = [1, 0, 0, 1, 0]  # Removes 1 Wood and 1 Wheat
   player_freqdeck_subtract(state, Color.BLUE, freq_subtraction)
   ```

### Correcting `_compute_heuristic_scores`
#### Faulty Code Section:
Replace erroneous references to resource lookup mechanisms that assume dictionary-like or incorrect formats. The valid approach is indexing into the list returned by `get_player_freqdeck`.

#### Example Refactored Code:
```python
def _compute_heuristic_scores(state, color):
    # Retrieve player frequency deck (resources in hand)
    player_resources = get_player_freqdeck(state, color)

    # Example heuristic: prioritize wheat and ore for city-building
    wheat = player_resources[3]
    ore = player_resources[4]

    # Compute heuristic score based on resource availability
    score = wheat * 1.5 + ore * 2.0  # Weight Wheat: 1.5, Ore: 2.0
    return score
```

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Ensure accurate resource management in `FooPlayer` by correctly using game framework methods to access and evaluate player resources, stabilizing the system for strategic improvement over the next evolutions.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Replace the incorrect dictionary-like reference (`player_resources['brick']`) with valid list-based indexing when accessing resource quantities. Update `_compute_heuristic_scores` to correctly evaluate resources using the resolved `player_resources` format.

CHOSEN AGENT: CODER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:
Refactor `foo_player.py` to fix the `TypeError` in `_compute_heuristic_scores`:

1. **Resource Retrieval**:
   - Replace the existing `player_resources['brick']` and `player_resources['wood']` references with valid list indices:
     - Brick: `player_resources[1]`
     - Wood: `player_resources[0]`

2. **Correct Scoring Logic**:
   - Adjust the conditional checks for resource availability (e.g., brick, wood) and ensure heuristic scores are calculated accurately using these list indices:
     ```python
     if player_resources[1] >= 3 and player_resources[0] >= 3:  # Brick and Wood
         heuristic_scores[action] += 5
     ```

3. **Testing Enhancements**:
   - Add print statements in `_compute_heuristic_scores` to log the retrieved resource counts and verify the heuristic decisions based on resource availability.

Once the refactoring is complete, test FooPlayer to ensure it runs without errors and validates the corrected resource handling logic.================================ Human Message =================================

CODER

### Updates Applied:
1. **Fixed Resource Access Logic**:
   - Corrected resource indexing errors in `_compute_heuristic_scores`:
     - Replaced dictionary-like access with proper list indices for `player_resources` (e.g., `[0]` for wood and `[1]` for brick).
     - Ensured proper referencing for ore and wheat when computing development card scores.

2. **Correct Context Retrieval for Adjacent Tiles**:
   - Replaced incorrect `state.board.adjacent_tiles` with `game.state.board.map.adjacent_tiles[node_id]` for settlement scoring.
   - Verified correct tile-level bonuses using `number_probability(tile.number)`.

3. **Enhanced Heuristic Scoring**:
   - Refined settlement evaluation to dynamically compute resource bonuses based on tile probabilities of adjacent nodes.
   - Adjusted road-building heuristics to prioritize spending surplus brick and wood.

4. **Debug and Stability**:
   - Ensured functional fallback mechanisms for invalid or ambiguous LLM responses.
   - Added robust resource handling with fail-safe mechanisms to avoid runtime errors.

### Notes for Testing:
1. Ensure the game simulation runs without `TypeError` or similar errors.
2. Validate heuristic calculations during settlement and road-building to confirm alignment with strategic priorities.
3. Observe resource-based bottleneck handling and fallback mechanisms' behavior when LLM responses fail.

After Running The New foo_player.py Player, Here is my analysis and findings:

### Scores of FooPlayer:
- Wins: 0  
- Average Victory Points (VP): 6.0  
- Average Settlements: 0.0  
- Average Cities: 2.0  
- Average Roads: 0.0  
- Average Largest Army: 0.67  
- Average Development VP: 0.67  

### Short Analysis of Game Output:
- **LLM Interaction Success**: LLM consistently generated justifications and proposed actions, such as "TRADE," "BUY_DEVELOPMENT_CARD," and "END_TURN." Responses appeared logical in the context given but often led to suboptimal action in terms of progressing VP efficiently.
- **Interesting Observations**: Maritime trades for resource balancing (e.g., trading ore for wheat) were frequently proposed but failed to substantially impact settlement or city-building opportunities.
- **Performance Deficiency**: Despite coherent justifications, the actual game execution did not lead to strategic advancements. The player failed to build any settlements and only maintained cities, likely limiting resource diversity and overall performance.

### Warnings or Signs of Player Implementation Error:
- **Heuristic Scoring Issue**: Logs suggest heuristic scores are applied, but the scoring system itself appears misaligned with actionable priorities (e.g., settlements as highest priority). High-scored actions like "BUILD_SETTLEMENT" were not executed successfully, indicating a disconnection between scoring and feasibility.
- **Resource Bottleneck**: Repetitive logs highlight insufficient resources for impactful actions, emphasizing a failure in resource management or strategy execution.
- **Low-Impact Choices**: Many turns defaulted to fallback mechanisms or repetitive low-impact actions (e.g., "ROLL" and "END_TURN"), which hindered VP growth and progression.

Let me know if you need anything else!================================== Ai Message ==================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Refine FooPlayer's decision-making to prioritize impactful actions that directly progress toward Victory Points (VP), focusing on settlement building, resource optimization, and strategic expansion. Strengthen alignment between heuristic scoring and actionable priorities over the next five iterations.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Identify and address issues in heuristic scoring and decision prioritization in the next iteration by:
1. Reassessing the weights and functional calculations for settlement and road scoring in `_compute_heuristic_scores`.
2. Improving resource management strategies to resolve bottlenecks and enable impactful actions (e.g., settlements, cities).

CHOSEN AGENT: STRATEGIZER  

AGENT OBJECTIVE:  
Analyze current heuristic strategies implemented in FooPlayer and propose targeted refinements. Specifically:  
1. **Evaluate Existing Strategies**: Are settlements and resource optimization correctly prioritized in the gameplay heuristic scoring system?  
2. **Suggest Strategic Adjustments**: Recommend specific heuristic weight changes or new strategies to focus on building settlements and cities while resolving resource bottlenecks for impactful turns.  
3. **New Strategy Options**: Provide 3 strategy options to test next evolution focusing on VP progression, settlement building optimization, and adaptability during resource deficits.  

Ensure findings are actionable with direct implementations for the next FooPlayer iteration.================================ Human Message =================================

STRATEGY:

### 1. Evaluation of Existing Strategies
The current implementation of heuristic scoring shows a general prioritization of settlements and cities but could benefit from specific refinements:
- **Settlement Prioritization**:
  - Settlements score base value (8), plus bonuses derived from adjacent tile probabilities. This approach aligns well with maximizing resource diversity but lacks differentiation between high-value and mediocre locations (e.g., tiles with low number probabilities).
  - Resource optimization for settlements (e.g., ensuring prerequisite resources are available for building settlements) is missing.
- **City Prioritization**:
  - Cities have a fixed weight (15), correctly reflecting their importance for VP progression. However, there's no contextual adjustment to incentivize cities over settlements when the player already has sufficient settlements to move forward efficiently.
- **Resource Management Strategies**:
  - While surplus brick/wood are partially addressed in road scoring, the handling of ore/wheat surplus for cities or development cards could be improved. The current logic misses opportunities to detect potential bottlenecks due to imbalanced resource accumulation.

---

### 2. Recommended Strategic Adjustments
To better align heuristic scoring and resource management with impactful actions:
#### Settlement Scores:
- **Dynamic Weight Adjustments**:
  - Differentiate settlement scores based on adjacency to high-value tiles (numbers 6, 8) and resource variety. Increase base settlement score from **8 to 10**.
  - Penalize settlement building on locations adjacent to low-value tiles (e.g., number probabilities of 2 or 12). Apply a **-3 penalty**.
  ```python
  resource_bonus = sum(number_probability(tile.number) for tile in adjacent_tiles if tile.resource is not None)
  if sum(number_probability(tile.number) < 4 for tile in adjacent_tiles):
      resource_bonus -= 3  # Penalty for adjacency to low-value tiles
  score = 10 + resource_bonus
  ```

#### City Scores:
- **Stage-Sensitive Adjustments**:
  - Maintain a high fixed priority for cities (score: 15) but add conditions to reflect when cities should be deprioritized:
    - If fewer than 3 settlements exist, reduce priority to **7** to emphasize foundational growth.
    ```python
    if len(settlements) < 3:
        score = 7  # Cities deprioritized until sufficient settlements exist
    ```

#### Road Scores:
- **Expansion Utility**:
  - Increase road score (base: 10) under conditions where settlements can follow immediately:
    ```python
    if action.action_type == ActionType.BUILD_ROAD and adjacent_empty_spot(action.value):
        score += 5  # Boost road priority if it leads toward settlement expansion
    ```
  - Roads bucket excess resources efficiently (brick, wood), and handling this systematically prevents stagnation.

#### Resource Bottleneck Handling:
- **Ore-Wheat Surplus**:
  - Introduce bottleneck detection for ore/wheat surplus. Add incentives for buying development cards or building cities when thresholds are exceeded.
    ```python
    if player_resources[4] >= threshold_ore and player_resources[3] >= threshold_wheat:
        heuristic_scores[ActionType.BUY_DEVELOPMENT_CARD] += 7  # Encourages spending resources effectively
        heuristic_scores[ActionType.BUILD_CITY] += 5
    ```
- **Mixed Surplus Strategy**:
  - Fallback mechanism triggers to spend surplus resources on actions with lower weights if impactful actions cannot be immediately performed.

---

### 3. Strategy Options for Next Evolution
#### Strategy 1: Settlement Optimization
- **Core Heuristic Changes**:
  - Increase settlement base score to **10** and apply resource diversity penalties/bonuses (as indicated above).
  - Adjust road scoring to prioritize connections to high-value settlement spots.
- **Fallback Enhancements**:
  - Ensure settlement-building is prioritized over roads whenever both are possible and resources permit.
  ```python
  priority_order = [ActionType.BUILD_SETTLEMENT, ActionType.BUILD_CITY, ActionType.BUILD_ROAD]
  ```

#### Strategy 2: Bottleneck Resolution Framework
- **Resource Threshold Detection**:
  - Detect resource surplus (e.g., ore/wheat or brick/wood) and enforce actions to resolve bottlenecks systematically. Prioritize city upgrades when ore/wheat surplus is present, roads when brick/wood surplus is detected.
- **Heuristic Refinement**:
  - Introduce bottleneck bonuses:
    ```python
    if player_resources[1] >= 3 and player_resources[0] >= 3:
        heuristic_scores[ActionType.BUILD_ROAD] += 5
    ```
      
#### Strategy 3: VP Progression Focus via Cities
- **Stage-Based Adjustment**:
  - Prioritize cities while maintaining settlement-building logic for foundational growth. Integrate heuristic logic to reduce city scores if fewer than 3 settlements are present.
- **Development Card Backup**:
  - Actively prioritize buying development cards when cities/settlements cannot be built due to resource constraints.
  - Add fallback logic focused on achieving Largest Army or disrupting competitors.

---

### Next Steps:
1. Integrate settlement optimization logic and dynamic resource management to address stagnation.
2. Benchmark the proposed scoring adjustments and strategize actions to test across multiple game iterations.
3. Combine bottleneck resolutions and VP progression focus to ensure gradual, measurable improvements toward impactful gameplay outcomes.

END STRATEGY.================================== Ai Message ==================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Optimize heuristic-driven actions in FooPlayer by implementing refined settlement prioritization, resource bottleneck resolution mechanisms, and VP progression strategies. Test improvements to settlement, city, and road-building actions over the next five iterations.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Implement **Strategy 1: Settlement Optimization** in FooPlayer to improve gameplay by:
1. Diversifying settlement scores based on high/low tile probability and adjacency resource variety.
2. Adjusting road-scoring logic to prioritize building roads that enable potential settlement expansion.
3. Refining the fallback mechanism to prioritize substantive actions (settlements, cities, roads) over low-impact turns.

CHOSEN AGENT: CODER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:
Refactor `foo_player.py` to follow the directives of **Strategy 1: Settlement Optimization**:

1. **Dynamic Settlement Scoring**:
   - Increase settlement base score to 10.
   - Adjust scoring logic for settlements based on tile probability values and penalties for adjacent low-probability tiles. For example:
     ```python
     resource_bonus = sum(number_probability(tile.number) for tile in adjacent_tiles if tile.resource is not None)
     if sum(1 for tile in adjacent_tiles if number_probability(tile.number) < 4) >= 1:
         resource_bonus -= 3  # Penalize low-value locations
     heuristic_scores[action] = 10 + resource_bonus
     ```

2. **Improved Road Scoring**:
   - Increase road score if the road enables immediate or future settlement building. Example:
     ```python
     if action.action_type == ActionType.BUILD_ROAD and adjacent_empty_node(action.value):
         heuristic_scores[action] += 5  # Incentivize road near buildable settlement spots
     ```

3. **Prioritization Order**:
   - Implement fallback logic to prioritize impactful actions in this order:
     - Settlements > Cities > Roads > Development Cards > Trades.
     Add debug logs where fallback is triggered to ensure visibility into the decision-making process.

Once these changes are implemented, run the updated FooPlayer and measure its success across game simulations. Aim to validate settlement optimization and ensure alignment between heuristic scoring, resource availability, and strategic decision-making.================================ Human Message =================================

CODER

### Updates Applied:
1. **Enhanced Settlement Scoring**:
   - Increased base settlement score to 10.
   - Incorporated adjacency bonuses using `number_probability(tile.number)` and penalized low-value locations where probabilities were <4.

2. **Improved Road Scoring**:
   - Modified road scoring to prioritize roads enabling settlement expansion using the `_adjacent_empty_node` helper method.
   - Assigned higher scores (15) for road actions leading to potential settlement spots.

3. **Dynamic City Scoring**:
   - Adjusted city scores to prioritize foundational settlement growth by reducing city priority to 7 if fewer than 3 settlements exist.

4. **Resource Bottleneck Handling**:
   - Improved handling of surplus resources, adding bonuses for road-building when brick/wood are abundant.
   - Encouraged development card purchases during ore/wheat surplus periods.

5. **Adjacency Node Check**:
   - Added `_adjacent_empty_node` helper method to dynamically check for available settlement spots connected to proposed road-building actions.

6. **Fallback Improvements**:
   - Updated fallback mechanism to reflect the new prioritization order: settlements > cities > roads > development cards > low-impact actions.

7. **Debug Enhancements**:
   - Added logs to track decision-making and fallback actions for visibility into player strategy.

### Notes for Testing:
- Validate stability during gameplay to confirm the absence of runtime errors.
- Monitor strategic upgrades (e.g., settlement expansion, city-building prioritization) via logs.
- Evaluate performance improvements over previous iterations, focusing on VP progression and settlement counts.

GAME RESULTS:

LLM Response: Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_SETTLEMENT: 'BUILD_SETTLEMENT'>, value=22)

Justification: Building a settlement at position 22 is an optimal choice as it ranks among the highest heuristic scores (7.333333333333334), indicating strong resource diversity potential or strategic placement. Expanding settlements early aligns with the game's priority of maximizing resource collection and establishing a strong foundation for VP growth. Additionally, building at this position provides better strategic positioning to block opponents' progress and secure valuable intersections for future expansions.

AttributeError: 'CatanMap' object has no attribute 'adjacent_nodes'. Did you mean: 'adjacent_tiles'?================================ Human Message =================================

After Running The New foo_player.py Player, Here is my analysis and findings:

### Syntax Error Details:
- **Error Message**: `AttributeError: 'CatanMap' object has no attribute 'adjacent_nodes'. Did you mean: 'adjacent_tiles'?`
- **Exact Line Number**: Line 134 in `foo_player.py`
- **Exact Line of Code**: `adjacent_nodes = game.state.board.map.adjacent_nodes[edge_id]`

### Root Cause:
The `CatanMap` object does not have an attribute `adjacent_nodes`. The correct attribute appears to be `adjacent_tiles` as suggested in the error message. This occurs in the `_adjacent_empty_node` method, which is used for heuristic scoring to validate potential road connections.

### Impact:
The syntax error prevents the game simulation from running, resulting in no recorded game results or scores for this evolution. Additionally, this issue directly affects heuristic calculations and the decision-making process.

Let me know if you need anything else!================================== Ai Message ==================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Correct the handling of road adjacency logic in the `_adjacent_empty_node` method by replacing the invalid `adjacent_nodes` reference with a functional alternative. Restore FooPlayer's functionality and ensure accurate decision-making in road-building heuristics over the next iterations.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Investigate the proper mechanism or data structure in `CatanMap` for determining adjacent nodes to a specific edge (or road) and refactor `_adjacent_empty_node` to utilize this correctly.

CHOSEN AGENT: RESEARCHER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:  
Investigate and validate the correct way to determine adjacent nodes for a given edge (`edge_id`) in the Catanatron framework. Specifically:
1. Identify the correct attribute or method in `CatanMap` or related classes (e.g., `State`, `Game`) to retrieve adjacent node IDs for an edge.
2. Provide pseudocode or usage examples for constructing the `_adjacent_empty_node` function, ensuring functionality and alignment with the game framework.
3. Highlight if further adjustments are needed to accurately compute adjacent nodes for road-building heuristics.

Deliver actionable findings to directly resolve the AttributeError in `_adjacent_empty_node`.================================ Human Message =================================

RESEARCH:

### Addressing the Road Adjacency Logic in `_adjacent_empty_node`

#### **1. Valid Mechanism for Determining Adjacent Nodes to an Edge**
The `Board` and `CatanMap` classes provide data structures and methods for locating adjacent nodes to edges. Specifically:
- **`STATIC_GRAPH`** in `Board`: A `networkx.Graph` object representing all nodes and edges on the map. This graph supports queries to find neighbors of any node or edge.
- **`STATIC_GRAPH.neighbors(node_id)`**: Returns a generator of immediate neighbors for a specific `node_id`.
  ```python
  neighbors = STATIC_GRAPH.neighbors(node_id)
  ```

#### **2. Querying Adjacent Nodes for Road Placement**
For adjacent nodes along edges, you can:
1. Find the connected endpoints of an edge using the stored graph.
2. Invert the edge if necessary (`edge_id = tuple(sorted([node_a, node_b]))`) to account for directional representation.

#### Example for Retrieving Adjacent Empty Nodes:
- Query neighbors that are unoccupied (not yet built upon):
  ```python
  def _adjacent_empty_node(edge_id, board):
      adjacent_nodes = []
      for node in edge_id:  # Iterate over both nodes of the edge
          neighbors = STATIC_GRAPH.neighbors(node)
          # Filter empty nodes (no buildings)
          empty_neighbors = [
              neighbor for neighbor in neighbors 
              if neighbor not in board.buildings
          ]
          adjacent_nodes.extend(empty_neighbors)
      return adjacent_nodes
  ```

---

#### **3. Incorporating the Adjacency Logic in `_adjacent_empty_node`**
To correct the `_adjacent_empty_node` logic in `FooPlayer`, use the validated code structure:
- Reference the `Board.buildings` dictionary to check if a node is occupied (whether there’s a building present).
- Use `STATIC_GRAPH.neighbors(node_id)` to identify adjacent nodes.

#### Refactored Code:
```python
def _adjacent_empty_node(edge_id, board):
    """
    Finds empty nodes adjacent to the given edge.
    
    Args:
        edge_id (Tuple[int, int]): The edge defined by two node IDs.
        board (Board): Current game board state.
        
    Returns:
        List[int]: Node IDs of all adjacent empty nodes.
    """
    adjacent_nodes = []
    for node in edge_id:  # For both nodes of the edge
        neighbors = STATIC_GRAPH.neighbors(node)  # Get connected nodes
        # Check if the neighbor node is empty (no building present)
        empty_neighbors = [
            neighbor for neighbor in neighbors 
            if neighbor not in board.buildings
        ]
        adjacent_nodes.extend(empty_neighbors)  # Add empty nodes to result
    return adjacent_nodes
```

---

#### **4. Alternative Approaches**
If `STATIC_GRAPH` is unavailable, you can reconstruct adjacency logic using board's `map` attributes:
1. Retrieve `node_id` pairs directly from `CatanMap` edge-to-node mapping:
   ```python
   def _adjacent_empty_node(edge_id, board):
       node_a, node_b = edge_id
       empty_nodes = []

           adjacent_nodes = [
               n for n in board.map.land_nodes

END RESEARCH.================================== Ai Message ==================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Ensure the stability and functionality of FooPlayer by implementing corrected adjacency logic for `_adjacent_empty_node`, enabling accurate road-building heuristics that prioritize settlement expansion.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Refactor `_adjacent_empty_node` in `foo_player.py` to use `STATIC_GRAPH.neighbors` for valid adjacency checks, ensuring empty nodes are correctly identified and utilized in decision-making.

CHOSEN AGENT: CODER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:
Refactor `_adjacent_empty_node` in `foo_player.py` to resolve the `AttributeError` and enable accurate adjacency detection for roads:

1. **Adjacency Logic**:
   - Replace the invalid `adjacent_nodes` reference with the following:
     ```python
     neighbors = STATIC_GRAPH.neighbors(node)
     empty_neighbors = [
         neighbor for neighbor in neighbors
         if neighbor not in board.buildings
     ]
     ```
   - Use the `STATIC_GRAPH` object to resolve adjacent nodes dynamically for road connectivity.

2. **Edge Handling**:
   - Ensure edges are properly indexed, assuming tuple format (e.g., `(node_a, node_b)`).

3. **Test and Debug Enhancements**:
   - Add debug statements to validate retrieved adjacent nodes during runtime, confirming no issues in scoring logic:
     ```python
     print(f"Adjacent empty nodes for edge {edge_id}: {adjacent_nodes}")
     ```

Once implemented, ensure the updated `_adjacent_empty_node` function runs without errors, supports accurate road heuristics, and aligns with prioritized settlement expansion strategies. Validate FooPlayer functionality through game simulations.================================ Human Message =================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Improve the performance of the `FooPlayer.py` by introducing intelligent strategy logic that leverages the LLM for decision-making. Specifically, aim for a minimum win count of 1 within the next 5 iterations while improving VP, settlements, and measurable gameplay metrics.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Address the issue of the `decide` method defaulting to selecting the first action. Integrate the LLM's `query_llm` functionality to intelligently evaluate actions based on state and strategy.

CHOSEN AGENT: CODER

AGENT OBJECTIVE: 
The current implementation of `FooPlayer` is defaulting to selecting the first action, as evidenced by the repeated log message "Choosing First Action on Default." Modify the `decide` method to leverage the `self.llm.query_llm` functionality for decision-making. Specifically:

1. Replace the current first-action default with an implementation that:
   a. Obtains a list of possible actions from the game state.
   b. Queries the LLM (`self.llm.query_llm`) for the evaluation of these actions.
   c. Selects the most intelligent action based on the LLM's evaluation.

2. Ensure the decision logic is robust and includes handling scenarios such as:
   - No valid actions available.
   - LLM providing ambiguous or conflicting guidance (fallback mechanisms).

3. Include clear comments and logging to observe how the LLM is influencing decision-making.

Once done, provide the modified code to be tested.================================== Ai Message ==================================

CODER

### Changes Made:
1. **Replaced Default Action Selection**:
   - Removed the hardcoded `return playable_actions[0]` that selected the first action by default.

2. **Integrated LLM Decision-Making in `decide`**:
   - Constructed a comprehensive prompt using the `_build_prompt` function to provide the LLM with game state and available actions.
   - Queried the LLM using `self.llm.query_llm(prompt)`.
   - Parsed the LLM's response using the `_parse_llm_response` function to select the most appropriate action from the available options.

3. **Added New Helper Methods**:
   - `_build_prompt`: Constructs a prompt by including the current game state and the list of playable actions.
   - `_parse_llm_response`: Interprets the LLM's response to match it with one of the playable actions. If no match is found, defaults to the first action.

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Included error handling for cases where the LLM query fails or returns an ambiguous response. In such cases, the method defaults to selecting the first action.
   - Added logging to show the LLM's response (`print(f"LLM Response: {llm_response}")`) and fallback mechanisms.

5. **Logging and Debugging**:
   - Added print statements for better debugging and observation:
     - Log when no playable actions are available.
     - Log the LLM's raw response.
     - Log if the response is ambiguous or invalid, and the fallback action is selected.

### Notes for the Next Iteration:
- **Prompt Details**: The current `_build_prompt` function makes a basic serialization of the game state and actions. If the LLM struggles to prioritize or understand the game details, refining this prompt may be necessary.
- **LLM Error Responses**: If runtime timing issues with `query_llm` arise (e.g., long delays or failures), adjustment of query limits or timeouts may be needed.

### Testing Recommendations:
- Test how the LLM chooses actions in various scenarios to verify that the parsing logic aligns with actual gameplay.
- Monitor logs (`LLM Response: ...`) for unexpected behaviors or ambiguous responses.

END CODER================================ Human Message =================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Transition FooPlayer into a competitive player over the next 5 iterations by leveraging enhanced strategy, including heuristic reinforcement, refined LLM prompts, and deterministic fallback mechanisms, and targeting measurable improvements in average VP and win rates.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Implement **segmented contextual prompting** and heuristic-enhanced decision-making into the LLM integration (as per Strategy 1 and 4). Additionally, integrate a **ranked action hierarchy** as a fallback mechanism (Strategy 2).

CHOSEN AGENT: CODER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:  
Modify the `decide` method of `FooPlayer.py` to achieve the following:

1. **Refined LLM Prompt**: 
   - Update the `_build_prompt` function to use **segmented contextual prompting**. Include headers that describe the game state, available resources, and strategic goals. Example structure:
     ```
     Current Game State:
     - Player Stats: {resources}, {settlements}, {cities}, VP: {victory_points}
     - Opponent Stats: {opponent resources/blockades}, etc.
     Goal: Maximize VP while taking advantage of the current game state.
     Available Actions: {list of formatted playable actions}
     Respond with:
     Action: {Selected optimal action}
     Justification: {Reasoning behind the action choice}
     ```

2. **Heuristic Context Integration**:
   - In the `_build_prompt` method, compute heuristic scores (e.g., settlement value, city upgrade value, road extension value) for each action. Integrate these scores into the prompt to help the LLM make better decisions.

3. **Fallback Mechanism**:
   - Enhance `_parse_llm_response` to implement a **ranked action hierarchy** fallback mechanism when the LLM output is invalid or ambiguous. Example hierarchy:
     - Priority Order: Build City > Build Settlement > Build Road > End Turn.
     - If a valid option matching the LLM response is not found, return the first valid action in this priority order.

4. **Logging**:
   - Improve logging to capture the heuristic scores, the LLM prompt, its raw response, and the fallback decision (when necessary) for post-game analysis.

Once complete, test the updated `FooPlayer.py`, run games, and report the results.================================== Ai Message ==================================

CODER

### Changes Made:
1. **Refined LLM Prompt Construction**:
   - Enhanced the `_build_prompt` function to use **segmented contextual prompting** with detailed headers for game state, player stats, opponent stats, and available actions.
   - Integrated **heuristic scores** for each action into the prompt to guide the LLM decision-making.

2. **Heuristic Computation Method**:
   - Added a `_compute_heuristic_scores` helper method to assign heuristic values to each action based on action type (e.g., city-building prioritized over road-building).

3. **Improved Parsing Logic**:
   - Enhanced `_parse_llm_response` to return a matching action from the LLM response, or delegate to the fallback mechanism if no match is found.

4. **Ranked Fallback Mechanism**:
   - Implemented `_fallback_action` to evaluate actions in a priority order: Build City > Build Settlement > Build Road > End Turn.
   - Default to the first action only when no prioritized options exist.

5. **Logging**:
   - Added print statements throughout to capture key debugging information:
     - The LLM prompt.
     - Heuristic scores of actions.
     - The LLM's raw response.
     - Logs for fallback mechanism use.

6. **Error Handling Enhancements**:
   - Integrated robust exception handling in the `decide` method for LLM failures, with clear logging of fallbacks.

### Notes for the Next Iteration:
- Tune the **heuristic scores** if the LLM's decisions align poorly with optimal strategies.
- Monitor how well the LLM responds to the enhanced prompt structure during testing.
- Evaluate the fallback mechanism's efficiency in comparison to the LLM's responses.

### Testing Recommendations:
- Focus on scenarios requiring diverse strategic goals (e.g., blocking opponent moves, building towards Largest Army).
- Analyze logs for patterns in ambiguous or ineffective LLM responses, and refine prompts or fallback heuristics accordingly.

END CODER================================ Human Message =================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Ensure functionality and compatibility of FooPlayer with the Catanatron API while strengthening the LLM decision-making mechanism in a way that improves strategic performance over the next 5 iterations.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Integrate valid Catanatron API calls into `foo_player.py`'s `_build_prompt` method to fetch relevant game data like resources, settlements, cities, roads, and victory points, and resolve the current `AttributeError` preventing gameplay.

CHOSEN AGENT: CODER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:  
Resolve the `AttributeError` by replacing invalid calls in `foo_player.py` with Catanatron-compatible API calls as outlined in the research:

1. **Resources**:
   - Replace `game.get_player_resources(Color.BLUE)` with `get_player_freqdeck(state, Color.BLUE)` to fetch all resources for FooPlayer.
   - Use `player_num_resource_cards(state, Color.BLUE, resource)` to query specific resource counts.

2. **Settlements and Cities**:
   - Replace invalid calls for settlements/cities with:
     ```python
     get_player_buildings(state, Color.BLUE, "SETTLEMENT")
     get_player_buildings(state, Color.BLUE, "CITY")
     ```

3. **Victory Points and Roads**:
   - Retrieve victory points using:
     ```python
     vp = state.player_state[player_key(state, Color.BLUE) + "_ACTUAL_VICTORY_POINTS"]
     ```
   - Roads remaining:
     ```python
     roads_available = state.player_state[player_key(state, Color.BLUE) + "_ROADS_AVAILABLE"]
     ```

4. **General Updates to `_build_prompt`**:
   - Adjust the prompt to include all valid game stats, ensuring Catanatron API calls function.
   - Include resource counts, settlements, cities, roads, and VP in the formatted prompt structure.

5. **Debugging and Validation**:
   - Add logging to verify data retrieval accuracy during gameplay for resources, actions, and VP.
   - Run a test evolution to confirm the absence of runtime errors.

Update the code to reflect these changes and provide detailed debug logs during testing for validation.================================== Ai Message ==================================

CODER

### Changes Made:
1. **Replaced Invalid API Calls**:
   - Substituted `game.get_player_resources(Color.BLUE)` with `get_player_freqdeck(state, Color.BLUE)` to correctly fetch resources.
   - Similar replacements made for settlements, cities, victory points, and roads using valid Catanatron API functions: 
     - `get_player_buildings(state, Color.BLUE, "SETTLEMENT")` and `get_player_buildings(state, Color.BLUE, "CITY")` for settlements and cities.
     - Victory points accessed via `state.player_state[f"{player_key(state, Color.BLUE)}_ACTUAL_VICTORY_POINTS"]`.
     - Roads available via `state.player_state[f"{player_key(state, Color.BLUE)}_ROADS_AVAILABLE"]`.

2. **Updated `_build_prompt` Method**:
   - Included new resource and state-fetching methods in the prompt template.
   - Enhanced formatting to make the prompt explainable and consistent with the desired LLM input structure.

3. **Improved Compatibility**:
   - Refactored the game state integration in `_build_prompt` to align with valid methods reliably compatible with the API.

4. **Debugging Enhancements**:
   - Added detailed logging via print statements to verify accurate state data retrieval during gameplay (resources, settlements, cities, heuristic scores).
   - Included error handling for invalid or mismatched LLM responses.

### Notes for the Next Iteration:
- Test how well the new prompt structure works with the LLM's decision-making.
- Monitor logs for resource/state-fetch accuracy and potential mismatches between heuristic scores and LLM responses.

### Testing Recommendations:
- Verify that resources, settlements, cities, and other player stats from the state align with the game's current state through debugging outputs.
- Check if the fallback mechanism handles invalid or ambiguous LLM responses efficiently.

END CODER================================ Human Message =================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Implement a strategy that improves both early and late-game decision-making for FooPlayer through advanced heuristics, adjusted fallback mechanisms, and refined LLM prompts, achieving measurable improvements in metrics such as roads, settlements, and victory points.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Integrate enhanced heuristic scoring and dynamic fallback priorities into the decision flow while refining LLM responses for strategic action selection, focusing on VP growth and efficient resource use.

CHOSEN AGENT: CODER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:  
Modify FooPlayer to implement the strategies outlined in the five key areas. Specifically:

1. **Enhance Heuristic Scoring**:
   - Add multipliers for actions directly contributing to Victory Points, such as settlement building and city upgrading.
   - Dynamically adjust scores based on the game stage (early vs. late-game priorities), prioritizing roads and settlements early while focusing on VP-heavy actions late.

2. **Dynamic Fallback Mechanism**:
   - Revise the fallback mechanism to focus on early-game expansion via roads and settlements as placeholders for resource diversity and VP accumulation.
   - Later transition fallback logic to VP-centric actions like city upgrades and development cards.

3. **Refined LLM Prompt**:
   - Update the LLM prompt to emphasize VP growth explicitly.
   - Demand justification for actions based on Victory Points and strategic blocking of opponents.

4. **Resource Threshold Balancing**:
   - Introduce logic for maintaining resource reserves and diversifying investments based on available actions.
   - Trigger placeholder actions like road-building when strategic objectives are temporarily unattainable.

5. **Action Bottleneck Detection**:
   - Implement tracking logic for repetitive unproductive actions (e.g., repeated "END TURN").
   - Adjust decision scoring to discourage stagnation, forcing resource spending or defensive actions when necessary.

Make necessary modifications to the `decide` method and auxiliary functions like `_build_prompt` and `heuristic_scores`. Run a test iteration post-implementation to ensure that the changes positively impact FooPlayer performance.

3. **Refined LLM Prompt**:
   - Expanded the prompt to focus on VP, resource diversity, and opponent impact.
   - Included heuristic scores for LLM guidance and decision alignment.

4. **Improved Error and Response Handling**:
   - Enhanced `_parse_llm_response` to handle ambiguous LLM outputs.
   - Included detailed print logs during fallback decisions.

### Next Steps:
- Test the updated `FooPlayer` against increasingly challenging opponents to evaluate performance.
- Monitor logs, especially during fallback actions, for adjustments to scoring weights or LLM alignment.
- Incrementally refine heuristic values and prompt details based on test outcomes.

Let me know when you're ready to test the updated player!================================ Human Message =================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Over the next 5 iterations, implement and refine a system that better aligns FooPlayer's heuristic evaluation, LLM prompt design, and fallback mechanisms towards impactful, VP-driven actions. Aim for measurable improvements in foundational metrics like roads, settlements, and cities.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Recalibrate FooPlayer's heuristic scoring system to implement stage-specific priorities and dynamically address bottlenecks, ensuring better alignment between heuristic-driven actions and LLM output. Update the LLM prompt design to explicitly focus on VP growth and reduce low-value decision patterns.

CHOSEN AGENT: CODER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:  
Update `foo_player.py` as follows:

1. **Enhanced Heuristic Scoring**: 
    - Modify `_compute_heuristic_scores` to include stage-specific priorities:
      - Early-game boosts for roads and settlements.
      - Late-game emphasis on cities and development cards.
    - Include dynamic bottle-neck handling, e.g.:
      - Reward actions that address resource buildup or stagnation.
      - Encourage actions that disrupt opponents (e.g., blocking roads/settlements).
    - Use tile values (6, 8, etc.) to boost settlement scores for strategic intersections.

2. **Refined LLM Prompt**:
    - Update `_build_prompt` with stronger emphasis on guiding actions toward VP and strategic goals:
      - Enumerate priorities explicitly: building roads, settlements, cities.
      - Include heuristic scores in the prompt with descriptions of why actions are valuable.
      - Penalize repetitive actions like "END TURN" through explicit discouragement in the prompt.

3. **Fallback Mechanism Adjustment**:
    - Introduce deterministic templates for stage-specific fallback actions:
      - Early-game: Prioritize roads and settlements for expansion.
      - Late-game: Focus on cities and VP-centric actions.
    - Dynamically adapt fallback decisions based on resource surplus or game state bottlenecks.
    ```python
    if player_resources["brick"] >= 3 and player_resources["wood"] >= 3:
        heuristic_scores[ActionType.BUILD_ROAD] += 5
    ```

4. **Action Bottleneck Detection**:
    - Add detection for repetitive or stagnating actions (e.g., unspent resources or repeated "END TURN").
    - Penalize stagnation by prioritizing resource expenditure and spatial expansion.

Upon completing the updates, test the revised player for functional improvements in decision-making, focusing on roads, settlements, and overall strategic progression.================================== Ai Message ==================================

CODER

### Updates to `foo_player.py`:
1. **Enhanced Heuristic Scoring**:
   - Integrated stage-specific priorities (e.g., roads and settlements emphasized early-game, cities in mid-late game).
   - Added bonuses for high-resource tiles in settlement actions.
   - Introduced penalties to address resource bottlenecks (e.g., surplus brick/wood triggers road-building incentives).
   - Incorporated logic to dynamically adjust scores based on resource availability and VP contributions.

2. **Refined LLM Prompt**:
   - Redesigned `_build_prompt` to better guide the LLM:
     - Explicit priorities for strategic actions based on Victory Point (VP) growth.
     - Highlighted roadmap for early-game road/settlement building and late-game upgrades.
     - Discouraged repetitive or non-impactful actions like unnecessary turns.
   - Included heuristic scores in the prompt, with explanations for why certain actions are prioritized.

3. **Dynamic Fallback Mechanism**:
   - Structured fallback logic to prioritize actions based on game state:
     - Early-game: Roads and settlements.
     - Late-game: Cities and VP-centric actions.
   - Updated fallback mechanism to prevent stagnation by using deterministic templates blended with heuristic-driven conditions.

4. **Bottleneck and Surplus Resource Handling**:
   - Added logic to detect and dynamically handle situations where surplus resources exist (e.g., incentivizing road-building on excess brick/wood).
   - Increased priority for settlement or city building to resolve resource stagnation.

5. **Improved Logs**:
   - Added meaningful print statements across key decision-making steps to facilitate debugging:
     - Fallback actions.
     - Detected bottlenecks or resource imbalances.
     - LLM responses (and when fallback mechanisms are triggered).

### Testing Suggestions:
- **Evaluate Decision Quality**:
  - Test early-game actions for expansion focus (roads and settlements).
  - Verify mid-to-late game actions prioritize cities and VP-centric plays.
- **Monitor Bottleneck Response**:
  - Simulate resource-rich scenarios to observe if surplus resources are properly spent.
- **Validate Fallback Logic**:
  - Conduct games where the LLM fails or incorrectly parses the prompt to assess fallback success.
- **Track Metrics**:
  - Compare average VP, settlements, and city counts across multiple iterations to previous versions.

### Next Steps:
- Refine heuristic weights after testing to balance strategic trade-offs.
- Incorporate feedback cycles to analyze and further tune prompt alignment with heuristic evaluations.
- Observe repetitive "END TURN" penalties and ensure they improve game progression.

END CODER================================ Human Message =================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Ensure compatibility with the Catanatron API by appropriately integrating valid attributes of the `Action` class and utilizing game state data to enhance decision-making. Achieve stable functionality for testing strategic performance over the next 5 iterations.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Correct the `AttributeError` by refactoring `foo_player.py` to rely on valid `Action.value` attributes or query relevant context from the `State` class for heuristic scoring. Ensure all references to `location` are replaced with valid methods to retrieve positional or resource data.

AGENT OBJECTIVE:
Refactor `foo_player.py` to address the syntax error and improve heuristic scoring:

1. **Fix Invalid References**:
   - Replace all calls to the nonexistent `action.location` with queries to `Action.value` or `State` methods.
   - Example adjustments:
     ```python
     if action.action_type == ActionType.BUILD_SETTLEMENT and len(state.board.map.adjacent_tiles[action.value]) > threshold:
         heuristic_scores[action] += 3
     ```
     Here, `action.value` provides the node ID where the settlement would be built.

2. **Context Retrieval from State**:
   - For actions like `BUILD_SETTLEMENT` or `BUILD_CITY`, retrieve adjacent tiles and their resource values using `state.board.map.adjacent_tiles[action.value]`.
   - For roads, use `Action.value` to access edge information and query connected tiles.

3. **Heuristic Scoring Enhancements**:
   - Incorporate valid context details from the state or action attributes to refine heuristic scoring:
     - High-value tiles should boost settlement scores:
       ```python
       adjacent_resources = [tile.resource for tile in state.board.map.adjacent_tiles[action.value] if tile.resource is not None]
       resource_bonus = sum(tile.value for resource in adjacent_resources)
       heuristic_scores[action] += resource_bonus
       ```

4. **Debugging and Validation**:
   - Ensure all invalid references are replaced with valid calls.
   - Add debug print statements to verify successful access to `Action.value` or state functions during gameplay.

Once refactoring is complete, test FooPlayer to confirm it runs without errors and demonstrate functional heuristic scoring improvements.================================== Ai Message ==================================

CODER

### Summary of Changes:
1. **Fixed `AttributeError`**:
   - Replaced invalid references to `action.location` with valid attribute and context retrieval using `action.value` and game state methods (e.g., accessing `state.board.map.adjacent_tiles` for settlement scoring).

2. **Improved Settlement Scoring**:
   - Enhanced `_compute_heuristic_scores` to calculate bonuses for settlements based on adjacent tiles' resource values using `state.board.map.adjacent_tiles[action.value]`.

3. **Resource Bottleneck Handling**:
   - Retained logic for surplus brick/wood to incentivize road-building.

4. **Improved Debugging**:
   - Added specific print statements during fallback and heuristic computation to verify logic.

5. **Dynamic Heuristic Refinements**:
   - Settlement scoring dynamically adjusts based on adjacent tile values, improving action prioritization.

### Testing Plan:
- Verify that the game runs without errors.
- Validate heuristic score calculations for settlements and roads using logs.
- Test gameplay performance:
  - Early-game: Expansion (settlements and roads).
  - Late-game: City-building and VP growth.

Let me know if the updated player behaves as expected or requires further refinements.

END CODER================================ Human Message =================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Ensure stable heuristic scoring for FooPlayer by correctly accessing valid attributes of `LandTile` and utilizing game state methods (e.g., `adjacent_tiles`) to compute bonuses for settlements and roads. Refine gameplay to support functional testing over the next 5 iterations.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Replace the incorrect reference to `tile.value` in heuristic scoring with valid queries to `tile.resource`, `tile.number`, and `number_probability()` to calculate bonuses for adjacent tiles when evaluating settlement actions.

CHOSEN AGENT: CODER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:
Refactor `foo_player.py` to fix the error and improve scoring calculations:

1. **Correct Tile Context Retrieval**:
   - Replace all calls to `tile.value` with queries to valid attributes of `LandTile`, such as `tile.resource` for resource type or `tile.number` for dice roll probability.
   - Use `game.state.board.adjacent_tiles[node_id]` to get tiles surrounding the node at which a settlement or city is to be built.
   - Example adjustment:
     ```python
     adjacent_tiles = game.state.board.adjacent_tiles[action.value]
     resource_bonus = sum(number_probability(tile.number) for tile in adjacent_tiles if tile.resource is not None)
     heuristic_scores[action] += resource_bonus
     ```

2. **Enhance Settlement Scoring**:
   - Calculate settlement scores dynamically based on cumulative resource probabilities from adjacent tiles (using `number_probability()` and `tile.resource`).
   - Adjust `_compute_heuristic_scores` to include valid resource bonuses:
     ```python
     for action in playable_actions:
         if action.action_type == ActionType.BUILD_SETTLEMENT:
             adjacent_tiles = game.state.board.adjacent_tiles[action.value]
             resource_bonus = sum(number_probability(tile.number) for tile in adjacent_tiles if tile.resource is not None)
             heuristic_scores[action] = 10 + resource_bonus
     ```

3. **Validate Heuristic Scoring**:
   - Ensure all logic runs smoothly, avoiding invalid calls or attributes.
   - Add debug print statements to log computed bonuses during gameplay.

Once implemented, test FooPlayer for functionality and measure changes in heuristic-driven decision-making across multiple iterations.================================== Ai Message ==================================

   - Settlement bonuses now dynamically evaluate adjacent tiles using `state.board.adjacent_tiles[action.value]`.
   - Bonuses are calculated based on valid attributes (`tile.resource` and `tile.number`) using `number_probability()`.

3. **Improved Resource Bottleneck Handling**:
   - Retained logic to incentivize road-building when brick and wood resources are in surplus.

4. **Debug Enhancements**:

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Leverage `CatanMap` utilities like `adjacent_tiles` and `node_production` to accurately compute node-specific resource bonuses for heuristic scoring. Stabilize FooPlayer to run without errors and refine its strategic behaviors.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Replace the invalid `state.board.adjacent_tiles` reference in `_compute_heuristic_scores` with a valid call to `game.state.board.map.adjacent_tiles` or leverage `node_production` for simplified resource-based scoring. Prioritize stability and alignment with Catanatron's API.

CHOSEN AGENT: CODER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:
Refactor `foo_player.py` to resolve the `AttributeError` and improve heuristic scoring:

1. **Correct Context Access**:
   - Replace the invalid `state.board.adjacent_tiles[action.value]` with valid methods:
     - Use `game.state.board.map.adjacent_tiles[action.value]` to retrieve adjacent tiles for the node (correcting the error).
     - Alternatively, use `game.state.board.map.node_production[action.value]` for precomputed resource probabilities at a node.

2. **Update Node-Specific Scoring Logic**:
   - If using `adjacent_tiles`, query each tile’s `resource` and `number` attributes and compute bonuses based on `number_probability(tile.number)`. Example:
     ```python
     adjacent_tiles = game.state.board.map.adjacent_tiles[action.value]
     resource_bonus = sum(number_probability(tile.number) for tile in adjacent_tiles if tile.resource is not None)
     ```
   - If using `node_production`, calculate a cumulative production score:
     ```python
     resource_production = game.state.board.map.node_production[action.value]
     resource_bonus = sum(resource_production[resource] * RESOURCE_WEIGHTS[resource] for resource in resource_production)
     ```

3. **Testing and Debugging Enhancements**:
   - Add debug print statements to verify retrieved tile data and computed scores.
   - Ensure heuristic-driven behaviors align with expected strategic priorities (e.g., roads, settlements, VP growth).

After implementing these changes, test FooPlayer for stability and validate heuristic-driven decision-making during game simulations.================================== Ai Message ==================================

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Replace the incorrect dictionary-like reference (`player_resources['brick']`) with valid list-based indexing when accessing resource quantities. Update `_compute_heuristic_scores` to correctly evaluate resources using the resolved `player_resources` format.

CHOSEN AGENT: CODER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:
Refactor `foo_player.py` to fix the `TypeError` in `_compute_heuristic_scores`:

1. **Resource Retrieval**:
   - Replace the existing `player_resources['brick']` and `player_resources['wood']` references with valid list indices:
     - Brick: `player_resources[1]`
     - Wood: `player_resources[0]`

2. **Correct Scoring Logic**:
   - Adjust the conditional checks for resource availability (e.g., brick, wood) and ensure heuristic scores are calculated accurately using these list indices:
     ```python
     if player_resources[1] >= 3 and player_resources[0] >= 3:  # Brick and Wood
         heuristic_scores[action] += 5
     ```

3. **Testing Enhancements**:
   - Add print statements in `_compute_heuristic_scores` to log the retrieved resource counts and verify the heuristic decisions based on resource availability.

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Optimize heuristic-driven actions in FooPlayer by implementing refined settlement prioritization, resource bottleneck resolution mechanisms, and VP progression strategies. Test improvements to settlement, city, and road-building actions over the next five iterations.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Implement **Strategy 1: Settlement Optimization** in FooPlayer to improve gameplay by:
1. Diversifying settlement scores based on high/low tile probability and adjacency resource variety.
2. Adjusting road-scoring logic to prioritize building roads that enable potential settlement expansion.
3. Refining the fallback mechanism to prioritize substantive actions (settlements, cities, roads) over low-impact turns.

CHOSEN AGENT: CODER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:
Refactor `foo_player.py` to follow the directives of **Strategy 1: Settlement Optimization**:

1. **Dynamic Settlement Scoring**:
   - Increase settlement base score to 10.
   - Adjust scoring logic for settlements based on tile probability values and penalties for adjacent low-probability tiles. For example:
     ```python
     resource_bonus = sum(number_probability(tile.number) for tile in adjacent_tiles if tile.resource is not None)
     if sum(1 for tile in adjacent_tiles if number_probability(tile.number) < 4) >= 1:
         resource_bonus -= 3  # Penalize low-value locations
     heuristic_scores[action] = 10 + resource_bonus
     ```

2. **Improved Road Scoring**:
   - Increase road score if the road enables immediate or future settlement building. Example:
     ```python
     if action.action_type == ActionType.BUILD_ROAD and adjacent_empty_node(action.value):
         heuristic_scores[action] += 5  # Incentivize road near buildable settlement spots
     ```

3. **Prioritization Order**:
   - Implement fallback logic to prioritize impactful actions in this order:
     - Settlements > Cities > Roads > Development Cards > Trades.
     Add debug logs where fallback is triggered to ensure visibility into the decision-making process.

Once these changes are implemented, run the updated FooPlayer and measure its success across game simulations. Aim to validate settlement optimization and ensure alignment between heuristic scoring, resource availability, and strategic decision-making.================================== Ai Message ==================================

2. **Improved Road Scoring**:
   - Modified road scoring to prioritize roads enabling settlement expansion using the `_adjacent_empty_node` helper method.
   - Assigned higher scores (15) for road actions leading to potential settlement spots.

3. **Dynamic City Scoring**:
   - Adjusted city scores to prioritize foundational settlement growth by reducing city priority to 7 if fewer than 3 settlements exist.

4. **Resource Bottleneck Handling**:
   - Improved handling of surplus resources, adding bonuses for road-building when brick/wood are abundant.
   - Encouraged development card purchases during ore/wheat surplus periods.

5. **Adjacency Node Check**:
   - Added `_adjacent_empty_node` helper method to dynamically check for available settlement spots connected to proposed road-building actions.

6. **Fallback Improvements**:
   - Updated fallback mechanism to reflect the new prioritization order: settlements > cities > roads > development cards > low-impact actions.

7. **Debug Enhancements**:
   - Added logs to track decision-making and fallback actions for visibility into player strategy.

### Notes for Testing:
- Validate stability during gameplay to confirm the absence of runtime errors.
- Monitor strategic upgrades (e.g., settlement expansion, city-building prioritization) via logs.
- Evaluate performance improvements over previous iterations, focusing on VP progression and settlement counts.

GAME RESULTS:

LLM Response: Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_SETTLEMENT: 'BUILD_SETTLEMENT'>, value=22)

Justification: Building a settlement at position 22 is an optimal choice as it ranks among the highest heuristic scores (7.333333333333334), indicating strong resource diversity potential or strategic placement. Expanding settlements early aligns with the game's priority of maximizing resource collection and establishing a strong foundation for VP growth. Additionally, building at this position provides better strategic positioning to block opponents' progress and secure valuable intersections for future expansions.

AttributeError: 'CatanMap' object has no attribute 'adjacent_nodes'. Did you mean: 'adjacent_tiles'?================================ Human Message =================================

After Running The New foo_player.py Player, Here is my analysis and findings:

### Syntax Error Details:
- **Error Message**: `AttributeError: 'CatanMap' object has no attribute 'adjacent_nodes'. Did you mean: 'adjacent_tiles'?`
- **Exact Line Number**: Line 134 in `foo_player.py`
- **Exact Line of Code**: `adjacent_nodes = game.state.board.map.adjacent_nodes[edge_id]`

### Root Cause:
The `CatanMap` object does not have an attribute `adjacent_nodes`. The correct attribute appears to be `adjacent_tiles` as suggested in the error message. This occurs in the `_adjacent_empty_node` method, which is used for heuristic scoring to validate potential road connections.

### Impact:
The syntax error prevents the game simulation from running, resulting in no recorded game results or scores for this evolution. Additionally, this issue directly affects heuristic calculations and the decision-making process.

Let me know if you need anything else!================================== Ai Message ==================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Correct the handling of road adjacency logic in the `_adjacent_empty_node` method by replacing the invalid `adjacent_nodes` reference with a functional alternative. Restore FooPlayer's functionality and ensure accurate decision-making in road-building heuristics over the next iterations.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Investigate the proper mechanism or data structure in `CatanMap` for determining adjacent nodes to a specific edge (or road) and refactor `_adjacent_empty_node` to utilize this correctly.

CHOSEN AGENT: RESEARCHER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:  
Investigate and validate the correct way to determine adjacent nodes for a given edge (`edge_id`) in the Catanatron framework. Specifically:
1. Identify the correct attribute or method in `CatanMap` or related classes (e.g., `State`, `Game`) to retrieve adjacent node IDs for an edge.
2. Provide pseudocode or usage examples for constructing the `_adjacent_empty_node` function, ensuring functionality and alignment with the game framework.
3. Highlight if further adjustments are needed to accurately compute adjacent nodes for road-building heuristics.

Deliver actionable findings to directly resolve the AttributeError in `_adjacent_empty_node`.================================ Human Message =================================

RESEARCH:

### Addressing the Road Adjacency Logic in `_adjacent_empty_node`

#### **1. Valid Mechanism for Determining Adjacent Nodes to an Edge**
The `Board` and `CatanMap` classes provide data structures and methods for locating adjacent nodes to edges. Specifically:
- **`STATIC_GRAPH`** in `Board`: A `networkx.Graph` object representing all nodes and edges on the map. This graph supports queries to find neighbors of any node or edge.
- **`STATIC_GRAPH.neighbors(node_id)`**: Returns a generator of immediate neighbors for a specific `node_id`.
  ```python
  neighbors = STATIC_GRAPH.neighbors(node_id)
  ```

#### **2. Querying Adjacent Nodes for Road Placement**
For adjacent nodes along edges, you can:
1. Find the connected endpoints of an edge using the stored graph.
2. Invert the edge if necessary (`edge_id = tuple(sorted([node_a, node_b]))`) to account for directional representation.

#### Example for Retrieving Adjacent Empty Nodes:
- Query neighbors that are unoccupied (not yet built upon):
  ```python
  def _adjacent_empty_node(edge_id, board):
      adjacent_nodes = []
      for node in edge_id:  # Iterate over both nodes of the edge
          neighbors = STATIC_GRAPH.neighbors(node)
          # Filter empty nodes (no buildings)
          empty_neighbors = [
              neighbor for neighbor in neighbors 
              if neighbor not in board.buildings
          ]
          adjacent_nodes.extend(empty_neighbors)
      return adjacent_nodes
  ```

---

#### **3. Incorporating the Adjacency Logic in `_adjacent_empty_node`**
To correct the `_adjacent_empty_node` logic in `FooPlayer`, use the validated code structure:
- Reference the `Board.buildings` dictionary to check if a node is occupied (whether there’s a building present).
- Use `STATIC_GRAPH.neighbors(node_id)` to identify adjacent nodes.

#### Refactored Code:
```python
def _adjacent_empty_node(edge_id, board):
    """
    Finds empty nodes adjacent to the given edge.
    
    Args:
        edge_id (Tuple[int, int]): The edge defined by two node IDs.
        board (Board): Current game board state.
        
    Returns:
        List[int]: Node IDs of all adjacent empty nodes.
    """
    adjacent_nodes = []
    for node in edge_id:  # For both nodes of the edge
        neighbors = STATIC_GRAPH.neighbors(node)  # Get connected nodes
        # Check if the neighbor node is empty (no building present)
        empty_neighbors = [
            neighbor for neighbor in neighbors 
            if neighbor not in board.buildings
        ]
        adjacent_nodes.extend(empty_neighbors)  # Add empty nodes to result
    return adjacent_nodes
```

---

#### **4. Alternative Approaches**
If `STATIC_GRAPH` is unavailable, you can reconstruct adjacency logic using board's `map` attributes:
1. Retrieve `node_id` pairs directly from `CatanMap` edge-to-node mapping:
   ```python
   def _adjacent_empty_node(edge_id, board):
       node_a, node_b = edge_id
       empty_nodes = []
       for node in (node_a, node_b):
           adjacent_nodes = [
               n for n in board.map.land_nodes
               if n != node and n not in board.buildings
           ]
           empty_nodes.extend(adjacent_nodes)
       return empty_nodes
   ```
2. This method is slower but works without `networkx` dependencies.

END RESEARCH.================================== Ai Message ==================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Ensure the stability and functionality of FooPlayer by implementing corrected adjacency logic for `_adjacent_empty_node`, enabling accurate road-building heuristics that prioritize settlement expansion.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Refactor `_adjacent_empty_node` in `foo_player.py` to use `STATIC_GRAPH.neighbors` for valid adjacency checks, ensuring empty nodes are correctly identified and utilized in decision-making.

CHOSEN AGENT: CODER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:
Refactor `_adjacent_empty_node` in `foo_player.py` to resolve the `AttributeError` and enable accurate adjacency detection for roads:

1. **Adjacency Logic**:
   - Replace the invalid `adjacent_nodes` reference with the following:
     ```python
     neighbors = STATIC_GRAPH.neighbors(node)
     empty_neighbors = [
         neighbor for neighbor in neighbors
         if neighbor not in board.buildings
     ]
     ```
   - Use the `STATIC_GRAPH` object to resolve adjacent nodes dynamically for road connectivity.

2. **Edge Handling**:
   - Ensure edges are properly indexed, assuming tuple format (e.g., `(node_a, node_b)`).

3. **Test and Debug Enhancements**:
   - Add debug statements to validate retrieved adjacent nodes during runtime, confirming no issues in scoring logic:
     ```python
     print(f"Adjacent empty nodes for edge {edge_id}: {adjacent_nodes}")
     ```

Once implemented, ensure the updated `_adjacent_empty_node` function runs without errors, supports accurate road heuristics, and aligns with prioritized settlement expansion strategies.

CODER

### Updates Implemented:
1. **Corrected Adjacency Logic**:
   - Refactored `_adjacent_empty_node` to use the `STATIC_GRAPH.neighbors` method from the `Board` class to check adjacent nodes.
   - Ensured the function properly detects empty nodes not occupied by buildings.

2. **Improved Debugging**:
   - Added logging of adjacent empty nodes detected for edges during road-building evaluations for better visibility.

3. **Updated `decide` and Heuristic Scoring**:
   - Integrated the corrected adjacency logic to accurately prioritize road-building actions that enable settlement opportunities.
   - Added fallback mechanisms for cases where nodes adjacent to edges were invalid or ambiguous.

4. **Stability Enhancements**:
   - Replaced the invalid `adjacent_nodes` attribute with robust neighbor detection logic, ensuring compatibility with the game API and avoiding runtime errors.

### Recommended Testing:
- Validate settlement and road-building heuristics during simulation runs.
- Monitor debug output for logs related to adjacent empty nodes and heuristic scores.
- Test fallback logic when LLM responses are invalid or the priority order must resolve ambiguities.

After Running The New foo_player.py Player, Here is my analysis and findings:

### Scores of FooPlayer:
- Wins: 0  
- Average Victory Points (VP): 3.33  
- Average Settlements: 2.33  
- Average Cities: 0.33  
- Average Roads: 0.0  
- Average Largest Army: 0.0  
- Average Development VP: 0.33  

### Short Analysis of Game Output:
- The LLM consistently failed to provide valid or actionable responses: "LLM response ambiguous or invalid. Defaulting to first action."
- FooPlayer defaulted to the first available action in all scenarios instead of executing strategic decisions.
- The performance difference is stark: FooPlayer had no wins and significantly lower VP compared to AlphaBetaPlayer.

### Errors, Warnings, or Signs of Implementation Issues:
- **LLM Integration Issue**: LLM responses are not being parsed correctly or are poorly generated, leading to fallback actions ("Defaulting to first action").
- **Decision-Making Deficiency**: The lack of strategic outcomes (e.g., 0 roads, 0 Largest Army) suggests serious shortcomings in action planning and execution.
- **Repeated Logs**: Multiple instances of ambiguous LLM responses point to insufficient prompt design or response parsing mechanism in `_parse_llm_response`.

After Running The New foo_player.py Player, Here is my analysis and findings:

### Syntax Error Details:
- **Error Message**: `AttributeError: 'Game' object has no attribute 'get_player_resources'`
- **Exact Line Number**: Line 84 in `foo_player.py`
- **Exact Line of Code**: `resources=str(game.get_player_resources(Color.BLUE)),  # Example method to get resources`

### Root Cause:
The method `get_player_resources` is being called on the `Game` object, but it does not exist in the `Game` class, leading to an `AttributeError`. This indicates a mismatch between the game's API and the implementation in `foo_player.py`.

### Impact:
The syntax error prevents the game from running, and thus no game results were recorded for this evolution.

After Running The New foo_player.py Player, Here is my analysis and findings:

### Scores of FooPlayer:
- Wins: 0  
- Average Victory Points (VP): 2.33  
- Average Settlements: 1.67  
- Average Cities: 0.33  
- Average Roads: 0.0  
- Average Largest Army: 0.0  
- Average Development VP: 0.0  

### Short Analysis of Game Output:
- **LLM Interaction**: The LLM responded consistently, but gameplay justification often involved executing mandatory or default actions (e.g., "ROLL" and "END TURN"), suggesting limited strategic depth.
- **Interesting Output**: The heuristic scoring mechanism categorizes actions clearly, but no significant changes to gameplay performance reflect deeper strategy execution.
- **Signs of Issue**: No roads or army development indicates repeated failure to invest strategically in growth areas, despite consistent heuristic scoring.

### Errors, Warnings, or Signs of Implementation Issues:
- **Strategic Weakness**: The absence of victories and poor metrics like roads and army raises concerns about the decision-making quality. 
- **Heuristic Misalignment**: High heuristic scores for actions like "BUILD_ROAD" occasionally appear in the logs but fail to translate into meaningful gameplay progression.

After Running The New foo_player.py Player, Here is my analysis and findings:

### Scores of FooPlayer:
- Wins: 0  
- Average Victory Points (VP): 2.6666666666666665  
- Average Settlements: 1.3333333333333333  
- Average Cities: 0.6666666666666666  
- Average Roads: 0.0  
- Average Largest Army: 0.0  
- Average Development VP: 0.0  

### Short Analysis of Game Output:
- **Repetitive Logs**: Multiple instances of LLM responses defaulting to basic actions such as "ROLL" and "END TURN," with justifications suggesting limited strategic depth. Example: "Rolling is necessary to progress the game state."
- **Neutral Heuristic Scoring**: Actions often evaluated with a low heuristic score (`1`). This indicates the heuristic system fails to differentiate between strategic actions.
- **Misalignment**: High-priority actions like "BUILD_CITY" or "BUILD_SETTLEMENT" seem underutilized, despite occasional high heuristic scores visible in logs. 

### Errors, Warnings, or Signs of Implementation Issues:
- **LLM Integration Weakness**: Responses imply poor decision quality by prioritizing roll/end-turn actions excessively. This indicates the prompt design and parsing mechanisms need refinement.
- **Strategic Gaps**: Failure to build roads or utilize army resources, even across multiple turns, suggests severe strategic deficiencies. The game log reinforces these gaps.
- **Warning**: Logs frequently state "Fallback mechanism applied," implying reliance on basic action prioritization rather than effective LLM outputs.

### Scores of FooPlayer:
- Wins: 0  
- Average Victory Points (VP): 6.0  
- Average Settlements: 0.0  
- Average Cities: 2.0  
- Average Roads: 0.0  
- Average Largest Army: 0.67  
- Average Development VP: 0.67  

### Short Analysis of Game Output:
- **LLM Interaction Success**: LLM consistently generated justifications and proposed actions, such as "TRADE," "BUY_DEVELOPMENT_CARD," and "END_TURN." Responses appeared logical in the context given but often led to suboptimal action in terms of progressing VP efficiently.
- **Interesting Observations**: Maritime trades for resource balancing (e.g., trading ore for wheat) were frequently proposed but failed to substantially impact settlement or city-building opportunities.
- **Performance Deficiency**: Despite coherent justifications, the actual game execution did not lead to strategic advancements. The player failed to build any settlements and only maintained cities, likely limiting resource diversity and overall performance.

### Warnings or Signs of Player Implementation Error:
- **Heuristic Scoring Issue**: Logs suggest heuristic scores are applied, but the scoring system itself appears misaligned with actionable priorities (e.g., settlements as highest priority). High-scored actions like "BUILD_SETTLEMENT" were not executed successfully, indicating a disconnection between scoring and feasibility.
- **Resource Bottleneck**: Repetitive logs highlight insufficient resources for impactful actions, emphasizing a failure in resource management or strategy execution.
- **Low-Impact Choices**: Many turns defaulted to fallback mechanisms or repetitive low-impact actions (e.g., "ROLL" and "END_TURN"), which hindered VP growth and progression.

After Running The New foo_player.py Player, Here is my analysis and findings:

### Syntax Error Details:
- **Error Message**: `AttributeError: 'CatanMap' object has no attribute 'adjacent_nodes'. Did you mean: 'adjacent_tiles'?`
- **Exact Line Number**: Line 134 in `foo_player.py`
- **Exact Line of Code**: `adjacent_nodes = game.state.board.map.adjacent_nodes[edge_id]`

### Root Cause:
The `CatanMap` object does not have an attribute `adjacent_nodes`. The correct attribute appears to be `adjacent_tiles` as suggested in the error message. This occurs in the `_adjacent_empty_node` method, which is used for heuristic scoring to validate potential road connections.

### Impact:
The syntax error prevents the game simulation from running, resulting in no recorded game results or scores for this evolution. Additionally, this issue directly affects heuristic calculations and the decision-making process.

This is the current game_output.txt file

rucial action to gain more resources, which are currently limited ([0, 1, 3, 1, 0]). Expanding settlements and upgrading them to cities require diverse resources that rolling may provide. Rolling maintains early-game momentum and aligns with the goal to maximize VP efficiently by enhancing resource diversity for future expansions. Playing the knight card does not contribute to immediate VP or resource gain at this stage, making it an inefficient choice given the low heuristic score.
LLM Response: Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Justification: Currently, the available actions both have equal heuristic scores, indicating no immediate impactful moves are possible at this stage. Playing a Knight Card does not advance resource collection, road-building, settlement expansion, or upgrading to cities, which are priorities for maximizing Victory Points. Since the action to play the Knight Card provides no resource or settlement-related benefit under the current conditions, ending the turn is the most efficient choice to gather more resources and await better opportunities to pursue the stated objectives.
LLM Response: **Action:** Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)  
**Justification:** Rolling is essential at this stage to generate more resources, which are necessary to expand settlements, build roads, and eventually upgrade settlements to cities. Since both actions have the same heuristic score, rolling provides a direct opportunity to collect resources and potentially improve your ability to take impactful actions in future turns. Playing a Knight card would block an opponent temporarily, but without a clear strategic advantage from doing so right now (e.g., blocking a major path or stealing key resources), rolling is the most logical choice to advance toward achieving resource diversity and maximizing VP efficiently.
LLM Response: ### Action: `Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MOVE_ROBBER: 'MOVE_ROBBER'>, value=((0, -1, 1), <Color.RED: 'RED'>, None))`

### Justification:
1. **Strategic Blocking**:
   - This move places the robber on a hex that we suspect benefits the Red player significantly, disrupting their resource generation. Blocking opponents, especially early-game, can delay their progress and prevent them from consolidating resources for settlements or cities.

2. **Aligning with Priorities**:
   - Since we currently lack the resources [0, 2, 2, 1, 0] (and not enough diversity to build settlements or roads right now), our best course of action is to hinder the progress of more advanced adversaries while setting up for future development.

3. **Maximum Impact on Opponent**:
   - Moving the robber to a strategic position with the intent to block **Red's resource generation** is better aligned with progression than other neutral or low-impact robber placements. Considering the heuristic scores are all equal (1), we focus on impact on opponents over neutral moves, making this the optimal choice.

4. **Next Steps**:
   - After hindering Red's progress, continue gathering resources to build more settlements/roads for resource diversity (Priority 1). Once resource flow is stabilized, upgrade settlements to cities (Priority 2) to maximize VP returns. Blocking and robber moves support these goals indirectly by weakening the competition.
LLM Response: **Action**: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD: 'PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD'>, value=None)  
**Justification**: Even though both actions have equal heuristic scores, playing the knight card is a more proactive move than ending the turn. Playing a knight card could potentially allow you to reposition the robber to block an opponent's resource production, indirectly slowing their progress while improving your strategic position. Additionally, playing knights accumulates progress toward the largest army bonus (worth 2 VP), which aligns with your goal of maximizing VP efficiently. Ending the turn would waste an opportunity to carry out an impactful action.
LLM Response: ### Action:
```python
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MOVE_ROBBER: 'MOVE_ROBBER'>, value=((0, 0, 0), None, None))
```

### Justification:
1. **Current Resources and Game State Constraints**:
   - Resources available: [0, 3, 2, 1, 0] (Brick, Lumber, Wheat, Ore, Sheep).
   - You currently lack Brick (0 resources) and Sheep (0 resources). Both are essential for building settlements (1 Brick, 1 Lumber, 1 Wheat, 1 Sheep required).
   - With 4 settlements on the board, expanding requires sufficient resources to build roads and new settlements.

2. **Impact of Moving the Robber**:
   - Moving the robber to disrupt opponents is critical when making progress toward VP growth is not immediately viable from your current resource situation. Since all "MOVE_ROBBER" actions have identical heuristic scores (1), the strategic value is the same across positions.
   - The robber placement at `(0, 0, 0)` (or any spatially neutral position) ensures minimal disruption to your positioning, allowing for focus on future resource gathering without appearing overly aggressive toward opponents, unless clarified further.

3. **Other Actions Analysis**:
   - All listed actions involve the robber movement. Since no weighted heuristic specifies higher strategic pressure to block opponents on higher-yield resource hexes, choosing a neutral action is optimal at this point in the game.

4. **Plan for Next Steps**:
   - Focus on gathering more Brick and Sheep by maintaining road-building options and positioning future settlements on resource-diverse hexes.
   - Convert settlements into cities once additional Ore and Wheat are accumulated, prioritizing long-term VP efficiency.

By choosing this relatively neutral robber placement, you optimize for future resource expansion while avoiding unnecessary aggression or wasted turns.
LLM Response: Based on your description, there seems to be a lack of actionable options to improve Victory Points (VP) directly at this moment. The only listed available action is to "END_TURN," which has limited impact. However, if additional actions are possible but not listed, or you can prepare to take advantage of resources or expansion opportunities, other strategies may arise. Here's my analysis and response:

---

### **Action:**
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

### **Justification:**
1. **Resource Insufficiency:** Your current resource pool ([0, 3, 2, 1, 0]) is insufficient for building settlements (typically costs 1 brick, 1 wood, 1 wheat, and 1 sheep) or upgrading to cities (usually costs 2 wheat and 3 ore). Without the necessary materials, no higher-priority actions (building settlements or upgrading to cities) can be pursued during this turn.
   
2. **No Additional Actions Available:** Based on the provided information, the only action at this moment is to "END_TURN." Consequently, ending the turn is the only viable option until new resources are acquired through dice rolls, trades, or other means.

3. **Preparation for Future Turns:** Ending the turn allows the game to progress, where you can potentially collect resources to execute more impactful actions, such as building settlements for resource diversity or upgrading to cities.

4. **Avoiding Repetition:** While ending turns unnecessarily is discouraged, in this case, no other available actions justify holding the turn further.

### **Strategic Notes:**
- On the next turn, aim to gather resources for building a settlement. The priority should be expanding roads and settlements to unlock better resources, particularly ore and wheat, which are key to upgrading settlements to cities later.
- Consider trading if the opportunity arises to balance your resource pool for construction.
- Observe opponents’ moves to identify potential blockades or counterstrategies.
LLM Response: ### Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

### Justification:
1. **Current Game State Analysis:**
   - Your resource count ([0, 3, 3, 1, 0]) suggests you're low on essential resources like brick (resource 0) and ore (resource 4), which are crucial for expanding settlements and upgrading to cities. Rolling the dice can yield additional resources to improve your diversity and quantity.
   - With 13 roads available, road-building is an option, but you currently lack the brick to build a road (cost: 1 brick, 1 wood).
   - You have 4 settlements on the board, meaning you're generating resources, but you need to gather a more robust pool to take impactful actions such as building new settlements or upgrading to cities.

2. **Why ROLL is Optimal:**
   - Rolling the dice is a productive action since it drives the game forward by providing resources and potentially aiding future goals.
   - Other actions are not currently available, but obtaining resources through rolling the dice directly aligns with the strategy to maximize resource diversity and VP efficiency.

3. **Avoid Repetition and Ineffective Actions:**
   - Refraining from ending the turn prematurely ensures you utilize your opportunities to gain resources and potentially set up higher-impact moves (e.g., building settlements, upgrading to cities).

Rolling the dice is a necessary step to progress meaningfully toward building your economy, setting you up for high-impact actions in subsequent turns.
LLM Response: **Action:** Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

**Justification:** Unfortunately, based on the current game state and lack of alternative actions provided, there doesn't seem to be an actionable option available to build settlements, roads, or upgrade settlements to cities. Building a settlement typically requires a diverse set of resources (e.g., 1 brick, 1 wood, 1 wheat, 1 sheep), while upgrading to a city requires 2 wheat and 3 ore. Currently, the resource inventory [0, 3, 3, 1, 0] lacks both brick and wood necessary for expansion as well as ore for city upgrades. Therefore, there is no high-impact action to take this turn, and the only available action is to end the turn. 

To maximize future efficiency, consider trading next turn or positioning yourself to obtain missing resources via strategic trades, dice rolls, or resource cards. Ending the turn promptly is necessary to move forward.
LLM Response: Based on the game state and priorities, the optimal course of action is as follows:

**Action:** `Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)`

**Justification:** Rolling the dice is the only available action, and it serves to gather resources, which are essential for building settlements, roads, and upgrading settlements to cities. Since resource diversity is critical for expanding and increasing VP early in the game, rolling is a necessary step to advance toward achieving these objectives. Additionally, it aligns with the first priority of expanding with settlements and roads to maximize resource efficiency and VP gain.
LLM Response: **Action:** Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('BRICK', 'BRICK', 'BRICK', 'BRICK', 'WHEAT'))  
**Justification:** To maximize Victory Points efficiently, resources should be prioritized for building settlements and roads early, focusing on resource diversity. Your current resource inventory includes [0, 4, 3, 1, 0] (0 Brick, 4 Wood, 3 Sheep, 1 Wheat, 0 Ore). Wheat is required to build settlements and upgrade them to cities later. Maritime trading four Bricks (assuming that you are using the 4:1 trade ratio) for Wheat is the most impactful choice since Wheat is the scarcest resource you have and is crucial for settlement expansion and future upgrades. This move sets you up for the upcoming turn where you can utilize your remaining resources more strategically to build or expand efficiently.
LLM Response: Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)  
Justification: Based on the current game state, there are no resources to build settlements, roads, or cities, nor any other actionable options presented. Ending the turn is necessary to gather resources for future impactful actions. I would avoid ending turns unnecessarily, but in this situation, it's the only viable action to advance progress toward maximizing Victory Points.
LLM Response: **Action**: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

**Justification**: Rolling is the only available action in the current game state, and it allows the player to generate resources needed to work toward the first priority: expanding settlements and roads for resource diversity. With only [0, 1, 3, 2, 0] resources currently available, there are not enough to build a settlement or road (both of which require specific resource combinations). Rolling will replenish resources and potentially open up more impactful options on subsequent turns, such as building or upgrading.
LLM Response: Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)  
Justification: Based on the current game state, there are no actionable moves available apart from ending the turn. Your resources ([0, 1, 3, 2, 0]) are insufficient to build a settlement, upgrade a city, or construct a road. Ending the turn is a necessary step to gather more resources strategically from future rolls, enabling higher-impact moves that align with your priorities.
LLM Response: ### Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

### Justification:
Currently, the game state reflects that resources are relatively low, with [0, 2, 3, 2, 0], which limits options for pursuing major developments like settlements (requires 1 brick, 1 wood, 1 wheat, and 1 sheep) or cities (requires 3 wheat and 2 ore). Rolling the dice is essential to collect additional resources and proceed with impactful actions like building settlements or roads. The heuristic score for this action is 1, which indicates it is appropriate as the next strategic step.

This decision aligns with the game's priorities:
1. **Priority on Expansion:** Resource diversity is crucial for building settlements. Rolling allows us to gather resources to pursue this goal.
2. **Avoid Low-Impact Actions:** Rolling is the only action currently available that has the potential to unlock meaningful gameplay progress. Without additional resources, other impactful actions cannot be taken.
LLM Response: Action: None (No immediate action is recommended)

Justification: Based on the given game state, there are no available impactful actions to progress toward maximizing Victory Points (VP). The only available action, ending the turn, has a low heuristic score (1) and does not contribute to resource diversity, settlement expansion, or city upgrades. To make an optimal decision aligned with the priorities, we must wait for more resources or opportunities to arise in the next turn that allow progression toward VP-efficient moves, such as building settlements, roads, or upgrading settlements to cities. Ending the turn remains necessary to advance the game state.
No valid action found in LLM response.
LLM response ambiguous or invalid. Defaulting to fallback mechanism.
Fallback: Chose action Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None) based on priority order.
LLM Response: Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)  
Justification: Rolling is the most optimal action at the moment because it generates resources, which are necessary to build settlements, roads, and cities—key elements for maximizing Victory Points and progressing in the game. With your current resource pool ([0, 3, 3, 2, 0]), you lack critical resources like wood or grain needed for building settlements, making resource generation through rolling the logical next step to expand your options and advance your priorities.
LLM Response: **Action**: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUY_DEVELOPMENT_CARD: 'BUY_DEVELOPMENT_CARD'>, value=None)

**Justification**: Purchasing a development card has a heuristic score of 7, which indicates its strategic importance for this turn. Development cards could contribute directly to Victory Points through cards like Victory Point cards, or indirectly by providing benefits such as knights for Largest Army or progress cards for resource boosts. Since expanding settlements or upgrading to cities is currently unavailable due to insufficient resources, buying a development card is the most impactful action to optimize VP growth and retain a competitive strategic position. Ending the turn without any action would waste an opportunity to leverage your current resources effectively.
LLM Response: Action: **Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)**  
Justification: Unfortunately, no impactful actions are currently listed in the game state that allow for the expansion of settlements, construction of roads, or upgrades to cities. Ending the turn is necessary to collect new resources from future rolls, enabling advancement toward higher-priority objectives such as building settlements and roads to expand resource diversity or upgrading settlements to cities for higher VP returns. Although ending the turn is a low-impact action, it is currently the only option available, and progressing toward accumulating resources will allow for better moves in subsequent turns.

================================== Ai Message ==================================

After Running The New foo_player.py Player, Here is my analysis and findings:

### Scores of FooPlayer:
- Wins: 1  
- Average Victory Points (VP): 5.33  
- Average Settlements: 2.67  
- Average Cities: 0.0  
- Average Roads: 0.33  
- Average Largest Army: 0.33  
- Average Development VP: 1.33  

### Short Analysis of Game Output:
- **Interesting Observations**:
  - The LLM responses include detailed justifications for actions such as "MOVE_ROBBER" and "BUY_DEVELOPMENT_CARD" that emphasize strategy but fail to yield impactful results to improve VP significantly.
  - Maritime trading and Knight plays are occasionally emphasized but lack meaningful progression in VP or resource diversity.
  - Fallback mechanisms (e.g., defaulting to "END_TURN") frequently activated due to ambiguous or invalid LLM responses.

### Warnings or Signs of Player Implementation Error:
- **LLM Ambiguity or Parsing Failures**: Logs repeatedly highlight ambiguous LLM responses leading to fallback actions, which undermines strategic progression.
- **Resource Management Issues**: Persistent inability to balance resources effectively is evident, hampering settlement and city building.
- **Strategic Gaps**: High-focus actions like "BUILD_SETTLEMENT" appear inadequately prioritized or are infeasible. Cities were not built in any game, indicating significant shortcomings in the scoring mechanism and resource focus.
