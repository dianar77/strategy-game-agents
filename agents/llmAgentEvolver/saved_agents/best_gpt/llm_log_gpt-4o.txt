After Running The New foo_player.py Player, Here is my analysis and findings:

### Scores of FooPlayer:
- Wins: 0
- Average Victory Points (VP): 2.0
- Average Settlements: 2.0
- Average Cities: 0.0
- Average Roads: 0.0
- Average Largest Army: 0.0
- Average Development VP: 0.0

### Short Analysis of Game Output:
- The phrase "Choosing First Action on Default" repeated throughout the log suggests that the implementation is defaulting to selecting the first action without strategy. 
- Results indicate poor performance compared to the opponent, with no victories achieved in the 3-game session. 

### Errors, Warnings, or Signs of Implementation Issues:
- **Implementation Warning**: The log shows "Choosing First Action on Default" continuously, indicating that the `decide` method is not leveraging the LLM integration (`self.llm.query_llm`) for decision-making.
- **Gameplay Warning**: The score disparity (2 VP versus 10 VP for the opponent) and the lack of progression in Cities, Roads, and Largest Army metrics highlight a lack of strategy execution.

================================ Human Message =================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Improve the performance of the `FooPlayer.py` by introducing intelligent strategy logic that leverages the LLM for decision-making. Specifically, aim for a minimum win count of 1 within the next 5 iterations while improving VP, settlements, and measurable gameplay metrics.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Address the issue of the `decide` method defaulting to selecting the first action. Integrate the LLM's `query_llm` functionality to intelligently evaluate actions based on state and strategy.

CHOSEN AGENT: CODER

AGENT OBJECTIVE: 
The current implementation of `FooPlayer` is defaulting to selecting the first action, as evidenced by the repeated log message "Choosing First Action on Default." Modify the `decide` method to leverage the `self.llm.query_llm` functionality for decision-making. Specifically:

1. Replace the current first-action default with an implementation that:
   a. Obtains a list of possible actions from the game state.
   b. Queries the LLM (`self.llm.query_llm`) for the evaluation of these actions.
   c. Selects the most intelligent action based on the LLM's evaluation.

2. Ensure the decision logic is robust and includes handling scenarios such as:
   - No valid actions available.
   - LLM providing ambiguous or conflicting guidance (fallback mechanisms).

3. Include clear comments and logging to observe how the LLM is influencing decision-making.

Once done, provide the modified code to be tested.
In Node: CODER
================================ Human Message =================================

CODER

### Changes Made:
1. **Replaced Default Action Selection**:
   - Removed the hardcoded `return playable_actions[0]` that selected the first action by default.

2. **Integrated LLM Decision-Making in `decide`**:
   - Constructed a comprehensive prompt using the `_build_prompt` function to provide the LLM with game state and available actions.
   - Queried the LLM using `self.llm.query_llm(prompt)`.
   - Parsed the LLM's response using the `_parse_llm_response` function to select the most appropriate action from the available options.

3. **Added New Helper Methods**:
   - `_build_prompt`: Constructs a prompt by including the current game state and the list of playable actions.
   - `_parse_llm_response`: Interprets the LLM's response to match it with one of the playable actions. If no match is found, defaults to the first action.

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Included error handling for cases where the LLM query fails or returns an ambiguous response. In such cases, the method defaults to selecting the first action.
   - Added logging to show the LLM's response (`print(f"LLM Response: {llm_response}")`) and fallback mechanisms.

5. **Logging and Debugging**:
   - Added print statements for better debugging and observation:
     - Log when no playable actions are available.
     - Log the LLM's raw response.
     - Log if the response is ambiguous or invalid, and the fallback action is selected.

### Notes for the Next Iteration:
- **Prompt Details**: The current `_build_prompt` function makes a basic serialization of the game state and actions. If the LLM struggles to prioritize or understand the game details, refining this prompt may be necessary.
- **LLM Error Responses**: If runtime timing issues with `query_llm` arise (e.g., long delays or failures), adjustment of query limits or timeouts may be needed.

### Testing Recommendations:
- Test how the LLM chooses actions in various scenarios to verify that the parsing logic aligns with actual gameplay.
- Monitor logs (`LLM Response: ...`) for unexpected behaviors or ambiguous responses.

- Average Settlements: 2.33  
- Average Cities: 0.33  
- Average Roads: 0.0  
- Average Largest Army: 0.0  
- Average Development VP: 0.33  

### Short Analysis of Game Output:
- The LLM consistently failed to provide valid or actionable responses: "LLM response ambiguous or invalid. Defaulting to first action."
- FooPlayer defaulted to the first available action in all scenarios instead of executing strategic decisions.
- The performance difference is stark: FooPlayer had no wins and significantly lower VP compared to AlphaBetaPlayer.

### Errors, Warnings, or Signs of Implementation Issues:
- **LLM Integration Issue**: LLM responses are not being parsed correctly or are poorly generated, leading to fallback actions ("Defaulting to first action").
- **Decision-Making Deficiency**: The lack of strategic outcomes (e.g., 0 roads, 0 Largest Army) suggests serious shortcomings in action planning and execution.
- **Repeated Logs**: Multiple instances of ambiguous LLM responses point to insufficient prompt design or response parsing mechanism in `_parse_llm_response`.

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Develop a robust strategy execution mechanism that effectively leverages the LLM for decision-making. The aim is to improve FooPlayer's win count and strategic metrics, including roads, cities, and army contributions, while ensuring VP increases consistently over the iterations.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Address the LLM integration issue by refining the prompt construction in `_build_prompt` and improving the parsing logic in `_parse_llm_response`. Ensure valid and actionable responses are obtained and utilized for strategic decision-making.

CHOSEN AGENT: STRATEGIZER

AGENT OBJECTIVE: 
The LLM responses are ambiguous or invalid, causing the FooPlayer to revert to default fallback actions. This suggests that the strategy design or LLM integration is insufficiently aligned with achieving optimal gameplay outcomes. 

Please provide 5 new strategy options that could address these key deficiencies:
1. How to design prompts to make the LLM understand the game state and prioritize optimal actions more effectively.
2. Ideas for alternative fallback mechanisms if the LLM fails to provide valid responses.
3. Strategies to temporarily compete with AlphaBetaPlayer while testing LLM refinement, using deterministic or semi-deterministic rules.
4. Methods of integrating game-specific heuristics to guide the LLM's responses.
5. Suggestions for benchmarking the LLM's decision-making quality against predefined rule-based logic. 


In Node: STRATEGIZER
================================ Human Message =================================

STRATEGY:

### 1. Designing Effective Prompts
The LLM query prompt construction should be more specific and structured to guide LLM decision-making effectively:
- **Segmented Contextual Prompting**: Break down the game state into key elements like resource availability, victory point progression, and opponent analysis. Use explicit headers, such as:
  ```
  Current Game State:
  - Player Stats: {resources}, {road_length}, {settlements}, {cities}, etc.
  - Opponent Stats: {resource_blockades}, {army_strength}, etc.
  - Goal: Maximize VP by using optimal actions considering available resources and the board state.
  ```
- **Action Explanation Request**: Explicitly require the LLM to provide a rationale for its decision:
  ```
  Respond with the optimal action and briefly justify your reasoning (e.g., maximizing resource gain or blocking opponent's road expansion).
  Example response structure:
  Action: {Chosen Action}
  Justification: {Rationale for Decision}
  ```

---

### 2. Alternative Fallback Mechanisms
Introduce enhanced fallback strategies when LLM returns invalid or ambiguous responses:
- **Priority Filtering**: Analyze the playable actions and prioritize the highest-value action types based on static strategic criteria:
  ```python
  if ActionType.BUILD_CITY in [action.action_type for action in playable_actions]:
      return next(action for action in playable_actions if action.action_type == ActionType.BUILD_CITY)
  ```
- **Deterministic Action Flow**: Create a ranked hierarchy of action preferences:
  1. Build City
  2. Build Settlement
  3. Build Road
  4. End Turn
  When the LLM fails, actions are chosen following this hierarchy.

---

### 3. Strategies to Compete With AlphaBetaPlayer During Testing
To reduce dependency on the LLM when aiming for immediate competitiveness:
- **Simplistic Economic Strategy**: Implement deterministic rules to prioritize resource gathering and expansion, focusing on settlement and city building to optimize resource production.
- **Blocking Mechanism**: Develop routines to block high-value paths or settlement spots for opponents while maintaining growth.
- **Pre-defined Decision Trees**: Temporarily hard-code a simple decision tree for strategy execution, emphasizing actions like:
  - If Victory Points >= threshold, prioritize defensive moves.
  - Else, expand aggressively towards high VP goals.

---

### 4. Integrating Game-Specific Heuristics to Guide the LLM
Provide the LLM with board knowledge by embedding heuristic calculations into the prompt:
- **Heuristic Scoring in Prompts**: Add metrics like road potential, resource diversity, and opponent growth advantage:
  ```
  Heuristic Scores:
  - Settlement Value: {calculated_value}
  - City Upgrade Value: {calculated_value}
  - Road Extension Value: {calculated_value}
  Prioritize the action with the highest heuristic score.
  ```
- **Guided Options List**: For each action, append a descriptive note:
  ```
  Here are the actions ranked by value:
  - Action A (Heuristic Value: 15.2): This blocks Player 2's longest road and increases your resource income.
  - Action B (Heuristic Value: 14.5): Upgrades a settlement to a city for 2 VP gain.
  ```

---

### 5. Benchmarking LLM Performance Against Rule-Based Logic
Establish a structured evaluation method to measure LLM's decision performance:
- **Simulated Competitive Runs**: Pair LLM-based FooPlayer with deterministic or AlphaBetaPlayer and track metrics (wins, VPs, strategic goals).
- **Monte Carlo Testing**: Run thousands of simulations where the LLM's actions are compared against a preset rule engine's results to assess decision quality in various scenarios.
- **Action Matching**: Create a dataset of optimal moves in given scenarios (based on historical game trends or AlphaBetaPlayer’s performances) to compare how often LLM decisions align with the "ground truth."
- **Score Weighting Metrics**:
  - Victory Point Contribution: Percentage of decisions that lead directly to VP gain.
  - Opponent Blocking: Success rate in disrupting opponent strategies.
  - Resource Utilization: Effective use of collected resources to maximize VP.
  
---

### Next Steps:
If necessary, prioritize implementing improved fallback mechanisms and basic decision trees first to ensure immediate competitiveness. Gradually integrate advanced decision-making systems via guided prompts and heuristic evaluations as LLM refinement continues.

END STRATEGY.
In Node: meta
================================ Human Message =================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Transition FooPlayer into a competitive player over the next 5 iterations by leveraging enhanced strategy, including heuristic reinforcement, refined LLM prompts, and deterministic fallback mechanisms, and targeting measurable improvements in average VP and win rates.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Implement **segmented contextual prompting** and heuristic-enhanced decision-making into the LLM integration (as per Strategy 1 and 4). Additionally, integrate a **ranked action hierarchy** as a fallback mechanism (Strategy 2).

CHOSEN AGENT: CODER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:  
Modify the `decide` method of `FooPlayer.py` to achieve the following:

1. **Refined LLM Prompt**: 
   - Update the `_build_prompt` function to use **segmented contextual prompting**. Include headers that describe the game state, available resources, and strategic goals. Example structure:
     ```
     Current Game State:
     - Player Stats: {resources}, {settlements}, {cities}, VP: {victory_points}
     - Opponent Stats: {opponent resources/blockades}, etc.
     Goal: Maximize VP while taking advantage of the current game state.
     Available Actions: {list of formatted playable actions}
     Respond with:
     Action: {Selected optimal action}
     Justification: {Reasoning behind the action choice}
     ```

2. **Heuristic Context Integration**:
   - In the `_build_prompt` method, compute heuristic scores (e.g., settlement value, city upgrade value, road extension value) for each action. Integrate these scores into the prompt to help the LLM make better decisions.

3. **Fallback Mechanism**:
   - Enhance `_parse_llm_response` to implement a **ranked action hierarchy** fallback mechanism when the LLM output is invalid or ambiguous. Example hierarchy:
     - Priority Order: Build City > Build Settlement > Build Road > End Turn.
     - If a valid option matching the LLM response is not found, return the first valid action in this priority order.

4. **Logging**:
   - Improve logging to capture the heuristic scores, the LLM prompt, its raw response, and the fallback decision (when necessary) for post-game analysis.

Once complete, test the updated `FooPlayer.py`, run games, and report the results.
In Node: CODER
================================ Human Message =================================

CODER

### Changes Made:
1. **Refined LLM Prompt Construction**:
   - Enhanced the `_build_prompt` function to use **segmented contextual prompting** with detailed headers for game state, player stats, opponent stats, and available actions.
   - Integrated **heuristic scores** for each action into the prompt to guide the LLM decision-making.

2. **Heuristic Computation Method**:
   - Added a `_compute_heuristic_scores` helper method to assign heuristic values to each action based on action type (e.g., city-building prioritized over road-building).

3. **Improved Parsing Logic**:
   - Enhanced `_parse_llm_response` to return a matching action from the LLM response, or delegate to the fallback mechanism if no match is found.

4. **Ranked Fallback Mechanism**:
   - Implemented `_fallback_action` to evaluate actions in a priority order: Build City > Build Settlement > Build Road > End Turn.
   - Default to the first action only when no prioritized options exist.

5. **Logging**:
   - Added print statements throughout to capture key debugging information:
     - The LLM prompt.
     - Heuristic scores of actions.
     - The LLM's raw response.
     - Logs for fallback mechanism use.

6. **Error Handling Enhancements**:
   - Integrated robust exception handling in the `decide` method for LLM failures, with clear logging of fallbacks.

### Notes for the Next Iteration:
- Tune the **heuristic scores** if the LLM's decisions align poorly with optimal strategies.
- Monitor how well the LLM responds to the enhanced prompt structure during testing.
- Evaluate the fallback mechanism's efficiency in comparison to the LLM's responses.

### Testing Recommendations:
- Focus on scenarios requiring diverse strategic goals (e.g., blocking opponent moves, building towards Largest Army).
- Analyze logs for patterns in ambiguous or ineffective LLM responses, and refine prompts or fallback heuristics accordingly.

After Running The New foo_player.py Player, Here is my analysis and findings:

### Syntax Error Details:
- **Error Message**: `AttributeError: 'Game' object has no attribute 'get_player_resources'`
- **Exact Line Number**: Line 84 in `foo_player.py`
- **Exact Line of Code**: `resources=str(game.get_player_resources(Color.BLUE)),  # Example method to get resources`

### Root Cause:
The method `get_player_resources` is being called on the `Game` object, but it does not exist in the `Game` class, leading to an `AttributeError`. This indicates a mismatch between the game's API and the implementation in `foo_player.py`.

### Impact:
The syntax error prevents the game from running, and thus no game results were recorded for this evolution.

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Refactor FooPlayer to work seamlessly with the Catanatron API while continuing to enhance strategic decision-making via heuristic integration and LLM refinement. Achieve compatibility and avoid critical runtime errors in the next evolution to allow for testing and evaluation.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Resolve the `AttributeError` by ensuring that `foo_player.py` uses valid methods from the Catanatron `Game` class for retrieving player resources and other game state data. Validate the compatibility of all API calls in the `_build_prompt` method.

CHOSEN AGENT: RESEARCHER

AGENT OBJECTIVE: 
Identify the correct way to access the following game state information from the Catanatron API:
1. Player resources (e.g., wood, brick, grain, etc.) for a specific color (e.g., `Color.BLUE`).
2. Obtain other player and game statistics that might be relevant for building the LLM prompt (e.g., settlements, cities, roads, VP).
3. Provide a list of valid Game API methods and properties that could be helpful for efficiently querying such state details.

Ensure that the information provided directly addresses the API compatibility issues in `foo_player.py`.
In Node: RESEARCHER
================================ Human Message =================================

RESEARCH:

#### Key Information on Accessing Game State Using Catanatron API

**1. Accessing Player Resources**
To retrieve resources (e.g., wood, brick, grain, etc.) for a specific player:
- Use the `get_player_freqdeck(state, color)` function, which provides the player's resource frequency deck.
  ```python
  from catanatron.state_functions import get_player_freqdeck
  player_resources = get_player_freqdeck(state, Color.BLUE)
  ```
- `player_num_resource_cards(state, color, resource)` can query the count for specific resources:
  ```python
  from catanatron.state_functions import player_num_resource_cards
  wood_count = player_num_resource_cards(state, Color.BLUE, "WOOD")
  ```

**2. Accessing Player and Game Statistics**
For settlements, cities, roads, and VP:
- **Settlements**: Use `get_player_buildings(state, color, "SETTLEMENT")` to retrieve settlement IDs of a player:
  ```python
  from catanatron.state_functions import get_player_buildings
  settlements = get_player_buildings(state, Color.BLUE, "SETTLEMENT")
  ```
- **Cities**: Similarly invoke `get_player_buildings(state, color, "CITY")` for city IDs:
  ```python
  cities = get_player_buildings(state, Color.BLUE, "CITY")
  ```
- **Roads Available**: Check roads available using state data:
  ```python
  player_key = player_key(state, Color.BLUE)
  roads_available = state.player_state[f"{player_key}_ROADS_AVAILABLE"]
  ```
- **Victory Points**: Victory points can be checked via:
  ```python
  victory_points = state.player_state[f"{player_key}_ACTUAL_VICTORY_POINTS"]
  ```

**3. General Game State Statistics**
The class `Game` contains the main API-level functions for interacting with game state, including:
- `play_tick()` to advance the game state.
- `winning_color()` to retrieve the player currently winning the game.
- `state.playable_actions` to list the valid actions at the current step.

```python
winning_player = game.winning_color()
playable_options = game.state.playable_actions
```

#### List of Useful Methods and Properties in Game API:
Valid methods within the `Game` class and associated functions:
- `get_player_freqdeck(state, color)` – Retrieves player's resources.
- `player_num_resource_cards(state, color, resource)` – Gets the count for specific resources.

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Ensure functionality and compatibility of FooPlayer with the Catanatron API while strengthening the LLM decision-making mechanism in a way that improves strategic performance over the next 5 iterations.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Integrate valid Catanatron API calls into `foo_player.py`'s `_build_prompt` method to fetch relevant game data like resources, settlements, cities, roads, and victory points, and resolve the current `AttributeError` preventing gameplay.

CHOSEN AGENT: CODER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:  
Resolve the `AttributeError` by replacing invalid calls in `foo_player.py` with Catanatron-compatible API calls as outlined in the research:

1. **Resources**:
   - Replace `game.get_player_resources(Color.BLUE)` with `get_player_freqdeck(state, Color.BLUE)` to fetch all resources for FooPlayer.
   - Use `player_num_resource_cards(state, Color.BLUE, resource)` to query specific resource counts.

2. **Settlements and Cities**:
   - Replace invalid calls for settlements/cities with:
     ```python
     get_player_buildings(state, Color.BLUE, "SETTLEMENT")
     get_player_buildings(state, Color.BLUE, "CITY")
     ```

3. **Victory Points and Roads**:
   - Retrieve victory points using:
     ```python
     vp = state.player_state[player_key(state, Color.BLUE) + "_ACTUAL_VICTORY_POINTS"]
     ```
   - Roads remaining:
     ```python
     roads_available = state.player_state[player_key(state, Color.BLUE) + "_ROADS_AVAILABLE"]
     ```

4. **General Updates to `_build_prompt`**:
   - Adjust the prompt to include all valid game stats, ensuring Catanatron API calls function.
   - Include resource counts, settlements, cities, roads, and VP in the formatted prompt structure.

5. **Debugging and Validation**:
   - Add logging to verify data retrieval accuracy during gameplay for resources, actions, and VP.
   - Run a test evolution to confirm the absence of runtime errors.

Update the code to reflect these changes and provide detailed debug logs during testing for validation.

### Changes Made:
1. **Replaced Invalid API Calls**:
   - Substituted `game.get_player_resources(Color.BLUE)` with `get_player_freqdeck(state, Color.BLUE)` to correctly fetch resources.
   - Similar replacements made for settlements, cities, victory points, and roads using valid Catanatron API functions: 
     - `get_player_buildings(state, Color.BLUE, "SETTLEMENT")` and `get_player_buildings(state, Color.BLUE, "CITY")` for settlements and cities.
     - Victory points accessed via `state.player_state[f"{player_key(state, Color.BLUE)}_ACTUAL_VICTORY_POINTS"]`.
     - Roads available via `state.player_state[f"{player_key(state, Color.BLUE)}_ROADS_AVAILABLE"]`.

2. **Updated `_build_prompt` Method**:
   - Included new resource and state-fetching methods in the prompt template.
   - Enhanced formatting to make the prompt explainable and consistent with the desired LLM input structure.

3. **Improved Compatibility**:
   - Refactored the game state integration in `_build_prompt` to align with valid methods reliably compatible with the API.

4. **Debugging Enhancements**:
   - Added detailed logging via print statements to verify accurate state data retrieval during gameplay (resources, settlements, cities, heuristic scores).
   - Included error handling for invalid or mismatched LLM responses.

### Notes for the Next Iteration:
- Test how well the new prompt structure works with the LLM's decision-making.
- Monitor logs for resource/state-fetch accuracy and potential mismatches between heuristic scores and LLM responses.

### Testing Recommendations:
- Verify that resources, settlements, cities, and other player stats from the state align with the game's current state through debugging outputs.
- Check if the fallback mechanism handles invalid or ambiguous LLM responses efficiently.

After Running The New foo_player.py Player, Here is my analysis and findings:

### Scores of FooPlayer:
- Wins: 0  
- Average Victory Points (VP): 2.33  
- Average Settlements: 1.67  
- Average Cities: 0.33  
- Average Roads: 0.0  
- Average Largest Army: 0.0  
- Average Development VP: 0.0  

### Short Analysis of Game Output:
- **LLM Interaction**: The LLM responded consistently, but gameplay justification often involved executing mandatory or default actions (e.g., "ROLL" and "END TURN"), suggesting limited strategic depth.
- **Interesting Output**: The heuristic scoring mechanism categorizes actions clearly, but no significant changes to gameplay performance reflect deeper strategy execution.
- **Signs of Issue**: No roads or army development indicates repeated failure to invest strategically in growth areas, despite consistent heuristic scoring.

### Errors, Warnings, or Signs of Implementation Issues:
- **Strategic Weakness**: The absence of victories and poor metrics like roads and army raises concerns about the decision-making quality. 
- **Heuristic Misalignment**: High heuristic scores for actions like "BUILD_ROAD" occasionally appear in the logs but fail to translate into meaningful gameplay progression.

================================ Human Message =================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Enhance the decision-making of FooPlayer by refining the strategic priorities directly implemented in both the heuristic framework and LLM prompt responses. Aim to improve measurable metrics such as roads, army, and settlements while moving closer to achieving winning conditions over the next 5 iterations.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Address the strategic weaknesses by introducing a deeper integration of heuristic priorities into the fallback mechanism and improving the clarity in LLM prompt responses to focus on VP growth, road-building, and settlements.

CHOSEN AGENT: STRATEGIZER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:  
Generate 5 improved strategies to address the current shortcomings:
1. Improvements to heuristic scoring that prioritize growth areas (e.g., building roads, achieving Largest Army).
2. Suggestions to alter fallback mechanisms to emphasize strategic contributions (e.g., prioritize roads early-game or settlements near resource-heavy tiles).
3. Refined LLM prompt designs that explicitly guide actions toward VP growth and strategic dominance.
4. Ideas to balance resource accumulation and strategic investments (e.g., cities vs roads) to diversify objectives.
5. Approach to identifying action bottlenecks that lead to stagnation (e.g., repeated patterns of "END TURN" or inefficient action sequences).
In Node: STRATEGIZER
================================ Human Message =================================

STRATEGY:

### 1. Improvements to Heuristic Scoring
Enhance heuristic scoring to align with strategic growth objectives and quantify the value of actions more effectively:
- **VP-Oriented Scoring**: Add a multiplier for actions directly contributing to Victory Points (e.g., upgrading to cities or building settlements on high-value intersections).
  ```python
  if action.action_type == ActionType.BUILD_SETTLEMENT and action.location.resource_value > threshold:
      heuristic_scores[action] = 10 + action.location.resource_value
  elif action.action_type == ActionType.BUILD_CITY:
      heuristic_scores[action] = 15
  elif action.action_type == ActionType.BUILD_ROAD:
      heuristic_scores[action] = 5 + len(connected_resources)
  ```
- **Dynamic Game Stage Consideration**: Assign higher scores to actions like building roads or settlements in the early game, shifting to cities and army card purchases in later stages based on available resources and board state.
- **Opponent Disruption**: Include metrics for actions that block opponents’ extensions or resource monopolies, such as cutting off road expansions.

---

### 2. Fallback Mechanism Adjustments
Revise the fallback mechanism to prioritize actions that align with broader strategic objectives:
- **Early-Game Priorities**:
  1. **Roads**: Emphasize road-building to expand quickly and secure settlement sites early (calculate heuristic road priority based on proximity to key tiles, e.g., 8/6/9 tiles).
  2. **Settlements**: Focus on openings that increase resource diversity and resource flow.
  ```python
  if len(settlements) < 3 and ActionType.BUILD_SETTLEMENT in actions:
      return next(action for action in actions if action.action_type == ActionType.BUILD_SETTLEMENT)
  ```
- **Late-Game Priorities**:
   - Transition to cities or army card purchases while only building roads/settlements to secure Longest Road or block opponents.
- **Secondary Metrics**:
   - Consider an aggregate utility metric (e.g., resource spillover from connected tiles) to decide between fallback paths.

---

### 3. Refined LLM Prompt Design
Re-orient the LLM prompt to place greater emphasis on VP growth and strategic objectives:
- **Structured Guidance**:
  ```
  You are tasked with growing Victory Points (VP) towards winning conditions. Prioritize actions that directly lead to VP growth (e.g., building settlements/cities or creating roads if expanding settlements is possible). Additionally, consider blocking opponents’ expansion and achieving Longest Road or Largest Army. Here are the factors to consider:
  - VP contributions: How does this action increase Victory Points?
  - Resource optimization: Does this action improve resource variety or frequency?
  - Opponent impact: Does this action hinder opponents?
  ```
- **Action Context and Justification**: Force the LLM to evaluate and justify its decision explicitly with VP and strategic metrics as criteria:
  ```
  Action: {Chosen Action}
  VP Contribution: {Describe how this action contributes to Victory Points or other winning conditions (Longest Road, Largest Army, etc.)}
  Strategic Justification: {Explain why this action is optimal in your current state.}
  ```

---

### 4. Balancing Resource Accumulation and Strategic Investments
Introduce a dynamic system to balance competing objectives like upgrading cities versus building roads:
- **Resource Thresholds**:
   - Maintain a minimum resource reserve (e.g., 3 bricks and 3 wood) for road-building during the early game.
   - Shift to reserving ore and wheat when cities are needed in the late game.
  ```python
  if resources['brick'] > 2 and resources['wood'] > 2 and ActionType.BUILD_ROAD in actions:
      return build_road_action
  elif resources['ore'] > 3 and resources['wheat'] > 2 and ActionType.BUILD_CITY in actions:
      return build_city_action
  ```
- **Investment Diversification**:
   - Build roads as placeholders if resources for settlements or cities are insufficient, keeping future options open.
   - Introduce a trigger to prioritize development cards if no immediate high-value options exist.

---

### 5. Identifying Bottlenecks and Inefficiencies
Implement mechanisms to evaluate and eliminate stagnation in decision-making:
- **Action Tracking**:
  - Track patterns of repetitive actions (e.g., 3 consecutive END TURN actions) and trigger specific re-evaluations for resource optimization or blocking moves.
  - Introduce a "resource stall threshold": If surplus resources accumulate beyond a predefined number, focus on spending them, even on sub-optimal actions.
- **Post-Action Evaluation**:
  - After every game session, log actions with their outcomes (e.g., Did this action result in VP gain or resource improvement?).
  - Use decision heatmaps to identify action sequences that correlate with stagnation (e.g., prolonged road-building with no settlements).
- **Dynamic Decision Adjustment**:
  - Adjust scoring to aggressively penalize repetitive non-contributory actions.
  ```python
  if "END TURN" repeats more than twice:
      print(f"Repeated END TURN actions detected. Prioritizing an alternative action.")
      # Force expansion or development actions here.
  ```

---

### Next Steps:
1. Prioritize enhancing heuristic scoring to drive better early-game performance.
2. Adjust fallback mechanisms to emphasize forward-looking strategies like settlement preparation.
3. Integrate bottleneck detection mechanisms for iteration feedback and adapt the LLM query structure for immediate impact.

END STRATEGY.

================================ Human Message =================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Implement a strategy that improves both early and late-game decision-making for FooPlayer through advanced heuristics, adjusted fallback mechanisms, and refined LLM prompts, achieving measurable improvements in metrics such as roads, settlements, and victory points.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Integrate enhanced heuristic scoring and dynamic fallback priorities into the decision flow while refining LLM responses for strategic action selection, focusing on VP growth and efficient resource use.

CHOSEN AGENT: CODER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:  
Modify FooPlayer to implement the strategies outlined in the five key areas. Specifically:

1. **Enhance Heuristic Scoring**:
   - Add multipliers for actions directly contributing to Victory Points, such as settlement building and city upgrading.
   - Dynamically adjust scores based on the game stage (early vs. late-game priorities), prioritizing roads and settlements early while focusing on VP-heavy actions late.

2. **Dynamic Fallback Mechanism**:
   - Revise the fallback mechanism to focus on early-game expansion via roads and settlements as placeholders for resource diversity and VP accumulation.
   - Later transition fallback logic to VP-centric actions like city upgrades and development cards.

3. **Refined LLM Prompt**:
   - Update the LLM prompt to emphasize VP growth explicitly.
   - Demand justification for actions based on Victory Points and strategic blocking of opponents.

4. **Resource Threshold Balancing**:
   - Introduce logic for maintaining resource reserves and diversifying investments based on available actions.
   - Trigger placeholder actions like road-building when strategic objectives are temporarily unattainable.

5. **Action Bottleneck Detection**:
   - Implement tracking logic for repetitive unproductive actions (e.g., repeated "END TURN").
   - Adjust decision scoring to discourage stagnation, forcing resource spending or defensive actions when necessary.

Make necessary modifications to the `decide` method and auxiliary functions like `_build_prompt` and `heuristic_scores`. Run a test iteration post-implementation to ensure that the changes positively impact FooPlayer performance.

   - Adjusted scores dynamically based on roads remaining and game phase.

2. **Dynamic Fallback Priorities**:
   - Modified `_fallback_action` to prioritize actions strategically based on early vs. late-game aims.
   - Incorporated a priority order that promotes building cities, settlements, and roads.

3. **Refined LLM Prompt**:
   - Expanded the prompt to focus on VP, resource diversity, and opponent impact.
   - Included heuristic scores for LLM guidance and decision alignment.

4. **Improved Error and Response Handling**:
   - Enhanced `_parse_llm_response` to handle ambiguous LLM outputs.
   - Included detailed print logs during fallback decisions.

### Next Steps:
- Test the updated `FooPlayer` against increasingly challenging opponents to evaluate performance.
- Monitor logs, especially during fallback actions, for adjustments to scoring weights or LLM alignment.
- Incrementally refine heuristic values and prompt details based on test outcomes.

After Running The New foo_player.py Player, Here is my analysis and findings:

### Scores of FooPlayer:
- Wins: 0  
- Average Victory Points (VP): 2.6666666666666665  
- Average Settlements: 1.3333333333333333  
- Average Cities: 0.6666666666666666  
- Average Roads: 0.0  
- Average Largest Army: 0.0  
- Average Development VP: 0.0  

### Short Analysis of Game Output:
- **Repetitive Logs**: Multiple instances of LLM responses defaulting to basic actions such as "ROLL" and "END TURN," with justifications suggesting limited strategic depth. Example: "Rolling is necessary to progress the game state."
- **Neutral Heuristic Scoring**: Actions often evaluated with a low heuristic score (`1`). This indicates the heuristic system fails to differentiate between strategic actions.
- **Misalignment**: High-priority actions like "BUILD_CITY" or "BUILD_SETTLEMENT" seem underutilized, despite occasional high heuristic scores visible in logs. 

### Errors, Warnings, or Signs of Implementation Issues:
- **LLM Integration Weakness**: Responses imply poor decision quality by prioritizing roll/end-turn actions excessively. This indicates the prompt design and parsing mechanisms need refinement.
- **Strategic Gaps**: Failure to build roads or utilize army resources, even across multiple turns, suggests severe strategic deficiencies. The game log reinforces these gaps.
- **Warning**: Logs frequently state "Fallback mechanism applied," implying reliance on basic action prioritization rather than effective LLM outputs.

1. Refactoring heuristics to better differentiate and prioritize optimal actions (e.g., building roads, settlements, and cities).
2. Revising the LLM prompt design to explicitly prioritize non-default, VP-centric, and impactful actions.
3. Adjusting the fallback mechanism to penalize repetitive default actions and ensure meaningful progression.

CHOSEN AGENT: STRATEGIZER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:  
Provide 5 specific refinements or new strategies to improve FooPlayer’s decision-making system, focusing on the following:
1. How to recalibrate heuristic scoring to strongly favor foundational growth actions like roads and settlements early on.
2. Techniques to adjust prompt design to directly steer the LLM away from repetitive or low-value default actions.
3. Criteria for dynamically detecting high-impact actions (strategic bottlenecks or game pivots) and encouraging the LLM or fallback decision to prioritize them.
4. Hybrid mechanisms blending determinate strategic templates for fallback actions alongside heuristic-driven flexibility.
5. Methods to evaluate and tune the heuristic scoring weights and LLM response handling over multiple evolutions, ensuring consistent improvement in strategic metrics.
In Node: STRATEGIZER
================================ Human Message =================================

STRATEGY:

### 1. Recalibrating Heuristic Scoring for Early Foundational Growth
Refine the heuristic scoring system to prioritize foundational growth actions, particularly during the early game:
- **Dynamic Weight Adjustments for Game Stages**:
  - **Early Game**:
    - Roads: Score 10 (high priority for expansion).
    - Settlements: Score 8 (emphasize resource diversity and availability).
    - Cities: Score 5 (lower priority due to resource scarcity early on).
  - **Mid to Late Game**:
    - Settlements: Score 10 (needed for reaching VP thresholds).
    - Cities: Score 15 (maximize VP by converting settlements to cities).
    - Roads: Score 7 (focus on Longest Road or movement towards strategic settlement spots).  
- **Tile Resource Heuristic**:
  - Assign weighted scores to actions based on resource tile priority:
    - High-Value Tiles: Prioritize intersections with tiles like 6, 8 (ore/wheat bonuses), increasing the heuristic scores of these actions.
    ```python
    if action.action_type == ActionType.BUILD_SETTLEMENT and action.location.resource_value > 15:
        heuristic_scores[action] += 3  # Boost for high-value tiles
    ```
- **Disruption Consideration**:
  - Actions that block opponent growth (road connections or settlements) receive a bonus.

---

### 2. Adjusting Prompt Design to Guide the LLM Towards High-Impact Actions
Update the LLM prompt construction to explicitly penalize repetitive or low-value actions and focus on strategic, VP-driving goals:
- **Segmented Descriptions with Action Prioritization**:
  ```
  You are tasked with making the most impactful move in the Catanatron Minigame. Always prioritize actions with long-term strategic benefits over short-term results. Avoid repetitive, low-impact actions like ending turns without building to progress.
  
  Current Priorities:
  1. Expand settlements and roads for resource variety and VP growth.
  2. Upgrade settlements to cities to maximize VP.
  3. Act to hinder opponents’ expansion when possible.
  
  Consider the following heuristic scores and game state in your decision:
  ```
  - Add structured fields for each action to explicitly indicate their heuristic weight, stage relevance, and potential impact:
    ```
    Action: {Action}
    Heuristic Score: {Score}
    Stage Priority: {Early/Mid/Late Game Relevance}
    Impact: {How this action will improve VP or hinder opponents}
    ```

---

### 3. Dynamic Detection of High-Impact Actions (Bottlenecks or Game Pivots)
Introduce dynamic logic to identify and prioritize high-impact actions during pivotal game moments:
- **Bottleneck Identification**:
  - Detect signs of resource stagnation or unspent resources (e.g., excessive ore/wheat without city upgrades or brick/wood without roads/settlements).
  ```python
  if player_resources['brick'] >= 3 and player_resources['wood'] >= 3:
      heuristic_scores[ActionType.BUILD_ROAD] += 5  # Encourage spending surplus
  ```
  - Time-based triggers: Penalize repeated "END TURN" or fallback actions and boost the use of active building moves.
- **Strategic Pivot Boosting**:
  - Add bonuses to actions when triggered by game-specific pivots:
    - Longest Road: Encourage roads when near the threshold for Longest Road.
    - Largest Army: Prioritize development card purchases when competing for Largest Army or sabotaging opponents.
    ```python
    if current_army_size >= 2 and opponents_army_size <= current_army_size:
        heuristic_scores[action] += 4  # Edge out Largest Army
    ```

---

### 4. Hybrid Mechanisms for Fallback Actions
Redesign the fallback system to incorporate both deterministic templates and heuristic-driven flexibility:
- **Action Templates by Priority**:
  - Use deterministic logic based on game stage:
    - Early Game: Build roads and settlements to ensure resource coverage.
    - Mid-Late Game: Prioritize cities for VP growth or roads for Longest Road.
  ```python
  for action_type in ["BUILD_CITY", "BUILD_SETTLEMENT", "BUILD_ROAD"]:
      for action in playable_actions:
          if action.action_type == action_type and action meets_conditions:
              return action
  ```
- **Heuristic-Fallback Hybrid**:
  - If no deterministic action is suitable, rely on heuristic priorities derived from current state evaluations to make fallback decisions.
- **Penalty for Stagnation**:
  - Penalize fallback repetitions by gradually increasing the weight on impactful actions like settlement-building or resource diversity improvements.

---

### 5. Methods to Evaluate and Refine Heuristics and LLM Response Handling
Design a structured framework for tuning heuristics and refining LLM responses over multiple game iterations:
- **Performance Metrics**:
  - Track metrics such as VP growth per iteration, total roads/cities/settlements built, and resource efficiency (unused resources).
  - Correlate LLM responses and fallback heuristic effectiveness with game outcomes.
- **Iterative Weight Adjustment**:
  - Analyze N-game results to adjust heuristic weights dynamically:
    - If too many roads are built without follow-up settlements, reduce road priority.
    - If city upgrades lead to stagnation due to resource imbalances, shift the weighting back to settlements.
  ```python
  if settlements_built < expected_settlement_threshold:
      heuristic_weights['BUILD_SETTLEMENT'] += 2
  ```
- **Benchmarking Against Rule-Based Baselines**:
  - Compare LLM-driven decisions with predefined optimal or rule-based actions to evaluate alignment with strategic goals.
  - Use deviation scores to identify areas where LLM prompts need refinement (e.g., under-prioritizing Largest Army or Longest Road).

---

### Next Steps:
1. Begin recalibrating heuristic scores to reflect stage-specific priorities.
2. Implement the updated prompt design to explicitly guide LLM responses toward non-repetitive, VP-centric strategies.
3. Integrate fallback mechanisms with dynamic, bottleneck-based adjustments to address stagnation and repeated default actions.
4. Build tools for iterative heuristic tuning and response evaluation against predefined baselines.

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Over the next 5 iterations, implement and refine a system that better aligns FooPlayer's heuristic evaluation, LLM prompt design, and fallback mechanisms towards impactful, VP-driven actions. Aim for measurable improvements in foundational metrics like roads, settlements, and cities.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Recalibrate FooPlayer's heuristic scoring system to implement stage-specific priorities and dynamically address bottlenecks, ensuring better alignment between heuristic-driven actions and LLM output. Update the LLM prompt design to explicitly focus on VP growth and reduce low-value decision patterns.

CHOSEN AGENT: CODER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:  
Update `foo_player.py` as follows:

1. **Enhanced Heuristic Scoring**: 
    - Modify `_compute_heuristic_scores` to include stage-specific priorities:
      - Early-game boosts for roads and settlements.
      - Late-game emphasis on cities and development cards.
    - Include dynamic bottle-neck handling, e.g.:
      - Reward actions that address resource buildup or stagnation.
      - Encourage actions that disrupt opponents (e.g., blocking roads/settlements).
    - Use tile values (6, 8, etc.) to boost settlement scores for strategic intersections.

2. **Refined LLM Prompt**:
    - Update `_build_prompt` with stronger emphasis on guiding actions toward VP and strategic goals:
      - Enumerate priorities explicitly: building roads, settlements, cities.
      - Include heuristic scores in the prompt with descriptions of why actions are valuable.
      - Penalize repetitive actions like "END TURN" through explicit discouragement in the prompt.

3. **Fallback Mechanism Adjustment**:
    - Introduce deterministic templates for stage-specific fallback actions:
      - Early-game: Prioritize roads and settlements for expansion.
      - Late-game: Focus on cities and VP-centric actions.
    - Dynamically adapt fallback decisions based on resource surplus or game state bottlenecks.
    ```python
    if player_resources["brick"] >= 3 and player_resources["wood"] >= 3:
        heuristic_scores[ActionType.BUILD_ROAD] += 5
    ```

4. **Action Bottleneck Detection**:
    - Add detection for repetitive or stagnating actions (e.g., unspent resources or repeated "END TURN").
    - Penalize stagnation by prioritizing resource expenditure and spatial expansion.

Upon completing the updates, test the revised player for functional improvements in decision-making, focusing on roads, settlements, and overall strategic progression.

### Updates to `foo_player.py`:
1. **Enhanced Heuristic Scoring**:
   - Integrated stage-specific priorities (e.g., roads and settlements emphasized early-game, cities in mid-late game).
   - Added bonuses for high-resource tiles in settlement actions.
   - Introduced penalties to address resource bottlenecks (e.g., surplus brick/wood triggers road-building incentives).
   - Incorporated logic to dynamically adjust scores based on resource availability and VP contributions.

2. **Refined LLM Prompt**:
   - Redesigned `_build_prompt` to better guide the LLM:
     - Explicit priorities for strategic actions based on Victory Point (VP) growth.
     - Highlighted roadmap for early-game road/settlement building and late-game upgrades.
     - Discouraged repetitive or non-impactful actions like unnecessary turns.
   - Included heuristic scores in the prompt, with explanations for why certain actions are prioritized.

3. **Dynamic Fallback Mechanism**:
   - Structured fallback logic to prioritize actions based on game state:
     - Early-game: Roads and settlements.
     - Late-game: Cities and VP-centric actions.
   - Updated fallback mechanism to prevent stagnation by using deterministic templates blended with heuristic-driven conditions.

4. **Bottleneck and Surplus Resource Handling**:
   - Added logic to detect and dynamically handle situations where surplus resources exist (e.g., incentivizing road-building on excess brick/wood).
   - Increased priority for settlement or city building to resolve resource stagnation.

5. **Improved Logs**:
   - Added meaningful print statements across key decision-making steps to facilitate debugging:
     - Fallback actions.
     - Detected bottlenecks or resource imbalances.
     - LLM responses (and when fallback mechanisms are triggered).

### Testing Suggestions:
- **Evaluate Decision Quality**:
  - Test early-game actions for expansion focus (roads and settlements).
  - Verify mid-to-late game actions prioritize cities and VP-centric plays.
- **Monitor Bottleneck Response**:
  - Simulate resource-rich scenarios to observe if surplus resources are properly spent.
- **Validate Fallback Logic**:
  - Conduct games where the LLM fails or incorrectly parses the prompt to assess fallback success.
- **Track Metrics**:
  - Compare average VP, settlements, and city counts across multiple iterations to previous versions.

### Next Steps:
- Refine heuristic weights after testing to balance strategic trade-offs.
- Incorporate feedback cycles to analyze and further tune prompt alignment with heuristic evaluations.
- Observe repetitive "END TURN" penalties and ensure they improve game progression.

After Running The New foo_player.py Player, Here is my analysis and findings:

### Syntax Error Details:
- **Error Message**: `AttributeError: 'Action' object has no attribute 'location'`
- **Exact Line Number**: Line 90 in `foo_player.py`
- **Exact Line of Code**: `score = 8 + (3 if action.location.resource_value > 15 else 0)`

### Root Cause:
The `Action` class used in the code does not have an attribute `location`. This issue arises within the `_compute_heuristic_scores` method when attempting to access non-existent properties of the `Action` object.

### Impact:
This syntax error prevents the game from running, leading to no recorded results or scores for this evolution.

Let me know if you need anything else!

================================ Human Message =================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Ensure FooPlayer's compatibility with the Catanatron API by resolving syntax errors and accurately utilizing the `Action` class attributes. Stabilize gameplay to allow evaluation of performance metrics over the next five iterations.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Fix the `AttributeError` by removing invalid references to the nonexistent `location` property in the `Action` class. Correct the scoring logic in `_compute_heuristic_scores` and replace erroneous calls with valid attributes from the `Action` class or game state.

CHOSEN AGENT: RESEARCHER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:  
Investigate the valid attributes and methods available in the `Action` class within the Catanatron API. Specifically:
1. Determine how to access the location or resource value associated with an action (if applicable).
2. Provide documentation or examples on other valid attributes of `Action` that might be relevant for heuristic scoring.
3. If no direct way exists to link `Action` to resource tiles or locations, suggest alternative ways to retrieve this context from the `Game` or `State` class for heuristic calculations.

Ensure the information is precise and actionable to debug and resolve the issue effectively.
In Node: RESEARCHER
================================ Human Message =================================

RESEARCH:

### Investigation of the `Action` Class and Related Attributes
The `Action` class is part of the core mechanics for handling user actions during the gameplay. Here's the context based on the files:

#### 1. Valid Attributes of the `Action` Class
The `Action` class is defined and utilized in multiple modules. Its attributes are:
- **`color`**: Represents the player's color (e.g., `Color.BLUE`).
- **`action_type`**: Identifies the type of action (e.g., `ActionType.BUILD_SETTLEMENT`, `ActionType.PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD`).
- **`value`**: The specific content of the action based on its type. For example:
  - `Build actions` (`BUILD_SETTLEMENT`, `BUILD_CITY`) use `value` to represent the node location (`node_id`). 
  - `BUILD_ROAD` uses an `edge` object as its `value`.
  - In `MOVE_ROBBER`, `value` is a tuple such as `(coordinate, robbed_color, robbed_resource)`.

Attributes cannot directly reference nonexistent properties, such as `location`.

#### 2. Documentation and Examples of Related Action Types
Key samples of `Action` usage based on the context:
- **Action Initialization**:
  ```python
  Action(color, ActionType.BUILD_SETTLEMENT, node_id)
  Action(color, ActionType.MOVE_ROBBER, (coordinate, enemy_color, resource))
  Action(color, ActionType.ROLL, dice_roll_result)
  ```
- **Examples of Valid `ActionType` Values**:
  - Actions related to resource handling: `ROLL`, `MARITIME_TRADE`, `PLAY_YEAR_OF_PLENTY`, `PLAY_MONOPOLY`.
  - Building-related actions: `BUILD_ROAD`, `BUILD_SETTLEMENT`, `BUILD_CITY`.
  - Development cards and robber actions: `PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD`, `MOVE_ROBBER`.

#### 3. Accessing Location and Resource Context for an `Action`
The `Action` class itself does not store location or resource details unless explicitly set using the `value` attribute.

##### Alternatives for Accessing Context:
- **From the Game State (`State` Class)**:
  - To retrieve the current player's buildings (settlements, roads, etc.) or check surroundings:
    ```python
    buildings = state.buildings_by_color[Color.BLUE]
    settlements = buildings[SETTLEMENT]
    cities = buildings[CITY]
    ```
  - To get adjacent resource tiles for a node:
    ```python
    adjacent_tiles = state.board.map.adjacent_tiles[node_id]
    resources = [tile.resource for tile in adjacent_tiles if tile.resource is not None]
    ```
  - To get the bank's resource availability:
    ```python
    state.resource_freqdeck  # Bank’s current resources
    ```

- **Using `Action.value` for Specific Action Contexts**:
  In specific cases like building or moving, `Action.value` already provides relevant location-like data:
  - For building roads: Retrieve edges with `Action.value`.
  - For building settlements/cities: Use `node_id` from `Action.value`.

#### 4. Valid Methods for Game and State Interactions
Key methods/functions from the `Game` and `State`:
- **`Game` Class**:
  - `play_tick()`: Executes one game tick.
  - `winning_color()`: Returns the player currently winning the game.
  - `execute(action: Action)`: Executes a given action for a player.
  
- **`State` Class**:
  - `state.playable_actions`: Returns a list of actions currently available.
  - `state.board.buildable_node_ids(color)`: Returns node IDs where the player can build.
  - `state.player_state`: Dictionary containing details for each player (e.g., `Color.BLUE_CITIES_AVAILABLE`, `Color.BLUE_HAS_ROLLED`).

---

##### Additional Notes:
If there is a dependency on parsing `location` or `tile` data, it should instead rely on `Action.value` explicitly or query the `State` for adjacent tiles or positions as outlined above.

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Ensure compatibility with the Catanatron API by appropriately integrating valid attributes of the `Action` class and utilizing game state data to enhance decision-making. Achieve stable functionality for testing strategic performance over the next 5 iterations.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Correct the `AttributeError` by refactoring `foo_player.py` to rely on valid `Action.value` attributes or query relevant context from the `State` class for heuristic scoring. Ensure all references to `location` are replaced with valid methods to retrieve positional or resource data.

CHOSEN AGENT: CODER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:
Refactor `foo_player.py` to address the syntax error and improve heuristic scoring:

1. **Fix Invalid References**:
   - Replace all calls to the nonexistent `action.location` with queries to `Action.value` or `State` methods.
   - Example adjustments:
     ```python
     if action.action_type == ActionType.BUILD_SETTLEMENT and len(state.board.map.adjacent_tiles[action.value]) > threshold:
         heuristic_scores[action] += 3
     ```
     Here, `action.value` provides the node ID where the settlement would be built.

2. **Context Retrieval from State**:
   - For actions like `BUILD_SETTLEMENT` or `BUILD_CITY`, retrieve adjacent tiles and their resource values using `state.board.map.adjacent_tiles[action.value]`.
   - For roads, use `Action.value` to access edge information and query connected tiles.

3. **Heuristic Scoring Enhancements**:
   - Incorporate valid context details from the state or action attributes to refine heuristic scoring:
     - High-value tiles should boost settlement scores:
       ```python
       adjacent_resources = [tile.resource for tile in state.board.map.adjacent_tiles[action.value] if tile.resource is not None]
       resource_bonus = sum(tile.value for resource in adjacent_resources)
       heuristic_scores[action] += resource_bonus
       ```

4. **Debugging and Validation**:
   - Ensure all invalid references are replaced with valid calls.
   - Add debug print statements to verify successful access to `Action.value` or state functions during gameplay.

Once refactoring is complete, test FooPlayer to confirm it runs without errors and demonstrate functional heuristic scoring improvements.

### Summary of Changes:
1. **Fixed `AttributeError`**:
   - Replaced invalid references to `action.location` with valid attribute and context retrieval using `action.value` and game state methods (e.g., accessing `state.board.map.adjacent_tiles` for settlement scoring).

2. **Improved Settlement Scoring**:
   - Enhanced `_compute_heuristic_scores` to calculate bonuses for settlements based on adjacent tiles' resource values using `state.board.map.adjacent_tiles[action.value]`.

3. **Resource Bottleneck Handling**:
   - Retained logic for surplus brick/wood to incentivize road-building.

4. **Improved Debugging**:
   - Added specific print statements during fallback and heuristic computation to verify logic.

5. **Dynamic Heuristic Refinements**:
   - Settlement scoring dynamically adjusts based on adjacent tile values, improving action prioritization.

### Testing Plan:
- Verify that the game runs without errors.
- Validate heuristic score calculations for settlements and roads using logs.
- Test gameplay performance:
  - Early-game: Expansion (settlements and roads).
  - Late-game: City-building and VP growth.

Let me know if the updated player behaves as expected or requires further refinements.

After Running The New foo_player.py Player, Here is my analysis and findings:

### Syntax Error Details:
- **Error Message**: `AttributeError: 'LandTile' object has no attribute 'value'`
- **Exact Line Number**: Line 92 in `foo_player.py`
- **Exact Line of Code**: `tile.value for tile in adjacent_tiles if tile.resource is not None`

### Root Cause:
The `LandTile` class does not have a `value` attribute as assumed in `_compute_heuristic_scores`. This error occurs when attempting to calculate resource bonuses for building settlements based on adjacent tiles.

### Impact:
The syntax error prevents the game from running, resulting in no recorded game results or player performance data for this evolution.

Let me know if you need anything else!

================================ Human Message =================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Ensure compatibility with the Catanatron API and eliminate syntax errors by properly accessing attributes of the `LandTile` class and adjacent tiles during heuristic scoring. Stabilize gameplay for functional testing and iterative improvements in performance metrics.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Correct the error by replacing the incorrect reference to `tile.value` with valid calls to extract resource-related attributes or other properties from the `LandTile` class. Fully debug and ensure the heuristic scoring function runs smoothly without errors.

CHOSEN AGENT: RESEARCHER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:  
Investigate the `LandTile` class and its valid attributes. Specifically:
1. Identify what attributes or methods the `LandTile` class provides for retrieving resource-type or strategic value data.
2. Provide guidance on how to properly compute bonuses for adjacent tiles when building settlements or roads.
3. Suggest alternative approaches if direct resource value computation from `LandTile` is not viable.  

Ensure the information is actionable and tailored for correcting the heuristic scoring computations.

### Investigating Attributes and Methods of the `LandTile` Class
The `LandTile` class and associated structures define the core elements of gameplay tiles in the Catanatron framework. Here's a breakdown of the relevant components:

---

### **1. Valid Attributes of `LandTile`**
The `LandTile` class provides the following attributes:
- **`id`**: A unique identifier for the land tile.
- **`resource`**: The resource type for the tile (e.g., `WOOD`, `BRICK`, `WHEAT`, `SHEEP`, `ORE`, or `None` for desert tiles).
- **`number`**: The number associated with the tile (dice roll probability value). `None` indicates desert tiles.
- **`nodes`**: A dictionary where the keys are `NodeRef` values (relative positions like `NORTH`, `SOUTH`) and the values are `node_id`s.
- **`edges`**: A dictionary mapping `EdgeRef` (edge directions) to edge IDs.

Example usage:
```python
tile_id = land_tile.id
tile_resource = land_tile.resource  # e.g., WOOD
tile_number = land_tile.number  # e.g., 8 for a high-probability tile
tile_nodes = list(land_tile.nodes.values())  # Get the node IDs
tile_edges = list(land_tile.edges.values())  # Get associated edges
```

---

### **2. Calculating Bonuses or Context from Adjacent Tiles**
To compute heuristic bonuses from adjacent tiles when assigning strategic values for settlements or roads:

#### 2.1 Accessing Adjacent Tiles
The `CatanMap` object maintains an auxiliary structure for adjacent tiles:
- **`CatanMap.adjacent_tiles`**: Maps `node_id` to a list of `LandTile` objects surrounding that node.
  ```python
  adjacent_tiles = game.state.board.adjacent_tiles[node_id]
  for tile in adjacent_tiles:
      resource = tile.resource
      probability = tile.number_probability(tile.number)
      print(f"Adjacent tile {tile.id}: Resource={resource}, Probability={probability}")
  ```

#### 2.2 Computing Resource Production
You can estimate the cumulative production at a node based on resource probabilities of adjacent tiles:
- **`CatanMap.node_production`**: Maps `node_id` to a `Counter` of resource probabilities.
  ```python
  resource_production = game.state.board.node_production[node_id]
  # Example format: Counter({WOOD: 0.25, BRICK: 0.12})
  ```

---

### **3. Alternative Approaches if Direct Resource Value is Not Possible**
When direct computation is unavailable, use a combination of these methods:
- **Resource Contributions from Tiles**: Use `CatanMap.adjacent_tiles` and `LandTile.resource` or `LandTile.number`.
  ```python
  adjacent_tiles = game.state.board.adjacent_tiles[node_id]
  resource_values = [tile.resource for tile in adjacent_tiles if tile.resource]
  ```

- **Dice Roll Probability**: Use `number_probability()` on a tile’s `number`.
  ```python
  from catanatron.models.map import number_probability
  dice_probability = number_probability(tile.number)  # Roll chance for the tile
  ```

- **Ports and Trading Context**: If ports matter (e.g., for heuristic value), access via:
  ```python
  ports = game.state.board.port_nodes  # Get port mappings
  ```

---

### **Actionable Guidance for Heuristic Scoring**
To integrate this into the heuristic computation:
1. Replace `tile.value` in `_compute_heuristic_scores` with access to `tile.resource` or `tile.number`.
   ```python
   resource = tile.resource  # WOOD, BRICK, etc.
   probability = number_probability(tile.number)  # Dice probability
   ```
2. For adjacent tile context at `node_id`, query `game.state.board.adjacent_tiles`.
   ```python
   adjacent_tiles = game.state.board.adjacent_tiles[node_id]
   for tile in adjacent_tiles:
       if tile.resource is not None:
           resource_value = tile.resource
           probability = number_probability(tile.number)
   ```

---

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Ensure stable heuristic scoring for FooPlayer by correctly accessing valid attributes of `LandTile` and utilizing game state methods (e.g., `adjacent_tiles`) to compute bonuses for settlements and roads. Refine gameplay to support functional testing over the next 5 iterations.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Replace the incorrect reference to `tile.value` in heuristic scoring with valid queries to `tile.resource`, `tile.number`, and `number_probability()` to calculate bonuses for adjacent tiles when evaluating settlement actions.

CHOSEN AGENT: CODER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:
Refactor `foo_player.py` to fix the error and improve scoring calculations:

1. **Correct Tile Context Retrieval**:
   - Replace all calls to `tile.value` with queries to valid attributes of `LandTile`, such as `tile.resource` for resource type or `tile.number` for dice roll probability.
   - Use `game.state.board.adjacent_tiles[node_id]` to get tiles surrounding the node at which a settlement or city is to be built.
   - Example adjustment:
     ```python
     adjacent_tiles = game.state.board.adjacent_tiles[action.value]
     resource_bonus = sum(number_probability(tile.number) for tile in adjacent_tiles if tile.resource is not None)
     heuristic_scores[action] += resource_bonus
     ```

2. **Enhance Settlement Scoring**:
   - Calculate settlement scores dynamically based on cumulative resource probabilities from adjacent tiles (using `number_probability()` and `tile.resource`).
   - Adjust `_compute_heuristic_scores` to include valid resource bonuses:
     ```python
     for action in playable_actions:
         if action.action_type == ActionType.BUILD_SETTLEMENT:
             adjacent_tiles = game.state.board.adjacent_tiles[action.value]
             resource_bonus = sum(number_probability(tile.number) for tile in adjacent_tiles if tile.resource is not None)
             heuristic_scores[action] = 10 + resource_bonus
     ```

3. **Validate Heuristic Scoring**:
   - Ensure all logic runs smoothly, avoiding invalid calls or attributes.
   - Add debug print statements to log computed bonuses during gameplay.

Once implemented, test FooPlayer for functionality and measure changes in heuristic-driven decision-making across multiple iterations.

### Changes Made:
1. **Resolved `AttributeError`**:
   - Replaced previous invalid references to `tile.value` with `number_probability(tile.number)` from the `LandTile` class to compute bonuses based on tile probabilities.

2. **Updated Heuristic Scoring Logic**:
   - Settlement bonuses now dynamically evaluate adjacent tiles using `state.board.adjacent_tiles[action.value]`.
   - Bonuses are calculated based on valid attributes (`tile.resource` and `tile.number`) using `number_probability()`.

3. **Improved Resource Bottleneck Handling**:
   - Retained logic to incentivize road-building when brick and wood resources are in surplus.

4. **Debug Enhancements**:
   - Added clear print statements to log heuristic scores and fallback decisions.

### Notes for Testing:
- Confirm stability and functionality of the game simulation without syntax errors.
- Test heuristic scoring improvements, observing early-game settlement expansion and resource optimization.
- Validate fallback mechanism functionality when a valid LLM response is not received.

RESEARCH:

#### Key Mechanisms for Accessing Adjacent Tile Information
The `CatanMap` and `State` classes provide the primary ways to access data about the board, including adjacent tiles and node-specific contexts. For resolving the issue around the erroneous `state.board.adjacent_tiles` reference, here are the validated methods and alternative approaches:

---

### **1. Accessing Adjacent Tiles**
The `CatanMap` class explicitly maintains data structures for adjacent tiles via its `adjacent_tiles` attribute. 
- The `adjacent_tiles` attribute of `CatanMap` serves as a mapping:  
  **Key**: `node_id`  
  **Value**: `List[LandTile]` (all land tiles adjacent to the given node).  

#### Example:
```python
# Access adjacent tiles for a specific node
adjacent_tiles = game.state.board.map.adjacent_tiles[node_id]
for tile in adjacent_tiles:
    resource = tile.resource  # Resource type (e.g., WOOD)
    number = tile.number      # Probability number for the resource
```

---

### **2. Computing Node-Specific Resource Context**
To compute bonuses for a specific node based on adjacent resources, leverage the `node_production` attribute from `CatanMap`.  
- **`node_production`**: Maps `node_id` to a `Counter` of resource probabilities (combining adjacent tiles).

#### Example:
```python
# Retrieve resource production probabilities for a node
resource_production = game.state.board.map.node_production[node_id]

# Example output: Counter({WOOD: 0.25, BRICK: 0.16, WHEAT: 0.08})
print(resource_production)
```

This can be used to assess the strategic value of a node based on the likelihood of obtaining specific resources.

---

### **3. Suggested Fix for `_compute_heuristic_scores`**
To eliminate the invalid `state.board.adjacent_tiles` reference, you can replace it with calls to either `adjacent_tiles` or `node_production` depending on the calculation context. For heuristic-based evaluations:

#### Using `node_production` for Scoring:
```python
def _compute_heuristic_scores(node_id):
    # Retrieve node-specific production score
    resource_production = game.state.board.map.node_production[node_id]
    
    # Compute heuristic score based on production probabilities
    score = sum(
        resource_production[resource] * weight
        for resource, weight in RESOURCE_WEIGHTS.items()
    )
    return score
```

#### Using `adjacent_tiles` for Detailed Context:
```python
def _compute_heuristic_scores(node_id):
    # Access adjacent tiles directly for the node
    adjacent_tiles = game.state.board.map.adjacent_tiles[node_id]
    
    # Example: Evaluate based on resources and probabilities
    score = 0
    for tile in adjacent_tiles:
        if tile.resource is not None:
            probability = number_probability(tile.number)
            score += RESOURCE_WEIGHTS[tile.resource] * probability
    return score
```

- **Key Function**: `number_probability(tile.number)` computes the probability of rolling the tile's dice number. 

---

### **4. Other Methods for Alternative Contexts**
Additional utilities that may assist in resource evaluation include:
- **From `CatanMap`**:
  - `land_tiles`: Dictionary of all land tiles by coordinate.
  - `port_nodes`: Mapping of ports to associated nodes.
- **From `State`**:
  - `state.board.buildings`: Dictionary of buildings (e.g., settlements, cities) associated with node IDs.
  - `state.resource_freqdeck`: Provides information on bank resources.

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Leverage `CatanMap` utilities like `adjacent_tiles` and `node_production` to accurately compute node-specific resource bonuses for heuristic scoring. Stabilize FooPlayer to run without errors and refine its strategic behaviors.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Replace the invalid `state.board.adjacent_tiles` reference in `_compute_heuristic_scores` with a valid call to `game.state.board.map.adjacent_tiles` or leverage `node_production` for simplified resource-based scoring. Prioritize stability and alignment with Catanatron's API.

CHOSEN AGENT: CODER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:
Refactor `foo_player.py` to resolve the `AttributeError` and improve heuristic scoring:

1. **Correct Context Access**:
   - Replace the invalid `state.board.adjacent_tiles[action.value]` with valid methods:
     - Use `game.state.board.map.adjacent_tiles[action.value]` to retrieve adjacent tiles for the node (correcting the error).
     - Alternatively, use `game.state.board.map.node_production[action.value]` for precomputed resource probabilities at a node.

2. **Update Node-Specific Scoring Logic**:
   - If using `adjacent_tiles`, query each tile’s `resource` and `number` attributes and compute bonuses based on `number_probability(tile.number)`. Example:
     ```python
     adjacent_tiles = game.state.board.map.adjacent_tiles[action.value]
     resource_bonus = sum(number_probability(tile.number) for tile in adjacent_tiles if tile.resource is not None)
     ```
   - If using `node_production`, calculate a cumulative production score:
     ```python
     resource_production = game.state.board.map.node_production[action.value]
     resource_bonus = sum(resource_production[resource] * RESOURCE_WEIGHTS[resource] for resource in resource_production)
     ```

3. **Testing and Debugging Enhancements**:
   - Add debug print statements to verify retrieved tile data and computed scores.
   - Ensure heuristic-driven behaviors align with expected strategic priorities (e.g., roads, settlements, VP growth).

After implementing these changes, test FooPlayer for stability and validate heuristic-driven decision-making during game simulations.

The file `foo_player.py` has been successfully updated with the following adjustments:

### Changes Made:
1. **Replaced Invalid Reference to `adjacent_tiles`**:
   - Updated tile context retrieval in `_compute_heuristic_scores`:
     - Replaced the erroneous `state.board.adjacent_tiles` reference with `game.state.board.map.adjacent_tiles[node_id]`.

2. **Heuristic Scoring Enhancements**:
   - Corrected settlement scoring to calculate bonuses using probabilities of adjacent tiles (`number_probability(tile.number)`).
   - Dynamically computed resource bonuses for settlements based on adjacent tiles' resource values.

3. **Debugging Improvements**:
   - Retained existing debug statements to observe how heuristic scores were computed and fallback decisions were made.

### Testing Recommendations:
- **Functional Testing**:
  - Run the updated `FooPlayer.py` against opponents to confirm there are no runtime errors.
  - Validate that heuristic scores accurately calculate settlement and road bonuses based on adjacent tile contexts.
- **Performance Validation**:
  - Observe gameplay for early-game expansion (settlements, roads) and resource optimization.
  - Measure if dynamic fallback mechanisms align with expected strategic goals.

================================ Human Message =================================

After Running The New foo_player.py Player, Here is my analysis and findings:

### Syntax Error Details:
- **Error Message**: `TypeError: list indices must be integers or slices, not str`
- **Exact Line Number**: Line 105 in `foo_player.py`
- **Exact Line of Code**: `if player_resources['brick'] >= 3 and player_resources['wood'] >= 3:`

### Root Cause:
The `player_resources` object retrieved using `get_player_freqdeck` is a list, but the code treats it as a dictionary with string keys (e.g., `'brick'`, `'wood'`). This mismatch causes a `TypeError`.

### Impact:
The syntax error prevents the game from running, resulting in no recorded game results or player performance data for this evolution.

### Suggested Resolution:
Convert `player_resources` to a dictionary format, or properly access elements using integer indices if it is indeed a list.

Let me know if you need anything else!
In Node: meta
================================ Human Message =================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Ensure accurate resource handling by correctly accessing the `player_resources` object in the game framework, eliminating all resource-related syntax errors. Stabilize FooPlayer to enable functional testing and iterative evaluation of strategies.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Resolve the `TypeError` in the `_compute_heuristic_scores` function by identifying the correct format for `player_resources` and updating resource access logic accordingly (either dictionary keys or list indices).

CHOSEN AGENT: RESEARCHER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:  
Investigate the structure and format of the `player_resources` object as retrieved by the `get_player_freqdeck` function or similar mechanisms. Specifically:
1. Determine whether `player_resources` is a list, dictionary, or another format.
2. Identify valid methods or attributes to access specific resource quantities (e.g., brick, wood, etc.).
3. Provide examples or pseudocode for correctly accessing resource quantities and updating the faulty code section in `_compute_heuristic_scores`.

Ensure clarity and comprehensiveness in the findings to address the issue efficiently.
In Node: RESEARCHER
================================ Human Message =================================

RESEARCH:

### Structure and Format of `player_resources` Object
The `player_resources` object, as retrieved by the `get_player_freqdeck()` function in the `state_functions.py` file, is formatted as a **list**. Each entry represents the count of a specific resource type for the player. The order of resources in the list is consistent and predefined:
1. **Wood**
2. **Brick**
3. **Sheep**
4. **Wheat**
5. **Ore**

#### Example Usage:
```python
resources = get_player_freqdeck(state, Color.BLUE)

# Access specific resources
wood_count = resources[0]
brick_count = resources[1]
sheep_count = resources[2]
wheat_count = resources[3]
ore_count = resources[4]
```

---

### Valid Methods for Resource Access
Functions related to resource interactions (defined in `state_functions.py`):
1. **`get_player_freqdeck(state, color)`**: Returns a list with counts of the player's resources in the order `(WOOD, BRICK, SHEEP, WHEAT, ORE)`.
   
2. **`player_num_resource_cards(state, color, card=None)`**:
   - Retrieves the number of total resource cards if no `card` is specified.
   - If a specific resource (`card`) is provided (e.g., `WOOD`), it returns the count of that resource.
   ```python
   total_resources = player_num_resource_cards(state, Color.BLUE)
   wood_count = player_num_resource_cards(state, Color.BLUE, WOOD)
   ```

3. **`player_freqdeck_add(state, color, freqdeck)`**: Adds specified resources to the player's inventory.
   ```python
   freq_addition = [1, 2, 0, 0, 3]  # Adds 1 Wood, 2 Bricks, and 3 Ore
   player_freqdeck_add(state, Color.BLUE, freq_addition)
   ```

4. **`player_freqdeck_subtract(state, color, freqdeck)`**: Subtracts specified resources from the player's inventory.
   ```python
   freq_subtraction = [1, 0, 0, 1, 0]  # Removes 1 Wood and 1 Wheat
   player_freqdeck_subtract(state, Color.BLUE, freq_subtraction)
   ```

---

### Correcting `_compute_heuristic_scores`
#### Faulty Code Section:
Replace erroneous references to resource lookup mechanisms that assume dictionary-like or incorrect formats. The valid approach is indexing into the list returned by `get_player_freqdeck`.

#### Example Refactored Code:
```python
def _compute_heuristic_scores(state, color):
    # Retrieve player frequency deck (resources in hand)
    player_resources = get_player_freqdeck(state, color)

    # Example heuristic: prioritize wheat and ore for city-building
    wheat = player_resources[3]
    ore = player_resources[4]

    # Compute heuristic score based on resource availability
    score = wheat * 1.5 + ore * 2.0  # Weight Wheat: 1.5, Ore: 2.0
    return score
```

1. **`catanatron_core/catanatron/state_functions.py`**:
   - Full implementation of resource functions (e.g., `get_player_freqdeck`, `player_num_resource_cards`, `player_freqdeck_add`, `player_freqdeck_subtract`).

================================ Human Message =================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Ensure accurate resource management in `FooPlayer` by correctly using game framework methods to access and evaluate player resources, stabilizing the system for strategic improvement over the next evolutions.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Replace the incorrect dictionary-like reference (`player_resources['brick']`) with valid list-based indexing when accessing resource quantities. Update `_compute_heuristic_scores` to correctly evaluate resources using the resolved `player_resources` format.

CHOSEN AGENT: CODER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:
Refactor `foo_player.py` to fix the `TypeError` in `_compute_heuristic_scores`:

1. **Resource Retrieval**:
   - Replace the existing `player_resources['brick']` and `player_resources['wood']` references with valid list indices:
     - Brick: `player_resources[1]`
     - Wood: `player_resources[0]`

2. **Correct Scoring Logic**:
   - Adjust the conditional checks for resource availability (e.g., brick, wood) and ensure heuristic scores are calculated accurately using these list indices:
     ```python
     if player_resources[1] >= 3 and player_resources[0] >= 3:  # Brick and Wood
         heuristic_scores[action] += 5
     ```

3. **Testing Enhancements**:
   - Add print statements in `_compute_heuristic_scores` to log the retrieved resource counts and verify the heuristic decisions based on resource availability.

Once the refactoring is complete, test FooPlayer to ensure it runs without errors and validates the corrected resource handling logic.
In Node: CODER
================================ Human Message =================================

CODER

### Updates Applied:
1. **Fixed Resource Access Logic**:
   - Corrected resource indexing errors in `_compute_heuristic_scores`:
     - Replaced dictionary-like access with proper list indices for `player_resources` (e.g., `[0]` for wood and `[1]` for brick).
     - Ensured proper referencing for ore and wheat when computing development card scores.

2. **Correct Context Retrieval for Adjacent Tiles**:
   - Replaced incorrect `state.board.adjacent_tiles` with `game.state.board.map.adjacent_tiles[node_id]` for settlement scoring.
   - Verified correct tile-level bonuses using `number_probability(tile.number)`.

3. **Enhanced Heuristic Scoring**:
   - Refined settlement evaluation to dynamically compute resource bonuses based on tile probabilities of adjacent nodes.
   - Adjusted road-building heuristics to prioritize spending surplus brick and wood.

4. **Debug and Stability**:
   - Ensured functional fallback mechanisms for invalid or ambiguous LLM responses.
   - Added robust resource handling with fail-safe mechanisms to avoid runtime errors.

### Notes for Testing:
1. Ensure the game simulation runs without `TypeError` or similar errors.
2. Validate heuristic calculations during settlement and road-building to confirm alignment with strategic priorities.
3. Observe resource-based bottleneck handling and fallback mechanisms' behavior when LLM responses fail.

Let me know if further refinements are needed! END CODER

After Running The New foo_player.py Player, Here is my analysis and findings:

### Scores of FooPlayer:
- Wins: 0  
- Average Victory Points (VP): 6.0  
- Average Settlements: 0.0  
- Average Cities: 2.0  
- Average Roads: 0.0  
- Average Largest Army: 0.67  
- Average Development VP: 0.67  

### Short Analysis of Game Output:
- **LLM Interaction Success**: LLM consistently generated justifications and proposed actions, such as "TRADE," "BUY_DEVELOPMENT_CARD," and "END_TURN." Responses appeared logical in the context given but often led to suboptimal action in terms of progressing VP efficiently.
- **Interesting Observations**: Maritime trades for resource balancing (e.g., trading ore for wheat) were frequently proposed but failed to substantially impact settlement or city-building opportunities.
- **Performance Deficiency**: Despite coherent justifications, the actual game execution did not lead to strategic advancements. The player failed to build any settlements and only maintained cities, likely limiting resource diversity and overall performance.

### Warnings or Signs of Player Implementation Error:
- **Heuristic Scoring Issue**: Logs suggest heuristic scores are applied, but the scoring system itself appears misaligned with actionable priorities (e.g., settlements as highest priority). High-scored actions like "BUILD_SETTLEMENT" were not executed successfully, indicating a disconnection between scoring and feasibility.
- **Resource Bottleneck**: Repetitive logs highlight insufficient resources for impactful actions, emphasizing a failure in resource management or strategy execution.
- **Low-Impact Choices**: Many turns defaulted to fallback mechanisms or repetitive low-impact actions (e.g., "ROLL" and "END_TURN"), which hindered VP growth and progression.

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Refine FooPlayer's decision-making to prioritize impactful actions that directly progress toward Victory Points (VP), focusing on settlement building, resource optimization, and strategic expansion. Strengthen alignment between heuristic scoring and actionable priorities over the next five iterations.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Identify and address issues in heuristic scoring and decision prioritization in the next iteration by:
1. Reassessing the weights and functional calculations for settlement and road scoring in `_compute_heuristic_scores`.
2. Improving resource management strategies to resolve bottlenecks and enable impactful actions (e.g., settlements, cities).

CHOSEN AGENT: STRATEGIZER  

AGENT OBJECTIVE:  
Analyze current heuristic strategies implemented in FooPlayer and propose targeted refinements. Specifically:  
1. **Evaluate Existing Strategies**: Are settlements and resource optimization correctly prioritized in the gameplay heuristic scoring system?  
2. **Suggest Strategic Adjustments**: Recommend specific heuristic weight changes or new strategies to focus on building settlements and cities while resolving resource bottlenecks for impactful turns.  
3. **New Strategy Options**: Provide 3 strategy options to test next evolution focusing on VP progression, settlement building optimization, and adaptability during resource deficits.  

Ensure findings are actionable with direct implementations for the next FooPlayer iteration.
In Node: STRATEGIZER
================================ Human Message =================================

STRATEGY:

### 1. Evaluation of Existing Strategies
The current implementation of heuristic scoring shows a general prioritization of settlements and cities but could benefit from specific refinements:
- **Settlement Prioritization**:
  - Settlements score base value (8), plus bonuses derived from adjacent tile probabilities. This approach aligns well with maximizing resource diversity but lacks differentiation between high-value and mediocre locations (e.g., tiles with low number probabilities).
  - Resource optimization for settlements (e.g., ensuring prerequisite resources are available for building settlements) is missing.
- **City Prioritization**:
  - Cities have a fixed weight (15), correctly reflecting their importance for VP progression. However, there's no contextual adjustment to incentivize cities over settlements when the player already has sufficient settlements to move forward efficiently.
- **Resource Management Strategies**:
  - While surplus brick/wood are partially addressed in road scoring, the handling of ore/wheat surplus for cities or development cards could be improved. The current logic misses opportunities to detect potential bottlenecks due to imbalanced resource accumulation.

---

### 2. Recommended Strategic Adjustments
To better align heuristic scoring and resource management with impactful actions:
#### Settlement Scores:
- **Dynamic Weight Adjustments**:
  - Differentiate settlement scores based on adjacency to high-value tiles (numbers 6, 8) and resource variety. Increase base settlement score from **8 to 10**.
  - Penalize settlement building on locations adjacent to low-value tiles (e.g., number probabilities of 2 or 12). Apply a **-3 penalty**.
  ```python
  resource_bonus = sum(number_probability(tile.number) for tile in adjacent_tiles if tile.resource is not None)
  if sum(number_probability(tile.number) < 4 for tile in adjacent_tiles):
      resource_bonus -= 3  # Penalty for adjacency to low-value tiles
  score = 10 + resource_bonus
  ```

#### City Scores:
- **Stage-Sensitive Adjustments**:
  - Maintain a high fixed priority for cities (score: 15) but add conditions to reflect when cities should be deprioritized:
    - If fewer than 3 settlements exist, reduce priority to **7** to emphasize foundational growth.
    ```python
    if len(settlements) < 3:
        score = 7  # Cities deprioritized until sufficient settlements exist
    ```

#### Road Scores:
- **Expansion Utility**:
  - Increase road score (base: 10) under conditions where settlements can follow immediately:
    ```python
    if action.action_type == ActionType.BUILD_ROAD and adjacent_empty_spot(action.value):
        score += 5  # Boost road priority if it leads toward settlement expansion
    ```
  - Roads bucket excess resources efficiently (brick, wood), and handling this systematically prevents stagnation.

#### Resource Bottleneck Handling:
- **Ore-Wheat Surplus**:
  - Introduce bottleneck detection for ore/wheat surplus. Add incentives for buying development cards or building cities when thresholds are exceeded.
    ```python
    if player_resources[4] >= threshold_ore and player_resources[3] >= threshold_wheat:
        heuristic_scores[ActionType.BUY_DEVELOPMENT_CARD] += 7  # Encourages spending resources effectively
        heuristic_scores[ActionType.BUILD_CITY] += 5
    ```
- **Mixed Surplus Strategy**:
  - Fallback mechanism triggers to spend surplus resources on actions with lower weights if impactful actions cannot be immediately performed.

---

### 3. Strategy Options for Next Evolution
#### Strategy 1: Settlement Optimization
- **Core Heuristic Changes**:
  - Increase settlement base score to **10** and apply resource diversity penalties/bonuses (as indicated above).
  - Adjust road scoring to prioritize connections to high-value settlement spots.
- **Fallback Enhancements**:
  - Ensure settlement-building is prioritized over roads whenever both are possible and resources permit.
  ```python
  priority_order = [ActionType.BUILD_SETTLEMENT, ActionType.BUILD_CITY, ActionType.BUILD_ROAD]
  ```

#### Strategy 2: Bottleneck Resolution Framework
- **Resource Threshold Detection**:
  - Detect resource surplus (e.g., ore/wheat or brick/wood) and enforce actions to resolve bottlenecks systematically. Prioritize city upgrades when ore/wheat surplus is present, roads when brick/wood surplus is detected.
- **Heuristic Refinement**:
  - Introduce bottleneck bonuses:
    ```python
    if player_resources[1] >= 3 and player_resources[0] >= 3:
        heuristic_scores[ActionType.BUILD_ROAD] += 5
    ```
      
#### Strategy 3: VP Progression Focus via Cities
- **Stage-Based Adjustment**:
  - Prioritize cities while maintaining settlement-building logic for foundational growth. Integrate heuristic logic to reduce city scores if fewer than 3 settlements are present.
- **Development Card Backup**:
  - Actively prioritize buying development cards when cities/settlements cannot be built due to resource constraints.
  - Add fallback logic focused on achieving Largest Army or disrupting competitors.

---

### Next Steps:
1. Integrate settlement optimization logic and dynamic resource management to address stagnation.
2. Benchmark the proposed scoring adjustments and strategize actions to test across multiple game iterations.
3. Combine bottleneck resolutions and VP progression focus to ensure gradual, measurable improvements toward impactful gameplay outcomes.

END STRATEGY.
In Node: meta
================================ Human Message =================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Optimize heuristic-driven actions in FooPlayer by implementing refined settlement prioritization, resource bottleneck resolution mechanisms, and VP progression strategies. Test improvements to settlement, city, and road-building actions over the next five iterations.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Implement **Strategy 1: Settlement Optimization** in FooPlayer to improve gameplay by:
1. Diversifying settlement scores based on high/low tile probability and adjacency resource variety.
2. Adjusting road-scoring logic to prioritize building roads that enable potential settlement expansion.
3. Refining the fallback mechanism to prioritize substantive actions (settlements, cities, roads) over low-impact turns.

CHOSEN AGENT: CODER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:
Refactor `foo_player.py` to follow the directives of **Strategy 1: Settlement Optimization**:

1. **Dynamic Settlement Scoring**:
   - Increase settlement base score to 10.
   - Adjust scoring logic for settlements based on tile probability values and penalties for adjacent low-probability tiles. For example:
     ```python
     resource_bonus = sum(number_probability(tile.number) for tile in adjacent_tiles if tile.resource is not None)
     if sum(1 for tile in adjacent_tiles if number_probability(tile.number) < 4) >= 1:
         resource_bonus -= 3  # Penalize low-value locations
     heuristic_scores[action] = 10 + resource_bonus
     ```

2. **Improved Road Scoring**:
   - Increase road score if the road enables immediate or future settlement building. Example:
     ```python
     if action.action_type == ActionType.BUILD_ROAD and adjacent_empty_node(action.value):
         heuristic_scores[action] += 5  # Incentivize road near buildable settlement spots
     ```

3. **Prioritization Order**:
   - Implement fallback logic to prioritize impactful actions in this order:
     - Settlements > Cities > Roads > Development Cards > Trades.
     Add debug logs where fallback is triggered to ensure visibility into the decision-making process.

Once these changes are implemented, run the updated FooPlayer and measure its success across game simulations. Aim to validate settlement optimization and ensure alignment between heuristic scoring, resource availability, and strategic decision-making.

### Updates Applied:
1. **Enhanced Settlement Scoring**:
   - Increased base settlement score to 10.
   - Incorporated adjacency bonuses using `number_probability(tile.number)` and penalized low-value locations where probabilities were <4.

2. **Improved Road Scoring**:
   - Modified road scoring to prioritize roads enabling settlement expansion using the `_adjacent_empty_node` helper method.
   - Assigned higher scores (15) for road actions leading to potential settlement spots.

3. **Dynamic City Scoring**:
   - Adjusted city scores to prioritize foundational settlement growth by reducing city priority to 7 if fewer than 3 settlements exist.

4. **Resource Bottleneck Handling**:
   - Improved handling of surplus resources, adding bonuses for road-building when brick/wood are abundant.
   - Encouraged development card purchases during ore/wheat surplus periods.

5. **Adjacency Node Check**:
   - Added `_adjacent_empty_node` helper method to dynamically check for available settlement spots connected to proposed road-building actions.

6. **Fallback Improvements**:
   - Updated fallback mechanism to reflect the new prioritization order: settlements > cities > roads > development cards > low-impact actions.

7. **Debug Enhancements**:
   - Added logs to track decision-making and fallback actions for visibility into player strategy.

### Notes for Testing:
- Validate stability during gameplay to confirm the absence of runtime errors.
- Monitor strategic upgrades (e.g., settlement expansion, city-building prioritization) via logs.
- Evaluate performance improvements over previous iterations, focusing on VP progression and settlement counts.

GAME RESULTS:

LLM Response: Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_SETTLEMENT: 'BUILD_SETTLEMENT'>, value=22)

Justification: Building a settlement at position 22 is an optimal choice as it ranks among the highest heuristic scores (7.333333333333334), indicating strong resource diversity potential or strategic placement. Expanding settlements early aligns with the game's priority of maximizing resource collection and establishing a strong foundation for VP growth. Additionally, building at this position provides better strategic positioning to block opponents' progress and secure valuable intersections for future expansions.

AttributeError: 'CatanMap' object has no attribute 'adjacent_nodes'. Did you mean: 'adjacent_tiles'?
In Node: ANALYZER
================================ Human Message =================================

After Running The New foo_player.py Player, Here is my analysis and findings:

### Syntax Error Details:
- **Error Message**: `AttributeError: 'CatanMap' object has no attribute 'adjacent_nodes'. Did you mean: 'adjacent_tiles'?`
- **Exact Line Number**: Line 134 in `foo_player.py`
- **Exact Line of Code**: `adjacent_nodes = game.state.board.map.adjacent_nodes[edge_id]`

### Root Cause:
The `CatanMap` object does not have an attribute `adjacent_nodes`. The correct attribute appears to be `adjacent_tiles` as suggested in the error message. This occurs in the `_adjacent_empty_node` method, which is used for heuristic scoring to validate potential road connections.

### Impact:
The syntax error prevents the game simulation from running, resulting in no recorded game results or scores for this evolution. Additionally, this issue directly affects heuristic calculations and the decision-making process.

Let me know if you need anything else!

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Correct the handling of road adjacency logic in the `_adjacent_empty_node` method by replacing the invalid `adjacent_nodes` reference with a functional alternative. Restore FooPlayer's functionality and ensure accurate decision-making in road-building heuristics over the next iterations.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Investigate the proper mechanism or data structure in `CatanMap` for determining adjacent nodes to a specific edge (or road) and refactor `_adjacent_empty_node` to utilize this correctly.

CHOSEN AGENT: RESEARCHER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:  
Investigate and validate the correct way to determine adjacent nodes for a given edge (`edge_id`) in the Catanatron framework. Specifically:
1. Identify the correct attribute or method in `CatanMap` or related classes (e.g., `State`, `Game`) to retrieve adjacent node IDs for an edge.
2. Provide pseudocode or usage examples for constructing the `_adjacent_empty_node` function, ensuring functionality and alignment with the game framework.
3. Highlight if further adjustments are needed to accurately compute adjacent nodes for road-building heuristics.

Deliver actionable findings to directly resolve the AttributeError in `_adjacent_empty_node`.

### Addressing the Road Adjacency Logic in `_adjacent_empty_node`

#### **1. Valid Mechanism for Determining Adjacent Nodes to an Edge**
The `Board` and `CatanMap` classes provide data structures and methods for locating adjacent nodes to edges. Specifically:
- **`STATIC_GRAPH`** in `Board`: A `networkx.Graph` object representing all nodes and edges on the map. This graph supports queries to find neighbors of any node or edge.
- **`STATIC_GRAPH.neighbors(node_id)`**: Returns a generator of immediate neighbors for a specific `node_id`.
  ```python
  neighbors = STATIC_GRAPH.neighbors(node_id)
  ```

#### **2. Querying Adjacent Nodes for Road Placement**
For adjacent nodes along edges, you can:
1. Find the connected endpoints of an edge using the stored graph.
2. Invert the edge if necessary (`edge_id = tuple(sorted([node_a, node_b]))`) to account for directional representation.

#### Example for Retrieving Adjacent Empty Nodes:
- Query neighbors that are unoccupied (not yet built upon):
  ```python
  def _adjacent_empty_node(edge_id, board):
      adjacent_nodes = []
      for node in edge_id:  # Iterate over both nodes of the edge
          neighbors = STATIC_GRAPH.neighbors(node)
          # Filter empty nodes (no buildings)
          empty_neighbors = [
              neighbor for neighbor in neighbors 
              if neighbor not in board.buildings
          ]
          adjacent_nodes.extend(empty_neighbors)
      return adjacent_nodes
  ```

---

#### **3. Incorporating the Adjacency Logic in `_adjacent_empty_node`**
To correct the `_adjacent_empty_node` logic in `FooPlayer`, use the validated code structure:
- Reference the `Board.buildings` dictionary to check if a node is occupied (whether there’s a building present).
- Use `STATIC_GRAPH.neighbors(node_id)` to identify adjacent nodes.

#### Refactored Code:
```python
def _adjacent_empty_node(edge_id, board):
    """
    Finds empty nodes adjacent to the given edge.
    
    Args:
        edge_id (Tuple[int, int]): The edge defined by two node IDs.
        board (Board): Current game board state.
        
    Returns:
        List[int]: Node IDs of all adjacent empty nodes.
    """
    adjacent_nodes = []
    for node in edge_id:  # For both nodes of the edge
        neighbors = STATIC_GRAPH.neighbors(node)  # Get connected nodes
        # Check if the neighbor node is empty (no building present)
        empty_neighbors = [
            neighbor for neighbor in neighbors 
            if neighbor not in board.buildings
        ]
        adjacent_nodes.extend(empty_neighbors)  # Add empty nodes to result
    return adjacent_nodes
```

---

#### **4. Alternative Approaches**
If `STATIC_GRAPH` is unavailable, you can reconstruct adjacency logic using board's `map` attributes:
1. Retrieve `node_id` pairs directly from `CatanMap` edge-to-node mapping:
   ```python
   def _adjacent_empty_node(edge_id, board):
       node_a, node_b = edge_id
       empty_nodes = []
       for node in (node_a, node_b):
           adjacent_nodes = [
               n for n in board.map.land_nodes
               if n != node and n not in board.buildings
           ]
           empty_nodes.extend(adjacent_nodes)
       return empty_nodes
   ```
2. This method is slower but works without `networkx` dependencies.

================================ Human Message =================================

MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Ensure the stability and functionality of FooPlayer by implementing corrected adjacency logic for `_adjacent_empty_node`, enabling accurate road-building heuristics that prioritize settlement expansion.

LOW LEVEL GOAL: Refactor `_adjacent_empty_node` in `foo_player.py` to use `STATIC_GRAPH.neighbors` for valid adjacency checks, ensuring empty nodes are correctly identified and utilized in decision-making.

CHOSEN AGENT: CODER

AGENT OBJECTIVE:
Refactor `_adjacent_empty_node` in `foo_player.py` to resolve the `AttributeError` and enable accurate adjacency detection for roads:

1. **Adjacency Logic**:
   - Replace the invalid `adjacent_nodes` reference with the following:
     ```python
     neighbors = STATIC_GRAPH.neighbors(node)
     empty_neighbors = [
         neighbor for neighbor in neighbors
         if neighbor not in board.buildings
     ]
     ```
   - Use the `STATIC_GRAPH` object to resolve adjacent nodes dynamically for road connectivity.

2. **Edge Handling**:
   - Ensure edges are properly indexed, assuming tuple format (e.g., `(node_a, node_b)`).

3. **Test and Debug Enhancements**:
   - Add debug statements to validate retrieved adjacent nodes during runtime, confirming no issues in scoring logic:
     ```python
     print(f"Adjacent empty nodes for edge {edge_id}: {adjacent_nodes}")
     ```

Once implemented, ensure the updated `_adjacent_empty_node` function runs without errors, supports accurate road heuristics, and aligns with prioritized settlement expansion strategies. Validate FooPlayer functionality through game simulations.

### Updates Implemented:
1. **Corrected Adjacency Logic**:
   - Refactored `_adjacent_empty_node` to use the `STATIC_GRAPH.neighbors` method from the `Board` class to check adjacent nodes.
   - Ensured the function properly detects empty nodes not occupied by buildings.

2. **Improved Debugging**:
   - Added logging of adjacent empty nodes detected for edges during road-building evaluations for better visibility.

3. **Updated `decide` and Heuristic Scoring**:
   - Integrated the corrected adjacency logic to accurately prioritize road-building actions that enable settlement opportunities.
   - Added fallback mechanisms for cases where nodes adjacent to edges were invalid or ambiguous.

4. **Stability Enhancements**:
   - Replaced the invalid `adjacent_nodes` attribute with robust neighbor detection logic, ensuring compatibility with the game API and avoiding runtime errors.

### Recommended Testing:
- Validate settlement and road-building heuristics during simulation runs.
- Monitor debug output for logs related to adjacent empty nodes and heuristic scores.
- Test fallback logic when LLM responses are invalid or the priority order must resolve ambiguities.

After Running The New foo_player.py Player, Here is my analysis and findings:

### Scores of FooPlayer:
- Wins: 1  
- Average Victory Points (VP): 5.33  
- Average Settlements: 2.67  
- Average Cities: 0.0  
- Average Roads: 0.33  
- Average Largest Army: 0.33  
- Average Development VP: 1.33  

### Short Analysis of Game Output:
- **Interesting Observations**:
  - The LLM responses include detailed justifications for actions such as "MOVE_ROBBER" and "BUY_DEVELOPMENT_CARD" that emphasize strategy but fail to yield impactful results to improve VP significantly.
  - Maritime trading and Knight plays are occasionally emphasized but lack meaningful progression in VP or resource diversity.
  - Fallback mechanisms (e.g., defaulting to "END_TURN") frequently activated due to ambiguous or invalid LLM responses.

### Warnings or Signs of Player Implementation Error:
- **LLM Ambiguity or Parsing Failures**: Logs repeatedly highlight ambiguous LLM responses leading to fallback actions, which undermines strategic progression.
- **Resource Management Issues**: Persistent inability to balance resources effectively is evident, hampering settlement and city building.
- **Strategic Gaps**: High-focus actions like "BUILD_SETTLEMENT" appear inadequately prioritized or are infeasible. Cities were not built in any game, indicating significant shortcomings in the scoring mechanism and resource focus.
