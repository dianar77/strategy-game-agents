# Catan Strategic Advisor

I'll provide you with expert Catan strategy analysis to help you make the best decision. 
Focus on these key strategic principles:

## Probability-Based Resource Collection
- Prioritize high-probability numbers (6, 8, 5, 9) when building settlements
- Balance your resource production to avoid dependency on a single resource
- Pay attention to what resources are scarce in the game

## Resource Value Hierarchy
- Early game: Prioritize brick and wood for initial expansion
- Mid game: Focus on wheat and ore for city upgrades and development cards
- Late game: Maintain balanced resource collection with emphasis on ore/wheat

## Development Card Strategy
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Hold knight cards until strategically beneficial (robber placement, largest army)
- Remember that unplayed VP cards count towards your score

## Building Strategy
- Build settlements on resource-diverse intersections
- Position roads to block opponents from prime settlement locations
- Upgrade to cities on tiles with high-probability wheat and ore

## Victory Point Paths
- Cities Path: Ore and wheat focus, upgrade settlements quickly
- Longest Road Path: Wood and brick focus, build a network of roads
- Development Card Path: Sheep, wheat, and ore focus, buy development cards
- Balanced Path: Mix strategies based on your initial settlement positions

## Trading Strategy
- Trade from strength (your abundant resources) to address weaknesses
- Avoid trading resources that directly help opponents reach their next build
- Use maritime trade (ports) when player trading is unfavorable
- Consider the game state when deciding whether to trade

Remember to adapt your strategy based on the current game state and opponents' positions.


You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN. That means 10 victory points.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>
6. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively
7. Think about the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

❓ Select action by number (0-19):


Based on this information, which action number do you choose? Think step by step about your options, then put the final action number in a box like \boxed{1}.
RESPONSE:
To determine the best action for the BLUE player, let's analyze the game state and the available options step by step:

### Game State Analysis:
1. **Resource Distribution**:
   - High-probability tiles are 🌾6, 🌾10, 🐑8, and ⛏️5.
   - The red player has a settlement at node 1, which produces 🌾6, 🐑8, and ⛏️5.

2. **Resource Availability**:
   - BLUE has no resources at the moment.
   - RED's resources are hidden, but their settlement produces 🌾, 🐑, and ⛏️.

3. **Strategic Considerations**:
   - High-probability numbers (6, 8, 5, 10) are crucial for resource collection.
   - Early game focus should be on brick and wood for initial expansion.
   - Diverse resource production is important to avoid dependency on a single resource.

### Available Settlement Options:
Let's evaluate the nodes based on the resources they provide and their proximity to high-probability tiles:

- **Node 3**: Produces 🌾6 and 🏜️ (blocked by robber).
- **Node 4**: Produces 🌾6 and 🌾10.
- **Node 5**: Produces 🌾6 and 🌾10.
- **Node 7**: Produces 🐑8 and ⛏️5.
- **Node 8**: Produces 🐑8 and ⛏️5.
- **Node 9**: Produces 🐑8 and 🌾6.
- **Node 10**: Produces 🧱4 and 🌾6.
- **Node 11**: Produces 🧱4 and 🌾6.
- **Node 12**: Produces 🧱4 and 🏜️ (blocked by robber).
- **Node 13**: Produces 🏜️ (blocked by robber) and 🌾10.
- **Node 14**: Produces 🏜️ (blocked by robber) and 🌾10.
- **Node 15**: Produces 🌾10 and 🌾6.
- **Node 16**: Produces 🌾10 and 🌲9.
- **Node 17**: Produces 🌾10 and 🌲9.
- **Node 18**: Produces 🌾10 and 🌲9.
- **Node 19**: Produces 🌲9 and ⛏️5.
- **Node 20**: Produces 🌲9 and ⛏️5.
- **Node 21**: Produces 🌲9 and ⛏️5.
- **Node 22**: Produces ⛏️5 and 🌲9.
- **Node 23**: Produces ⛏️5 and 🌲9.

### Best Options:
1. **Node 4**: Produces 🌾6 and 🌾10. This is a high-probability tile combination and provides diverse resources.
2. **Node 5**: Produces 🌾6 and 🌾10. Similar to node 4, it provides high-probability resources.
3. **Node 15**: Produces 🌾10 and 🌾6. Another good option for high-probability resources.

### Final Decision:
Given the need for diverse and high-probability resources, **Node 4** is the best option. It provides both 🌾6 and 🌾10, which are crucial for early game expansion and resource collection.

<plan>Build a settlement at node 4 to ensure diverse and high-probability resource collection. Focus on expanding towards other high-probability tiles in the next turns.</plan>

RESPONSE:
To determine the best action, let's analyze the game state and the available options step by step:

1. **Current Plan**:
   - Build a settlement at node 4 to ensure diverse and high-probability resource collection.
   - Focus on expanding towards other high-probability tiles in the next turns.

2. **Game Status**:
   - Longest Road: None (0 segments)
   - Largest Army: None (0 knights)
   - Robber Location: (-1, 0, 1)

3. **Resource & Node Grid Analysis**:
   - Node 4 (where the BLUE settlement is) produces 🌾6 (high-probability) and 🌾10 (medium-probability).
   - Possible expansions from node 4:
     - Edge (4, 15) leads to node 15, which is connected to 🌾6 (high-probability).
     - Edge (4, 5) leads to node 5, which is connected to 🌾10 (medium-probability) and 🌾6 (high-probability).
     - Edge (3, 4) leads to node 3, which is connected to 🌾6 (high-probability) and 🧱4 (low-probability).

4. **Resource Collection**:
   - Node 15 (🌾6) has a high probability and is beneficial for early game expansion.
   - Node 5 (🌾10, 🌾6) also has high and medium-probability resources, which is good for diverse resource collection.
   - Node 3 (🌾6, 🧱4) has a high and low-probability resource, which is less optimal compared to nodes 15 and 5.

5. **Strategic Considerations**:
   - Building towards node 15 ensures continued high-probability wheat production, which is crucial for early expansion.
   - Building towards node 5 provides a mix of high and medium-probability resources, which is also beneficial for balanced resource collection.
   - Building towards node 3 provides a high-probability resource but also a low-probability resource, which is less ideal.

Based on the above analysis, the best action is to build a road towards node 15, as it ensures continued high-probability wheat production, which is crucial for early expansion.

<plan>Build a road at edge (4, 15) to ensure continued high-probability wheat production. Focus on expanding towards other high-probability tiles in the next turns.</plan>

   - The current plan is to build a road at edge (4, 15) to ensure continued high-probability wheat production and expand towards other high-probability tiles.

2. **Current Resources**:
   - BLUE has no resources currently.

3. **Available Actions**:
   - All available actions are to build a settlement at various nodes.

4. **Resource Analysis**:
   - BLUE currently has a settlement at node 4, which produces 🌾6 and 🌾10.
   - RED has a settlement at node 1, which produces 🌾6, 🐑8, and ⛏️5.

5. **Strategic Considerations**:
   - Since BLUE has no resources, building a settlement is not immediately possible.
   - The plan suggests focusing on high-probability tiles.
   - Nodes connected to high-probability tiles are:
     - Node 7: Connected to 🐑8 and 🧱4.
     - Node 8: Connected to 🐑8 and 🌾6.
     - Node 9: Connected to 🐑8 and 🌾6.
     - Node 10: Connected to 🧱4 and 🌾10.
     - Node 11: Connected to 🧱4.
     - Node 12: Connected to 🧱4 and 🌾6.
     - Node 13: Connected to 🌾6 and 🌾10.
     - Node 14: Connected to 🌾10.
     - Node 16: Connected to 🌾10.
     - Node 17: Connected to 🌾10.
     - Node 18: Connected to 🌾10.
     - Node 19: Connected to 🌲9.
     - Node 20: Connected to 🌲9 and ⛏️5.
     - Node 21: Connected to 🌲9.
     - Node 22: Connected to ⛏️5.
     - Node 23: Connected to ⛏️5.

6. **Optimal Node Selection**:
   - Node 13 is connected to 🌾6 and 🌾10, both high-probability tiles.
   - Building at node 13 ensures continued high-probability wheat production and aligns with the current plan.

7. **Adjusting the Plan**:
   - The plan should be adjusted to prioritize the settlement at node 13 and then focus on resource collection for future expansions.

<plan>Build a settlement at node 13 to ensure continued high-probability wheat production. Focus on collecting resources for future expansions towards other high-probability tiles.</plan>

Given the analysis, the best action is to build a settlement at node 13.

# Catan Strategic Advisor

I'll provide you with expert Catan strategy analysis to help you make the best decision. 
Focus on these key strategic principles:

## Probability-Based Resource Collection
- Prioritize high-probability numbers (6, 8, 5, 9) when building settlements
- Balance your resource production to avoid dependency on a single resource
- Pay attention to what resources are scarce in the game

## Resource Value Hierarchy
- Early game: Prioritize brick and wood for initial expansion
- Mid game: Focus on wheat and ore for city upgrades and development cards
- Late game: Maintain balanced resource collection with emphasis on ore/wheat

## Development Card Strategy
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Hold knight cards until strategically beneficial (robber placement, largest army)
- Remember that unplayed VP cards count towards your score

## Building Strategy
- Build settlements on resource-diverse intersections
- Position roads to block opponents from prime settlement locations
- Upgrade to cities on tiles with high-probability wheat and ore

## Victory Point Paths
- Cities Path: Ore and wheat focus, upgrade settlements quickly
- Longest Road Path: Wood and brick focus, build a network of roads
- Development Card Path: Sheep, wheat, and ore focus, buy development cards
- Balanced Path: Mix strategies based on your initial settlement positions

## Trading Strategy
- Trade from strength (your abundant resources) to address weaknesses
- Avoid trading resources that directly help opponents reach their next build
- Use maritime trade (ports) when player trading is unfavorable
- Consider the game state when deciding whether to trade

Remember to adapt your strategy based on the current game state and opponents' positions.


You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN. That means 10 victory points.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>
6. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively
7. Think about the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

❓ Select action by number (0-1):


Based on this information, which action number do you choose? Think step by step about your options, then put the final action number in a box like \boxed{1}.
RESPONSE:
To make the best decision, let's analyze the game state and the available options step by step:

1. **Current Plan**: The current plan is to build a settlement at node 13 to ensure high-probability wheat production and focus on collecting resources for future expansions towards other high-probability tiles.

2. **Game State Analysis**:
   - **Your Settlements**:
     - Node 4: Produces 🌾6[⭐⭐⭐], 🌾10[⭐]
     - Node 13: Produces no resources (not yet activated)
   - **Opponent's Settlements**:
     - Node 1: Produces 🌾6[⭐⭐⭐], 🐑8[⭐⭐⭐], ⛏️5[⭐⭐]
   - **Resource Collection**:
     - You need to prioritize high-probability numbers (6, 8, 5, 9).
     - Your current settlements are on tiles with 6 and 10, which are good but you need to diversify.

3. **Available Actions**:
   - [0] Build a road at edge (13, 14) (Cost: 1 🌲WOOD, 1 🧱BRICK)
   - [1] Build a road at edge (12, 13) (Cost: 1 🌲WOOD, 1 🧱BRICK)

4. **Strategic Considerations**:
   - **Road Placement**:
     - Building a road at edge (13, 14) would connect node 13 to node 14, which is adjacent to the 🏜️- (-1, 0, 1) tile (currently blocked by the robber).
     - Building a road at edge (12, 13) would connect node 13 to node 12, which is adjacent to the 🌾6 (0, 0, 0) tile and the 🧱4 (0, -1, 1) tile.
   - **Future Expansion**:
     - Connecting to node 12 allows for future expansion towards the 🧱4 tile, which has a high-probability number (4) and provides bricks, which are valuable for building roads.
     - Connecting to node 14 does not provide immediate benefits due to the robber's presence and the lack of high-probability resources in the vicinity.

5. **Resource Availability**:
   - You currently have no resources, but the goal is to plan for future resource collection.
   - Building towards node 12 aligns with the strategy of diversifying resource collection and ensuring access to high-probability tiles.

6. **Next Steps**:
   - After building the road, the next step would be to build a settlement at node 12, which would provide access to the 🌾6 tile and the 🧱4 tile.
   - This would diversify your resource collection and set you up for future expansions.

Based on the analysis, the best action is to build a road at edge (12, 13) to connect to node 12. This aligns with the current plan and sets up future expansions towards high-probability tiles.

<plan>Build a road at edge (12, 13), then build a settlement at node 12 to diversify resource collection. Focus on collecting resources for future expansions towards other high-probability tiles.</plan>

Based on this information, which action number do you choose? Think step by step about your options, then put the final action number in a box like \boxed{1}.
RESPONSE:
To determine the best action, let's analyze the game state and the available options step by step:

1. **Game State Analysis:**
   - **Victory Points:** You (BLUE) have 2 VP, while RED has 3 VP.
   - **Resources:** You have 4 WHEAT.
   - **Buildings:** You have settlements at nodes 4 and 13. Node 4 produces WHEAT from tiles with numbers 6 and 10. Node 13 currently produces no resources.
   - **Robber Location:** The robber is at (-1, 0, 1), blocking resource production on that tile.
   - **Ports:** You have access to maritime trade options.

2. **Current Plan:**
   - Your plan is to build a road at edge (12, 13) and then build a settlement at node 12 to diversify resource collection.

3. **Available Actions:**
   - End Turn [0]
   - Trade 4 WHEAT for 1 ORE [1]
   - Trade 4 WHEAT for 1 WOOD [2]
   - Trade 4 WHEAT for 1 SHEEP [3]
   - Trade 4 WHEAT for 1 BRICK [4]

4. **Resource Needs:**
   - To continue with your plan, you need to build a road. Building a road requires 1 WOOD and 1 BRICK.
   - You currently have 4 WHEAT, which is not useful for building roads directly.

5. **Trade Options:**
   - You can trade 4 WHEAT for 1 WOOD [2] or 1 BRICK [4].
   - Since you need both WOOD and BRICK to build a road, you should prioritize acquiring one of these resources.

6. **Strategic Consideration:**
   - Trading 4 WHEAT for 1 WOOD [2] will allow you to get closer to building the road you need.
   - You can then focus on acquiring BRICK in future turns to complete the road.

Given the above analysis, the best action is to trade 4 WHEAT for 1 WOOD to move closer to your goal of building a road.

❓ Select action by number (0-5):


Based on this information, which action number do you choose? Think step by step about your options, then put the final action number in a box like \boxed{1}.
RESPONSE:
Let's analyze the game state and decide the best action step by step.

### Current Game State Analysis:
1. **Resource Production**:
   - BLUE has settlements at nodes 4 and 13.
   - Node 4 produces wheat from tiles with numbers 6 and 10.
   - Node 13 currently produces no resources.

2. **Robber Location**:
   - The robber is currently at (-1, 0, 1), which is a desert tile and does not block any resource production.

3. **Available Actions**:
   - Move the robber to any of the following tiles:
     - [0] (0, 0, 0) - Wheat tile with number 6 (affects RED and BLUE)
     - [1] (1, -1, 0) - Sheep tile with number 8 (affects RED)
     - [2] (0, -1, 1) - Brick tile with number 4
     - [3] (-1, 1, 0) - Wheat tile with number 10 (affects BLUE)
     - [4] (0, 1, -1) - Wood tile with number 9 (affects RED)
     - [5] (1, 0, -1) - Ore tile with number 5 (affects RED)

4. **Strategic Considerations**:
   - BLUE needs to diversify resource collection.
   - Moving the robber to a tile that affects RED's resource production can slow down their progress.
   - BLUE should avoid moving the robber to tiles that affect their own resource production.

### Action Analysis:
- **[0] Move robber to (0, 0, 0)**:
  - This tile produces wheat with number 6.
  - Affects both RED and BLUE.
  - Not ideal as it affects BLUE's resource production.

- **[1] Move robber to (1, -1, 0)**:
  - This tile produces sheep with number 8.
  - Affects RED.
  - Good option as it affects RED's resource production without affecting BLUE.

- **[2] Move robber to (0, -1, 1)**:
  - This tile produces brick with number 4.
  - Does not affect any player's current resource production.
  - Not a strategic move.

- **[3] Move robber to (-1, 1, 0)**:
  - This tile produces wheat with number 10.
  - Affects BLUE.
  - Not ideal as it affects BLUE's resource production.

- **[4] Move robber to (0, 1, -1)**:
  - This tile produces wood with number 9.
  - Affects RED.
  - Good option as it affects RED's resource production without affecting BLUE.

- **[5] Move robber to (1, 0, -1)**:
  - This tile produces ore with number 5.
  - Affects RED.
  - Good option as it affects RED's resource production without affecting BLUE.

### Best Action:
- Moving the robber to (1, -1, 0) affects RED's resource production without affecting BLUE.
- This will slow down RED's progress and allow BLUE to continue with their plan.

Focus on these key strategic principles:

## Probability-Based Resource Collection
- Prioritize high-probability numbers (6, 8, 5, 9) when building settlements
- Balance your resource production to avoid dependency on a single resource
- Pay attention to what resources are scarce in the game

## Resource Value Hierarchy
- Early game: Prioritize brick and wood for initial expansion
- Mid game: Focus on wheat and ore for city upgrades and development cards
- Late game: Maintain balanced resource collection with emphasis on ore/wheat

## Development Card Strategy
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Hold knight cards until strategically beneficial (robber placement, largest army)
- Remember that unplayed VP cards count towards your score

## Building Strategy
- Build settlements on resource-diverse intersections
- Position roads to block opponents from prime settlement locations
- Upgrade to cities on tiles with high-probability wheat and ore

## Victory Point Paths
- Cities Path: Ore and wheat focus, upgrade settlements quickly
- Longest Road Path: Wood and brick focus, build a network of roads
- Development Card Path: Sheep, wheat, and ore focus, buy development cards
- Balanced Path: Mix strategies based on your initial settlement positions

## Trading Strategy
- Trade from strength (your abundant resources) to address weaknesses
- Avoid trading resources that directly help opponents reach their next build
- Use maritime trade (ports) when player trading is unfavorable
- Consider the game state when deciding whether to trade

Remember to adapt your strategy based on the current game state and opponents' positions.

❓ Select action by number (0-5):


Based on this information, which action number do you choose? Think step by step about your options, then put the final action number in a box like \boxed{1}.
RESPONSE:
To make the best decision, let's analyze the game state step by step:

### Current Game State Analysis:
1. **Resource Collection:**
   - **BLUE**: You have settlements at nodes 4 and 13.
     - Node 4 produces wheat from tiles 🌾6 and 🌾10.
     - Node 13 currently does not produce any resources due to the robber.
   - **RED**: Has cities at nodes 1 and 20.
     - Node 1 produces wheat, sheep, and ore.
     - Node 20 produces wood and ore.

2. **Victory Points:**
   - **BLUE**: 2 points (2 settlements).
   - **RED**: 4 points (2 cities).

3. **Resource Cards:**
   - **BLUE**: 1 wood, 1 wheat.
   - **RED**: 4 unknown cards.

4. **Robber Location:**
   - Currently at (-1, 0, 1), blocking node 13 from producing resources.

### Strategic Considerations:
1. **Probability-Based Resource Collection:**
   - Moving the robber to a high-probability tile can significantly impact resource collection for both players.
   - Tile 🌾6 (0, 0, 0) is a high-probability tile producing wheat, which is crucial for both players.

2. **Resource Value Hierarchy:**
   - Early game: Prioritize brick and wood for initial expansion.
   - Mid game: Focus on wheat and ore for city upgrades and development cards.

3. **Opponent Impact:**
   - RED has cities that produce a lot of resources. Blocking RED's resource production can slow down their progress.

4. **Current Plan:**
   - Build a road at edge (12, 13), then build a settlement at node 12 to diversify resource collection.
   - Moving the robber to a strategic location can help in executing this plan by gaining resources from RED.

### Available Actions:
- [0] Move robber to (0, 0, 0) and steal from RED
- [1] Move robber to (1, -1, 0) and steal from RED
- [2] Move robber to (0, -1, 1)
- [3] Move robber to (-1, 1, 0)
- [4] Move robber to (0, 1, -1) and steal from RED
- [5] Move robber to (1, 0, -1) and steal from RED

### Decision Making:
1. **Move Robber to (0, 0, 0) and Steal from RED [0]:**
   - Blocks a high-probability wheat tile.
   - Steals a resource from RED, potentially slowing their progress.
   - Wheat is crucial for city upgrades and development cards.

2. **Move Robber to (1, -1, 0) and Steal from RED [1]:**
   - Blocks a high-probability sheep tile.
   - Sheep is less critical compared to wheat in the mid-game.

3. **Move Robber to (0, -1, 1) [2]:**
   - Blocks a low-probability brick tile.
   - Less impactful as brick is not a high-priority resource currently.

4. **Move Robber to (-1, 1, 0) [3]:**
   - Blocks a high-probability wheat tile.
   - No steal option, less beneficial compared to option [0].

5. **Move Robber to (0, 1, -1) and Steal from RED [4]:**
   - Blocks a high-probability wood tile.
   - Wood is important for early expansion but less critical in the mid-game.

6. **Move Robber to (1, 0, -1) and Steal from RED [5]:**
   - Blocks a high-probability ore tile.
   - Ore is crucial for city upgrades and development cards.
   - Stealing ore from RED can significantly slow their progress.

### Final Decision:
Given the current game state and strategic considerations, the best action is to move the robber to (1, 0, -1) and steal from RED. This blocks a high-probability ore tile and allows you to steal a crucial resource from RED, potentially slowing their progress towards city upgrades and development cards.

<plan>Continue with the plan to build a road at edge (12, 13), then build a settlement at node 12 to diversify resource collection. Focus on collecting resources for future expansions towards other high-probability tiles.</plan>

❓ Select action by number (0-5):


Based on this information, which action number do you choose? Think step by step about your options, then put the final action number in a box like \boxed{1}.
RESPONSE:
Let's break down the situation and analyze the best action step by step:

1. **Understand the Current Plan**:
   - The current plan is to build a road at edge (12, 13), then build a settlement at node 12 to diversify resource collection.
   - To continue with this plan, we need to ensure that our resource collection is not hindered by the robber.

2. **Evaluate Resource Collection**:
   - BLUE currently has settlements at nodes 4 and 13.
   - Node 4 produces wheat from tiles 🌾6 and 🌾10.
   - Node 13 currently produces no resources.

3. **Analyze Robber Placement Options**:
   - Option [0]: Move robber to (0, 0, 0) and steal from RED. This tile produces 🌾6.
   - Option [1]: Move robber to (1, -1, 0) and steal from RED. This tile produces 🐑8.
   - Option [2]: Move robber to (0, -1, 1). This tile produces 🧱4.
   - Option [3]: Move robber to (-1, 1, 0). This tile produces 🌾10.
   - Option [4]: Move robber to (0, 1, -1) and steal from RED. This tile produces 🌲9.
   - Option [5]: Move robber to (1, 0, -1) and steal from RED. This tile produces ⛏️5.

4. **Strategic Considerations**:
   - Moving the robber to (0, 0, 0) will block the 🌾6 tile, which is crucial for BLUE's wheat production.
   - Moving the robber to (1, -1, 0) will block the 🐑8 tile, which is less critical for BLUE but will affect RED.
   - Moving the robber to (0, -1, 1) will block the 🧱4 tile, which does not affect BLUE directly.
   - Moving the robber to (-1, 1, 0) will block the 🌾10 tile, which is important for BLUE's wheat production.
   - Moving the robber to (0, 1, -1) will block the 🌲9 tile, which does not affect BLUE directly.
   - Moving the robber to (1, 0, -1) will block the ⛏️5 tile, which does not affect BLUE directly but will affect RED.

5. **Best Action**:
   - To ensure BLUE's resource collection is not hindered, we should avoid placing the robber on tiles that produce wheat (🌾6 and 🌾10).
   - Placing the robber on (0, 1, -1) will block the 🌲9 tile, which does not affect BLUE's current resource collection and will not affect RED's resource collection significantly.

Therefore, the best action is:

   - RED's cities produce 🌾6, 🐑8, ⛏️5, and 🌲9.

5. **Robber Location**:
   - The robber is at (0, 1, -1), blocking the 🌲9 tile.

6. **Strategic Plan**:
   - The current plan is to build a road at edge (12, 13) and a settlement at node 12 to diversify resource collection.

### Available Actions:
1. **End Turn**:
   - [0] End your turn.

2. **Maritime Trade Options**:
   - [1] Trade port: Give 4 🌾WHEAT for 1 ⛏️ORE.
   - [2] Trade port: Give 4 🌾WHEAT for 1 🌲WOOD.
   - [3] Trade port: Give 4 🌾WHEAT for 1 🐑SHEEP.
   - [4] Trade port: Give 4 🌾WHEAT for 1 🧱BRICK.

### Analysis of Options:
1. **End Turn**:
   - Ending the turn without making a move could be detrimental as it doesn't advance the strategic plan.

2. **Maritime Trade Options**:
   - BLUE has 4 🌾WHEAT, which can be traded for any other resource.
   - Considering the current resources (2 🌲WOOD and 4 🌾WHEAT), trading 4 🌾WHEAT for 1 ⛏️ORE or 1 🧱BRICK could be beneficial.
   - ⛏️ORE is crucial for city upgrades and development cards, which are important in the mid-game.
   - 🧱BRICK is important for building roads and settlements, which are crucial for expansion.

### Decision:
- Given the current plan to diversify resource collection and expand towards high-probability tiles, acquiring 🧱BRICK would be more beneficial for building roads and settlements.
- Trading 4 🌾WHEAT for 1 🧱BRICK will allow BLUE to build a road at edge (12, 13) and then a settlement at node 12, aligning with the strategic plan.

Therefore, the best action is:

I'll provide you with expert Catan strategy analysis to help you make the best decision. 
Focus on these key strategic principles:

## Probability-Based Resource Collection
- Prioritize high-probability numbers (6, 8, 5, 9) when building settlements
- Balance your resource production to avoid dependency on a single resource
- Pay attention to what resources are scarce in the game

## Resource Value Hierarchy
- Early game: Prioritize brick and wood for initial expansion
- Mid game: Focus on wheat and ore for city upgrades and development cards
- Late game: Maintain balanced resource collection with emphasis on ore/wheat

## Development Card Strategy
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Hold knight cards until strategically beneficial (robber placement, largest army)
- Remember that unplayed VP cards count towards your score

## Building Strategy
- Build settlements on resource-diverse intersections
- Position roads to block opponents from prime settlement locations
- Upgrade to cities on tiles with high-probability wheat and ore

## Victory Point Paths
- Cities Path: Ore and wheat focus, upgrade settlements quickly
- Longest Road Path: Wood and brick focus, build a network of roads
- Development Card Path: Sheep, wheat, and ore focus, buy development cards
- Balanced Path: Mix strategies based on your initial settlement positions

## Trading Strategy
- Trade from strength (your abundant resources) to address weaknesses
- Avoid trading resources that directly help opponents reach their next build
- Use maritime trade (ports) when player trading is unfavorable
- Consider the game state when deciding whether to trade

Remember to adapt your strategy based on the current game state and opponents' positions.

❓ Select action by number (0-5):


Based on this information, which action number do you choose? Think step by step about your options, then put the final action number in a box like \boxed{1}.
RESPONSE:
To determine the best action, let's analyze the game state and the available options step by step:

1. **Current Plan**:
   - The plan is to build a road at edge (11, 12), then build a settlement at node 12 to diversify resource collection.
   - To continue with this plan, we need to move the robber strategically.

2. **Game State**:
   - **RED Player**:
     - Has 4 victory points.
     - Has 4 hidden resources.
     - Has 2 cities and 4 roads.
   - **BLUE Player** (you):
     - Has 2 victory points.
     - Has 1 🌲WOOD and 1 🌾WHEAT.
     - Has 2 settlements and 3 roads.
   - **Robber Location**: (0, 1, -1)
   - **Available Actions**:
     - [0] Move robber to (0, 0, 0) and steal from RED
     - [1] Move robber to (1, -1, 0) and steal from RED
     - [2] Move robber to (0, -1, 1)
     - [3] Move robber to (-1, 0, 1)
     - [4] Move robber to (-1, 1, 0)
     - [5] Move robber to (1, 0, -1) and steal from RED

3. **Strategic Considerations**:
   - **Resource Collection**:
     - RED has valuable cities on high-probability tiles (🌾6, 🐑8, ⛏️5).
     - Moving the robber to a tile that RED heavily relies on could hinder their resource collection.
   - **Stealing Resources**:
     - Stealing a resource from RED could slow their progress.
   - **Future Plans**:
     - Moving the robber to a tile that does not affect your future settlement at node 12 is crucial.

4. **Analysis of Options**:
   - **[0] Move robber to (0, 0, 0) and steal from RED**:
     - This tile produces 🌾6, which is valuable for both players.
     - Stealing from RED and blocking this tile could be beneficial.
   - **[1] Move robber to (1, -1, 0) and steal from RED**:
     - This tile produces 🐑8, which is also valuable.
     - Stealing from RED and blocking this tile could be beneficial.
   - **[2] Move robber to (0, -1, 1)**:
     - This tile produces 🧱4, which is less valuable.
     - No stealing opportunity.
   - **[3] Move robber to (-1, 0, 1)**:
     - This tile produces no resources (desert tile).
     - No strategic benefit.
   - **[4] Move robber to (-1, 1, 0)**:
     - This tile produces 🌾10, which is valuable.
     - No stealing opportunity.
   - **[5] Move robber to (1, 0, -1) and steal from RED**:
     - This tile produces ⛏️5, which is valuable for city upgrades.
     - Stealing from RED and blocking this tile could be beneficial.

5. **Best Action**:
   - Moving the robber to (1, 0, -1) and stealing from RED is the best option. This tile produces ⛏️5, which is crucial for RED's city upgrades. Blocking this tile will hinder RED's progress significantly, and stealing a resource will further slow them down.

Therefore, the best action is:

Based on this information, which action number do you choose? Think step by step about your options, then put the final action number in a box like \boxed{1}.
RESPONSE:
To determine the best action, let's analyze the game state and the available options step by step:

### Current Plan Analysis:
- **Current Plan**: Build a road at edge (11, 12), then build a settlement at node 12 to diversify resource collection. Focus on collecting resources for future expansions towards other high-probability tiles.
- **Current Resources**: 1 🌲WOOD, 1 🐑SHEEP, 1 🌾WHEAT.

### Resource and Node Grid Analysis:
- **High-Probability Tiles**:
  - 🌾6 (0, 0, 0)
  - 🌾10 (-1, 1, 0)
  - 🐑8 (1, -1, 0)
  - 🌲9 (0, 1, -1)
- **Robber Location**: (1, 0, -1) - blocking ⛏️5 ore tile.

### Player Status:
- **RED**:
  - Victory Points: 4/10
  - Resources: 0 cards (hidden)
  - Development Cards: None
  - Buildings: 2 cities
  - Roads: 10 roads
- **BLUE**:
  - Victory Points: 2/10
  - Resources: 1 🌲WOOD, 1 🐑SHEEP, 1 🌾WHEAT
  - Development Cards: None
  - Buildings: 2 settlements
  - Roads: 3 built

### Available Actions:
- [0] Move robber to (0, 0, 0)
- [1] Move robber to (1, -1, 0)
- [2] Move robber to (0, -1, 1)
- [3] Move robber to (-1, 0, 1)
- [4] Move robber to (-1, 1, 0)
- [5] Move robber to (0, 1, -1)

### Strategy Considerations:
1. **Robber Placement**:
   - The robber is currently on the ⛏️5 ore tile, which is not producing for BLUE.
   - Moving the robber to a high-probability tile will hinder RED's resource collection and potentially benefit BLUE.

2. **High-Probability Tiles**:
   - 🌾6 (0, 0, 0): This tile is crucial for both players, especially RED who has a city on it.
   - 🌾10 (-1, 1, 0): Also important for RED.
   - 🐑8 (1, -1, 0): Useful for BLUE's future expansion.
   - 🌲9 (0, 1, -1): Another high-probability tile.

3. **Future Expansion**:
   - BLUE's current plan involves expanding towards node 12, which is connected to the 🌾10 and 🌲9 tiles.
   - Moving the robber to a tile that does not affect BLUE's current resource collection but hinders RED's collection is strategic.

### Best Action:
- **Option [0]**: Move robber to (0, 0, 0) - This will block the 🌾6 tile, which is crucial for RED and less critical for BLUE's immediate plan.
- **Option [1]**: Move robber to (1, -1, 0) - This will block the 🐑8 tile, which is useful for BLUE's future expansion.
- **Option [2]**: Move robber to (0, -1, 1) - This will block the 🧱4 tile, which is not a high-probability tile.
- **Option [3]**: Move robber to (-1, 0, 1) - This will block the 🏜️- tile, which is not producing any resources.
- **Option [4]**: Move robber to (-1, 1, 0) - This will block the 🌾10 tile, which is important for RED and BLUE.
- **Option [5]**: Move robber to (0, 1, -1) - This will block the 🌲9 tile, which is important for RED and BLUE.

Given the current plan and the need to hinder RED's resource collection without affecting BLUE's immediate expansion, the best option is to move the robber to the 🌾6 tile.

### Final Decision:
\[ \boxed{0} \]

<plan>Continue with the current plan: Build a road at edge (11, 12), then build a settlement at node 12 to diversify resource collection. Focus on collecting resources for future expansions towards other high-probability tiles.</plan>

# Catan Strategic Advisor

I'll provide you with expert Catan strategy analysis to help you make the best decision. 
Focus on these key strategic principles:

## Probability-Based Resource Collection
- Prioritize high-probability numbers (6, 8, 5, 9) when building settlements
- Balance your resource production to avoid dependency on a single resource
- Pay attention to what resources are scarce in the game

## Resource Value Hierarchy
- Early game: Prioritize brick and wood for initial expansion
- Mid game: Focus on wheat and ore for city upgrades and development cards
- Late game: Maintain balanced resource collection with emphasis on ore/wheat

## Development Card Strategy
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Hold knight cards until strategically beneficial (robber placement, largest army)
- Remember that unplayed VP cards count towards your score

## Building Strategy
- Build settlements on resource-diverse intersections
- Position roads to block opponents from prime settlement locations
- Upgrade to cities on tiles with high-probability wheat and ore

## Victory Point Paths
- Cities Path: Ore and wheat focus, upgrade settlements quickly
- Longest Road Path: Wood and brick focus, build a network of roads
- Development Card Path: Sheep, wheat, and ore focus, buy development cards
- Balanced Path: Mix strategies based on your initial settlement positions

## Trading Strategy
- Trade from strength (your abundant resources) to address weaknesses
- Avoid trading resources that directly help opponents reach their next build
- Use maritime trade (ports) when player trading is unfavorable
- Consider the game state when deciding whether to trade

Remember to adapt your strategy based on the current game state and opponents' positions.


You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN. That means 10 victory points.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>
6. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively
7. Think about the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)
