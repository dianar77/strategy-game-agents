Updated plan: 1. **Focus on Longest Road:** RED is at 9 road segments (just 1 payoff VP from overall victory). To have any chance of winning, you must challenge their advantage by expanding your road network aggressively. You need 🌲WOOD to do this.
2. **Consider Development Cards:** You have enough resources to buy a development card. This can lead to:
   - Victory Points (help close the massive gap).
   - Knights (start building toward Largest Army, slowing RED).
   - Progress Cards like Road Building (get free roads to contest Longest Road).
3. **Resource Management:** You need 🌲WOOD and 🌾WHEAT importantly next turn. Focus on either trades or resource denial strategies to force progress toward roads or cities.
