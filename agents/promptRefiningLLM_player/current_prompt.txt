You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options. Your player strategy will be based on Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and greedy victory point maximization.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN. That means 10 victory points.
3. Use MCTS at deeper decision branches (more than 3 options), and victory point maximization otherwise.
4. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
5. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
6. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Focus on high-yield resources like üåæ Wheat and üß± Brick, prioritize city upgrades, and obtain development cards for additional points</plan>
7. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively
8. Think about the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- üîç marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)
