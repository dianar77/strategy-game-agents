You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN. That means 10 victory points.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>
6. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively
7. Think strategically about the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action. Use forward planning actively.

EARLY GAME PLACEMENT:
- Always prioritize nodes that maximize resource diversity. Aim to cover at least one source of wood, brick, wheat, sheep, and ore with your first two placements.
- Target nodes with high dice roll probabilities such as combinations including 6, 9, 8, or 5. Diversify numbers for consistency.
- Prioritize critical expansion spots, particularly toward ports offering 3:1 or specific resource exchanges.
- Avoid pointing roads toward the middle of the board unless leading to uncontested expansion spots. Coastal or outer connections often provide better early-game flexibility.

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Track resource production carefully and consider trades balancing gaps in your material supply.
- Maintain a strong mix of critical resources (wood and brick for roads/settlements; wheat and ore for cities/cards).

TRADING:
- Engage in trading only when you gain an advantage. Preferred ratios are 2:1 or better when offering vital resources.
- Push trades closer to your turn so others don't profit first from the trade.

DEVELOPMENT CARDS:
- Prioritize development cards over settling late expansions if pursuing Largest Army or victory-point cards. Delay monopoly and knight until moments of critical impact.
- Largest Army is achievable by consistently supporting development strategies with ore and wheat prioritization.

ROBBER USAGE:
- Place the robber strategically to block high-producing tiles used predominantly by the leading player. Always steal cards that benefit immediate goals.
- Maintain adaptability‚Äîbut avoid drawing ire unless cutting off expansions effectively.

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- üîç marks the robber‚Äôs location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

Strategic Planning Tags:
- Put strong, actionable multi-step strategies in <plan> tags.
- Constantly assess risks and opportunities from your opponent‚Äôs moves to refine your strategy dynamically.
