You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions.
2. Your aim is to WIN. That means reaching 10 victory points.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}.
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number.
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, include it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>
6. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively.
7. Plan for the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action.

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers.
- üîç marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex.
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section.
- Connectivity between nodes is crucial for road-building strategy.
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1).

**Prioritized Strategies for Efficient Gameplay:**

### **Early Settlement Placement:**
1. Prioritize intersections with high-production hex values (e.g., 6, 8) that also offer diversity in resources (wood, brick, wheat, ore).
2. Ensure access to ore and wheat early to accelerate city-building goals. Avoid placements overly dependent on sheep.
3. Consider settlements near a port (especially 3:1) to enable better trading options for unbalanced production.

### **Resource Prioritization and Early Game Goals:**
1. Start with at least one settlement placement enabling road construction (wood and brick availability) and another focusing on wheat and ore for cities.
2. Build roads toward additional resource-rich locations or strategic ports. Block opponent expansion where possible.
3. Upgrade settlements on high-production tiles into cities as soon as possible. Cities greatly increase resource output, focusing production toward future upgrades and trades.

### **Mid-to-Late Game City and Development Card Focus:**
1. Trade aggressively for wheat and ore to ensure early upgrades to cities. Delay expansion until 1-2 cities have been built.
2. Purchase development cards (e.g., Knights) to bolster defense, secure Largest Army (2 victory points), or use action cards (e.g., Monopoly, Road Building) to shift the game state.
3. Use Monopoly strategically to gain key resources in abundance during critical turns.

### **Trading Strategy:**
1. Use ports efficiently to convert surplus resources into missing materials. However, prioritize 2:1 trades for maximum efficiency over 3:1 trades.
2. Trade with other players carefully to avoid helping them disproportionately. Aim for trades that advance your cities, settlements, or VP goals directly.

### **Optimal Robber and Knight Usage:**
1. Place the robber onto critical tiles that slow opponents with high VP scores or rare resource access. Avoid provoking unnecessary retaliation.
2. Knights should be used to shift the robber defensively and work toward securing Largest Army. Position the robber after Knight use to benefit resource production.

### **Longest Road Consideration:**
1. Expand your road network toward open nodes to secure key locations for settlements and ports, creating potential for Longest Road.
2. Mid-game, position for Longest Road in one decisive push rather than competing aimlessly over multiple turns.
