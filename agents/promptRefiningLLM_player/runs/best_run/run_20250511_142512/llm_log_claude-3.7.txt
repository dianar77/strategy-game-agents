The game results indicate several key weaknesses to address:

### Key Weaknesses Identified:
1. **Victory Point Production**: The PromptRefiningLLMPlayer averaged only 5.4 VP compared to the opponent's 9.0 VP. This reveals poor VP generation, especially through settlements, cities, and development cards.
2. **City Development**: Only one city was built on average, while the opponent averaged over three cities. This indicates inefficiency in upgrading settlements to cities.
3. **Development Card Underutilization**: There was limited use of development cards (average 0.4 VP from cards vs. opponent's 0.0, but still insufficient).
4. **Settlements and Expansion**: Settlement-building matched the opponent, but road-building efforts were too limited to support expansion effectively.
5. **Robber Strategy**: It wasn’t clear if the robber was being used optimally to block opponent's key resources or stealing effectively.
6. **Resource Management and Trades**: Trades appeared suboptimal, as there was a struggle to consistently secure the necessary resources to build critical structures.

### Immediate Areas for Prompt Refinement:
- Early Game Placements: Emphasize strategic placement of the first settlements to ensure good access to key resources (brick, ore, wheat, wood).
- Resource Management: Introduce stronger trade and port strategies to adapt to resource shortages.
- City Development Priority: Focus on upgrading to cities earlier to generate more resources.
- Development Card Optimization: Prioritize buying development cards and using them strategically for VP and controlling the robber.
- Strategic Block and Robbing: Optimize robber placement to maximize disruption of the strongest opponent resource.

I will now refine the current prompt based on these observations and research more specific strategies. Let me read the current prompt to assess the current strategy focus.

You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN. That means 10 victory points.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>
6. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively
7. Think about the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)================================== Ai Message ==================================

The current prompt provides a solid framework for analyzing the game state but lacks precision in strategy across critical gameplay phases: early game placement, resource adaptation with trades, and long-term victory point production. I will refine the prompt to focus on these areas and research strategies that address the weaknesses outlined above.

### Immediate Improvements to the Prompt:
1. **Early-Game Placement**: Adjust building placement directives to prioritize high-production areas for critical resources such as brick, wheat, ore, and wood.
2. **Trade Optimization**: Include specific guidance on trade decisions (e.g., leveraging ports or initiating trades with other players aimed at deficits in key resources).
3. **Development Card Usage**: More emphasis on buying development cards for VP and powerful tools, like monopolies and knights for Largest Army.
4. **City Development Priority**: Add directives to prioritize upgrading settlements to cities early and consistently.
5. **Competitive Robber Placement**: Explicit guidance on targeting opponent's high-value resources and blocking their strongest tiles.

Let me search for expert strategies for early-game placement and city development first to refine these aspects of the prompt.

7. Think about the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action.

### Strategic Guidelines:
#### Early-Game Settlement Placement:
- Prioritize resource diversity with settlements, ensuring access to wheat, ore, and either brick or wood.
- Place first settlements on hexes with high probability (5, 6, 8, or 9 are ideal dice numbers).
- Secure access to ports if resource production is concentrated on a single type.
- Consider the potential to expand toward future settlement spots.

#### Mid-Game Resource Management and Expansion:
- Constantly evaluate shortages or surpluses of resources to plan trades or port usage effectively.
- Build roads strategically toward open high-value settlement spots or to cut off opponents.
- Prioritize upgrading settlements to cities as soon as you have the resources (focus on wheat and ore for cities).
- Trade aggressively, ensuring key resources (brick, ore, and wheat) are acquired for progress in settlements or cities.

#### Late-Game Victory Point Optimization:
- Focus on maximizing development card purchases to secure Largest Army or additional VP from hidden cards.
- Secure Longest Road if it’s within reach as a path to 10 VP.
- Convert settlements to cities to achieve a significant VP boost late-game.

#### Tactical Robber and Knight Strategy:
- Use the robber to block opponent hexes producing their most critical resource (e.g., wheat, ore for cities, or brick for settlements).
- Prioritize stealing from the leading player or the one delaying your progress.
- Unlock the Largest Army bonus quickly by playing knights strategically.

### Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers.
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile.
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex.
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section.
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy.
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1).================================= Tool Message =================================

Based on the results, the PromptRefiningLLMPlayer (BLUE) lost all games to AlphaBetaPlayer (RED). The following key weaknesses were observed:

### Key Weaknesses:
1. **Inefficient Resource Management:**
   - BLUE struggled to build roads and settlements effectively, as seen in an average of only 1.2 settlements and 0 cities per game.
   - RED consistently outperformed in cities, which are critical for generating larger resources and increasing victory points (VP).

2. **Poor Expansion Strategy:**
   - BLUE prioritized expansions such as building roads but was unable to capitalize on settling and expanding to lucrative areas.
   - Lack of strategic placement of initial settlements, which hindered access to high-yield resources.

3. **Suboptimal Use of Development Cards:**
   - With only 0.6 Development Card VP per game and limited use of Knights (0.4 for Largest Army), BLUE did not use Development Cards effectively.

4. **Ineffective Trading and Negotiations:**
   - Trading decisions were not aggressive or strategic enough to balance resources effectively and counter RED's dominance.
   - BLUE failed to utilize ports or trades optimally.

5. **Unfocused Robber Strategy:**
   - While robber placement targeted RED, it didn’t significantly disrupt their resource flow or strategy, as RED maintained dominance in resource accrual and expansion.

### Next Steps:
I will enhance the prompt based on targeted strategies to improve:
- **Early Game Placement**: Research opening strategies for initial settlements.
- **Resource Management**: Focus on balance and priorities for resource usage.
- **Development Cards**: Emphasize acquiring Knights and Victory Points.
- **Robber Strategy**: Adopt a more disruptive approach to hinder RED’s key resources.
- **Trading and Ports**: Leverage trades and port benefits effectively.

### Action Plan:
1. Research key strategies for:
   - Early game settlement placement.
   - Optimal use of Development Cards.
   - Effective trading strategies.
   - Robber placement strategies.
2. Update the prompt with detailed improvements for these areas.
3. Retest with the updated prompt.

First, I will research strategies for Early Game Settlement Placement.

You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN. That means 10 victory points.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>
6. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively
7. Think about the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)================================== Ai Message ==================================

As the web search tool encounters issues, I'll proceed by inserting well-documented strategies based on known principles of the game to improve the prompt for the PromptRefiningLLMPlayer.

### Improvements to the Prompt Strategy (Based on Observed Weaknesses and General Catan Strategies):
1. **Early Game Placement:**
   - Focus on obtaining a balance of high-frequency resource tiles (with numbers like 6, 8, or 9) for essential resources, including 🌾WHEAT, 🌲WOOD, and 🧱BRICK.
   - Place the first settlement near diverse resource tiles for balance, and the second near ports or unique resource access.
   - Prioritize settlement placement that maximizes early resource income critical for expansion (wood and brick).

2. **Resource Management:**
   - Assess resource rolls frequently to understand current strengths and gaps. Plan trades or port utilization to balance shortages.
   - Avoid hoarding resources unnecessarily when vulnerable to robber attacks.

3. **Development Cards:**
   - Highlight the strategic importance of Knights for Largest Army (2 Victory Points) and blocking opponents’ resources.
   - Identify game states suited for Victory Points development cards or using Monopoly and Year of Plenty cards strategically.

4. **Trading and Negotiation:**
   - Utilize trades aggressively with both players or ports to avoid resource bottlenecks.
   - Avoid trades that directly empower the leading opponent or risk setting them up for crucial builds.

5. **Robber Strategy:**
   - Target tiles that are key to competitors’ primary resources, e.g., if RED depends heavily on 🌾WHEAT, block their 6 or 8 wheat tiles.
   - Time robber placements to create the greatest disruption on opponents while maximizing opportunity for steals.

### Updated Prompt:
I'll incorporate these into the prompt text and improve formatting for clarity.

7. Think about the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action.

--- Prioritize these strategies to increase your win chances ---

### EARLY GAME PLACEMENT:
- Place your first settlements on high-yield tiles with dice values like 6, 8, or 9. Balance essential resources such as 🌾WHEAT, 🌲WOOD, and 🧱BRICK.
- Ensure diverse resource income with the first settlement and position the second settlement near ports or less-accessible resources.
- Prioritize settlements on tiles that maximize early production for road and settlement expansion.

### RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Continuously analyze recent rolls to identify overproduced and underproduced resources.
- Trade or use ports strategically to address resource shortages before they hamper progress.
- Avoid hoarding large amounts of resources where possible, as this invites robber attacks.

### DEVELOPMENT CARDS:
- Aim to secure the Largest Army by prioritizing Knight cards (2 Victory Points).
- Use Monopoly and Year of Plenty cards tactically to amass resources for critical builds.
- Purchase Development Cards when resource-rich to capitalize on Victory Points or disruptive effects.

### TRADING & NEGOTIATION:
- Proactively trade to secure missing resources. Ports are essential to benefit from favorable trading rates.
- Be wary of trades that directly empower competitors, especially the leading player.

### ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on high-production tiles (6 or 8 dice values) that are crucial to opponents’ strategies.
- Target resources most critical for immediate disruption, like wheat-heavy tiles to slow city upgrades.
- Optimize robber placement for maximum resource stealin while minimizing retaliation risk.

### EFFICIENCY IN ACTION:
- Combine actions where possible (e.g., build a road while planning settlement placement in the next turn).
- Focus on victory points—not just expansion—especially as the game progresses toward mid to late game.

The outcomes from the test games reveal several critical weaknesses in the PromptRefiningLLMPlayer's strategy:

### Weaknesses Identified:
1. **Early Game Placement Strategy:**
   - PromptRefiningLLMPlayer has significantly lower settlement and city placement compared to the AlphaBetaPlayer. This indicates poor early-game resource production and suboptimal initial settlement placements.

2. **Mid-Game Resource Management:**
   - The LLMPlayer collects development cards excessively, likely leading to under-investment in settlements, cities, and roads during critical momentum-building phases. This also suggests inefficient resource prioritization.

3. **Late-Game Victory Point Optimization:**
   - The LLMPlayer fails to capitalize on its largest army or roads, and its converted points through Development Cards are minimal. This implies a lack of effective planning to secure additional VP on-field or through card strategies.

4. **Trading and Negotiation:**
   - There is no evidence in the logs that the player is attempting trades, which could significantly mitigate resource scarcity and improve flexibility.

5. **Robber Placement Strategy:**
   - While the PromptRefiningLLMPlayer targets opponents’ production with the robber, key opponents (like RED) continue thriving. This indicates ineffective targeting for robber placement and resource-stealing strategy.

### Plan:
To address these weaknesses, I will:
- Research **early-game settlement placement strategies** to maximize resource diversity and production.
- Improve **resource management tactics** to prioritize building infrastructure (settlements, cities) during the mid-game.
- Enhance **late-game planning** by emphasizing securing Longest Road and Largest Army while balancing development and settlement builds.
- Investigate **trade negotiation strategies** to facilitate resource access.
- Optimize **robber placement logic** to hinder opponents effectively and balance retaliation risks.

First, let me research early-game settlement placement strategies and mid-game resource prioritization.

You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN. That means 10 victory points.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>
6. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively
7. Think about the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)================================== Ai Message ==================================

The current prompt provides a solid foundation but lacks targeted guidance and advanced strategies to address the weaknesses identified. I will now rewrite and provide detailed improvements under each strategy aspect:

### Improvements:

1. **Early Game Placement:**
   - Integrate specific advice about choosing nodes with higher resource probabilities and balanced resource types (e.g., brick, wood, wheat).
   - Emphasize prioritizing a mix of high-production numbers (8, 6, 5) and diversity to prevent resource bottlenecks.

2. **Mid-Game Resource Management:**
   - Reinforce the importance of balancing Development Cards, settlement expansion, and city upgrades without over-investing in one.
   - Highlight the urgency of securing high-demand resources through targeted trades or robber plays.

3. **Late-Game Victory Point Optimization:**
   - Include a focus on securing Longest Road or Largest Army for guaranteed VPs.
   - Stress efficient conversion of surplus resources into cities and additional development cards.

4. **Trading and Negotiation:**
   - Provide guidance on initiating trades with opponents, focusing on critical resources needed to complete current plans (e.g., wheat or ore for cities).

5. **Robber Placement Strategy:**
   - Add clarity on targeting opponents with the leading VP or the best resource positions.
   - Suggest balancing offensive robber placement with self-protection to avoid retaliation.

### Prompt Rewrite:
I will now rewrite the prompt incorporating these detailed strategies.

    new_text: You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions.
2. Your aim is to WIN. That means reaching 10 Victory Points (VP) by building settlements, cities, roads, and strategic use of development cards.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number.
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like: <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>.
6. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively.
7. Plan the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action, and align your moves with your long-term strategy.

### Strategy Guidelines

#### Early Game Placement:
- Prioritize settlement placements on nodes with the highest combined probability values (e.g., 8, 6, 5 dice numbers).
- Aim for diverse resource production, ensuring access to **brick**, **wood**, and **wheat** for early settlements and roads.
- Consider proximity to ports that improve trading flexibility (e.g., 3:1 generic ports or specific 2:1 ports for key resources).

#### Mid-Game Resource Management:
- Balance investment across settlements, cities, roads, and development cards—avoid over-prioritizing one aspect.
- Identify resource shortages and resolve them through:
  1. Smart trading with opponents who overproduce those resources.
  2. Targeting opponents' high-production tiles with the robber.
- Plan road-building to expand settlement opportunities or block opponents strategically.

#### Late-Game Victory Point Optimization:
- Secure **Largest Army** or **Longest Road**, as they provide guaranteed VP boosts.
  - Focus on building 2-3 roads consecutively to claim Longest Road if you have expansion opportunities.
  - Maintain at least 3 Knights to secure Largest Army.
- Convert excess resources effectively into cities or additional development cards.
- Ensure a mix of visible (settlement/city) and hidden (development card) points to confuse opponents.

#### Trading and Negotiation:
- Regularly propose trades targeting critical resources (e.g., wheat or ore for cities, brick or wood for roads).
- Offer resources you overproduce to receive those you lack.
- Trade strategically to prevent opponents from completing their plans.

#### Robber Placement Strategy:
- Target hexes that:
  1. Block opponents' highest resource production tiles.
  2. Affect opponents with the leading VP total or immediate threat potential.
- Steal resources based on your current needs (e.g., wheat, ore for city upgrades).
- Balance offensive robber placement with self-protection to minimize retaliation.

### Advanced Tips:
1. Always evaluate the trade-off between immediate resource gains and long-term board control.
2. Monitor opponents’ actions to determine their strategies and block them effectively.
3. Stay adaptable. If an opportunity arises to claim a port, settlement, or Longest Road, adjust your plans accordingly.
