It seems like our PromptRefiningLLMPlayer (BLUE) has lost all 5 games and performed significantly worse than the AlphaBetaPlayer (RED). Let's analyze the weaknesses and key areas for improvement:

### Observed Weaknesses
1. **Early Game Placement Strategy**:
   - RED consistently managed to achieve better resource positions, leading to stronger setups in the opening phase.
   - BLUE's settlements are likely suboptimal, resulting in inefficient resource generation.

2. **City Building**:
   - RED averaged 2.8 cities per game, while BLUE only averaged 0.4 cities, indicating poor focus on ore and wheat collection necessary for upgrading settlements.

3. **Road Network**:
   - BLUE constructed no roads compared to RED's average of 1. This suggests a lack of attention toward expanding or setting up longest road potential.

4. **Development Cards and Robber Play**:
   - RED seems to have outperformed in terms of development cards and leveraging the robber effectively. BLUE's usage of development cards lacked a clear focus, and even when the robber was used, strategic impact was minimal.

5. **Trade and Resource Management**:
   - BLUE likely faced resource constraints without any notable effort to mitigate this through trades, prioritizing critical resources, or card strategy.

### Plan for Improvement
1. Research **early settlement placement strategies** to improve resource diversity and positioning in the initial phases.
2. Focus on a **wheat and ore-heavy strategy** to enable consistent city upgrades.
3. Incorporate strategies to **build and extend roads**, not just to expand but also for competing for the Longest Road.
4. Improve **robber placement logic** to hinder RED's critical resource generation further.
5. Research effective **mid-game trading** strategies to optimize resource collection.
6. Sharpen **development card strategies**, focusing on Largest Army or using specific cards (like Year of Plenty) to fill resource gaps.

### Next Steps
1. Conduct research into optimal early game placements and general strategies for a robust start in Catan.
2. Update the prompt with findings to include better initial setup strategies, mid-game resource management, and improved use of development cards.

Let's begin by researching early settlement placement strategies, particularly with a focus on setups favorable against an aggressive player like RED.

The current prompt establishes some key decision-making steps, but it lacks specificity in critical areas like initial settlement placement and mid-game resource optimization. To improve the win rate of the PromptRefiningLLMPlayer, we must enhance the prompt by embedding researched strategies directly into it.

Since the web search tool isn't functional, I'll now integrate known strategies for settlement placement and mid-game optimization based on Catan knowledge. Then, I will refine the rest of the prompt to address observed weaknesses.

Strategic Guidelines:
### Early Game Placement Strategy
- Prioritize settlement placements that maximize access to diverse resources (wood, brick, wheat, ore, and sheep) and target high-probability tiles based on dice rolls (e.g., 8, 6, 5, 9).
- Look for placements that ensure at least one strong resource pair for early development: (wood + brick) or (wheat + ore).
- Secure access to ports where possible, especially if you have concentrated resource production (e.g., 3:1 general port or resource-specific ports).

### Mid-Game Resource Management
- Always evaluate your resource collection to ensure a balance between key resources. Trade aggressively with opponents or use ports to convert excess resources into those you lack.
- If you’re resource-starved, focus on buying development cards to gain "Year of Plenty" or "Monopoly" to stabilize your resource flow.
- Expand roads only when it opens up valuable settlement spots or blocks opponents strategically.

### Late-Game Victory Points
- Transition focus to city upgrades once you have multiple productive settlements, particularly around high-frequency tiles.
- Aim to secure Largest Army or Longest Road for crucial extra points. If feasible, prioritize building cities and settlements to reach the 10-point threshold.

### Robber Placement Strategy
- Target tiles that block key resources for the leading player (e.g., RED's wheat or ore if they are building cities aggressively).
- Avoid placing the robber on tiles that excessively harm your own production unless it is critical to stop an opponent from winning. Always steal from the likely leader.

### Development Card Usage
- Knights: Use aggressively early to block opponents and secure Largest Army.
- Victory Points: Remember these contribute directly to your score; consider them when planning the final victory point push.
- "Year of Plenty"/"Monopoly": Time these cards for maximum impact, especially when resources are scarce or opponents are hoarding.
- "Road Building": Use strategically to secure key expansion routes or contest Longest Road.

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers.
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile.
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex.
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section.
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy.

The results highlight several key weaknesses in our PromptRefiningLLMPlayer:

1. **Early Game Setup**: The AlphaBetaPlayer consistently acquires settlements and cities faster than PromptRefiningLLMPlayer.
2. **Resource Management**: There is room for improvement in trading and optimizing resource acquisition.
3. **Development Card Usage**: The use of resources for purchasing development cards is not yielding enough tactical advantage.
4. **Robber Strategy**: Robber placement is focused exclusively on RED, but it may not be sufficiently effective at slowing RED's progress.
5. **Victory Point Optimization and Speed**: RED consistently wins due to higher VP generation rates and a faster progression toward end-game settlements and cities.

## Next Steps:
I will research specific strategies for early placement setup and mid-game resource management improvements as these have the most significant impact on the overall game outcome. Then, I'll refine the current prompt with detailed instructions based on the findings.

Let's start by researching early game placement strategies.

It seems the web search tool isn't functioning due to a missing API key. Instead, I will focus on refining the prompt using existing strategies and gameplay insights based on past experiences and analysis.

I will read the current prompt and identify where adjustments can be made.

You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN. That means 10 victory points.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>
6. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively
7. Think about the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)================================== Ai Message ==================================

Here's the plan to improve the current prompt with details targeting early game placement, resource optimization, and strategic foresight:

### Improvement Segments
1. Early Game Placement Strategy:
   - Emphasize high dice value tiles and access to diverse resource types.
   - Prioritize settlement placement near ports for better trading options early on.

2. Resource Management & Trading Strategy:
   - Introduce guidelines for optimizing resources by prioritizing trades to offset shortages relative to strategic goals (growth vs cards).

3. Development Card Usage and Robber Placement:
   - Add a heuristic for utilizing development cards strategically—prioritize largest army to extend VP and use robber placement to target high-value resource generation for the opponent.

4. Planning for Victory Points Optimization:
   - Reinforce proactive strategies for acquiring VP beyond settlements/cities by focusing on largest army and development card usage.

### Update Current Prompt
I will now rewrite the prompt with these focused improvements.

7. Think about the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action

Strategic Guidelines:
- **Early Game Placement**:
   1. Prioritize settlements at high-probability (dice roll) tiles to maximize resource generation.
   2. Ensure access to a balanced mix of resources (🌾WHEAT, 🐑SHEEP, 🌲WOOD, 🧱BRICK, and ⛏️ORE).
   3. Settle near ports early to enable better trades (e.g., 3:1 or 2:1 rates).

- **Mid-Game Resource Management**:
   1. Use trading (with players or ports) to mitigate resource shortages and to align resources toward strategic goals (e.g., city-building or road-building).
   2. Avoid trades that disproportionately benefit opponents—analyze their VP and resource needs before trading.

- **Development Cards**:
   1. Purchase development cards to unlock Largest Army VP potential or secure resource-monopolizing capabilities through Year of Plenty and Monopoly.

- **Robber Placement**:
   1. Always place the robber to hinder the opponent's primary resource generation.
   2. Prioritize blocking opponents who are close to winning or making significant progress.

- **Victory Point Progression**:
   1. Balance between conducting strategic trades and focusing on city upgrades to maximize VP gain.
   2. Actively pursue Largest Army and development card use as supplementary strategies for VP advancement.

I’ve refined the prompt to address key weaknesses, particularly improving:
1. **Early game placement** by emphasizing placements with high dice probabilities and resource diversity near ports.
2. **Mid-game resource management** by optimizing trades and ensuring they align with strategic goals.
3. **Development card usage** to include a focus on Largest Army and targeted gameplay advantages.
4. **Robber strategy** with a heuristic to hinder opponent progress effectively.

The results suggest the PromptRefiningLLMPlayer suffers from several weaknesses, including poor early-game placement, inefficient resource management, and a lack of strategy for competing in key victory avenues such as settlement building, city upgrades, and road/army dominance. Let's focus on the following observations:

### Key Weaknesses:
1. **Early Game Placement**: The player is not choosing optimal starting positions, leading to resource shortages (e.g., ore and wheat, which are critical for cities and development cards).
2. **Mid-Game Resource Management**: The player struggles with securing resources critical for expansions, city upgrades, and development card purchases.
3. **Late-Game Execution**: The player fails to compete effectively for Longest Road or Largest Army and struggles to prioritize efficient point accumulation.
4. **Trading and Negotiation**: The player is not leveraging trades to mitigate resource locking effectively.

### Strategic Improvements:
We need to incorporate techniques for better initial placement, more efficient use of resources, and adaptability with trading and settlement expansion. I'll start by researching placement strategies and other mid-to-late-game optimization concepts.

You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN. That means 10 victory points.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>
6. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively
7. Think about the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)================================== Ai Message ==================================

To address the player's weaknesses based on their performance, the prompt must incorporate robust strategies and guidelines. Here’s how I plan to improve the prompt:

1. Add explicit focus on **optimal initial placement strategy**, emphasizing balanced resource collection (wheat, ore, and brick/wood priority), and access to high-frequency dice rolls.
2. Guide the player on **robust mid-game resource management**, including building roads towards key expansion spots and utilizing resource-heavy ports.
3. Include **clear late-game goals**, like actively competing for Longest Road, Largest Army, and maximizing Victory Point development cards.
4. Address **trading opportunities** as an essential way to counter resource roadblocks throughout the game.

Now, I'll refine the prompt with these insights and improvements.

Strategy Guidelines:
- **Early Game Placement Priorities**: Choose starting positions near hexes with high-frequency dice rolls and diverse resources (aim for 🌾WHEAT, ⛏️ORE, and 🧱BRICK/🌲WOOD). Balance resource collection and prioritize nodes with access to ports for future trades.
- **Mid-Game Resource Management**: Build roads and expand toward critical settlement nodes to secure missing resources. Prioritize settlement expansion near highly productive tiles and ports for resource optimization.
- **Trading and Negotiation**: Actively trade with opponents or ports to address resource shortages. Be strategic in trading to advance your goals without aiding opponents significantly.
- **Late Game Optimization**: Focus on gaining Victory Points through city upgrades, development cards, and competing for Longest Road/Largest Army. Use development cards (knights) strategically to control the robber and disrupt opponents.
- **Robber Placement**: Place the robber on opponent tiles producing critical resources. Steal strategically to gain missing resources for your plan.

Based on the results from the previous set of games, there are several notable weaknesses in the PromptRefiningLLMPlayer's strategy. These weaknesses include:

1. **Early Game Placement Strategy**: The opponent (AlphaBetaPlayer) consistently built strong early positions and gained resources more efficiently. Our player did not place settlements effectively to secure diversified and highly productive resources.

2. **Mid-Game Resource Management**: The player struggled with resource scarcity, particularly of brick and ore. This limited their ability to build settlements and cities, reducing development effectiveness.

3. **Late Game Victory Point Optimization**: The player failed to keep up in the race for 10 Victory Points. It struggled to leverage potential strategies such as Longest Road, Largest Army, or development card advantages.

4. **Development Cards and Robber Strategy**: Although the player used development cards, the usage of the robber was not always optimal for maximum disruption, and Knight accumulation was insufficient to contest Largest Army.

5. **Trading and Negotiation**: The player infrequently utilized trades and did not capitalize on efficient ports or in-game trading opportunities to overcome resource shortages.

### Plan for Improvement:

- Research effective **starting placement strategies** to secure high-probability hexes and ports.
- Refine **resource prioritization** during mid-game to ensure a constant supply of critical resources such as ore and wheat for city upgrades.
- Look for strategies on long-term **victory point optimization** through Largest Army, Longest Road, and settlement/city maximization.
- Enhance use of **trading and ports** to reduce dependence on luck for resource acquisition.
- Improve the use of the **robber** to selectively block the opponent's most productive tiles.

I will now search for research and strategies covering these areas.

You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN. That means 10 victory points.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>
6. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively
7. Think about the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)================================== Ai Message ==================================

The prompt provides a good starting point but requires targeted updates to address the weaknesses identified in the game results.

### Updates to the Prompt:
1. **Early Game Placement Strategy**: Add criteria for settlements that prioritize proximity to high-probability resource tiles (8, 6, 5). Explain the value of diversity in resources and port access.

2. **Mid-Game Resource Management**: Provide explicit instructions to prioritize resource accumulation by analyzing scarcity and abundance, with a focus on obtaining ore and wheat. Add strategies for using trades and ports strategically to overcome shortages.

3. **Late Game Victory Point Strategy**: Include guidance on adapting the plan to target victory points through Longest Road/Largest Army while maintaining flexibility for settlement and city expansion.

4. **Robber Strategy**: Emphasize its use not only to block critical tiles but strategically to maximize disruption of the opponent’s development.

5. **Development Card Usage**: Explicitly guide the player to analyze the situational use of development cards (e.g., Knights for Largest Army, specific cards like Monopoly).

I will now update the prompt with these targeted refinements.

Early Game Placement Strategy:
- Prioritize settlement placements on hexes with high dice probabilities (8, 6, 5), ensuring a balance of diverse resources (especially wood, brick, wheat, and ore).
- Consider proximity to ports, specifically versatile 3:1 ports or specialized ports for scarce resources.
- Avoid resource overlap between initial settlements unless aiming to monopolize critical resources.

Mid-Game Resource Management:
- Regularly analyze resource scarcity and abundance, prioritizing trades or robber placement to address shortages.
- Focus on accumulating ore and wheat for city upgrades.
- Use ports strategically to convert excess resources, aiming to streamline settlement or city plans.

Late Game Victory Point Optimization:
- Identify opportunities to secure Largest Army or Longest Road proactively.
- Balance between upgrading settlements to cities and leveraging development cards for victory points.
- Regularly revisit your strategic plan to optimize resource allocation and disruption of the opponent’s progress.

Development Card Usage:
- Accumulate Knights early to compete for Largest Army.
- Leverage situational cards (e.g., Monopoly to monopolize scarce resources or Road Building to capture Longest Road).
- Keep an active count on the opponent’s progress to use the timing of cards strategically.

Robber Strategy:
- Maximize disruption by targeting hexes critical to the opponent’s resource generation, prioritizing high-probability tiles.
- When tied for disruption value, prioritize blocking the opponent’s dominant resource or highest dice number.
- Use robber placement to redirect resources toward achieving your next target (settlement, city, or card).

Trading Strategy:
- Initiate trades actively to cover resource gaps or gain advantage in critical resources.
- Avoid trades that enable the opponent’s known strategic priorities (e.g., settlements, cities).
- Use ports strategically to convert excess resources at efficient rates and maintain momentum.================================= Tool Message =================================
