Updated plan: 1. Buy a Development Card (this turn).
2. Analyze the card drawn:
   - If it's a Knight, use it to move the robber and block Red’s high-production tiles (e.g., 🧱5 or 🌲9).
   - If it's a VP card, keep it hidden and continue resource accumulation.
3. Begin trading aggressively for wood and brick to build a road toward node 5 to secure 🧱brick production.
4. Prioritize road expansion toward node 22 (🐑10 port) or node 5, whichever is more feasible.
5. Once brick production is secured (node 5), focus on upgrading cities (e.g., node 4) for extra VP.

Updated plan: 1. **Road Expansion Toward Node 5:** To gain 🧱brick, secure node 5 by building a road from node 4. With both 🌲wood and 🧱brick, your early-game building potential increases significantly.
2. **Port Access:** Later, aim for the 🐑2:1 port near node 22. With 🐑10 producing sheep, the port will allow you to trade excess 🐑sheep efficiently.
3. **City Upgrades:** Prioritize upgrading your settlement at node 4 to a city for extra resource production. This will help in securing development cards or additional city upgrades for Victory Points.
4. **Strategic Use of Monopoly Card:** Save the card for a critical moment when opponents hold significant resources (e.g., during late-game city upgrades or settlement expansions).

Updated plan: 1. Prioritize resource gathering. Build roads toward the most promising settlement spots when you secure brick and wood.
2. Hold onto the Monopoly card until RED shows clear accumulation of wheat or ore, at which point you can use it to upgrade settlements to cities.
3. Target securing a port (3:1 or specific) to increase trade flexibility. The path toward a 3:1 port (near Node 5 or similar) seems viable.
4. Longer term: Compete for Longest Road if RED expands further, or pivot toward Largest Army by buying development cards when resources allow.
LLM chose action 5: End your turn
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2622 chars)
Updated plan: 1. **Short-Term Goal**: Gather resources to build at least one road toward the 3:1 port or another viable settlement spot. Use the Monopoly card when the opportunity arises (preferably targeting Wheat or Ore).
2. **Mid-Term Goal**: Secure a third settlement at a high-production node or port, then upgrade one settlement to a city by acquiring Ore and Wheat. Aim for flexible trading through a 3:1 port.
3. **Long-Term Goal**: Prepare to contest the Largest Army by purchasing development cards or pivot to Longest Road if we expand effectively.
LLM chose action 5: Roll the dice
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2619 chars)
Updated plan: 1. **Immediate Plan:** Play Monopoly on Brick to gather enough for a road. Build 1-2 roads toward the 3:1 port or another viable settlement node next turn.
2. **Next Turn Strategy:** Use resources from rolls and trades to build a settlement at your chosen location. Prioritize positions with strong production (🌾Wheat, ⛏️Ore, 🐑Sheep).
3. **Long-Term Goal:** Secure the port for flexible trades, upgrade to cities when possible, and contest Longest Road to boost VP visibility.

Based on the analysis, I'll outline the next few moves to advance your game toward winning:

<plan>
1. Roll the dice to gain resources. Focus on accumulating brick and ore for building roads and upgrading settlements to cities. These contribute directly to VP growth.
2. Prioritize reaching the 3:1 port near nodes 16 and 20 via road-building for trade flexibility. This helps overcome resource shortages.
3. Use development cards (Knights) to secure Largest Army for VP. Continue purchasing development cards, especially since wheat and sheep are in good supply.
LLM chose action 1: Roll the dice
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2607 chars)
Updated plan: 1. Move the robber to **(0, 1, -1)** to block RED's wheat production and steal a resource.
2. Trade or use stolen resources to prepare for either road-building (toward the port near nodes 16 and 20) or a development card (to unlock Largest Army progress).
3. Continue expanding roads strategically to reach the port or block RED's expansion.
4. Prioritize upgrading settlements to cities as resources become available.
