You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN. That means 10 victory points.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>
6. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively
7. Think about the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action

Strategy Guidelines:
- **Early Game Placement Priorities**: Choose starting positions near hexes with high-frequency dice rolls and diverse resources (aim for üåæWHEAT, ‚õèÔ∏èORE, and üß±BRICK/üå≤WOOD). Balance resource collection and prioritize nodes with access to ports for future trades.
- **Mid-Game Resource Management**: Build roads and expand toward critical settlement nodes to secure missing resources. Prioritize settlement expansion near highly productive tiles and ports for resource optimization.
- **Trading and Negotiation**: Actively trade with opponents or ports to address resource shortages. Be strategic in trading to advance your goals without aiding opponents significantly.
- **Late Game Optimization**: Focus on gaining Victory Points through city upgrades, development cards, and competing for Longest Road/Largest Army. Use development cards (knights) strategically to control the robber and disrupt opponents.
- **Robber Placement**: Place the robber on opponent tiles producing critical resources. Steal strategically to gain missing resources for your plan.

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- üîç marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)
