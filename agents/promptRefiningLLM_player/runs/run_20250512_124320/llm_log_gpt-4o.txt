You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN. That means 10 victory points.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>
6. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively
7. Think about the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- üîç marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)================================== Ai Message ==================================

Looking at the game results, our player has performed poorly‚Äîthere are no wins and very low victory points. A key observation from the logs shows that our player is potentially struggling in the following areas:

1. Early game placement strategy: The opposing player quickly obtains settlements and cities, indicating better initial settlement placements.
2. Mid-game resource management: The average resources collected are not effectively leading to impactful developments (e.g., upgrades to cities or roads).
3. Victory point path: Our player doesn't appear to strategize around achieving victory points via settlements, cities, roads, or development cards.
4. Robber placement: No evidence suggests effective use of the robber to weaken opponents.

To address these issues, I will focus on:
- Improving early placement strategy for highly productive tiles and strategic nodes (ports).
- Enhancing mid-game resource utilization to upgrade settlements to cities and acquire development cards when required.
- Implementing better planning for consistent victory point growth.
- Improving how the robber is used to block high-value resources from the opponent.

I'll begin by researching improvements to early game settlement placement.

There was an error in performing the web search. To overcome this, I'll use my expertise to clearly refine the placement strategy within the prompt based on common early-game settlement placement rules:

1. Prioritize high-frequency numbers (6s and 8s) linked to key resources: wood, brick, wheat, and ore.
2. Ensure a balanced distribution of resources to avoid bottlenecks, aiming for variety.
3. Prioritize access to ports if available, especially those aligned with collected resources.
4. Block opponents from access to valuable nodes whenever possible.

I will now incorporate these strategies into the existing prompt.

From the game results, a few observations can be made about our player's weaknesses and opportunities for improvement:

### Key Weaknesses:
1. **Early Game Placement**: Our player likely struggles with optimal settlement and road placement at the start of the game. This is evident from "AVG SETTLES" (2.0), which indicates poor placement strategy or inefficiency in acquiring settlements.
2. **Resource Efficiency**: With "AVG CITIES" at 0.0, it‚Äôs apparent our player doesn‚Äôt effectively transition from settlements to city upgrades.
3. **Road Building**: The "AVG ROAD" at just 0.0 shows a lack of road-building activity, preventing the player from securing "Longest Road" points.
4. **Development Card Usage**: "AVG ARMY" and "AVG DEV VP" at 0.0 highlight an underutilization of development cards, which could help in gaining "Largest Army" and stealth victory points.
5. **Lack of Trading & Adaptiveness**: Because the player isn‚Äôt scaling well, it‚Äôs likely there are suboptimal trading strategies in play.

### Improvement Steps:
1. Research effective early-game settlement and road placement strategies (e.g., prioritizing high-yield resources and high-probability rolls).
2. Address mid-game inefficiency by finding strategies to transition quickly to cities and investing in roads and development cards.
3. Improve robber placement and general player interference tactics to disrupt more skilled opponents like AlphaBetaPlayer.
4. Reinforce optimal trading strategies to ensure the player accesses missing resources faster.

### Immediate Next Steps:
I will now research **effective Catan early game settlement placement strategy** and **city-building transitions** to address the two glaring issues: poor settlement placement and lack of cities or progression into mid-game power positions.

The current prompt provides basic rules and structure, but lacks specificity in strategies anywhere along the gameplay stages. Targeted strategies must be incorporated to address weaknesses analyzed from the previous game results. Here's my plan for improving the prompt:

1. **Early Game Placement Strategy**: Guide the player to prioritize high-resource yield tiles and access to diverse resources.
2. **Mid-Game Transition (Settlements ‚Üí Cities)**: Emphasize securing sufficient wheat and ore for upgrading settlements to cities as a priority.
3. **Road Building for Longest Road**: Include consideration for positioning roads to capture "Longest Road" points while blocking opponents.
4. **Development Card Usage**: Incentivize buying development cards early and deploying them for "Largest Army" and other advantages.
5. **Trading Optimization**: Encourage more aggressive trading to ensure resources are consistently balanced towards goals.

### Step-by-Step Enhancement Process:
1. **Research early game settlement placement**: Since I encountered an issue with the web search tool, I'll retrieve an alternative search or craft this strategy based on known best practices.
2. Begin incrementally refining the prompt for strategies once I have well-researched details.

I will now enhance the current prompt with improved strategies for early game settlement and resources.

Strategies:

**Early Game Settlement Placement**:
- Prioritize locations with high-frequency dice rolls (6, 8) for critical resources like brick, wheat, and ore.
- Balance access to a diverse set of resources (brick, wood, sheep, wheat, ore).
- Choose at least one location with proximity to a harbor for trading flexibility.

**Mid-Game Strategy (Settlements to Cities)**:
- Focus on collecting sufficient wheat and ore to upgrade settlements to cities as quickly as possible.
- Build new settlements on nodes with high yield or to block opponents' expansion.

**Road Building for Longest Road**:
- Strategically place roads to capture "Longest Road" points while aiming to reach critical ports or key expansion areas.
- Use roads to block opponents' access to valuable locations where needed.

**Development Card Usage**:
- Buy development cards early and frequently to secure "Largest Army" and obtain victory points.
- Use knights strategically to move the robber and block opponents' key resources.

**Trading Optimization**:
- Leverage trades aggressively to offset gaps in resource production.
- Target harbors that reduce the trade ratio (e.g., 2:1 harbors matching your surplus resource).

**Robber Placement Strategy**:
- Place the robber on your opponent's most critical resource tiles to hinder their progress.
- Avoid blocking tiles you depend heavily on unless absolutely necessary.
