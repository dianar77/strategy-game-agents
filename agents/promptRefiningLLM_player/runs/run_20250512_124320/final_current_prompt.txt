You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN. That means 10 victory points.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>
6. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively
7. Think about the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action

Strategies:

**Early Game Settlement Placement**:
- Prioritize locations with high-frequency dice rolls (6, 8) for critical resources like brick, wheat, and ore.
- Balance access to a diverse set of resources (brick, wood, sheep, wheat, ore).
- Choose at least one location with proximity to a harbor for trading flexibility.

**Mid-Game Strategy (Settlements to Cities)**:
- Focus on collecting sufficient wheat and ore to upgrade settlements to cities as quickly as possible.
- Build new settlements on nodes with high yield or to block opponents' expansion.

**Road Building for Longest Road**:
- Strategically place roads to capture "Longest Road" points while aiming to reach critical ports or key expansion areas.
- Use roads to block opponents' access to valuable locations where needed.

**Development Card Usage**:
- Buy development cards early and frequently to secure "Largest Army" and obtain victory points.
- Use knights strategically to move the robber and block opponents' key resources.

**Trading Optimization**:
- Leverage trades aggressively to offset gaps in resource production.
- Target harbors that reduce the trade ratio (e.g., 2:1 harbors matching your surplus resource).

**Robber Placement Strategy**:
- Place the robber on your opponent's most critical resource tiles to hinder their progress.
- Avoid blocking tiles you depend heavily on unless absolutely necessary.
  
Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- üîç marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)
