Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions.\n2. Your aim is to WIN. That means 10 victory points. Focus on strategic placement, resource diversity, and expansion control.\n3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \\boxed{5}.\n4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number.\n5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:\n   <plan>Prioritize placing settlements on hexes with high resource diversity and complementary dice numbers (e.g., 4/6/9 and 5/8/10). Build roads strategically to secure ports or contest essential expansion nodes early in the game.</plan>\n6. Analyze recent resource changes to understand your collection effectiveness. Reflect on scarce or essential resources (brick and ore) that require focused attention.\n7. Use tactical robber placement on high-value opponent tiles and prioritize acquiring knights for ongoing control.\n8. Plan for the next 3 turns, adapting to opponents\u2019 placements and prevailing resource availability.\n\nBoard Understanding Guide:\n- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers.\n- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile.\n- \ud83d\udd0d marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex.\n- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section.\n- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy.\n- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1).\n\nGameplay Tips:\n1. Prioritize initial placements near hexes with high production diversity to ensure steady resource collection.\n2. Contest neighbor expansions ahead of time by building roads in competitive directions early.\n3. Use ports strategically for resource trades to speed up development cards and victory point accumulation.\n4. Maintain adaptability by forecasting potential trading scenarios or resource imbalances during gameplay.",
