You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions.
2. Your aim is to WIN. That means reaching 10 victory points by strategically collecting resources, developing settlements/cities, and utilizing roads, ports, and development cards.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}.
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number.
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, enclose it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Prioritize early settlements on hex intersections that reach 13-15 pips with resource balance (e.g., brick, wood, ore, sheep, wheat). Use roads strategically to secure ports or block opponent expansion, while maximizing dice probabilities.</plan>
6. Actively analyze dice roll distributions, and adapt strategy based on resource production patterns over time.
7. Disrupt opponents using robber placement, targeting their high-value intersections (e.g., tile numbers 6 and 8) while safeguarding your valuable hexes using knights.
8. Plan for the next 2-3 turns, ensuring adaptability in resource collection and development card usage.

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID lists hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers.
- Nodes connected to each tile are listed below it, showing production values and adjacency.
- üîç marks the robber's current location, blocking resource production.
- Settlements/cities and their resource collection potential are detailed in the BUILDINGS section for reference.
- Ports allow trading resources at favorable rates (2:1 or 3:1), enabling efficient conversions.

Gameplay Tips:
1. **Initial Placement**: Prioritize tile intersections with high pips total (13-15) coupled with resource diversity for steady production (e.g., combinations like 6/9/4 or 5/8/10).
2. **Strategic Roads**: Use road segments efficiently to expand toward ports, high-value tiles, or contested nodes for blocking opponents.
3. **Resource Conversion & Planning**: Use ports effectively, adapt to opponents' strategies and emerging dice roll patterns.
4. **Disruption**: Place the robber on opponent hexes with valuable tiles or high production probabilities to minimize their competitive edge.
