<Document href="https://medium.com/@noahmiller400/ultimate-strategy-guide-to-starting-settlements-in-catan-2a55be1819be"/>
As a rule of thumb, during your first settlement placement, it’s usually best not to point your road toward the middle of the board. You will likely have no expansion spots since everyone will start toward the middle, rather than the coast.
Anytime your road is in a contestable direction, make sure you’re the one cutting someone off or are more likely to win the race — not the other way around. [...] Think of a Catan map as having 3 areas — the center, inner, and coastal rings. The “center” is all the spots around the middle hex, “inner” is the next one outward, and so on.
For starters, the coast never makes sense for your first placement as it will only have 2 hexes of production (3 for you to build more central) and it will inhibit your optionality to expand. [...] As a result, you will start with a road which gives you a great first mover advantage if you are in a race with anyone. This can help you secure a contested spot with your first settlement or deliberately cut someone off placing two roads from your second placement.
#13. Consider which spots will always be knighted.

In a development card heavy game (lots of ore, grain, and wool), knights can play a major role in directing where the robber is placed.

- try to avoid trading down to just a few cards with the bank and being stuck unable to build. Chances are, you're doing so for a resource you're finding hard to get and therefore other players will know they can disproportionately hurt you with the robber if they steal it.

- preserve juicy settlement locations with judicious road placement. Lock up that port that's critical to your strategy early. Nothing more infuriating than having an opponent beat you to it. [...] 1. Get one of everything. You're going to need all of wood, brick, wheat, sheep, and ore, so why not make sure you have them all at the start? Place your first settlement so you get 3 different resources, and pick up the final 2 with your last placement. [...] 4. Get a good distribution of numbers. The ideal is to get as many different number placements as possible. This seems a little counter-intuitive, but it is great for experienced players as it keeps them in the game regardless of how the dice shake down. The dream initial placement is something like 4/6/9 and 5/8/10... 2/3 of the time, you will be getting a resource card, and you'll feel involved throughout.

Colonist Strategies: What are the Best Catan Starting Strategies?

Today we will be giving you pointers on the best starting placement strategies for Settlers of Catan that you can use in Colonist.

Colonist.io

1. Identify Your Goals

The first and most important Catan Strategy is knowing what you want to build. This will dictate which resources you should go after when you place your starting settlements. [...] Overall, placing your starting settlements wisely will give you a huge advantage in Settlers of Catan. But this is just one of the many strategies that can be employed in the game.

It is very hard to employ all these tactics in every game though, as the board is arranged randomly by the system and your neighbors choices restrict yours.

However, having a good grasp of starting positions and initial placements will help greatly in winning you your next Colonist game. [...] Of course, this is highly contextual and will depend on each game session.

However, looking at your opponents’ spots might just open up opportunities that were not visible to you before.

For example, if all the Bricks on the board are on low-yield numbers like 2-3-4, then that’s a rare resource. Work on acquiring them early on.

5. Work on Expansion as Your Main Focus

Settlers of Catan is a game of conquest. Gaining as much territory as possible is one of the essentials in winning the game.
</Document>================================== Ai Message ==================================

The analysis of game logs and strategy research reveals several areas for improvement in promptRefiningLLM_player's gameplay. The AlphaBetaPlayer achieved a decisive win in all games, emphasizing weaknesses in early game settlement placement, resource optimization, and strategic planning for road building.

### Observations:
1. **Weak Early Game Placement**: The player lacked dominance in settlement placement, which limited resource diversity and expansion potential.
2. **Inefficient Resource Management**: The logs point towards underutilized resources, particularly in the mid-game, leading to stagnation while AlphaBeta gained momentum.
3. **Suboptimal Road and Expansion**: The player didn't secure critical spots or ports, losing opportunities for territorial and resource gain.

### Key Strategies to Include:
- Prioritize resource diversity in settlement placements, targeting hexes with complementary numbers (e.g., 4/6/9 and 5/8/10).
- Ensure connection to vital resources (e.g., brick and ore) and expand early to competitive spots or ports using roads.
- Adjust expansion tactics to compete for scarce resources, such as early acquisition of rare resources and ports for trading.
- Implement deliberate robber placement on high-value tiles of opponents and strategically use knights from development cards to mitigate risks.

### Prompt Update Plan:
I'll improve the prompt to explicitly include these strategic concepts and decision-making rules. The updates will emphasize:
- Analyzed early placement considering resource diversity, dice probabilities, and expansion paths.
- Guidance to prioritize roads strategically for competitive objectives.
- Continual adaptive planning during gameplay.

    new_text: You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions.
2. Your aim is to WIN. That means 10 victory points. Focus on strategic placement, resource diversity, and expansion control.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}.
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number.
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Prioritize placing settlements on hexes with high resource diversity and complementary dice numbers (e.g., 4/6/9 and 5/8/10). Build roads strategically to secure ports or contest essential expansion nodes early in the game.</plan>
6. Analyze recent resource changes to understand your collection effectiveness. Reflect on scarce or essential resources (brick and ore) that require focused attention.
7. Use tactical robber placement on high-value opponent tiles and prioritize acquiring knights for ongoing control.
8. Plan for the next 3 turns, adapting to opponents’ placements and prevailing resource availability.

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers.
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile.
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex.
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section.
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy.
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1).

Gameplay Tips:
1. Prioritize initial placements near hexes with high production diversity to ensure steady resource collection.
2. Contest neighbor expansions ahead of time by building roads in competitive directions early.
3. Use ports strategically for resource trades to speed up development cards and victory point accumulation.
4. Maintain adaptability by forecasting potential trading scenarios or resource imbalances during gameplay.================================= Tool Message =================================

I have updated the prompt to address key weaknesses, including early settlement placement, mid-game resource utilization, and competitive road building. The adjustments emphasize strategic planning, resource diversity, and adaptability based on board dynamics and opponent actions. The next iteration should test these improvements for effectiveness against AlphaBetaPlayer.Evolve Counter: 0

### SUMMARY:
1. **Learned from Game Results**:
   - The AlphaBetaPlayer consistently outperformed the promptRefiningLLM_player, achieving victory in all five games with an average of 5 victory points per game.
   - Weak areas identified include poor early settlement placement, limited resource diversity, inefficient resource utilization, and suboptimal road building strategies, which hindered expansion potential.
   - Competitive tactics such as securing ports and prioritizing scarce resources like brick were missed, resulting in strategic stagnation.

2. **Strategies Implemented in the Updated Prompt**:
   - Emphasis on settlement placement strategy: Prioritize hexes with high resource diversity and favorable dice probabilities to maximize collection efficiency (e.g., 4/6/9 and 5/8/10 combinations).
   - Road building aimed at securing ports and contesting important expansion spots early.
   - Adaptive planning introduced, focusing on scarce resources (like brick and ore) and countering opponent expansion paths.
   - Tactical use of the robber and knights to disrupt opponents and protect vital production tiles.
   - Expanded focus on trading using ports to optimize resource conversion and development card opportunities.

3. **Performance Metrics Observed**:
   - AlphaBetaPlayer demonstrated absolute dominance with 5 wins and twice the average VP (5.0 vs. 2.2 for RandomPlayer).
   - Average game length: 128.2 ticks (approximately 50 turns) and average game duration of 0.753 seconds per run.
   - RandomPlayer's lack of strategic depth resulted in minimal expansion (2 settlements per game on average) and no competitive edge in cities, roads, army, or trading.

The updated prompt aims to address these gaps by embedding strategies rooted in resource optimization, competitive foresight, and adaptive gameplay dynamics. Future tests should measure its effectiveness against the AlphaBetaPlayer benchmark.

Given there is a limit of 7 cards before you are at risk of losing half your cards, it can be advantageous to have a steady stream of resources coming into your hand throughout the game. The best way to do this is to place your two first settlements on intersections with six different numbers total with ideally, the highest probability. If you can manage it, the best numbers to be on from the beginning would be 4,5,6,8,9,10 or some combination as close to that as possible. Ideally you would [...] Assistant

In Settlers of Catan, the order in which players place their initial settlements can significantly impact their strategy and success in the game. Each position—first, middle, or last—has its advantages and disadvantages:
First Player
Advantages:- Optimal Location: The first player can choose the best starting spot on the board, often securing a high-probability resource hex (like 6s or 8s) and access to diverse resources. [...] Variety of (good) numbers. In base settlers, production is king. Having the six top numbers (6/8, 5/9, & 4/10) takes most of the luck out of having resources. Two out of every three rolls (IIRC) should produce something for you, although you’ll probably need to build to secure at least one of these numbers. In starting placement, unless you are claiming a port (see #2), getting five-six different numbers is the surest long term strategy, even if they aren’t quite the top 6.

2. Maximize pips. Each number has pips on it indicating its probability (out of 36) of being rolled on a given throw of the dice. Place your settlements looking to maximize your probability of getting resource cards (if you're placing numbers according to the recommended spiral convention, the best you can do is 13 pips, e.g. 5/6/9). To maximize pips, you should generally avoid the desert and the coast. See the second photo, above. [...] Good when the following are true:- your starting position gives you a good range of resources with high probability- you have options for building good settlements- you have a useful port available to you- everyone else is going for another strategy [...] 4. Get a good distribution of numbers. The ideal is to get as many different number placements as possible. This seems a little counter-intuitive, but it is great for experienced players as it keeps them in the game regardless of how the dice shake down. The dream initial placement is something like 4/6/9 and 5/8/10... 2/3 of the time, you will be getting a resource card, and you'll feel involved throughout.

Catan uses two dice, which makes 6 and 8 the most frequent rolls (5 pips). Always prioritize spots with high-probability numbersâbut more importantly, make sure you have access to key resources for your chosen strategy.

Also, donât forget about your free starting roadâitâs a sneakily powerful tool. Point it somewhere useful, like:

After reviewing the game results and analyzing weaknesses from the AlphaBetaPlayer dominance, it is clear that our prompt can benefit from certain optimizations rooted in strategic Catan gameplay tactics. Research provides valuable insights regarding resource placement, expansion, ports, and managing dice probabilities.

### Observations from Results
1. **Resource Collection**: Both Evolution 0 and Evolution 1 struggled to target tiles with high production probabilities, resulting in inefficient resource collection.
2. **Expansion**: AlphaBetaPlayer contested key expansion nodes effectively, utilizing road-building strategies to close expansion opportunities.
3. **Ports**: Missed early port strategies limited efficient resource conversion opportunities.
4. **Robber Placement**: The robber was underutilized tactically to disrupt opponents’ production capabilities.

### Key Learnings from Gameplay Analysis and External Research:
1. **Initial Settlements**: Starting settlements should prioritize two intersections summing up to 13-15 pips (e.g., combinations like 4/6/9 or 5/8/10). Access to 6-8 different number combinations and diverse resources is essential to maximize steady production.
2. **Strategic Roads**: Early-road construction decisions should aim to either secure ports with resource trading advantages or contest advantageous node expansions by opponents.
3. **Resource Balance**: Building an initial position that guarantees access to scarce resources like brick and ore provides advantages in terms of development cards and city upgrades.
4. **Adaptive Plan**: Continuous adjustment of strategy based on opponents’ placement and resource availability speeds expansion and defense.
5. **Robber Usage**: Actively leveraging the robber to stall opponents' high-value resources (e.g., from 6s and 8s) disrupts their development.

### Targeted Prompt Updates:
Based on observations and research findings, the updated prompt will instruct our player to:
- Prioritize settlement placement on hex intersections that sum up to high pips and provide resource balance (e.g., 6/8/9/10 with brick, wood, and ore).
- Strategically build roads to ports for efficient trading or toward contested opponent nodes to block expansion.
- Actively monitor dice roll probabilities to reevaluate resource emerging patterns and adapt strategies.
- Leverage the robber and knights to disrupt opponents while safeguarding critical resource tiles.
- Plan next moves while considering 2-3 turn horizons with strategic focus on development cards.

### Proposed Updated Prompt:
```plaintext
You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions.
2. Your aim is to WIN. That means reaching 10 victory points by strategically collecting resources, developing settlements/cities, and utilizing roads, ports, and development cards.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}.
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number.
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, enclose it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Prioritize early settlements on hex intersections that reach 13-15 pips with resource balance (e.g., brick, wood, ore, sheep, wheat). Use roads strategically to secure ports or block opponent expansion, while maximizing dice probabilities.</plan>
6. Actively analyze dice roll distributions, and adapt strategy based on resource production patterns over time.
7. Disrupt opponents using robber placement, targeting their high-value intersections (e.g., tile numbers 6 and 8) while safeguarding your valuable hexes using knights.
8. Plan for the next 2-3 turns, ensuring adaptability in resource collection and development card usage.

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID lists hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers.
- Nodes connected to each tile are listed below it, showing production values and adjacency.
- 🔍 marks the robber's current location, blocking resource production.
- Settlements/cities and their resource collection potential are detailed in the BUILDINGS section for reference.
- Ports allow trading resources at favorable rates (2:1 or 3:1), enabling efficient conversions.

Gameplay Tips:
1. **Initial Placement**: Prioritize tile intersections with high pips total (13-15) coupled with resource diversity for steady production (e.g., combinations like 6/9/4 or 5/8/10).
2. **Strategic Roads**: Use road segments efficiently to expand toward ports, high-value tiles, or contested nodes for blocking opponents.
3. **Resource Conversion & Planning**: Use ports effectively, adapt to opponents' strategies and emerging dice roll patterns.
4. **Disruption**: Place the robber on opponent hexes with valuable tiles or high production probabilities to minimize their competitive edge.
