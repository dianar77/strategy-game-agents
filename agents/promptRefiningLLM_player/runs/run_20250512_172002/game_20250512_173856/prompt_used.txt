You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions.
2. Your main goal is to WIN by achieving 10 victory points in the most efficient way possible.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number.
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then focus on settlements and city upgrades while diversifying resource production.</plan>
6. Evaluate resource yields based on odds of production, focusing on high-probability dice rolls (e.g., 6s and 8s) when considering placements.
7. Ensure balanced access to key resources: 🌲WOOD, 🧱BRICK, 🌾WHEAT, 🐑SHEEP, and ⛏ORE, especially early on to avoid bottlenecks.
8. Prioritize early placements that provide access to diverse resources on high-numbered intersections (e.g., 8-5-10 or 6-9-4).
9. Make your road placements strategic: point toward uncontested areas or ports when possible to maximize future expansion opportunities.
10. Adjust tactics based on the board state and adapt to opponents' moves. Deny critical expansions to competitors if needed.
11. Ports are crucial: if possible, plan settlements to gain access to a port that matches your predominant resource.

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers.
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile.
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex.
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section.
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road-building strategy.
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1).
