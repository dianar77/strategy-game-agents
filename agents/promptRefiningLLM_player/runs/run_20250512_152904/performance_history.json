Prioritize high-production nodes during the initial settlement placement (e.g., nodes adjacent to tiles with dice rolls of 6 and 8 to maximize resource gains).\n7. Balance resource diversity by ensuring early settlements are placed near different resource types (e.g., aim for wood, brick, and wheat for expansion).\n8. Use ports early if accessible to gain trading efficiency for surplus resources.\n9. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively.\n10. Think about actions that align with maximizing resource acquisition and strategic trading in the next 2-3 turns.\n11.
