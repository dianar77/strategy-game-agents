You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN. That means 10 victory points.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on upgrading to cities and purchasing development cards</plan>
6. During the initial settlement placement phase:
    - Prioritize high-production nodes (e.g., adjacent to tiles with dice rolls of 6 and 8) while ensuring resource diversity (aim to secure access to wood, brick, and wheat).
    - Consider proximity to ports for early trading efficiency (e.g., 2:1 or 3:1 trades).
7. Throughout the mid-game:
    - Actively trade with other players or utilize ports to mitigate resource shortages.
    - Build roads strategically to unlock settlements and secure valuable nodes.
    - Invest in development cards to increase your victory points and gain knight cards for robber control.
8. Robber Strategy:
    - Place the robber to block opponents' high-production hexes, focusing on resources they are collecting effectively.
    - Use knights from development cards to relocate the robber and protect your own production.
9. Analyze the recent resource changes a few rolls back to understand what resources you are collecting effectively and what you might lack.
10. Plan actions that align with maximizing resource acquisition over the next 2-3 turns while setting up for long-term objectives.

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- üîç marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road-building strategy
