I will revise the current prompt based on strategic insights about early-game settlement placement as this aspect has consistently been crucial in Catan. AlphaBetaPlayer performed far better in settlements and overall victory points, indicating stronger game-start positioning. The revised prompt will introduce focused instructions for early-game placement strategy. Additionally, updates for leveraging resources effectively and adjusting mid-game plans will be included to strengthen competitiveness.

Here is a summary of the conversation:

- **Game Results Provided**: Detailed performance statistics from Settlers of Catan games were shared, showing "AlphaBetaPlayer:RED" dominated with 5 wins, compared to "RandomPlayer:BLUE" with no wins.

- **Initial Analysis**: The inferior performance of RandomPlayer was attributed to weaker early-game settlement strategies and suboptimal resource utilization.

- **Prompt Revision Plan**: Insights from the game results were used to propose enhancing the prompt with specific guidelines for:
  1. Prioritizing early settlement placement on high-production nodes (e.g., dice rolls of 6, 8).
  2. Ensuring resource diversity in placements (e.g., wood, brick, wheat).
  3. Leveraging ports early for trading surplus resources.
  4. Adjusting strategies based on robber placement and opponents' actions.

- **Implementation**: The prompt was successfully revised to include these strategic instructions, aiming to improve future performance.

- **Next Steps**: Testing is needed to evaluate the impact of the revised prompt on player competitiveness against stronger opponents like AlphaBetaPlayer.================================ Human Message =================================

You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Based on the game results, history, and analyzed weaknesses, the following points emerge critically:

### Observations from Results:
1. **Low Settlement Count (AVG SETTLES: 1.8):**
   - The lack of sufficient settlements suggests ineffective early-game placement and slowed expansion.
2. **Unfilled Resource Needs:**
   - Resources for road-building (wood and brick) seem insufficient, evidenced by zero average road builds.
3. **Underutilized Development (DEV VP: 0.2):**
   - Suggests neglect of development card purchases and usage, which could provide bonuses such as victory points or knight cards for robber control.

### Hypotheses for Weak Performance:
1. **Initial Settlement Placement:** Suboptimal prioritization of nodes that balance high production and resource diversity might slow growth.
2. **Lack of Trade Focus:** Ports and trading opportunities are not being leveraged enough to address resource gaps.
3. **Robber Strategy:** Inefficient use of knights and poorly targeted robber placements could further hinder resource production.

### Improvement Opportunities:
To boost performance, the updated prompt must guide the player to:
- **Early Game Placement:**
  - Focus on high-production nodes of varied resources (6, 8, and complementary tiles).
  - Consider strategic placement near accessible ports.
- **Mid-Game Development:**
  - Shift to aggressive trading to close resource shortages.
  - Invest in roads to unlock new nodes and settlements faster.
- **Robber Strategy:**
  - Place the robber to block high-priority resources of opponents.
  - Focus development cards (knights) for long-term benefits.

### Plan for Prompt Improvement:
Augment the prompt by making the above aspects explicit, actionable, and clear. Include strategic advice for each phase to address identified weaknesses.

7. Throughout the mid-game:
    - Actively trade with other players or utilize ports to mitigate resource shortages.
    - Build roads strategically to unlock settlements and secure valuable nodes.
    - Invest in development cards to increase your victory points and gain knight cards for robber control.
8. Robber Strategy:
    - Place the robber to block opponents' high-production hexes, focusing on resources they are collecting effectively.
    - Use knights from development cards to relocate the robber and protect your own production.
9. Analyze the recent resource changes a few rolls back to understand what resources you are collecting effectively and what you might lack.
10. Plan actions that align with maximizing resource acquisition over the next 2-3 turns while setting up for long-term objectives.
