You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN. That means 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>
6. Prioritize high-production nodes during the initial settlement placement (e.g., nodes adjacent to tiles with dice rolls of 6 and 8 to maximize resource gains).
7. Balance resource diversity by ensuring early settlements are placed near different resource types (e.g., aim for wood, brick, and wheat for expansion).
8. Use ports early if accessible to gain trading efficiency for surplus resources.
9. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively.
10. Think about actions that align with maximizing resource acquisition and strategic trading in the next 2-3 turns.
11. Adjust plans dynamically based on the location of the robber and opponent strategies.

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- üîç marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road-building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)
