You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN. That means 10 victory points.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>
6. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively
7. Think about the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- üîç marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

## Here a log of results as they are found:

- We were able to create a Python package that implements the Game's core logic.
  No fancy networkX or numpy models, just good old Python objects and readable
  algorithms. Fully tested!

- We build a UI to go along with it. Not only useful for debugging, but if robot
  comes to life, we may want to allow users to play against it!

- WeightedRandomPlayer consistently wins to RandomPlayer.

- ValueFunction exposed that copying game with `deepcopy` is slow. Potential
  road block for Tree-Search algorithms (e.g. mini-max). Played OK. Too slow
  to benchmark really. Computed features.

- Started playing with DRL approaches. Threw away useful features (like production)
  and used RAW representation (someone said automatic feature engineering).

- Started with Policy learning using "Cross Entropy Method" here: ...
  Noticed we face class-imbalance. Infra was still inmature.
  Wasn't getting a meaningful LOSS, so scrapped it.

- Started with Deep Q-Learning. Seemed we were able to achieve a reasonable LOSS
  (MAE=0.05) on a "Discounted Return" with `DISCOUNT_FACTOR=0.999`. Played
  terrible tho. Not better than random (maybe actually worst).

- Tried Deep Q-Learning only on top-examples. Nothing interesting.

- Tried Deep Learning ValueFunction, and doing greedy algorithm on it. Won 63%
  of the games against RandomPlayers. Single-epoch, 32-batch, 75,000 samples.
  RAW Features. Games take around 30s tho.

  ```

- Using hand-crafted production and expansion features, we achieved 0.15 MAE.

- Using AutoKeras on hand-crafted production and expansion features yielded
  something like 0.01 MSE. But in performance, still played just like Random
  tho. Did not perform better.

- Got very good performance using VICTORY_POINTS_RETURN with 30GB data set,
  batch size = 256, batchnormalization => dense(64) => dense(1) value func.
  MSE loss, adam with lr=0.001,clipnorm=1. 1 epoch. Achieved ~2.0 MAE.

- First BoardTensor model seems to overfit (places on same nodes). ~200,000 params
  with less than 1,000,000 samples. Still, after normalizing wins 44/100 games
  against random players. NEXT: Try simpler model and more data.

- Second BoardTensor model (adam(0.001,clipnorm=1),
  input1 = 21x11x16 => batchnorm => 1 filter-cnn kernel=3 linear => flatten
  input2 = num-features
  model = input1 + input2 => 64 relu => 32 relu => 1 linear.
  MSE loss on VP RETURN. Batch=256, epoch=1, 2M samples.
  Performed comparable to simple 2-layer on 1M samples.

- We prototyped the Playouts Theorem. It indeed gives a good value function to
  play out random games from a given state. Pretty stable at at least 50 games.
  25 games there was some flakyness... (could stable out given we do this)
  many times. Takes around 0.3 secs to play a random game to completion.

- MCTS (doing 25 playouts for each possible action) wins almost every
  game against randoms, but it takes a while. And it seems some high-branching
  factor situations make it take longer (e.g. monopoly play, late road building).
  Here some results:

  RandomPlayer:Bar[BLUE] [0]

- It seems learning the simple problem of whether a player produces OWS
  works well with 1 filter of size 3, linear, unit_norm, and l2-reg. =>
  flat => 1 dense sigmoid. Adding a 0.2 dropout before 1 dense sigmoid
  seemed to help a lot to not overfit. Next steps would like to separate
  edges and nodes from channels (it seems it confuses these two), and add
  max-pooling in an attempt to learn hierarchy (OWS-node, variaty-node, etc...).
  Does EPOCHS help? EPOCHS=2 overfits. Well we get TRAIN_ACC=90%+,TEST_ACC=60%.
- No class weight, simple 1 3x3 filter CNN seems to learn, just needs more data.
- No class weight, using autokerastuner arrives at 96 neurons 1-layer 0.0001 LR.
  Achieves 57% accuracy (using log-loss as objective).

- Practicing on simple problem of given a 2x2 array, trying to learn to count
  the number of 1s. it performs well. With num-samples=100,000, epoch=1,
  2-32-relu layers gets mae: 0.6571, val_mae: 0.0301. Default Adam, with loss=mse.
  With 1 more order of magnitude of data, we can get 1 order of magnitude less error. (val_mae: 0.0034)
  Next steps:

  - Use auto keras to see how much better can we get.
    This achieved val_mae: 0.0496. Not much significant improvement.
  - Use CNN to see how it affects counting.
    This improves model to 0.009 mae (with 100,000 samples). note params increased
    from 4k to 65k (from normal NN to 32-filter CNN). 1-filter got val_mae: 1.3479.
    PROBLEM SOLVED!
  - Next steps: complicated by adding planes of random data. Does it confuse NN?
    Adding 3 extra random data layers, did not confuse NN. Still achieves mae~0.004.
  - Next step: Can we learn AND'ed points across channels?
    Seems that CNN behaves better here (1 3x3 filter) as expected since problem
    is translation invariant. AutoKeras yields a very deep model. DNN get to ~80%
    val_accuracy. CNN gets to 90%+. They seem sensitive to initial values tho.
  - Next step: Does adding random layers disturb the AND learning?
    Yes. It seems CNN have trouble with noisy channels.
  - Next step: What if we add some 2s as well... (here we prove we could learn count-vp-problem)
    Yes. Can learn (without noise channels), to val_mae: 0.1147.

- We fixed a bug in the tensor board representation. Using only the first 13 planes
  allows a CNN to learn if a player has OWS successfully (88% val_accuracy). Results:

- Regroup on Jan 2021.

  - We achieve mae: 5.4591e-11, val_mae: 2.4891e-04 with a deep model on RepA,
    and DISCOUNTED_RETURN. But model doesnt perform well in games. 50 game
    epochs, aiming to use 1K games, but early stopping.
    loss: 1.2714e-20 - mae: 5.4591e-11 - val_loss: 3.2321e-07 - val_mae: 2.4807e-04
  - Similar results with Rep B. But it played terribly...

- Online MCTS is looking promising. Did a first run with a 1-neuron model (normalizing
  features), playouts=25, training everytime there are >1K samples in batches of 64.
  There was a bug in the data as well (was creating samples like root-node => mcts result
  for all branches, instead of branch-node => mcts result). It didn't win games,
  but there seemed to be VP improvement from 2 VP avg to 5 VP avg, in 100 games.

- A heuristic player plays better than WeightedRandom (but we have a memory leak).
  Memory leak was due to @functools.lru with copied boards.

- Simple MiniMax Algorithm takes too long... ~20segs per decision,
  which makes for 30 min games. Even if de-bugged the implementation seems pretty slow.
  As such, alpha-pruning doesnt seem wont help much (even if cuts time by half).

- Using PyPy (removing TF and other Python 3.9 features), speeds up playing random
  games by around 33%s. (1000s games w/CPython3.9 took 2m52s and 1000s games
  w/PyPy3.7 took 1m52s).

- Looked at RL Python Frameworks. keras-rl doesn't work with TF2.0, same with
  stable-baselines. Many undocumented or hard to use. Best one seems to be
  tensorforce. TF-Agents seems possible, but pretty raw API right now.
  Hard to use tensorforce because not clear how to specify Rep B mixed model.

- VictoryPoint player is better than Random (much better) and WeightedRandom (not so much).

- Where able to do a somewhat strong NN with clipnorm=1, 2 layers, 32 and 8 neurons
  batch norm of inputs and batches of 32. 7,000,000 samples divided in 10 epochs.
  Still this player doesnt beat hand-heuristic. (ValueFunctionPlayer). This used
  DISCOUNTED_RETURN. MSE as loss and LR=0.0001.
  `loss: 1.5084e-07 - mae: 2.1945e-04 - val_loss: 4.2677e-05 - val_mae: 5.0571e-04`

- Did a RandomForest, but data seems wrong. Played very poorly. Tried again with
  all Rep 1 features; no dice. Hard to analyze... Probably overfitted. Keeps ending turn.

- Scikit Regression player doesnt win, because just gets a lot of wheat production,
  builds roads to extend as much as they can (dont hold to build settlements),
  place robber on themselves, dont trade (same value); no hand-diversity features.

- Greedy (even when budgeted to run same num playouts as MCTS) does better than
  MCTS.

- ValueFunction 2.0 (using EFFECTIVE_PRODUCTION and REACHABILITY features) plays
  pretty strongly. Better than Greedy=25 and MCTS=100.

- AlphaBeta(depth=2) plays stronger than ValueFunction 2.0. Using VF2.0 as heuristic.

- Tried Bayesian Optimization to search better weights for hand-crafted heuristic,
  but seems too slow and inefective.

- Note: In a random game, 38.6% of actions are roll (action=0), 27% are end turn (action=5557).

## Future Work:

- Should probably try to do NN player with better tuning (more layers, different label).

- Interested in seeing MCTS play in real life. Should compare G10 to MCTS50

- Work on performance.

- Generate data as 1 Big CSV per representation. (samples + labels), (bt + labels)

- Idea: Make test-evaluation framework. Use gaussian optimization to find best weights.

- Attempt DQN Tutorial with TF2.0 Summary Module, to see progress. If works,
  adapt to Catan-DQN Tutorial.

- Paperspace: Dockerfile: Install catanatron, and Pipenv dependencies, so that we can
  experiment/play.py, have a Game in the Overview.ipyn and run a catan-dqn.py job faster
  (should only do when can confirm Data and DQN approach improves...).

- Simplify ROBBER_ACTIONS to "Play Knight" to player with most points.

- Learn from offline MCTS data, using Rep B. (Seems slow to generate MCTS labeled data).

- Use tensorforce (since TF2.0 compatible and DQN Agent will be bug-free).
  Seems hard because API is not too easy.

- Learn an offline DQN (using VPs) with Rep B. That is, use Reward as label (
  so that early moves don't get a 1)

- Consider implementing AlphaBetaPruning to speed up game. Although
  it seems speedup at best might be 1/2 the time, which still doesn't cut it.
  Unless we speed up game copying...

- Actually use MCTS result to improve network. Do online so that we can
  see progress.

  - Add epsilon-playing to ensure we are exploring space. (Well, I think the fact
    that we have random players fixed does this job for now, since we collect
    samples from their perspective as well).

- Play a game against Greedy player. Play against Greedy with look-ahead.

- Idea: Sum up "enemy features". Make it look like its 1 enemy.

- Try Online - DQN approach (using PythonProgramming Tutorial).
- Use Value-Estimator with a tree-lookahead alpha-beta pruning.
- Try CNN-action space. (i.e. BUILD_SETTLEMENT at 3 means plane-board-tensor)
- Try policy-learning and q-learning on simpler action space.
- Try Cross-Entropy approach (using only top X features and dropping END TURNs).
- Try AlphaZero single-neural network learning (state) => (value, action).

  - Use in tree-search (take N top actions to explore via RollOuts).

- Try putting in features back. Is this VPlayer better than Raw Features one?
- Can autokeras use tf.Dataset?
- Using autokeras with whole 1Gb dataset is better?
- Does playing against your V1 self, training on that, improve?
- Try Q-Learning but, iterate on playing, learning, playing, learning... e-greedy.

### Performance Improvements

- Separate immutable state from Board (Map?), so that copying is a lot faster, and
  can cache functions (say node-production) globally (across game copies).

### Toy problems

- Idea: hot-encode 5 layers per player (one per resource) to denote income and buildings.
  then use 3D convolution of size WxHx5 and stride=5 (to not overlap)
- An easier problem would be to count house/city VPs (only uses 1 plane). count-vp-problem.
- Next medium problem will be, guess wheat production (to see if combining the two planes).

## Catan State Space Analysis

- Each tile can be any resource = 19. So 19! resource-tile decisions.
- Each tile must be one of the numbers. So 18! (desert has no number)
- There are 9 ports so: 9! ways of ordering them.
  Finally, there are 19! \* 18! \* 9! boards in Catan. So like 10^38 boards.

Configurations states inside it are upper bounded by:

- Each player has at most 5 houses. 54 choose 5 are ways of putting all 5 houses.
  54 choose 4 are ways of putting 4 houses. Sum\_{i in [0, 5]} (54 choose i) = 3.5M.
  Actually, better ignore colors and consider all 20 houses. So:
  `sum([comb(54, i) for i in range(21)]) = 683689022885551`.
  Actually, including cities, then there are 9 pieces per player that can be in board.
  `sum([comb(54, i) for i in range(4*9 + 1)]) = 17932673125137243`
- There are 14 roads per player so 56 roads in total. 72 possible locations so:
  `sum([comb(72, i) for i in range(56)]) = 4722360822358286581300`

If we include number of cards that makes the state space much much bigger,
but in practice its a lot less (its rare for a player to have 20+ cards). So
just using the Board States we see there are:
10^38 boards. Each with 17932673125137243 \* 4722360822358286581300 configurations,
which is almost like 10^37, so we are talking around 10^68 just possible board-states.

In terms of cards-in-hand state. Assuming on average players have 5 cards in hand,
then out of the 19*5 resource cards we start with, we are talking about:
`comb(19*4, 20) = 1090013712241956540` (or 10^18).

Grand-ballpark estimate is ~**10^100** states in Catan. Chess is 10^123.
Go is 10^360. Number of atoms in the Universe is 10^78.

### Branching Factor

The following stats suggests the decision tree players navigate usually has
around ~5 branches, and very few times something huge like 279 branches
(trading options after a monopoly(?), late road-building card(?)).

```
Branching Factor Stats:

    new_text: You are playing Settlers of Catan, a strategic board game. Your primary objective is to achieve 10 victory points (VP) before any opponent. Be strategic in managing resources, building roads, settlements, and cities, and using development cards.

**Rules and Guidelines:**
1. **Think Step by Step:** Carefully analyze the game state before taking action. Consider resource availability, opponent strategies, and the next few turns.
2. **Objective:** Your end goal is to win by reaching 10 victory points before your opponents.
3. **Answer Format:** Your final decision must be submitted as a single integer representing the action number. Use the format \boxed{X}, where X is your decision.
4. **Plans:** Include strategic plans in <plan> tags, like `<plan> Description of plan </plan>`.

**Strategies:**
- Focus on building settlements and upgrading them to cities for resource diversity and VP.
- Aim to secure ports early for effective trading options.
- Analyze dice rolls and prioritize collecting scarce resources.
- Use development cards strategically to gain Largest Army or rob key resources.
- Block opponents' key resources using the robber.

**Important Notes:**
- Always prioritize increasing your victory points.
- Trade with opponents only when it is highly beneficial to your strategy.
- Attempt to predict and counteract the strategies of your opponents, especially those closest to 10 VP or controlling critical resources (like ore, wheat, or brick).
- Gain dominance by building towards Longest Road or Largest Army if feasible.

**Extra Board Insights:**
- Settlements adjacent to high-yield resource tiles with common dice numbers (6, 8) are ideal.
- Cities on these tiles provide double production and can offer a significant advantage.
- Ports allow you to convert excess resources into needed ones; prioritize building near ports of key resources you lack.

**Simplified Game Flow:**
1. **Initial Placement:** Place settlements and roads in locations that ensure a variety of early-game resources.
2. **Middle Game:** Focus on upgrading settlements to cities and building roads toward ports or resource clusters.
3. **End Game:** Secure victory points through development cards, expanding settlements, and upgrading cities. Ensure you block opponents nearing 10 VP.

Enhance your strategy as the game progresses. Adapt dynamically to opponents' moves while focusing on your victory point generation. Always prioritize actions that bring you closer to winning.

Your decisions must maximize your chances of winning without errors or sub-optimal strategies. Let‚Äôs aim for victory!

Game state prepared for LLM (length: 3009 chars)
Updated plan: Based on the above factors, building a settlement at **Node 22** provides:
1. Access to three vital resources‚Äîore (‚õèÔ∏è8), sheep (üêë10), and wheat (üåæ3)‚Äîfor future city upgrades and development card purchases.
2. Strong dice probabilities (8 and 10) for a consistent resource income.
3. A balanced position on the board with flexibility for future expansion (e.g., nodes near ports or brick).
LLM chose action 18: Build a settlement at node 22 (Cost: 1 üå≤WOOD, 1 üß±BRICK, 1 üåæWHEAT, 1 üêëSHEEP)
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2051 chars)
Updated plan: - My next settlement should aim to strengthen resource diversity. Moving toward **node 23/20** and connecting to **node 16 (üåæ3, ‚õèÔ∏è8)** is logical.
   - Road placement at **(22, 23)** aligns with this expansion while maintaining the current advantage.
   - Long-term, securing **cities** (requires ore and wheat) and/or **development cards** (potential for Largest Army) becomes the focus.
LLM chose action 1: Build a road at edge (22, 23) (Cost: 1 üå≤WOOD, 1 üß±BRICK)
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 3391 chars)
Updated plan: Build a settlement at **node 16** to gain access to **üåæwheat** and **‚õèÔ∏èore**, enhancing resource diversity and enabling upgrades to cities. Continue building roads strategically to secure ports and expand settlement possibilities. Prioritize development cards for Largest Army and robbing opponents while upgrading settlements to cities.
LLM chose action 12: Build a settlement at node 16 (Cost: 1 üå≤WOOD, 1 üß±BRICK, 1 üåæWHEAT, 1 üêëSHEEP)
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2156 chars)
Updated plan: Build a road toward node 18 to gain access to üå≤wood and üêësheep while preparing for future settlement expansion. Focus next on upgrading settlements to cities for extra victory points and doubling resource production. Use development cards to aim for Largest Army while blocking opponents' strategies.

Updated plan: The goal is to advance toward gaining new settlement spots for resource diversity (wood from node 18, sheep from node 22) and upgrading settlements to cities. Simultaneously, RED‚Äôs settlements must be weakened by blocking key resources, especially üåæ9 and üå≤6. The robber should maximize disruption to RED while providing opportunities to steal a resource card to expedite progress toward future builds or upgrades.

Updated plan: Move robber to üå≤6 (-1, 0, 1) to block RED‚Äôs critical wood production and steal a resource from RED. This will slow their progress while expediting ours. Use stolen resource for settlement expansion or city upgrades.
LLM chose action 2: Move robber to (-1, 0, 1) and steal from RED
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2052 chars)
Updated plan: Buy a development card to improve short- and long-term prospects. If it‚Äôs a Knight, we can progress toward Largest Army and gain robber control. If it‚Äôs a Victory Point card, it directly brings us closer to 10 points. Other cards can assist in resource management or expanding our board position.

Only one action available. Selecting it automatically without API call.
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2122 chars)
Updated plan: The plan is to roll the dice to generate resources for future actions such as buying development cards or building settlements and cities. These actions directly contribute to our victory point goal while maintaining flexibility to secure Largest Army or Longest Road later on.
LLM chose action 1: Roll the dice
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2203 chars)
Updated plan: Buy a development card to aim for victory points while preparing for Largest Army later. This action is immediate, strategic, and resource-efficient.
LLM chose action 2: Buy a development card (1 üêëSHEEP, 1 üåæWHEAT, 1 ‚õèÔ∏èORE)
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 1978 chars)
Updated plan: - Focus on gathering wheat and ore for upgrading a settlement to a city (preferably Node 16 for üåæ3 and ‚õèÔ∏è8).
- Use YEAR_OF_PLENTY strategically to grab brick/wheat or other needed resources when preparing to expand/build.
- Hold onto the KNIGHT card until it can deliver a stronger impact (e.g., blocking RED‚Äôs progress further when needed or claiming Largest Army).
- Monitor RED's road-building progress for potential Longest Road risks.
- Expand towards ports when possible to enable better trading in the mid-game.
LLM chose action 1: End your turn
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 3488 chars)
Updated plan: 1. **Short-Term Goal (Immediate Action):**
   - Use the **"Year of Plenty" development card** to gather resources needed for upgrading to a city at **Node 16**. You'll need:
     - Wheat (üåæ, 1 needed)
     - Ore (‚õèÔ∏è, 2 needed)
   - Select: **Action [10] Play Year of Plenty card - Take ('WHEAT', 'ORE')**.

2. **Mid-Term Goal (Next Moves):**
   - After acquiring the resources, aim to roll favorable numbers or trade to gather the final ore you need for upgrading to a city (settlement -> city adds crucial VP).

3. **Long-Term Goals:**
   - Build towards a port (to enable better trades, especially for scarce wheat).
   - Use Knight strategically to hinder RED when they become a more imminent threat.
   - Continue aiming for cities and development cards toward Largest Army.

Only one action available. Selecting it automatically without API call.
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2661 chars)
LLM chose action 1: Buy a development card (1 üêëSHEEP, 1 üåæWHEAT, 1 ‚õèÔ∏èORE)
Only one action available. Selecting it automatically without API call.
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2633 chars)
Updated plan: 1. **Roll the Dice:** This is the starting step to gather resources organically. Your settlements are adjacent to potentially high-yield tiles like ‚õèÔ∏è8. This can help you begin collecting the **ore** (‚õèÔ∏è) you need for upgrading to a city.
2. Post-roll decisions will depend on the resources gained:
   - If you roll useful resources, consider trading or using the "Year of Plenty" card to fill in gaps for a city.
   - If resources are insufficient, continue building towards development cards, cities, and road expansion.
3. **Hold Knight Cards Strategically:** Save Knight cards for when RED becomes a larger threat or when you need to block a critical resource tile like üåæ9 or üå≤6. Accumulate more cards if aiming for Largest Army.
4. Short-term priority is upgrading Node 16 to a **city**, as it will boost your resource generation significantly.
LLM chose action 1: Roll the dice
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2708 chars)
Updated plan: Given the current game state:
1. Resources are unavailable, meaning I cannot build or upgrade right now. 
2. RED does not appear to be an immediate threat with only 2 victory points and limited expansion possibilities.
3. Playing a Knight card now would likely result in minimal benefit since RED has only 2 resource cards, and the robbing mechanic would not decisively affect their strategy.
4. The strategic priority is still upgrading Node 16 to a city, but resources must be gathered first. Rolling for future resource production is essential, and saving Knight cards for future turns remains a better option.
5. Ending the turn is optimal to move forward without wasting development cards unnecessarily.
LLM chose action 1: End your turn
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2563 chars)
Updated plan: 1. Roll the dice to produce resources and progress toward your goal of upgrading Node 16 to a city.
2. Save the Knight cards for later use when:
   - You can steal from an opponent with more resources.
   - You need to strategically block a key resource or disrupt threats.
   - You're aiming to claim **Largest Army** for additional VPs.
3. Focus on resource collection and positioning your gameplay toward building cities and reaching 10 VPs.
LLM chose action 1: Roll the dice
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2307 chars)
Updated plan: Objective: Since we do not have enough resources to take an immediate action such as building or upgrading, and playing a Knight card is not strategically advantageous at the moment, the best decision is to end the turn. We need to focus on accumulating more resources in the upcoming turns to upgrade our settlement at Node 16 to a city (gaining an additional 2 VP) and plan further expansions. Saving the Knight cards for later use when they can secure **Largest Army** or disrupt an opponent's strategy is a better approach.
LLM chose action 1: End your turn
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2386 chars)
Updated plan: Based on the game state, my primary goal is to acquire resources to upgrade my settlement at Node 16 to a city, which will increase production on üåæ3 and ‚õèÔ∏è8 tiles and grant me 2 VP. Since I only have 1 üåæWHEAT and no other resources, my immediate focus should be rolling the dice to generate resources. Playing a Knight card now does not directly benefit me because:
- I have no critical need to block opponents' production or steal resources at this moment.
- The Largest Army bonus requires 3 played Knight cards, so holding onto my Knights for later strategic opportunities is wise.
Thus, the best action is to roll the dice to collect resources and move closer to my objective.
LLM chose action 1: Roll the dice
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2543 chars)
Updated plan: Our immediate goal is to generate resources to upgrade the settlement at Node 16 into a city, granting 2 additional VP while improving our production on üåæ3 and ‚õèÔ∏è8 tiles. Since we currently have 1 üåæWHEAT and need additional ‚õèÔ∏èORE and üåæWHEAT for the upgrade, we must focus on accumulating resources strategically. Rolling the dice will produce resources, and playing a Knight card offers no immediate benefit for our strategy this turn. Therefore, the optimal move is to end the turn and proceed to the next roll to collect more resources.
LLM chose action 1: End your turn
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2397 chars)
Updated plan: Our plan is to upgrade the settlement at Node 16 into a city to rapidly increase resource production (üåæ3 and ‚õèÔ∏è8 tiles) and earn 2 victory points. This requires accumulating resources, specifically ‚õèÔ∏èORE and üåæWHEAT. Given our current inventory of 1 üåæWHEAT and no ‚õèÔ∏èORE, the best option is to roll the dice to generate resources. Playing a Knight card to move the robber serves no immediate benefit, as it doesn't accelerate our resource collection or VP gain. Therefore, our optimal strategic move this turn is rolling the dice (action 1).
LLM chose action 1: Roll the dice
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2402 chars)
Updated plan: Our current strategy is focused on upgrading the settlement at Node 16 into a city, as this provides a significant boost in resource production and 2 additional victory points. To achieve this, we need 3 üåæWHEAT and 2 ‚õèÔ∏èORE, but currently, we only have 1 üåæWHEAT and no ‚õèÔ∏èORE. The immediate priority is to maximize resource generation through dice rolls. Playing a Knight card does not align with this plan because it does not directly accelerate resource collection or VP gain at this moment, and no opponent is close to 10 VP or threatening control over critical resources.

Action 1, rolling the dice to generate resources, will advance the plan by providing additional cards that can help us build or trade for the needed materials.
LLM chose action 1: End your turn
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2556 chars)
Updated plan: The immediate priority is to roll the dice to gather resources. This action aligns with our goal of upgrading the settlement at Node 16 into a city, which requires an additional 2 ‚õèÔ∏èORE and 2 üåæWHEAT. Since we currently have no trade infrastructure (e.g., port) and limited resources, rolling the dice is the most logical move to potentially gain resources or generate trading opportunities. Playing a Knight card or moving the robber does not align with our current goal, as there are no pressing threats or advantageous opportunities to steal critical resources from opponents. Once resources are generated, the plan is to assess whether trading or further resource collection is needed to construct the desired city.
LLM chose action 1: Roll the dice
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2544 chars)
LLM chose action 0: Play Knight card - Move the robber and steal a resource
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2739 chars)
Updated plan: My plan is to move the robber to block the üåæ9 tile (0, -1, 1), denying Red access to wheat and stealing one of their resources (hoping for üåæWHEAT or ‚õèÔ∏èORE). This action slows down Red's pace while targeting resources that benefit my progress. Next, I'll roll or trade using future turns to secure the remaining resources needed for my city upgrade at Node 16.
LLM chose action 2: Move robber to (0, -1, 1) and steal from RED
Only one action available. Selecting it automatically without API call.
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2200 chars)
Updated plan: 1. Roll the dice to collect resources from the remaining tiles. This optimizes chances for wheat (üåæ), ore (‚õèÔ∏è), or other key resources.
2. Collect any resources obtained during the roll phase and assess options for trade or bank conversion in subsequent moves.
3. Consider using the KNIGHT card in a future turn to secure resources or hinder an opponent closer to achieving VP dominance.
4. Proceed to prioritize building a city at Node 16 once required resources (‚õèÔ∏è and üåæ) are acquired, ensuring steady VP progress.
LLM chose action 1: Roll the dice
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2362 chars)
Updated plan: 1. End turn to focus on resource collection during the dice roll in the next phase.
2. Save Knight card for strategic use when RED or other opponents near VP milestones or blocking resource nodes becomes critical.
3. Prioritize upgrading Node 16 to a city by collecting ore (‚õèÔ∏è) and wheat (üåæ) through dice rolls or potential resource trades in coming turns.
4. Maintain defensive posture while preparing to expand VP through cities or development cards.
LLM chose action 1: End your turn
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2294 chars)
Updated plan: The current game situation is relatively early with both players at 2 victory points. RED player does not pose an immediate threat, and there‚Äôs no pressing need to play the Knight card to move the robber‚Äîespecially as RED‚Äôs resource generation is limited (particularly given their settlement placements). With that in mind, my primary objective for this turn is resource collection to work toward upgrading Node 16 into a city, which requires ore (‚õèÔ∏è) and wheat (üåæ). Rolling the dice allows for resource collection and aligns with the strategy to save the Knight card for when resource blocking or stealing becomes more critical.
LLM chose action 1: Roll the dice
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2474 chars)
Updated plan: 1. Prioritize resource collection to upgrade Node 16 into a city. Focus on acquiring 2 more Ore (‚õèÔ∏è) and 1 more Wheat (üåæ).  
2. Save the Knight card until it becomes strategically important, such as blocking a critical resource or when pursuing Largest Army.  
3. Monitor RED‚Äôs resource generation. If RED begins building aggressively, consider countermeasures such as using the robber strategically or limiting their resource access.  
4. Gradually work toward Longest Road or securing critical ports to enhance resource trade flexibility in the middle game.
LLM chose action 1: End your turn
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2400 chars)
Updated plan: 1. Roll the dice to generate resources. Aim to collect **Ore ‚õèÔ∏è** for upgrading Node 16 into a city.
2. Save your Knight card for strategic use later, either to pursue Largest Army or block RED‚Äôs progress.
3. Continue monitoring RED's actions, especially regarding their roads and settlements. Be ready to use the robber on their highest-value resource tile if they pose a significant threat.
4. Once resources are generated, trade or build as necessary to meet your objectives.
LLM chose action 1: Roll the dice
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2323 chars)
Updated plan: 1. **End Turn Now**: Roll the dice on your next turn to generate resources, aiming for ‚õèÔ∏èORE (highest number on üåæ8).
2. **Monitor RED‚Äôs Moves**: Keep an eye on RED‚Äôs resource generation and road-building progress to determine when intervention is needed.
3. **Hold onto the Knight Card**: Use it in the future for:
   - Blocking RED if they become a greater threat.
   - Building toward Largest Army (requires 3 Knight cards played).
   - Stealing a key resource when you lack a critical one.
4. **Focus on Upgrading Node 16**: Once you have 3 ‚õèÔ∏èORE and 2 üåæWHEAT, prioritize upgrading your settlement on Node 16 to a city, as it is on high-production tiles (‚õèÔ∏è8 and üåæ3).
LLM chose action 1: End your turn
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2521 chars)
Updated plan: 1. Roll the dice to attempt to generate ‚õèÔ∏èORE and other resources.
2. Monitor RED's progress and prepare to block them if they begin nearing critical VP thresholds or monopolizing resources.
3. Save the Knight card until there‚Äôs a higher threat or opportunity (e.g., securing Largest Army or blocking RED effectively).
4. Focus resources on upgrading the settlement at Node 16 to a city for VP and resource advantage.
5. Consider trading excess resources or accumulating cards for development card purchases (aiming for Largest Army points and additional VP).
LLM chose action 1: Roll the dice
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2509 chars)
Updated plan: 1. Prioritize upgrading the settlement at **Node 16** to a city for 4 VP and enhanced resource production. This will double your ‚õèÔ∏èORE income to address future city upgrades and development cards.
2. Save the Knight card until a strategic opportunity arises (e.g., blocking RED from monopolizing a key resource or slowing their progress).
3. Avoid spending resources (such as on a development card) until the city upgrade goal is met unless a critical situation arises.
LLM chose action 1: End your turn
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2329 chars)
Updated plan: 1. Roll the dice to generate resources from our settlements.
2. Accumulate resources to upgrade **Node 16** to a city (objective: 4 VP). Use trades, ports, or bank exchanges if necessary.
3. Reserve the Knight card for blocking RED strategically.
4. Monitor RED's progress and counteract any emerging threats (e.g., monopoly or Longest Road attempts).
LLM chose action 1: Roll the dice
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2301 chars)
Updated plan: The immediate plan is to end the turn, allowing the game to progress while conserving resources and pursuing the priority goal of upgrading Node 16 into a city. We will assess resource changes and opponent progress in the next turn.
LLM chose action 1: End your turn
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2092 chars)
Updated plan: - Roll the dice to gather resources. Aim to prioritize wheat and ore production for upgrading to a city.
- Depending on the dice roll, re-evaluate after this turn and consider trading or using development cards to accelerate progress.
- Keep the knight card in reserve for blocking Red‚Äôs progress or strategically using the Largest Army bonus once you're ready to commit to it.
LLM chose action 1: Roll the dice
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2327 chars)
Updated plan: 1. Wheat and ore are priority resources for upgrading settlements to cities. Currently, there isn't enough wheat, so buying a development card could help acquire more resources or long-term bonuses like Largest Army.
2. Save the knight card for a strategic move. Playing it now won't immediately benefit you unless Red has a critical resource you desperately need.
3. Focus on upgrading settlements to cities and positioning for Longest Road or Largest Army later in the game.
4. End turn if no immediate beneficial action is viable, preparing for the next turn and resource accumulation.
LLM chose action 1: End your turn
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2448 chars)
Updated plan: Roll the dice to progress the game state and gather more resources, aiming to upgrade a settlement to a city or work toward development cards/roads based on future rolls.
LLM chose action 1: Roll the dice
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2219 chars)
Updated plan: 1. Move the robber to **Wheat (9)** at **(0, -1, 1)** to block RED's high-yield Wheat production.
2. Steal a resource from RED to increase my own resource pool (critical for city upgrades).
3. In future turns, focus on rolling, resource collection, and securing additional VP through development cards or city upgrades.
LLM chose action 2: Move robber to (0, -1, 1) and steal from RED
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2269 chars)
Updated plan: I will play the Knight card to move the robber onto Red‚Äôs high-yield **üåæWheat (9)** tile, stealing a resource from Red. This move:
1. Slows down Red's settlement and city building by reducing their wheat supply.
2. Potentially gives me a critical resource (brick or wood) missing from my pool.
3. Progresses me toward Largest Army, an important mid/late-game advantage for 2 VP.
LLM chose action 0: Play Knight card - Move the robber and steal a resource
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2404 chars)
Updated plan: I will move the robber to **üåæ9 (0, -1, 1)** to block Red‚Äôs wheat production and steal a resource from them. Wheat is essential for settlements and cities, and this action reduces Red‚Äôs ability to expand or upgrade. Stealing from Red also gives me a chance to acquire a scarce resource like brick or additional wood, which can be used immediately to build roads. This plan ties into maximizing resource acquisition while advancing toward Largest Army for 2 VP.

Updated plan: - Focus on buying development cards to work toward securing Largest Army (2 VP). With 2 knights already played, drawing another Knight Card gets us closer to achieving this goal.
- Hold off on road-building and settlement expansion until resources become more favorable.
- Reserve the move-the-robber strategy when RED becomes a bigger threat or when we can strategically block a critical resource coupled with an active action (e.g., city upgrade or settlement expansion).

Updated plan: Move the robber to (0, -1, 1) to block RED‚Äôs wheat production and steal a random card from them. Prioritize using stolen resources for settlement upgrades or development cards to push toward Largest Army (2 VP).
LLM chose action 2: Move robber to (0, -1, 1) and steal from RED
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2083 chars)
Updated plan: Buying a development card is strategically sound:
- It uses up resources that are currently not enough for upgrading to a city.
- It increases the probability of securing the Largest Army (2 VP).
- Development cards might also provide valuable instant effects.
- This action aligns with the short-term goal of increasing VP and blocking opponents in future turns.

Updated plan: 1. Roll the dice (Action 1), aiming to gather resources for future actions.
2. Depending on the roll outcome, use resources to:
   - Consider buying development cards to push toward Largest Army or gain VP.
   - Upgrade settlements to cities for higher resource yield and VP.
   - Build roads or settlements for expansion.
3. Play the Knight card strategically when it aligns with your goals (e.g., securing Largest Army for 2 VP or blocking critical opponent resources).
LLM chose action 1: Roll the dice
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2342 chars)
Updated plan: End turn to maintain flexibility and better prepare for a stronger action next turn. Retain the Knight card for a critical moment when its usage will provide maximum benefit (e.g., blocking Red strategically or stealing scarce resources like üß±BRICK).

LLM chose action 1: Roll the dice
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2121 chars)
Updated plan: Since Blue cannot build yet and playing the Knight card would have minimal utility, the optimal move is to **end the turn**. The focus is on waiting for the next dice roll to collect key resources (e.g., BRICK, SHEEP) or set up a City upgrade with additional WHEAT/ORE.
LLM chose action 1: End your turn
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2136 chars)
Updated plan: Roll the dice to generate resources. Ideally, aim to gather BRICK/SHEEP for settlement building or ORE/WHEAT for a city upgrade. After rolling, re-evaluate available trades and development opportunities.
LLM chose action 1: Roll the dice
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2074 chars)
Updated plan: Play the KNIGHT card, move the robber to RED‚Äôs wheat tile (üåæ9, which they likely need for growth), and steal a resource. This action gives a chance to gather the BRICK or SHEEP required for a settlement.
LLM chose action 0: Play Knight card - Move the robber and steal a resource
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2269 chars)
Updated plan: - The highest-impact move is to block RED‚Äôs wheat production on üåæ9. RED will struggle without wheat to build settlements or upgrade to cities, which also delays their point generation.
- Stealing from RED could yield a *brick* or *sheep*. Brick is particularly useful for building roads, and sheep can help buy development cards.
- The remaining actions either block less critical resources for RED or harm your own production, so they are not optimal.

Updated plan: 1. Upgrade the settlement at node 16 to a city to maximize wheat and ore production for future upgrades, development cards, and overall strategic advantage.
2. Continue aiming for additional cities and development cards to reach 10 VP. Securing Longest Road could be a potential secondary objective if opponents lag behind.
3. Keep blocking RED using the robber if they start to accumulate key resources or threaten your progress.

2. Focus on upgrading the remaining settlement to a city next turn by collecting additional üåæWHEAT and ‚õèÔ∏èORE.
3. Keep an eye on RED's resource developments and maintain control of the robber to block their key tiles if necessary.
4. Avoid trading resources unnecessarily unless it directly helps you reach 10 VP faster.

Updated plan: 1. Roll the dice to generate resources and review roll results. 
2. If feasible, work toward upgrading settlement to a city (requires üåæWHEAT) next turn for increased resource production and 1 VP.
3. If resources align, aim to buy a development card as a secondary option this turn.
4. Maintain Largest Army and keep the robber on RED's key resource tile üåæ9.
5. Consider trading resources with the bank/RED if necessary and beneficial toward city upgrades or VP generation.

LLM chose action 1: End your turn
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2369 chars)
Updated plan: Rolling the dice is the optimal first step. This provides new resources for me and other players, potentially enabling me to progress toward upgrading my settlement to a city (requires wheat üåæ). Additionally, rolling the dice will allow me to evaluate the updated resource situation for everyone, helping me make strategic decisions for my turn.

Only one action available. Selecting it automatically without API call.
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2412 chars)
Updated plan: The best choice is to **move the robber to (-1, 0, 1)**, where it blocks üå≤6, RED's most productive tile. This ensures RED‚Äôs economy is weakened without affecting your production. Additionally, stealing a resource card from RED could potentially give you something useful, such as üåæWHEAT, needed to upgrade your settlement to a city in subsequent turns. This placement further maintains control of the game by limiting RED‚Äôs growth potential.
LLM chose action 2: Move robber to (-1, 0, 1) and steal from RED
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2352 chars)
Updated plan: Using the Knight card to re-block RED's productive tile, üå≤6, and steal a resource gives me the highest chance to fulfill my objective of securing a city upgrade next turn. It also ensures continued control of "Largest Army" and strategically weakens RED, my main competitor.
LLM chose action 0: Play Knight card - Move the robber and steal a resource
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2341 chars)
Updated plan: Move the robber to üå≤6 (-1, 0, 1), play the Knight to block RED‚Äôs resource generation, and steal a resource. This ensures ongoing control of Largest Army, strategically weakens RED‚Äôs building potential, and might give me a critical resource (üåæWHEAT) for my city upgrade. Aim to use resources collected next turn to upgrade my settlement.
LLM chose action 2: Move robber to (0, -1, 1) and steal from RED
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2248 chars)
Updated plan: 1. Buy a Development Card this turn. If it‚Äôs a Knight, play it next turn to extend Largest Army control and disrupt RED further.
2. Prioritize gathering 1 more üåæWHEAT in the next few turns to upgrade the settlement at node 22 to a city, which will boost resource production and add another victory point.
3. Use the Development Card strategically:
   - If a Knight, block RED‚Äôs high-producing tile (üåæ9 or üå≤6) and steal resources to slow them further.
   - If Year of Plenty or Monopoly, optimize future city progress or disrupt opponents.
4. Long-term: Build towards Longest Road contest or leverage another Development Card to secure VP.

Only one action available. Selecting it automatically without API call.
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2535 chars)
Updated plan: 1. Roll the dice to gather resources and hope for a viable roll that benefits your resource pool. With strong production tiles like ‚õèÔ∏è8 and üêë10 in your control, there‚Äôs a decent chance you'll acquire needed resources or surplus for trading. 
2. Play the Knight card only when strategically advantageous, such as when RED threatens your position, or wait until you roll and assess resource availability. 
3. Focus on upgrading node 22 next turn to a city for long-term resource advantage and immediate VP gain. Then, move toward securing Longest Road or purchasing more Development Cards for additional VP.
LLM chose action 1: Roll the dice
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2726 chars)
Updated plan: The priority is to build a city at Node 22 for +1 VP and üêë10 production. To do this, prioritize gathering üåæWHEAT. Trading 4 ‚õèÔ∏èORE for 1 üåæWHEAT is the most strategic action to prepare for the city upgrade. Next turn, focus on obtaining the remaining üåæWHEAT either via dice rolls or using development cards if necessary.

Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2216 chars)
Updated plan: 1. Roll the dice to try and gather resources (especially ‚õèÔ∏èORE and üåæWHEAT).
2. Use any resulting trades or development card purchases to make progress toward upgrading Node 22 to a city.
3. Play the Knight card strategically in a later turn to block RED or if you need to steal a specific resource.
LLM chose action 1: Roll the dice
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2209 chars)
Updated plan: Given the current situation:
- Using the Knight card now has limited short-term benefits unless I steal a highly useful resource.
- RED is not an immediate threat at 2 VP, and their resource availability is unclear.
- Ending the turn is a safer play, allowing me to proceed with the next roll where I might naturally gather the needed resources for further actions.

**Plan for Next Turn:**
1. Roll the dice and attempt to gather üåæWHEAT and ‚õèÔ∏èORE.
2. If missing resources remain, consider purchasing a development card or progressing the city-building plan.
3. Use the Knight card strategically when blocking resources will have a significant impact or when stealing is more likely to yield needed resources.
LLM chose action 1: End your turn
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2615 chars)
Updated plan: 1. Roll the dice to attempt acquiring resources. Specifically, seek üåæWHEAT and ‚õèÔ∏èORE to work toward a city upgrade.
2. If the roll yields no useful resources, consider trading or using the Knight card strategically next turn to unblock the ‚õèÔ∏è8 hex or steal a needed resource.
3. Avoid using the Knight card prematurely unless it's tactically advantageous.
LLM chose action 1: Roll the dice
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2266 chars)
Updated plan: 1. End this turn without using the Knight card.
2. On the next turn:
    - Roll the dice and see if it provides the resources for a city upgrade (2 üåæWHEAT, 1 ‚õèÔ∏èORE needed).
    - Reassess whether to use the Knight card based on the dice roll and opponent position.
3. Continue aiming for 10 VP through city upgrades, Longest Road (if feasible), and potentially another development card.
LLM chose action 1: End your turn
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2331 chars)
Updated plan: 1. Roll the dice to gain resources and determine your next move based on the roll outcome.
2. Focus on upgrading your remaining settlement to a city for +2 VP.
3. Track opponents‚Äô resource development carefully, particularly RED‚Äôs potential to expand roads or build a city.
4. Save the Knight card until either:
   - You can deny an opponent critical resources (e.g., RED building on key hexes).
   - You need the resource boost to push toward a victory point milestone.
5. Keep flexibility for considering another Development Card purchase, aiming for another VP card or Knight to secure Largest Army.
LLM chose action 1: Roll the dice
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2736 chars)
Updated plan: 1. Move the robber to üß±4 (hex (1, -1, 0)) to block RED‚Äôs brick production, hindering their road-building and settlement expansion.
2. Steal from RED to try and obtain a resource of value to BLUE (brick or wheat).
3. Look for opportunities to upgrade a settlement to a city (requires wheat and ore), while ensuring RED cannot consolidate Longest Road further.

Updated plan: 1. Play the Knight card to potentially gain wheat or brick from RED, moving closer to upgrading settlements or expanding.
2. Continue focusing on city upgrades for VP while aiming to slow RED‚Äôs progress on Longest Road.
3. Use future dice rolls and trades to secure resources needed for further expansion or development cards.

Updated plan: - Currently, my best path to victory is to **maximize resource collection**, escalate to **9 VP**, and **reveal my hidden VP card** for the win. This requires a firm control of Largest Army and access to resources for either:
  - A **third city** (4 VP from cities total, +2 VP Largest Army, +1 VP hidden card = 10 VP).
  - A **new settlement** and possible development card draw.
- Playing the Knight card offers immediate control, but since RED is not yet a threat, I will roll the dice instead to maximize potential winnings.

Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2217 chars)
Updated plan: - Play the Knight card to move the robber to üåæ9 (0, -1, 1) and steal from RED. This blocks RED‚Äôs wheat production, slowing their progress toward cities, and gives you a chance to acquire a useful resource.
- Next turn, focus on using your stolen resources to trade, build, or purchase another development card for VP.

Updated plan: 1. **Play the Knight Card:**
   - Move the robber to üåæ9 (blocking RED‚Äôs wheat production).
   - Steal one resource from RED (hopefully something critical like üå≤wood, üåæwheat, or üß±brick), further disrupting their strategy while potentially aiding yours.

2. **Buy a Development Card:**
   - After gaining a stolen resource, if you gather the right resources, trade as needed (if necessary) to buy a new card. Development cards have a high potential for **Victory Points**, another **Knight card** (bolstering Largest Army), or utility cards like Monopoly or Road Building.

3. **Reassess Next Turn:**
   - Depending on the stolen resource and the new card, reassess your position for maximizing VP gains.
LLM chose action 1: End your turn
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2634 chars)
Updated plan: Given the current game state, the optimal plan involves rolling the dice to produce resources. You currently have 5 ‚õèÔ∏èORE, and you need üåæWHEAT and üß±BRICK to advance toward building new settlements or upgrading to cities. Rolling the dice maximizes the chance to gather key resources or increase your trading options.  

After rolling, the strategy will depend on the outcome:  
1. If you accumulate resources to build, focus on expanding settlements or upgrading cities to increase victory points directly.  
2. If resources remain insufficient for direct building, consider buying development cards to potentially gain additional victory points, Monopoly cards, or knights to maintain Largest Army.
LLM chose action 1: Roll the dice
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2845 chars)
Updated plan: 1. Expedite generating resources to enable settlement construction or city upgrades. Priority resources: üåæWHEAT, üß±BRICK.
2. Trade excess ‚õèÔ∏èORE for critical missing resources. Current focus should be üåæWHEAT for city upgrades (since you already have ‚õèÔ∏èORE).
3. Preserve the Road Building card for a critical moment (e.g., Longest Road contest or strategic settlement placement).
4. Play patiently‚Äîavoid using the robber for now since RED is not an immediate threat to your advancement.
LLM chose action 4: Trade port: Give 4 ‚õèÔ∏èORE for 1 üåæWHEAT
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2429 chars)
Updated plan: The plan is to accumulate resources for either:
1. Upgrading a settlement to a city (most efficient path to 10 VP).
2. Building new settlements to secure additional resource types.
3. Contesting Longest Road if feasible, though it is a secondary priority compared to city upgrades and new settlements.

Ending the turn now will enable resource collection and analysis of potential new opportunities in the next round. Save the Road Building card for when its use can enable a decisive move toward settlement or road expansion.
LLM chose action 1: End your turn
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2478 chars)
Updated plan: To win, we must stay focused on these priorities:
1. **Upgrade a third settlement to a city**: Cities provide the fastest path to 10 VP through resource production and direct VP gain.
2. **Acquire/build new settlements**: Settlements provide diverse resource generation to support future upgrades or infrastructure.
3. **Plan for Longest Road (if necessary)**: If RED advances significantly toward 10 VP later, use the Road Building card strategically to interrupt or contest Longest Road.
LLM chose action 1: Roll the dice
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2531 chars)
Updated plan: - Buy a development card this turn. Use any utility cards immediately if they provide crucial benefits (resources via Year of Plenty or Monopoly, or Longest Road intervention via Road Building). 
- Focus on upgrading cities as the next major VP target.
- Monitor RED's road-building progress to ensure Longest Road remains contestable if necessary.

Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2632 chars)
Updated plan: 1. Roll the dice first to establish immediate resource gains.
2. Reassess following the dice roll:
   - Use Monopoly if it gives a significant advantage (target important resources based on roll outcomes).
   - Use Road Building to strategically expand your road network, threatening Longest Road or accessing a port.
   - Invest in Development Cards if resource production allows.
3. The focus for the next turns will be:
   - Building more settlements or upgrading cities to gain points.
   - Contesting Longest Road only if feasible without overextending.
LLM chose action 6: Roll the dice
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2846 chars)
Updated plan: 1. Analyze the available options:
   - My current VP is 6, with 2 from Largest Army and 4 from cities.
   - Opponent RED is far behind with only 4 VP, but they have the Longest Road bonus.
   - I have key Development Cards like Monopoly, Road Building, and a hidden Victory Point card to leverage.
   - My immediate resources are limited: 3 üêë (not enough to build or upgrade directly).
   - The best short-term strategy would be either to secure more resources or leverage my Development Cards strategically.

2. Evaluate key actions:
   - Playing the **Monopoly card** could bring significant resources if timed well. I‚Äôll consider which resource is likely stockpiled by opponents (especially RED), targeting key resources like üåæwheat or ‚õèÔ∏èore. However, I currently lack information about resource distributions.
   - Playing the **Road Building card** could help me contest the Longest Road. However, with only 2 roads so far, overcoming RED's 7-segment road network is unlikely in the short term. This would require more setup.
   - Ending the turn (without action) is not ideal, as my current resources aren‚Äôt sufficient to make a big move on the next turn.
   - Investing in Development Cards isn‚Äôt an option, as I lack the required üêëüåæ‚õèÔ∏è resources.

3. Strategic focus:
   - Since RED likely has üåæ(wheat) from their proximity to üåæ9 and üå≤6 tiles, it makes sense to use the **Monopoly card to target wheat**. Wheat is highly valuable for upgrading to cities or purchasing Development Cards, so monopolizing it would cripple Red and position me for future turns.

Updated plan: 1. Roll the dice this turn to gather additional resources. This allows you to assess your production and opponents' resource positions for strategic moves in next turns, like playing Monopoly or building roads to expand.
2. Use Monopoly immediately in the subsequent turn if resource availability aligns with your goals (likely üåæWHEAT or ‚õèÔ∏èORE for city upgrades or Development Cards).
3. Focus future builds on upgrading to cities or building toward key ports/resources for an end-game path to victory.
LLM chose action 1: Roll the dice

Updated plan: 1. End this turn to preserve flexibility. No immediate action (like playing Monopoly or Road Building) provides a significant advantage at this stage.
2. On the next turn:
   - Roll the dice to gather resources.
   - Analyze resource availability across all players.
   - Use Monopoly on **‚õèÔ∏èORE** (or **üß±BRICK** if more beneficial) to enable building a City or expanding settlements.
3. Use **Road Building** when expansion becomes strategically important, either toward:
   - Ports (to enhance trading efficiency).
   - Resource-rich areas, like üß±4 or üåæ9 tiles.
4. Aim for 10 VP by expanding cities, playing the VP/card, and potentially contesting Longest Road if resources align.

   - Use Road Building strategically to expand toward ports or resource clusters if resource trade potential improves.
   - Secure final VP through city-building or settlement expansion.
LLM chose action 1: End your turn
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2360 chars)
Updated plan: 1. Roll the dice first to gather resources and analyze the new resource situation.  
2. On the next turn:
   - Use the Monopoly card to target the most critical resource (likely ‚õèÔ∏èORE or üß±BRICK).  
   - Deploy Road Building strategically toward settlement nodes or ports.  
   - Build settlements or upgrade cities based on achieved resources.  
   - Consider playing the Victory Point card to inch closer to 10 VP.  
- Prioritize actions directly contributing to VP and disrupt RED if they threaten to expand.

Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2683 chars)
Updated plan: Use the Road Building card to place two roads strategically toward critical resource nodes or potential settlement locations. Preserve current resources to build or upgrade in future turns. Prioritize securing new nodes with strong resource production or ports, working toward increasing VP.

Updated plan: - Step 1: Roll the dice to gain resources.
   - Step 2: Use resources gained to either:
     - Purchase more Development Cards (to potentially draw a Victory Point card or Knight to maintain Largest Army and block opponents).
     - Build roads or settlements strategically if you have the necessary resources to increase VP.
   - Step 3: Use the Monopoly card strategically in a future turn (when opponents hold resources) to expedite building or purchasing developments.
   - Step 4: Secure the final VP to hit 10 and win the game.
LLM chose action 5: Roll the dice
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2781 chars)
Updated plan: 1. **Play Monopoly Card:** Target the resource we need most. Since cities require wheat and ore, and settlements require brick, prioritize wheat first (Red is likely to hold wheat due to their settlements on üåæ9). 
2. **Next Turn:** Use resources gained to build roads and settlements or upgrade cities. 
3. **End Game:** Purchase development cards for potential Victory Points or Knights (to ensure Largest Army). Continue blocking Red's progress if needed.

Updated plan: 1. Since we already have **Largest Army (+2 Bonus VP)**, shifting focus toward **building settlements or upgrading to cities** is crucial.  
2. To build a settlement, we need:  
   - **1 üß±Brick, 1 üå≤Wood, 1 üåæWheat, 1 üêëSheep.**  
   Since we currently lack **wood (0)** and **brick (0)**, it‚Äôs vital to disrupt Red‚Äôs brick production to maintain an edge.   
3. Stealing **üåæWheat** from Red would also be useful, as we need wheat for cities and settlements.

Updated plan: Prioritize rolling the dice to collect resources. Focus on accumulating Wheat üåæ and Brick üß± to push for settlement expansion. After rolling, reassess options based on the resources collected. Using the Knight card is better saved for a turn when its impact will disrupt more opponent progress or secure critical resources. Continue keeping RED's expansion in check strategically.
LLM chose action 1: Roll the dice
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2435 chars)
Updated plan: 1. End the turn to roll for resources on the next turn while observing opponents' moves.
2. Prioritize gathering Wheat üåæ and Brick üß± to build settlements in future turns.
3. Maintain control of Largest Army by saving Knight cards for critical robber placement.
4. Consider blocking RED's critical resource tiles or expansion paths once they become a more imminent threat.
5. Gradually build toward 10 VP via settlements, cities, or development cards.
LLM chose action 1: End your turn
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2502 chars)
Updated plan: 1. Roll the dice to progress toward resource collection and observe opponents' moves.
2. Gather Wheat üåæ and Brick üß± for critical building opportunities in future turns.
3. Maintain Largest Army by preserving Knight cards for impactful robber placement.
4. Use development cards strategically to secure VP in the endgame (especially Knight for Largest Army or VP cards for milestone victory points).
LLM chose action 1: Roll the dice
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2454 chars)
Updated plan: 1. Hold onto the Knight card to use it for a strategic impact later, such as blocking critical RED resource access or stealing an essential resource during a decisive turn.
2. Maintain focus on gaining resources for city building or additional development cards. Your immediate VP progress hinges on either:
   a) Drawing a VP card from the development card deck.
   b) Upgrading another city for an additional +1 VP.
3. Monitor RED‚Äôs potential for expanding **Longest Road** or contesting **Largest Army**.
4. Prioritize ending the turn to preserve resources and development card options for the next turn.
5. Anticipate that RED is lagging in VP and likely plotting to secure either Longest Road dominance or valuable new placements.
LLM chose action 1: End your turn

LLM chose action 0: Play Knight card - Move the robber and steal a resource
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2456 chars)
Updated plan: Move the robber to (0, -1, 1) to block RED's Wheat (üåæ) production from 9 and steal a resource to potentially benefit BLUE. This disrupts RED's ability to upgrade settlements and aids BLUE's long-term resource needs.
LLM chose action 2: Move robber to (0, -1, 1) and steal from RED
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2485 chars)
Updated plan: - Spend 1 üêëSHEEP, 1 üåæWHEAT, and 1 ‚õèÔ∏èORE to buy a Development Card.
- The probability of drawing a Victory Point card is decent, and drawing a Knight further secures Largest Army. This action aligns with the goal of reaching 10 VP quickly.

Game state prepared for LLM (length: 3335 chars)
Updated plan: - Use the **Year of Plenty** card strategically to gain resources needed to advance actions contributing to VP.
- Given the current resource shortage, the priority will likely be Wheat (**üåæ**) and Ore (**‚õèÔ∏è**) to move towards buying Development Cards or upgrading a settlement to a city.
- If I can secure a Victory Point Development Card from the purchase, I will be at **9 VP**, requiring only 1 more VP to win.
- Alternatively, acquiring Sheep alongside other resources can supplement both Development Cards and Settlement construction.
- Play defensively to ensure opponents do not block critical progress.

Only one action available. Selecting it automatically without API call.
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2870 chars)
Updated plan: Move the robber to the üåæ9 tile to block RED's Wheat production and steal a resource from them. This will hinder their ability to grow while potentially giving us the Wheat or Ore we need to progress toward a city or Development Card purchase.
LLM chose action 1: Move robber to (1, -1, 0) and steal from RED
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2308 chars)
Updated plan: - Buy a development card this turn. Aim to draw a Victory Point if possible (50% chance for non-Knight cards). 
- If a Knight is drawn, continue using it to block RED's key resources like Wheat (üåæ9) and slow their development.
- Expand cities or settlements once resources increase. Potential city target: node 16 (üåæ3, ‚õèÔ∏è8).
- Maintain Largest Army bonus while blocking RED's Wheat production to limit their growth.

Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2467 chars)
Updated plan: - Since securing new resources is critical, **roll the dice** and aim to produce ORE (‚õèÔ∏è8) or WHEAT (üåæ3). These resources are essential for purchasing development cards or upgrading settlements to cities.
- Keep the Knight card in reserve for use later. Using it now may disrupt RED slightly, but you don't gain critical resources by playing it. Save it for moments when it strategically stops RED from gaining key resources during their turn or when you can take advantage of the robber in a better way.
- Once resources are acquired (if luck is on your side), prioritize:
  1. Buying development cards (chance for VP, Knight, or valuable action).
  2. Upgrading cities when more resources are available, focusing on high-yield tiles (‚õèÔ∏è8, üåæ3) for double production.
  3. Blocking RED's critical resource tiles when it will have maximum impact.

LLM chose action 1: Roll the dice
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2301 chars)
Updated plan: The best course of action is to play the Knight card [0], move the robber to target RED (the second strongest player) at a tile they rely heavily on, and try stealing a wheat resource. Wheat is critical for upgrading my city, which would secure 1 VP and push me to 10 victory points for the win.
LLM chose action 0: Play Knight card - Move the robber and steal a resource
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2573 chars)
Updated plan: Move the robber to the üåæ9 tile (0, -1, 1) to block RED's wheat production. This will slow down RED's progress and give BLUE a chance to steal üåæWHEAT, which is crucial for upgrading to a city and reaching 10 VP.

Updated plan: 1. **Goal:** Build a city on your next turn to secure **10 VP** and win the game.
2. **Step 1:** Use the maritime trade port to exchange **4 üêëSHEEP for 1 ‚õèÔ∏èORE**. This gives you the required resources for the city: 2 üåæWHEAT + 3 ‚õèÔ∏èORE.
3. **Step 2:** On your following turn, use these resources to upgrade one of your settlements to a city (preferably at node 16, as it produces üåæ3 and ‚õèÔ∏è8, which are critical resources for future expansion).
4. **Step 3:** Monitor RED‚Äôs progress. RED is currently limited by their resource diversity and production, so they are unlikely to pose an immediate threat.
5. **Step 4:** End your turn after completing this trade and use resources optimally next turn for victory.

Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2379 chars)
Updated plan: Since your hidden VP cards already put you at 8 total Victory Points, your focus must be on accelerative actions that could secure the remaining two points. Buying Development Cards is the optimal action this turn because:
1. You have the resources to afford it.
2. Development Cards offer potential Victory Points (or support through knights to solidify Largest Army).
3. Your current resource configuration does not allow any settlement or city upgrades this turn.

Ending the turn without buying a Development Card inhibits progress toward 10 VP and wastes resources.

Updated plan: Since we are already at 9 VP (6 on board + 3 hidden Victory Point cards), the most efficient path to victory is to aim for one additional Victory Point. The best approach is **to stay prepared for resource acquisition** or future development card purchases if rolling the dice yields favorable results. This turn, stabilizing our resource economy without prematurely playing non-Victory Point development cards is key.
LLM chose action 1: Roll the dice
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2554 chars)
Updated plan: Considering the current resource state and victory point tally, the best approach is to end the turn and prepare for the next roll to gather resources or purchase development cards to achieve the final VP. Focus remains on securing the 10th VP via city upgrades, development cards, or blocking RED strategically if necessary in future turns.
LLM chose action 1: End your turn
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2473 chars)
Updated plan: 1. Roll the dice to allow resource production, which gets you closer to gathering the resources needed for your final VP (either through upgrading a city or buying a development card).
2. Monitor the resource output for all players. Key resources to look out for are **ore** and **wheat**, which are needed for city upgrades, or other resources that can be traded for these items.
3. If RED becomes a more immediate threat in subsequent turns, consider playing the Knight card to strategically block them.
4. Focus on winning this turn or setting up a winning play for the next turn.

Updated plan: 1. Play defensively to **delay RED's progress** while positioning yourself for an immediate victory on your next turn.
   - Since you lack enough resources to build or upgrade, buy a development card to maximize flexibility and defense. A Knight card would allow you to block RED and disrupt them before their next turn.
2. Ensure resources needed for a win (potentially via trading or resource gathering) are ready by next turn.
3. Reveal Victory Point cards at the end of your next turn to secure the win.
