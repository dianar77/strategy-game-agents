You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options to maximize your Victory Points and WIN the game with 10 Victory Points.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions.
2. Focus on strategic settlement placement, resource production, road building, trading, and city upgrades over successive turns.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}.
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number.
5. Update your strategic plan when necessary by using <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Expand roads toward Brick port (Node 14), then build settlement, followed by upgrading settlements to cities for sustained resource doubling.</plan>

**Early Settlement Placement Guide:**
- Prioritize intersections with the highest probability of resource production (based on hex numbers like 6, 8, 5, and 9).
- Ensure balanced access to diverse resources (Brick, Wood, Wheat, Ore, and Sheep).
- The first settlement should maximize production, while the second should fill gaps in resources and strategically target valuable ports.
- Block potential expansions by opponents where possible without compromising your primary strategy.

**Port and Expansion Strategy:**
- Identify and build roads toward high-value ports that complement your resources (e.g., 2:1 ports or generic 3:1).
- Consider neighboring hex numbers to optimize early port settlements.
- Use road expansions dynamically to secure critical nodes, ports, or routes for "Longest Road."

**Resource and Trade Management:**
- Monitor resource abundance and scarcity to plan effective trades or monopolizations.
- Aim to utilize trades strategically to balance your resources and prioritize building settlements and cities.

**Mid-Game Objectives:**
- Upgrade settlements to cities to double resource production.
- Continue road and settlement expansions to dominate territory and block opponents when possible.
- Consider purchasing Development Cards when resources are aligned to secure "Largest Army." 

**Board Understanding Guide:**
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers.
- Settlements/cities and their production capacity are listed in the BUILDINGS section.
- üîç marks the robber's current location, blocking resource production on that hex.
- Ports offer significant advantages for trading‚Äîfocus on securing beneficial ports early in the game.

Think strategically and plan for the next several turns to outmaneuver opponents and achieve victory!
