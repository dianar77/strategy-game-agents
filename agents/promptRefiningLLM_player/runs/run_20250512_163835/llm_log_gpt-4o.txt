As a rule of thumb, during your first settlement placement, it‚Äôs usually best not to point your road toward the middle of the board. You will likely have no expansion spots since everyone will start toward the middle, rather than the coast.
Anytime your road is in a contestable direction, make sure you‚Äôre the one cutting someone off or are more likely to win the race ‚Äî not the other way around. [...] Think of a Catan map as having 3 areas ‚Äî the center, inner, and coastal rings. The ‚Äúcenter‚Äù is all the spots around the middle hex, ‚Äúinner‚Äù is the next one outward, and so on.
For starters, the coast never makes sense for your first placement as it will only have 2 hexes of production (3 for you to build more central) and it will inhibit your optionality to expand. [...] This is what you should spend most of your time thinking about when making your initial placements. Depending on who you are playing with and where they might place their settlements will have a major impact on your game.
You need to think about how their spots will affect your placements, how strong their set-up will be, and how it will affect their relationships with everyone else at the table. (More on this later.)

Colonist Strategies: What are the Best Catan Starting Strategies?

Today we will be giving you pointers on the best starting placement strategies for Settlers of Catan that you can use in Colonist.

Colonist.io

1. Identify Your Goals

The first and most important Catan Strategy is knowing what you want to build. This will dictate which resources you should go after when you place your starting settlements. [...] Overall, placing your starting settlements wisely will give you a huge advantage in Settlers of Catan. But this is just one of the many strategies that can be employed in the game.

It is very hard to employ all these tactics in every game though, as the board is arranged randomly by the system and your neighbors choices restrict yours.

However, having a good grasp of starting positions and initial placements will help greatly in winning you your next Colonist game. [...] If you plan ahead and look at complementary spots on the board, then you might just score two spots that work in harmony with each other and give you all the resources you need.

With that in mind, the next most important aspect of starting placements to take into consideration would be: Numbers.

Now, now, you don‚Äôt need to be Pythagoras nor Einstein to figure this out.

I‚Äôll make it easy for you: be on as many different but high numbers as you can.

The best way to do this is to place your two first settlements on intersections with six different numbers total with ideally, the highest probability.
</Document>================================== Ai Message ==================================

Based on the research, several aspects of the early-game placement strategy must be incorporated into the new prompt. 

Here are some insights:

1. **Diversify Numbers**: Ensure that starting settlements are placed on intersections corresponding to six different dice roll numbers. Maximizing principles of probability increases overall chances of resource generation.

2. **Non-contested Expansion**: Use initial road placements carefully to reduce competition with neighboring players or aim expansion towards less contested areas.

3. **Avoid Coastal First Placements**: Coastal settlements typically generate resources from two hexes. Instead, prioritize locations generating resources from three hexes.

4. **Complementary Starting Spots**: Focus on strategically choosing locations where both starting spots complement each other, covering the essential resources (brick, ore, wood, wheat, sheep).

5. **Plan for Resource Harmony**: Symmetrically plan for collection soft gaps essential if)> improve%%% intertwinedtax_solver

SUMMARY:

1. **Learnings from Game Results**:
   - The "AlphaBetaPlayer" demonstrated a dominant performance in wins (5 out of 5 games), achieving an average of 5.2 Victory Points (VP) and outperforming the "RandomPlayer."
   - Key performance metrics showed the AlphaBetaPlayer focused on settlements (AVG 2.8) and roads (AVG 0.8) while deprioritizing cities (AVG 0.4) and development cards (0 development VP).
   - The "RandomPlayer" underperformed significantly, earning an average of only 2.2 VP with minimal infrastructure development.
   - Games lasted an average of ~37.4 turns, with a duration of about 0.73 seconds per game.

2. **Strategies Implemented in the Prompt**:
   - The prompt emphasized analytical decision-making step-by-step to maximize resource production and secure Victory Points.
   - Strategic planning was incorporated, allowing the agent to evolve its approach over successive turns.
   - The board understanding guide included heuristics like connectivity of nodes for road building, recognizing blocked hexes, and leveraging ports for efficient trades.

3. **Performance Metrics Observed**:
   - The agent produced plans about prioritizing settlements, road expansions, and focusing on unblocked resource collection.
   - However, despite providing a robust analysis structure, the agent's effectiveness in generating high VP totals or advancing systematically toward a win (10 VP) was suboptimal, as evident in its real-world test run average VP score of 2.2.

When looking for intersections to place your first Settlements, pay less attention to the type of resource and more attention to the number of dots on the hex tiles that make up the intersections.¬† The type of resource matters less than the frequency of obtaining them. After all, resources can be traded to the bank at 4:1 or at Ports for an even better return (see below). [...] While the introductory game comes with a recommended board layout, later games are played on a randomized hex tile layout.¬† Take a close look at these random layouts at the start of the game. Are there two of the same resource next to one another?¬† Is at least one of the numbered chits on those tiles reasonably high? Consider placing a Settlement in the most advantageous intersection of those tiles, then build roads and additional Settlements around them to block your opponents from doing the

In Settlers of Catan, the order in which players place their initial settlements can significantly impact their strategy and success in the game. Each position‚Äîfirst, middle, or last‚Äîhas its advantages and disadvantages:
First Player
Advantages:- Optimal Location: The first player can choose the best starting spot on the board, often securing a high-probability resource hex (like 6s or 8s) and access to diverse resources. [...] Cities first strategy
Since cities double your earning power, an effective strategy can be to optimize for as much wheat and rock as you can get early in the game, upgrade to two cities as quickly as possible, and then trade out some of your abundant wheat and rock for wood and brick later to build roads and expand. If you can get access to sheep with this strategy, you can also quickly and easily pursue a strategy of buying a lot of development cards before building more settlements. [...] Given there is a limit of 7 cards before you are at risk of losing half your cards, it can be advantageous to have a steady stream of resources coming into your hand throughout the game. The best way to do this is to place your two first settlements on intersections with six different numbers total with ideally, the highest probability. If you can manage it, the best numbers to be on from the beginning would be 4,5,6,8,9,10 or some combination as close to that as possible. Ideally you would

- try to avoid trading down to just a few cards with the bank and being stuck unable to build. Chances are, you're doing so for a resource you're finding hard to get and therefore other players will know they can disproportionately hurt you with the robber if they steal it.

- preserve juicy settlement locations with judicious road placement. Lock up that port that's critical to your strategy early. Nothing more infuriating than having an opponent beat you to it. [...] You need to point these towards where you would like to build your next settlement. This will nearly always be towards the outside of the board. Don't bother pointing it at that empty 5/9/10 intersection - someone will occupy it for sure. That 4/9 port? Perfect. Road placement is all about second-guessing your opponents: you basically want to point your road at the (n+1)th best position left on the board where n = the number of settlement placements left. This is tough on round 1 of placements [...] Do:- start road, settlement, road, settlement. One of the settlements should be a port, ideally 3:1. These 4 settlements will be your engine of production. Now look to upgrade to cities (unless hand management and/or other opportunities dictate otherwise). Upgrade to cities before building settlements IF your settlement locations are secure.- It's often easier for the Producer to steal the Longest Road from the Explorer than it is to steal the Largest Army from the Commander or Developer.- win

6. Ports for High Concentration of the Same Resource

Waterfront properties are valuable. Both in real life and in Settlers of Catan.

Owning one makes the bank love you. To the point that they‚Äôll be willing to trade for less resources.

This is why ports play an important role in The Settlers of Catan.

Having the ability to trade 2:1 can win your game, so looking at the available ports on the board during your first placement is critical. [...] More often than not, it‚Äôs difficult to find ideal port placements in the onset of the game, but sometimes there‚Äôs that magical spot of paradise. So take it!

Of course, the high number resources that are next to their respective ports are extremely valuable.

One brick port on an 8 Brick slot will give you immediate, priceless trading power. There‚Äôs also the possibility of bagging a complementary port. [...] Of course, this is highly contextual and will depend on each game session.

However, looking at your opponents‚Äô spots might just open up opportunities that were not visible to you before.

For example, if all the Bricks on the board are on low-yield numbers like 2-3-4, then that‚Äôs a rare resource. Work on acquiring them early on.

5. Work on Expansion as Your Main Focus

Settlers of Catan is a game of conquest. Gaining as much territory as possible is one of the essentials in winning the game.

</Document>================================== Ai Message ==================================

From the research and performance review insights, here are the key weaknesses identified and strategies to implement in the updated prompt:

**Identified Weaknesses:**
1. **Early Settlement Placement:** The agent lacks an understanding of optimal first settlement placement, especially prioritizing high-probability hexes and balanced resources.
2. **Port Strategy:** The player doesn't leverage ports effectively to compensate for resource shortages or monopolize rare resources.
3. **Failure to Expand Quickly:** The agent struggles with road placement and settlement expansion to lock critical spots or ports.
4. **Resource Management and Trading:** The player doesn't optimally manage resources nor capitalize on trade to gain needed resources for strategic objectives.

### Updated Strategies to Address Weaknesses:

#### Early Settlement Placement:
- Prioritize first settlements based on high-probability hexes (6, 8, 5, 9) with resource diversity.
- Balance between high-frequency hexes and strategic positioning to maximize different resources.
- For the second settlement, prioritize a setup that ensures access to key resources not covered by the first settlement.
- Consider placements that block opponents‚Äô expansion toward critical nodes or resources.

#### Ports and Expansion:
- Identify high-value ports (e.g., 2:1 resource-specific ports). Ensure that a settlement adjacent to such a port complements a high-probability resource hex.
- Plan expansion road placements toward contiguous intersections that secure future port or resource control.

#### Trade Strategy and Flexibility:
- Use trades to balance resource shortages and monopolize critical resources required for expansions or city upgrades.
- Proactively consider trade ratios and aim to secure 3:1 or 2:1 ports early for flexibility.

- Prioritize intersections with the highest probability of resource production (based on hex numbers like 6, 8, 5, and 9).
- Ensure balanced access to diverse resources (Brick, Wood, Wheat, Ore, and Sheep).
- The first settlement should maximize production, while the second should fill gaps in resources and strategically target valuable ports.
- Block potential expansions by opponents where possible without compromising your primary strategy.

**Port and Expansion Strategy:**
- Identify and build roads toward high-value ports that complement your resources (e.g., 2:1 ports or generic 3:1).
- Consider neighboring hex numbers to optimize early port settlements.
- Use road expansions dynamically to secure critical nodes, ports, or routes for "Longest Road."

**Resource and Trade Management:**
- Monitor resource abundance and scarcity to plan effective trades or monopolizations.
- Aim to utilize trades strategically to balance your resources and prioritize building settlements and cities.

**Mid-Game Objectives:**
- Upgrade settlements to cities to double resource production.
- Continue road and settlement expansions to dominate territory and block opponents when possible.
- Consider purchasing Development Cards when resources are aligned to secure "Largest Army." 

**Board Understanding Guide:**
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers.
- Settlements/cities and their production capacity are listed in the BUILDINGS section.
- üîç marks the robber's current location, blocking resource production on that hex.
- Ports offer significant advantages for trading‚Äîfocus on securing beneficial ports early in the game.
