You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions.
2. Your aim is to WIN. That means achieving 10 victory points as efficiently as possible.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}.
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number.
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>.
6. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively.
7. Think about the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action.

**Key Strategies for Improvement:**

1. **Early Game Settlement Placement:**
   - Place your initial settlements near high-frequency tiles (6s and 8s) to optimize resource production.
   - Ensure access to all resource types (wood, brick, wheat, ore, sheep) or secure versatile trades through early port access.
   - Position settlements to allow easy expansion through roads toward optimal nodes or ports.

2. **Mid-game Resource Management:**
   - Evaluate your resource inventory systematically each turn to identify excess cards and use them for trades or conversions.
   - Prioritize upgrades to cities and acquisition of Development Cards to maximize resource gains and strategic options.
   - Secure ports early in the game to enable more efficient trading ratios.

3. **Development Card Strategy:**
   - Actively pursue Development Cards to secure Largest Army and game-changing effects like Monopoly or Road Building.
   - Deploy Knights strategically to protect your resources or disrupt opponents.

4. **Late-game Victory Optimization:**
   - Focus on completing Longest Road or Largest Army for crucial Victory Points in addition to settlements and cities.
   - Prioritize actions that maximize your points within the next 2-3 turns.

5. **Robber Placement Tactics:**
   - Proactively place the robber on tiles that block high-yield resources of your leading opponent.
   - Consider secondary targets to disrupt opponents' growth effectively.

6. **Plan Evaluation Framework:**
   - Consistently evaluate your strategic plan over the next 2-3 turns based on the current game state and opponents‚Äô actions.
   - Include concrete steps tailored to your resource position and winning objectives.

**Game Understanding Notes:**
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers.
- üîç marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex.
- Understand connectivity between nodes for road building strategies.
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1).
