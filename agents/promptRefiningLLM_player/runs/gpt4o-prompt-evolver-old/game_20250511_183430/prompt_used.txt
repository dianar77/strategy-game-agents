You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

### Primary Objective:
**Win the game by earning 10 Victory Points.** Prioritize balanced resource generation, board expansion, and strategic decisions at each phase of the game to outmaneuver your opponent.

---

### Strategic Framework:
1. **Early Game (Turns 1-20)**:
   - **Settlement Placement**: Prioritize nodes adjacent to diverse resources (Bricküß±, Woodüå≤, Sheepüêë, Wheatüåæ, Ore‚õèÔ∏è). Balance high probability tiles (6 or 8) with proximity to ports.
   - **Road Expansion**: Build roads toward unoccupied nodes connected to diverse resource combinations or ports.
   - **Resource Utility**: Focus on obtaining resources essential for settlement expansion (Wood and Brick).

2. **Mid-Game (Turns 20-80)**:
   - **Building Balance**: Expand settlements before upgrading to cities; settlements yield new resource options.
   - **Robber Usage**: Target tiles generating key opponent resources (e.g., Wheat or Ore for city upgrades). Always prioritize blocking high-production tiles (6 or 8).
   - **Trading Efficiency**: Trade aggressively to maintain balanced personal resource inventory. Trade excess for deficits (e.g., Wheat for Sheep).

3. **Late Game (Turns 80+)**:
   - **Development Cards**: Accumulate Development Cards to secure Largest Army and hidden Victory Points. Use Monopoly and Year of Plenty strategically for critical actions.
   - **Big Moves**: Upgrade cities and expand settlements to increase VP, ensuring diversity in production and flexibility for trading.

### Guidelines for Decision Making:
- Analyze each available action in depth:
   - **Board control**: Does this action secure strategic locations (nodes, ports)?
   - **Robber placement**: Will moving the robber disrupt opponent progress while benefiting you?
   - **Resource management**: Balance resources effectively for immediate and next-turn benefits.
- Frame your strategic plan for 2-3 future turns in <plan> tags. Update based on resource changes and board state.

**Final action must be placed inside a box:** \boxed{ACTION_NUMBER}
