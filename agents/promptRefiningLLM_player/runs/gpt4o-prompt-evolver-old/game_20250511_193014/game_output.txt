Updated plan: Prioritize upgrading Node 3 into a city to enhance resource throughput. Focus on acquiring Wheat (🌾) and Ore (⛰️) for development cards. Extend roads toward high-probability nodes or ports to maximize expansion. Take control of valuable nodes to support Largest Army and Longest Road bonuses.
LLM chose action 3: Build a settlement at node 3 (Cost: 1 🌲WOOD, 1 🧱BRICK, 1 🌾WHEAT, 1 🐑SHEEP)
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 1954 chars)
Updated plan: Prioritize unlocking missing resources (Wood 🌲 and Sheep 🐑), starting with access to the Wood (6) hex via road-building at edge (3, 4). Upgrade the settlement at node 3 into a city as soon as possible to increase resource production throughput. Expand toward nodes with high dice probabilities and ports for trading flexibility. Invest in development cards to secure Victory Points and build toward Largest Army.
LLM chose action 1: Build a road at edge (3, 4) (Cost: 1 🌲WOOD, 1 🧱BRICK)
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 3252 chars)
Updated plan: Since you are starting without access to Wood (🌲) and Sheep (🐑), your priority should be to expand to nodes that unlock these resources. Heading toward node 6 (Wood) by building roads from node 3 (e.g., connecting node 4 to 6) makes the most strategic sense. 

Your short-term strategy should focus on:
1. Securing access to Wood (🌲) at node 6.
2. Positioning yourself near a Sheep (🐑) node, preferably one with a high dice probability.
3. Expanding settlement options strategically, targeting nodes with scarce or high-probability resources like Ore (⛰️), Wheat (🌾), and port proximity.

In the longer term:
- Build a city at node 3 to boost resource throughput (Wheat 🌾 and Ore ⛰️ for development cards and more expansions).
- Work toward Largest Army (invest in development cards as your resources allow).

Game state prepared for LLM (length: 3442 chars)
Updated plan: 1. **Disrupt RED’s progress immediately**:
   - Play Year of Plenty strategically to accelerate development and disrupt RED's dominance.
   - The best disruption involves buying Development Cards (especially to secure Largest Army or hidden VPs).
     - Development Cards cost: Wheat (🌾), Ore (⛏️), Sheep (🐑).
  
2. **Focus resources on the most critical goal**:
   - You lack cities or resource production. Development Cards can give you up to 7 VPs long-term (5 hidden + 2 for Largest Army).
   - Ignore settlement building unless absolutely necessary—it’s too slow given RED's lead.
  
3. **Use the Robber as an active tool**:
   - Block RED's **Wheat (🌾)** from either node 9 or node 8.
   - RED's Wheat is critical for building cities or settlements, and blocking it slows their 10th VP significantly.

4. **Always prioritize Wheat (🌾) and Ore (⛏️)**:
   - These are critical for buying Development Cards and upgrading cities. Avoid wasting time on Brick (🧱) or Wood (🌲) barring short-term road needs.

5. **Next 1-2 turns**:
   - Immediately: Play Year of Plenty for resources useful for Development Cards—ideally **Wheat (🌾)** and **Ore (⛏️)**.
   - On next rolls, prioritize upgrading a settlement to a city or buying another Development Card.

Updated plan: Prioritize upgrading settlement at Node 7. Increase Wheat (🌾) production to synergize with our focus on city upgrades and development cards. After the city upgrade:
1. Save for additional resources to either build a second city at Node 1 or purchase development cards (as we collect Sheep 🐑).
2. Continue targeting Red by blocking critical nodes (Wheat 🌾6).
3. Once we stabilize cities and resource throughput, transition toward claiming Longest Road or additional VP from development cards.

1. Securing Largest Army (purchase Development Cards with Wheat 🌾, Ore ⛏️, and Sheep 🐑 to gain Knights).  
2. Gathering sufficient resources to upgrade settlements to cities for +2 VP.  
3. Secondary priority: Use Road Building to block RED or extend toward ports to bypass Wheat or Sheep gaps.  
4. Use the robber against RED’s most-productive tiles (e.g., ⛏️8 or 🌾6) when applicable.
LLM chose action 1: Roll the dice
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2432 chars)
Updated plan: Maintain focus on securing Largest Army by purchasing another Development Card (requires Sheep 🐑, Wheat 🌾, and Ore ⛏). End this turn to gather resources and evaluate trades. Secondary priority remains upgrading settlements to cities for VP. Use the Road Building card to disrupt RED or position for ports once BLUE is closer to domination.

Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2505 chars)
Updated plan: Strategic Focus:
1. Prioritize securing Largest Army for the +2 VP immediately. Playing Knights is the fastest way to gain this. Once established, invest remaining resources into further Development Cards for potential VP bonuses.
2. Build roads toward future expansion strategically. Block RED when possible, while giving yourself access to valuable resources or ports.
3. Focus on city upgrades to maximize resource generation. Look for surplus resources to trade for missing Brick (🧱) and Wood (🌲).
4. Disrupt RED by playing the robber on tiles that starve their Wheat (🌾) or Ore (⛏️), slowing their city/settlement builds and possibly Longest Road expansion.
LLM chose action 0: Play Knight card - Move the robber and steal a resource
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 4113 chars)
Updated plan: Prioritize acquiring resources from Node 3 (🌾,🐑,⛏️). Focus on upgrading settlements on high-probability nodes into cities for maximum resource throughput. Build roads toward key locations for future settlements or port access. Invest in development cards early and aim for Largest Army.

LLM chose action 1: Build a road at edge (3, 4) (Cost: 1 🌲WOOD, 1 🧱BRICK)
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2851 chars)
Updated plan: We now have balanced resource production to execute a hybrid strategy:
- Focus **early-game** on road building and settlement expansion to secure additional nodes. 
- Upgrade settlements toward **cities** as soon as possible with our strong 🌾Wheat and ⛏️Ore generation.
- Target development cards after roads/expansion for mid-to-late-game control (Largest Army or bonus VPs).
LLM chose action 5: Build a settlement at node 11 (Cost: 1 🌲WOOD, 1 🧱BRICK, 1 🌾WHEAT, 1 🐑SHEEP)
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2201 chars)
Updated plan: Our goal remains to focus on settlements and city upgrades, as well as development cards for late-game control. Current resources and positioning lead to the following updated plan:
1. **Obtain Wood 🌲 and Brick 🧱** to build roads toward new nodes.
   - Expand to Node 4 (🌲3, 🐑5, or ⛏️10) OR Node 20 (🌾9, 🏜️Port).
   - These nodes will give us critical missing resources or access to a port for future trading.
2. **Upgrade a settlement to a city** ASAP to maximize our Wheat 🌾 and Ore ⛏️ production.
3. **Start acquiring development cards** for the Largest Army (2 VP) or potential bonus Victory Points.
