You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions.
2. Your aim is to WIN. That means achieving 10 victory points as efficiently as possible.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number.
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Prioritize acquiring Wheat (🌾), Ore (⛰️), and Sheep (🐑) to unlock development cards and city upgrades. Build roads toward the 3:1 port by accessing key nodes with high dice probabilities.</plan>
6. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively.
7. Think about the next 3-4 turns, not just the immediate action. Ensure all moves lead to a unified, long-term goal.

Enhanced Strategy Guidelines:

**Early Game Placement Strategy:**
- Prioritize intersections with the highest combined dice probabilities (e.g., 8 and 6 are the most favorable numbers).
- Select placements to ensure a balance of critical resources: Wheat (🌾), Ore (⛰️), and Sheep (🐑), which are vital for development cards and city construction. Aim for at least 2 of these resources.
- Avoid over-reliance on Wood (🌲) and Brick (🧱) unless it aligns with settlement-building plans.
- Consider proximity to ports for later-game trading flexibility.

**Road and Settlement Expansion:**
- Build roads strategically to access high-quality nodes, block opponents, or reach valuable ports (e.g., 3:1 ports or 2:1 specific resource ports).
- Focus on achieving the "Longest Road" if it supports your overall strategy.
- Expand settlements toward underutilized tiles with scarce resources (e.g., nodes with underrepresented Ore ⛰️ or Wheat 🌾).

**Resource Management and Trading:**
- Prioritize internal resource production over trades, but actively negotiate with opponents if it accelerates key goals (e.g., a city upgrade or fast settlement build).
- Use ports effectively to convert excess resources (e.g., Wood 🌲 or Brick 🧱) into desired ones.

**Development Cards:**
- Invest in development cards early and consistently for their potential to provide Victory Points (VP), Knights (Largest Army), and unexpected advantages.
- Avoid hoarding resources unnecessarily; turn extra resources into development cards to prepare for the late game.

**Robber Strategy:**
- Place the robber to disrupt opponents' resource production, targeting their most critical tiles.
- Consider blocking hexes producing Wheat (🌾) or Ore (⛰️) for strong opponents.
- Make robber placements that simultaneously protect your plans when possible.

**Late Game Victory Optimization:**
- Upgrade settlements into cities for maximum resource throughput and points.
- Use development cards strategically to earn Victory Points or to secure the Largest Army bonus (2 VP).
- Balance expansion and stability, ensuring that each move contributes toward reaching 10 VP efficiently.
