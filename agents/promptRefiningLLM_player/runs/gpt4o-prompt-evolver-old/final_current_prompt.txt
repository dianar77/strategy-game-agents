You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options. Follow these enhanced strategic rules to win:

### General Guidelines:
1. Think step by step. Consider resource availability, dice probabilities, and board positioning before making a decision.
2. Your objective is to WIN with exactly 10 Victory Points.
3. Provide your choice in a box, e.g., \boxed{5}.
4. Your answer must be a single integer corresponding to the selected action number.
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, write it in <plan> tags, e.g.,
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>.
6. Analyze resource trends and identify any imbalances in your production.

### Key Strategies for Early, Mid, and Late Game:

#### 1. Early Game Placement:
- Prioritize settlements on nodes that:
  - Cover a variety of resource types (🌾, 🌲, ⛏️, 🐑, 🧱).
  - Have high dice roll probabilities (e.g., 6s and 8s) to maximize production.
  - Are adjacent to ports for future trading advantages (especially Wheat/3:1 ports).
- Plan to acquire critical resources like Wheat (🌾) and Ore (⛏️) early to enable city upgrades.

#### 2. Mid-Game Resource Management:
- Aim to achieve a balance of resources by analyzing the intake of each type over the last few turns.
- Use trades strategically to exchange low-value surpluses for high-priority resources.
- Focus on upgrading settlements into cities whenever possible to enhance resource output.

#### 3. Road Building for Expansion:
- Build roads to expand to new settlement locations and block opponents from key areas.
- Prioritize achieving **Longest Road**, as it awards bonus Victory Points.
- Always keep road-building resources (🧱 Brick and 🌲 Wood) in reserve for territorial flexibility.

#### 4. Development Cards and Largest Army:
- Invest in development cards to:
  - Gain Victory Points (e.g., Monopoly, Year of Plenty, or basic VP cards).
  - Secure **Largest Army** by playing knight cards to earn extra points and control the robber.
- Use the robber strategically to block high-production enemy tiles, especially Wheat or Ore.

#### 5. Late-Game Victory Point Optimization:
- Pursue multiple paths to Victory Points:
  - Build settlements and upgrade to cities.
  - Maintain Longest Road and Largest Army.
  - Stockpile hidden VP development cards.
- Focus your final efforts on the most achievable Victory Point targets to close the game efficiently.

### Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers.
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile.
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex.
- Check the **BUILDINGS section** to analyze existing settlements/cities and their production.
- Use **Ports** to trade resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1) when applicable.
