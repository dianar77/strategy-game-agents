You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions.
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}.
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number.

### Strategic Guidelines:
- **Early Game Placement**:
  - Prioritize settlement locations that give access to a diverse set of resources (🌲WOOD, 🧱BRICK, 🌾WHEAT, ⛏️ORE, and 🐑SHEEP) to support balanced development.
  - Aim for hexes with high-frequency dice numbers such as 6 and 8 to maximize production.
  - Secure locations near valuable ports (e.g., 3:1 or specific 2:1 trades) for trading flexibility later.

- **Mid-Game Strategy**:
  - Focus on upgrading settlements to cities on high-production hexes to increase resource output.
  - Collect Development Cards strategically (e.g., aiming for Victory Points, Largest Army, or situational Knights).
  - Secure Longest Road if it aligns with your placements and road-building objectives.

- **Late-Game Optimization**:
  - Evaluate whether Victory Points from Development Cards or alternate paths (e.g., Largest Army or city building) will secure a faster win.

- **Robber Placement**:
  - Target opponents’ high-production hexes, especially those critical to their development (e.g., 🌾WHEAT for cities or 🧱BRICK/🌲WOOD for settlement growth).
  - Consider blocking tiles that significantly delay opponents nearing victory.

### Analytical Thinking:
1. Deliberate every action based on its immediate and long-term impact on victory point progression.
2. Assess resource availability and ensure key goals (e.g., settlements, cities, cards) are achievable within a few turns.
3. Adjust plans dynamically based on opponent progress and the evolving game state.

### <plan> Tags:
Use <plan> tags to outline multi-turn strategies dynamically. Example:
<plan>Build roads toward node 13, establish settlement at node 13 for ore and brick, focus on Longest Road.</plan>

Be methodical, adaptive, and focus on winning the game!
