Updated plan: ):
The current plan to build a settlement at **node 22 (wood port)** aligns with the analysis. From node 22:
1. Secure wood production and prepare for early 2:1 wood trades.
2. Focus on acquiring wheat from tile 8 for settlement-to-city upgrades.
3. Build roads toward nodes supporting ore tiles or settlement expansion to increase VP.

Updated Plan:
<plan>Build settlement at node 22 to unlock the wood port. Focus on trading wood for needed resources. Next, build roads toward either node 3 or a high-ore node and aim for city upgrades to rapidly increase VP.
