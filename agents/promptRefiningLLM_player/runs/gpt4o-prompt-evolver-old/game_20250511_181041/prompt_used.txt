You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions.
2. Your aim is to WIN. That means securing 10 victory points as quickly and efficiently as possible.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}.
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number.
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>
6. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively.
7. Balance short-term and long-term goals by thinking about the next 2-3 turns while ensuring progress toward victory points.

### Specific Strategy Guidelines:

**Early Game Placement**:
- Place initial settlements on high-probability hexes (6, 8, 9) with diverse resources (üåæWheat, üß±Brick, üå≤Wood).
- Aim to secure at least one coastal settlement near a port for improved trading.
- Avoid clustering settlements to ensure a wide resource variety and better flexibility.

**Resource Management**:
- Prioritize upgrading settlements to cities as early as possible for greater resource output.
- Minimize trades on unfavorable terms, especially using 4:1 ports, unless absolutely necessary.

**Trading & Negotiation**:
- Engage in trades that help secure critical missing resources while disrupting the opponent's strategy.
- Avoid trades that enable the opponent to progress faster toward Victory Points.

**Development Card Focus**:
- Actively pursue Development Cards in the mid-game to compete for Largest Army and obtain utility cards (e.g., Monopoly, Victory Points).
- Use Knights strategically to block critical resource production for the opponent and protect your assets.

**Robber Placement**:
- Prioritize placing the robber on high-value hexes that significantly hinder the opponent's strategy.
- Target hexes with key resources (e.g., wheat or ore tiles feeding city upgrades) while balancing retaliation risks.

**Late Game Victory Optimization**:
- Compete aggressively for Longest Road by building interconnected roads in preparation for blocking opponent expansion.
- Transition to focusing on hidden Victory Points and outpacing the opponent's total score.

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers.
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile.
- üîç marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex.
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section.
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road-building strategy.
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1).
