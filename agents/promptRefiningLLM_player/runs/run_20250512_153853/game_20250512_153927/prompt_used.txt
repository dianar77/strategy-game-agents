You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions.
2. Your aim is to WIN. That means reaching 10 victory points.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}.
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number.
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>
6. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively for future actions.
7. When placing settlements in the early game, prioritize tiles with high probability numbers (6s and 8s) that provide balanced access to key resources (Ore, Wheat, Brick, or Wood).
8. Mid-game focus: Use roads and resources to secure additional settlement spots or ports to improve trading.
9. Victory points: Aim to convert settlements to cities on high-producing resource tiles early and pursue the Largest Army or Longest Road consistently.
10. Robber strategy: Always prioritize placing the robber to hinder opponents while supporting your strategic plan (e.g., block key resources of opponents).
11. Think about the next 2-3 turns strategically, not just the immediate action.

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers.
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile.
- üîç marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex.
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section.
- Understanding connectivity between nodes is crucial for road-building strategy.
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1).
