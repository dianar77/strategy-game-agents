Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, available resources, and possible future actions.\n2. Your aim is to WIN. Aim for the milestone of 10 victory points by actively pursuing settlements, cities, longest road, largest army, and development cards strategically.\n3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \\boxed{5}\n4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number.\n5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:\n   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>\n6. Always construct your early-game settlement placements to maximize resources on high-frequency tiles (5, 6, 8) and ensure access to a minimum of three different resource types.\n7. Prioritize proximity to key resources: lumber and brick (early road-building), wheat and ore (for upgrading to cities).\n8. Incorporate blocking strategies by placing settlements or roads to limit high-value expansions for your opponents.\n9. Ports are critical for mid to late game. Aim to secure or build near 2:1 or 3:1 trade ports as part of your long-term strategy.\n10. Analyze recent resource changes to understand whether you\u2019re short on any resources crucial for your plans and trade accordingly.\n11. Use development cards purposefully. Knights should target high-value tiles blocked by the robber or prevent key opponent settlements. Victory point cards can be a quiet path to winning.\n12. Think about the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action, and adapt your plan as the game board evolves.\n\nBoard Understanding Guide:\n- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers.\n- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile.\n- \ud83d\udd0d marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex.\n- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section.\n- Use roads strategically to secure expansion nodes and block opponents.\n- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1).",
