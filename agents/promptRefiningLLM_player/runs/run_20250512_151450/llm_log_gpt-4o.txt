You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN. That means 10 victory points.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>
6. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively
7. Think about the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action

Given that external web-search is currently not accessible, and some files can't be read, I will proceed with refining the prompt for improvement based on internal logic, the performance history, and strategies drawn from my knowledge.

### Observations:
1. **Performance History Insights**:
   - Zero wins in the recent game logs, indicating a severe underperformance.
   - Average victory points (VP) scored are only 2.6, well below the target of 10.
2. **Potential Issues from Current Prompt**:
   - The prompt lacks a clear articulation of **early-game placement** strategies, which are foundational in building momentum.
   - There‚Äôs no specific guidance on **prioritization of resource diversity** during settlement placements.
   - Effective **trading, city-building, development card usage, and robber strategies** are only broadly outlined.

### Hypotheses for Improvement:
To address possible weaknesses:
1. Early-game settlement placement must prioritize high-frequency tiles (5, 6, 8) and complementary resources (at least 3 types).
2. Strategic plan creation needs explicit direction to optimize early production of **lumber, brick, wheat**, and **ore**‚Äîkey resources for settlements, roads, and cities.
3. Specific advice on **blocking opponents‚Äô expansion paths** and defensive strategies against trade monopoly by opponents must be integrated.
4. The benefits of trading and ports should be more entirely developed for resource conversion efficiency.

I will now refine the prompt accordingly to add targeted improvements.

    new_text: You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, available resources, and possible future actions.
2. Your aim is to WIN. Aim for the milestone of 10 victory points by actively pursuing settlements, cities, longest road, largest army, and development cards strategically.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number.
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>
6. Always construct your early-game settlement placements to maximize resources on high-frequency tiles (5, 6, 8) and ensure access to a minimum of three different resource types.
7. Prioritize proximity to key resources: lumber and brick (early road-building), wheat and ore (for upgrading to cities).
8. Incorporate blocking strategies by placing settlements or roads to limit high-value expansions for your opponents.
9. Ports are critical for mid to late game. Aim to secure or build near 2:1 or 3:1 trade ports as part of your long-term strategy.
10. Analyze recent resource changes to understand whether you‚Äôre short on any resources crucial for your plans and trade accordingly.
11. Use development cards purposefully. Knights should target high-value tiles blocked by the robber or prevent key opponent settlements. Victory point cards can be a quiet path to winning.
12. Think about the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action, and adapt your plan as the game board evolves.

The prompt has been refined to address early-game settlement placement strategies, resource diversity prioritization, mid-game trading optimization, and strategic use of development cards and the robber. These changes aim to improve the player's chance of winning against the opponent. Let's now test the new prompt in gameplay to assess its effectiveness.Evolve Counter: 0
