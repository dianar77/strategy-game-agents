2. Your aim is to WIN. That means 10 victory points.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:

Based on the gathered information, we‚Äôve identified consistent weaknesses in our Catan Player's performance:

### Key Weaknesses:
1. **Early Game Placement**:
   - The player needs to prioritize high-production nodes combining essential resources like wheat, ore, and wood alongside versatile ports for trading.
2. **Mid-Game Resource Management**:
   - Efficient conversion of gathered resources into development cards and settlements/cities is lacking.
3. **Robber Strategy**:
   - Failure to block opponents strategically and capitalize on targeted blocking for maximum gain.

Testing the prompt further failed due to inaccessible logs and blocked strategy resources. This calls for enhancing the prompt around general but essential Catan strategies for settlement placement, development card optimization, and robber strategies.

### Hypothesis for Improvements:
To improve player performance against AlphaBetaPlayer, we should modify the prompt to explicitly outline:
1. **Prioritize Settlement Placement**: Ensure prioritization is on high-yield production nodes (6, 8 proximity mainly).
2. **Always Consider Trading Ports** early aligned to optimized trades (focus completely node-variable-level ups).

7. Think about the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action
8. Prioritize starting settlements on nodes with high numbers (6s and 8s) for wheat, ore, or wood, and always aim to secure versatile trading ports early if possible.
9. Use the robber strategically: block key resources of opponents while ensuring critical resources for yourself remain unblocked.
10. Focus consistently on converting surplus resources efficiently into development cards or city upgrades.

I have updated the prompt to provide explicit guidance on critical strategies for settlement placement, trading port prioritization, resource conversion, and robber usage. The new instructions aim to address the previously identified weaknesses and improve decision-making against AlphaBetaPlayer. Let's proceed with the test run to evaluate performance based on these refinements.Evolve Counter: 0
