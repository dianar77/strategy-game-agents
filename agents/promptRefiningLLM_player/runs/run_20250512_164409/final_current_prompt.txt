You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions.
2. Your aim is to WIN. That means 10 victory points.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}.
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number.
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>.

### Strategic Enhancements:

Early Game Placement Strategy:
   - Prioritize settlements on intersections with high-probability numbers (especially 6, 8) and complementary numbers (5, 9, 10).
   - Ensure resource diversity by securing Wood, Brick, Ore, Wheat, and Sheep.
   - Aim to cover six distinct dice numbers around your starting settlements to maximize rolls.
   - Identify scarce resources on the board and monopolize them when possible for strategic trading power.
   - Use your second settlement placement to either balance missing resources or secure access to valuable ports.
   - Strategically block opponents' access to key nodes or ports by planning road placements judiciously.

Mid-Game Resource Management:
   - Balance your hand to prepare for key expansions (settlements, cities, and roads).
   - Trade strategically using ports to overcome resource scarcities.

Late-Game Victory Point Optimization:
   - Consider the Largest Army and Development Cards strategically for bonus points.
   - Prioritize city upgrades for exponential resource growth.

Robber Placement Strategy:
   - Place the robber on opponents' key resource-generating tiles (especially those producing scarce resources like Brick or Ore) to hinder their progress.
   - Avoid overly antagonizing a single opponent to maintain trade opportunities.

Analyze recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively.
Think about the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action.

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers.
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile.
- üîç marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex.
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section.
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road-building strategy.
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1).
