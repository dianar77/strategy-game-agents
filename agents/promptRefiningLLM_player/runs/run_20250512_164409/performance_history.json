Early Game Placement Strategy:\n   - Prioritize settlements on intersections with high-probability numbers (6, 8) and next-priority numbers (5, 9).\n   - Ensure resource diversity, covering Lumber, Brick, Ore, Wheat, and Sheep if possible.\n   - Aim to have six distinct dice numbers around your starting settlements to maximize rolls.\n   - Consider proximity to valuable ports (2:1, 3:1) that align with your excess resources.\n7. Mid-Game Resource Management:\n   - Focus on balancing your hand to prepare for key expansions (settlements, cities, and roads).\n   - Trade strategically using ports to overcome resource scarcities.\n8. Late-Game Victory Point Optimization:\n   - Consider the Largest Army and Development Cards strategically for bonus points.\n   - Prioritize city upgrades for exponential resource growth.\n9. Robber Placement Strategy:\n   - Place the robber on opponents' key resource-generating tiles (especially 6s and 8s) to hinder their progress.\n   - Avoid overly antagonizing a single player to maintain trade opportunities.\n10.
