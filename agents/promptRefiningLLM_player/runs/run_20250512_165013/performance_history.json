Use your initial settlement placements to prioritize intersections with high-probability numbers (6, 8, and 9) and resource variety (brick, wood, wheat, sheep, and ore). Avoid overproducing resources that may lead to waste from rolling a 7.\n9. Position your roads strategically to maximize your chances of cutting off opponents or securing key expansion areas. Avoid placing roads in predictable directions toward the board center.\n10. After your initial settlements, aim to quickly build cities on resource-rich or high-probability intersection nodes. Focus especially on intersections with wheat and ore for strong early-city development.\n11. Leverage ports early if they are accessible. Use them to mitigate excess of one resource type and to trade efficiently with limited resource diversity. Incorporate this into your short-term plan.\n12. Avoid placing settlements at coasts unless a strategic port makes up for reduced resource access. Balance this decision with the long-term expansion potential.\n\nBoard Understanding Guide:\n- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers.\n- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile.\n- \ud83d\udd0d marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex.\n- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section.\n- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy.\n- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1).",
