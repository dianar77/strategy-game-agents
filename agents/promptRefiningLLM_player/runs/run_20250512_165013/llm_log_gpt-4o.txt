As a rule of thumb, during your first settlement placement, it‚Äôs usually best not to point your road toward the middle of the board. You will likely have no expansion spots since everyone will start toward the middle, rather than the coast.
Anytime your road is in a contestable direction, make sure you‚Äôre the one cutting someone off or are more likely to win the race ‚Äî not the other way around. [...] Think of a Catan map as having 3 areas ‚Äî the center, inner, and coastal rings. The ‚Äúcenter‚Äù is all the spots around the middle hex, ‚Äúinner‚Äù is the next one outward, and so on.
For starters, the coast never makes sense for your first placement as it will only have 2 hexes of production (3 for you to build more central) and it will inhibit your optionality to expand.

Placing your initial settlements in Settlers of Catan is crucial for setting up a strong position in the game. Here are some strategies to consider when placing your settlements:
1. Resource Variety

Aim to have access to a variety of resources (brick, wood, wheat, sheep, and ore). A balanced resource base helps you build roads, settlements, and cities effectively.

2. High-Probability Numbers [...] Work with what the dice give you. Sometimes, that will be nothing.
Your strategy in Catan will be based heavily off of your initial placement of your Settlements. The serpentine placement pattern (P1, P2, P3, P4, P4, P3, P2, P1) is very good at balancing out who gets access to the best spots, but think carefully about where you‚Äôre going to start and what you‚Äôre going to work towards. [...] Cities first strategy
Since cities double your earning power, an effective strategy can be to optimize for as much wheat and rock as you can get early in the game, upgrade to two cities as quickly as possible, and then trade out some of your abundant wheat and rock for wood and brick later to build roads and expand. If you can get access to sheep with this strategy, you can also quickly and easily pursue a strategy of buying a lot of development cards before building more settlements.

Colonist Strategies: What are the Best Catan Starting Strategies?

Today we will be giving you pointers on the best starting placement strategies for Settlers of Catan that you can use in Colonist.

Colonist.io

1. Identify Your Goals

The first and most important Catan Strategy is knowing what you want to build. This will dictate which resources you should go after when you place your starting settlements. [...] Overall, placing your starting settlements wisely will give you a huge advantage in Settlers of Catan. But this is just one of the many strategies that can be employed in the game.

It is very hard to employ all these tactics in every game though, as the board is arranged randomly by the system and your neighbors choices restrict yours.

However, having a good grasp of starting positions and initial placements will help greatly in winning you your next Colonist game. [...] Also you don‚Äôt want to overproduce resources which can‚Äôt be used and then lose them to a 7 roll.

A much more ideal setup would be an 8-5-10 placement, with a secondary placement of 6-9-4.

These are all good numbers, and you‚Äôve got a variety, meaning that you‚Äôre more likely to collect on any given roll.

It‚Äôs not always possible to get good number variety, and you will more often than not have a duplicate number, but it‚Äôs important to be as diverse as possible.

Strategic Improvements
8. Use your initial settlement placements to prioritize intersections with high-probability numbers (6, 8, and 9) and resource variety (brick, wood, wheat, sheep, and ore). Avoid overproducing resources that may lead to waste from rolling a 7.
9. Position your roads strategically to maximize your chances of cutting off opponents or securing key expansion areas. Avoid placing roads in predictable directions toward the board center.
10. After your initial settlements, aim to quickly build cities on resource-rich or high-probability intersection nodes. Focus especially on intersections with wheat and ore for strong early-city development.
11. Leverage ports early if they are accessible. Use them to mitigate excess of one resource type and to trade efficiently with limited resource diversity. Incorporate this into your short-term plan.
12. Avoid placing settlements at coasts unless a strategic port makes up for reduced resource access. Balance this decision with the long-term expansion potential.

SUMMARY:

1. **Agent Observations from Game Results:**
   - The AlphaBetaPlayer:RED demonstrated superior performance with 5 wins, averaging 5 victory points (VP) per game, primarily focusing on settlements (1.8 avg), cities (0.8 avg), and roads (0.8 avg), but showing no progress in building armies or using development card victory points.
   - The RandomPlayer:BLUE failed to win any games, with an average score of 2.2 VP per game, and demonstrated marginal activity in settlements (2.0 avg), roads (0.0 avg), and slight tactics relying on development cards (0.2 avg DEV VP).
   - Game Summary metrics showed the games lasted approximately 41.4 turns with an average duration of 0.55 seconds.

2. **Strategies Implemented in the Prompt:**
   - Improved settlement placement guidelines, emphasizing intersections with high-probability numbers (e.g., 6, 8, 9) and resource variety (brick, wood, wheat, sheep, and ore) while avoiding overproduction or waste from rolling a 7.
   - Emphasis on strategic road positioning to block opponents or secure high-value expansion spots, avoiding predictable directions toward the board center.
   - Early-game focus on city upgrades using resource-rich intersections (especially wheat and ore nodes).
   - Integration of port utilization into strategy as a method to balance excess resources and enable efficient trading.
   - Long-term approach to avoid coastal settlement placements unless supported by strategic port advantages.

3. **Performance Metrics Observed:**
   - The updated prompt will aim to address the data insights, improving decision-making during settlement placement, road-building, and optimizing city upgrades based on resource production quality.
   - These adjustments are designed to bolster early-game dominance and resource utilization to increase victory points achieved per game, leveraging higher-impact strategies observed in winning players like AlphaBetaPlayer:RED.

Placing your initial settlements in Settlers of Catan is crucial for setting up a strong position in the game. Here are some strategies to consider when placing your settlements:
1. Resource Variety

Aim to have access to a variety of resources (brick, wood, wheat, sheep, and ore). A balanced resource base helps you build roads, settlements, and cities effectively.

2. High-Probability Numbers [...] Cities first strategy
Since cities double your earning power, an effective strategy can be to optimize for as much wheat and rock as you can get early in the game, upgrade to two cities as quickly as possible, and then trade out some of your abundant wheat and rock for wood and brick later to build roads and expand. If you can get access to sheep with this strategy, you can also quickly and easily pursue a strategy of buying a lot of development cards before building more settlements. [...] Prioritize wheat and brick in your initial placements. Wheat is essential for building settlements and cities, while brick is crucial for roads and settlements.

4. Strategic Positioning

Consider placing your settlements near the coast if you can trade for resources you lack. Ports can provide valuable trade opportunities.

5. Blocking Opponents

The knights that are bought help keep the robber off of an OWS player‚Äôs territory (and help the player get the largest army bonus in the process).
What is Road-Strategy in Settlers of Catan?
Road Builder / Road Strategy, sometimes simply called ‚Äúroad,‚Äù is a popular alternative to OWS, which focuses on strong wood-brick production to get the longest road point bonus.
The main resources involved are wood, brick, wheat, and sheep, with especially heavy wood and brick. [...] The Ore-Wheat-Sheep Strategy usually is being used by first/second position, while the Road Builder Strategy can go to third or fourth [...] Third position has a couple interesting strategy choices.
An obvious answer is going for high wood-brick and a Longest Road-strategy. But if there‚Äôs no good spots for that, you need to have alternatives.
Another strong strategy is a port-strategy, getting a lot of a certain resource and the matching 2:1-port.
Also, you can always monopolise one rare resource that others won‚Äôt be able to have, so they will be forced to give you 2:1 deals just so they can have one specific resource.

<Document href="https://blog.colonist.io/guide-to-catan-starting-strategies/"/>
In addition, this would also give you a pretty good idea on how you would want your game to progress.

There are three main strategies you can focus on:

Settlements and Longest Road - Your essential resources would be high amount of Lumber, Brick and some amount of Wool, and Wheat.

Hybrid Expansion ¬†- Occupying as much as you can of the map thereby acquiring more resources. For this strategy you will need to produce a balanced amount of all resources. [...] This is where the road placement comes in very handy. Placing your first roads is actually very important, as doing it wrong can set you back a few turns.

Just make sure that your road points to a spot on the map that you can move out to, even if the resource production isn‚Äôt high.

A common error to make is pointing the road to a goldmine of resources and numbers, only to have your neighbor place there next turn, making your road a dead end for you.

## Here a log of results as they are found:

- We were able to create a Python package that implements the Game's core logic.
  No fancy networkX or numpy models, just good old Python objects and readable
  algorithms. Fully tested!

- We build a UI to go along with it. Not only useful for debugging, but if robot
  comes to life, we may want to allow users to play against it!

- WeightedRandomPlayer consistently wins to RandomPlayer.

- ValueFunction exposed that copying game with `deepcopy` is slow. Potential
  road block for Tree-Search algorithms (e.g. mini-max). Played OK. Too slow
  to benchmark really. Computed features.

- Started playing with DRL approaches. Threw away useful features (like production)
  and used RAW representation (someone said automatic feature engineering).

- Started with Policy learning using "Cross Entropy Method" here: ...
  Noticed we face class-imbalance. Infra was still inmature.
  Wasn't getting a meaningful LOSS, so scrapped it.

- Started with Deep Q-Learning. Seemed we were able to achieve a reasonable LOSS
  (MAE=0.05) on a "Discounted Return" with `DISCOUNT_FACTOR=0.999`. Played
  terrible tho. Not better than random (maybe actually worst).

- Tried Deep Q-Learning only on top-examples. Nothing interesting.

- Tried Deep Learning ValueFunction, and doing greedy algorithm on it. Won 63%
  of the games against RandomPlayers. Single-epoch, 32-batch, 75,000 samples.
  RAW Features. Games take around 30s tho.

- Using hand-crafted production and expansion features, we achieved 0.15 MAE.

- Using AutoKeras on hand-crafted production and expansion features yielded
  something like 0.01 MSE. But in performance, still played just like Random
  tho. Did not perform better.

- Got very good performance using VICTORY_POINTS_RETURN with 30GB data set,
  batch size = 256, batchnormalization => dense(64) => dense(1) value func.
  MSE loss, adam with lr=0.001,clipnorm=1. 1 epoch. Achieved ~2.0 MAE.

- First BoardTensor model seems to overfit (places on same nodes). ~200,000 params
  with less than 1,000,000 samples. Still, after normalizing wins 44/100 games
  against random players. NEXT: Try simpler model and more data.

- Second BoardTensor model (adam(0.001,clipnorm=1),
  input1 = 21x11x16 => batchnorm => 1 filter-cnn kernel=3 linear => flatten
  input2 = num-features
  model = input1 + input2 => 64 relu => 32 relu => 1 linear.
  MSE loss on VP RETURN. Batch=256, epoch=1, 2M samples.
  Performed comparable to simple 2-layer on 1M samples.

- We prototyped the Playouts Theorem. It indeed gives a good value function to
  play out random games from a given state. Pretty stable at at least 50 games.
  25 games there was some flakyness... (could stable out given we do this)
  many times. Takes around 0.3 secs to play a random game to completion.

- MCTS (doing 25 playouts for each possible action) wins almost every
  game against randoms, but it takes a while. And it seems some high-branching
  factor situations make it take longer (e.g. monopoly play, late road building).
  Here some results:

- It seems learning the simple problem of whether a player produces OWS
  works well with 1 filter of size 3, linear, unit_norm, and l2-reg. =>
  flat => 1 dense sigmoid. Adding a 0.2 dropout before 1 dense sigmoid
  seemed to help a lot to not overfit. Next steps would like to separate
  edges and nodes from channels (it seems it confuses these two), and add
  max-pooling in an attempt to learn hierarchy (OWS-node, variaty-node, etc...).
  Does EPOCHS help? EPOCHS=2 overfits. Well we get TRAIN_ACC=90%+,TEST_ACC=60%.
- No class weight, simple 1 3x3 filter CNN seems to learn, just needs more data.
- No class weight, using autokerastuner arrives at 96 neurons 1-layer 0.0001 LR.
  Achieves 57% accuracy (using log-loss as objective).

- Practicing on simple problem of given a 2x2 array, trying to learn to count
  the number of 1s. it performs well. With num-samples=100,000, epoch=1,
  2-32-relu layers gets mae: 0.6571, val_mae: 0.0301. Default Adam, with loss=mse.
  With 1 more order of magnitude of data, we can get 1 order of magnitude less error. (val_mae: 0.0034)
  Next steps:

  - Use auto keras to see how much better can we get.
    This achieved val_mae: 0.0496. Not much significant improvement.
  - Use CNN to see how it affects counting.
    This improves model to 0.009 mae (with 100,000 samples). note params increased
    from 4k to 65k (from normal NN to 32-filter CNN). 1-filter got val_mae: 1.3479.
    PROBLEM SOLVED!
  - Next steps: complicated by adding planes of random data. Does it confuse NN?
    Adding 3 extra random data layers, did not confuse NN. Still achieves mae~0.004.
  - Next step: Can we learn AND'ed points across channels?
    Seems that CNN behaves better here (1 3x3 filter) as expected since problem
    is translation invariant. AutoKeras yields a very deep model. DNN get to ~80%
    val_accuracy. CNN gets to 90%+. They seem sensitive to initial values tho.
  - Next step: Does adding random layers disturb the AND learning?
    Yes. It seems CNN have trouble with noisy channels.
  - Next step: What if we add some 2s as well... (here we prove we could learn count-vp-problem)
    Yes. Can learn (without noise channels), to val_mae: 0.1147.

- We fixed a bug in the tensor board representation. Using only the first 13 planes
  allows a CNN to learn if a player has OWS successfully (88% val_accuracy). Results:

  - We achieve mae: 5.4591e-11, val_mae: 2.4891e-04 with a deep model on RepA,
    and DISCOUNTED_RETURN. But model doesnt perform well in games. 50 game
    epochs, aiming to use 1K games, but early stopping.
    loss: 1.2714e-20 - mae: 5.4591e-11 - val_loss: 3.2321e-07 - val_mae: 2.4807e-04
  - Similar results with Rep B. But it played terribly...

- Online MCTS is looking promising. Did a first run with a 1-neuron model (normalizing
  features), playouts=25, training everytime there are >1K samples in batches of 64.
  There was a bug in the data as well (was creating samples like root-node => mcts result
  for all branches, instead of branch-node => mcts result). It didn't win games,
  but there seemed to be VP improvement from 2 VP avg to 5 VP avg, in 100 games.

- A heuristic player plays better than WeightedRandom (but we have a memory leak).
  Memory leak was due to @functools.lru with copied boards.

- Simple MiniMax Algorithm takes too long... ~20segs per decision,
  which makes for 30 min games. Even if de-bugged the implementation seems pretty slow.
  As such, alpha-pruning doesnt seem wont help much (even if cuts time by half).

- Using PyPy (removing TF and other Python 3.9 features), speeds up playing random
  games by around 33%s. (1000s games w/CPython3.9 took 2m52s and 1000s games
  w/PyPy3.7 took 1m52s).

- Looked at RL Python Frameworks. keras-rl doesn't work with TF2.0, same with
  stable-baselines. Many undocumented or hard to use. Best one seems to be
  tensorforce. TF-Agents seems possible, but pretty raw API right now.
  Hard to use tensorforce because not clear how to specify Rep B mixed model.

- VictoryPoint player is better than Random (much better) and WeightedRandom (not so much).

- Where able to do a somewhat strong NN with clipnorm=1, 2 layers, 32 and 8 neurons
  batch norm of inputs and batches of 32. 7,000,000 samples divided in 10 epochs.
  Still this player doesnt beat hand-heuristic. (ValueFunctionPlayer). This used
  DISCOUNTED_RETURN. MSE as loss and LR=0.0001.
  `loss: 1.5084e-07 - mae: 2.1945e-04 - val_loss: 4.2677e-05 - val_mae: 5.0571e-04`

- Did a RandomForest, but data seems wrong. Played very poorly. Tried again with
  all Rep 1 features; no dice. Hard to analyze... Probably overfitted. Keeps ending turn.

- Scikit Regression player doesnt win, because just gets a lot of wheat production,
  builds roads to extend as much as they can (dont hold to build settlements),
  place robber on themselves, dont trade (same value); no hand-diversity features.

- Greedy (even when budgeted to run same num playouts as MCTS) does better than
  MCTS.

- ValueFunction 2.0 (using EFFECTIVE_PRODUCTION and REACHABILITY features) plays
  pretty strongly. Better than Greedy=25 and MCTS=100.

- AlphaBeta(depth=2) plays stronger than ValueFunction 2.0. Using VF2.0 as heuristic.

- Tried Bayesian Optimization to search better weights for hand-crafted heuristic,
  but seems too slow and inefective.

- Note: In a random game, 38.6% of actions are roll (action=0), 27% are end turn (action=5557).

## Future Work:

- Should probably try to do NN player with better tuning (more layers, different label).

- Interested in seeing MCTS play in real life. Should compare G10 to MCTS50

- Work on performance.

- Generate data as 1 Big CSV per representation. (samples + labels), (bt + labels)

- Idea: Make test-evaluation framework. Use gaussian optimization to find best weights.

- Attempt DQN Tutorial with TF2.0 Summary Module, to see progress. If works,
  adapt to Catan-DQN Tutorial.

- Paperspace: Dockerfile: Install catanatron, and Pipenv dependencies, so that we can
  experiment/play.py, have a Game in the Overview.ipyn and run a catan-dqn.py job faster
  (should only do when can confirm Data and DQN approach improves...).

- Simplify ROBBER_ACTIONS to "Play Knight" to player with most points.

- Learn from offline MCTS data, using Rep B. (Seems slow to generate MCTS labeled data).

- Use tensorforce (since TF2.0 compatible and DQN Agent will be bug-free).
  Seems hard because API is not too easy.

- Learn an offline DQN (using VPs) with Rep B. That is, use Reward as label (
  so that early moves don't get a 1)

- Consider implementing AlphaBetaPruning to speed up game. Although
  it seems speedup at best might be 1/2 the time, which still doesn't cut it.
  Unless we speed up game copying...

- Actually use MCTS result to improve network. Do online so that we can
  see progress.

  - Add epsilon-playing to ensure we are exploring space. (Well, I think the fact
    that we have random players fixed does this job for now, since we collect
    samples from their perspective as well).

- Play a game against Greedy player. Play against Greedy with look-ahead.

- Idea: Sum up "enemy features". Make it look like its 1 enemy.

- Try Online - DQN approach (using PythonProgramming Tutorial).
- Use Value-Estimator with a tree-lookahead alpha-beta pruning.
- Try CNN-action space. (i.e. BUILD_SETTLEMENT at 3 means plane-board-tensor)
- Try policy-learning and q-learning on simpler action space.
- Try Cross-Entropy approach (using only top X features and dropping END TURNs).
- Try AlphaZero single-neural network learning (state) => (value, action).

  - Use in tree-search (take N top actions to explore via RollOuts).

- Try putting in features back. Is this VPlayer better than Raw Features one?
- Can autokeras use tf.Dataset?
- Using autokeras with whole 1Gb dataset is better?
- Does playing against your V1 self, training on that, improve?
- Try Q-Learning but, iterate on playing, learning, playing, learning... e-greedy.

### Performance Improvements

- Separate immutable state from Board (Map?), so that copying is a lot faster, and
  can cache functions (say node-production) globally (across game copies).

### Toy problems

- Idea: hot-encode 5 layers per player (one per resource) to denote income and buildings.
  then use 3D convolution of size WxHx5 and stride=5 (to not overlap)
- An easier problem would be to count house/city VPs (only uses 1 plane). count-vp-problem.
- Next medium problem will be, guess wheat production (to see if combining the two planes).

## Catan State Space Analysis

- Each tile can be any resource = 19. So 19! resource-tile decisions.
- Each tile must be one of the numbers. So 18! (desert has no number)
- There are 9 ports so: 9! ways of ordering them.
  Finally, there are 19! \* 18! \* 9! boards in Catan. So like 10^38 boards.

Configurations states inside it are upper bounded by:

- Each player has at most 5 houses. 54 choose 5 are ways of putting all 5 houses.
  54 choose 4 are ways of putting 4 houses. Sum\_{i in [0, 5]} (54 choose i) = 3.5M.
  Actually, better ignore colors and consider all 20 houses. So:
  `sum([comb(54, i) for i in range(21)]) = 683689022885551`.
  Actually, including cities, then there are 9 pieces per player that can be in board.
  `sum([comb(54, i) for i in range(4*9 + 1)]) = 17932673125137243`
- There are 14 roads per player so 56 roads in total. 72 possible locations so:
  `sum([comb(72, i) for i in range(56)]) = 4722360822358286581300`

If we include number of cards that makes the state space much much bigger,
but in practice its a lot less (its rare for a player to have 20+ cards). So
just using the Board States we see there are:
10^38 boards. Each with 17932673125137243 \* 4722360822358286581300 configurations,
which is almost like 10^37, so we are talking around 10^68 just possible board-states.

In terms of cards-in-hand state. Assuming on average players have 5 cards in hand,
then out of the 19*5 resource cards we start with, we are talking about:
`comb(19*4, 20) = 1090013712241956540` (or 10^18).

Grand-ballpark estimate is ~**10^100** states in Catan. Chess is 10^123.
Go is 10^360. Number of atoms in the Universe is 10^78.

### Branching Factor

The following stats suggests the decision tree players navigate usually has
around ~5 branches, and very few times something huge like 279 branches
(trading options after a monopoly(?), late road-building card(?)).

```
Branching Factor Stats:
count    94010.000000
mean         4.643772
std          7.684072
min          1.000000
25%          1.000000
50%          1.000000
75%          5.000000
max        279.000000

1000 Random Games result in:

```
AVG Ticks: 959.049
AVG Turns: 275.261
AVG Duration: 0.18782643032073976
AVG VPS: RandomPlayer:Foo[RED] 5.851
AVG VPS: RandomPlayer:Bar[BLUE] 5.871
AVG VPS: RandomPlayer:Baz[ORANGE] 5.766
AVG VPS: RandomPlayer:Qux[WHITE] 6.086
```

So each player makes around 70 decisions per game. Averages around 5.9 VPs per game.

### Performance Bits

- Creating an array with `np.array` is much faster than `tf.convert_to_tensor` and
  `pd.DataFrame` or `pd.Series`.

```
In [1]: timeit.timeit("np.array(array)", setup="import numpy as np; array = list([i for i in range(1000)])", number=1000)
Out[1]: 0.055867002985905856
In [2]: timeit.timeit("tf.convert_to_tensor(array)", setup="import tensorflow as tf; array = list([i for i in range(1000)])", number=1000)
Out[2]: 0.20465714897727594
In [3]: timeit.timeit("pd.DataFrame(array)", setup="import pandas as pd; array = list([i for i in range(1000)])", number=1000)
Out[3]: 0.333771405974403
```

- Game.copy() took 45% of the time when using ValueFunctionPlayer (5.7s).
- 3/21/21 playable_actions is 50% of time when running random 1v1s.
  Accounts for 7s in a 14s 100-game run.

Time Estimates:

- AB2 takes 0.01 seconds per tick.

  Args:
    new_text: You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions.
2. Your aim is to WIN. That means 10 victory points.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}.
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number.
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>.
6. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively.
7. Think about the next 3 turns, not just the immediate action.

Strategic Improvements
8. Use your initial settlement placements to prioritize intersections with high-probability numbers (6, 8, 9) and resource variety (brick, wood, wheat, sheep, and ore). Avoid overproducing resources that may lead to waste from rolling a 7.
9. Position your roads strategically to maximize your chances of cutting off opponents or securing key expansion areas. Avoid placing roads in predictable directions toward the board center.
10. After your initial settlements, aim to quickly build cities on resource-rich or high-probability intersection nodes. Focus especially on intersections with wheat and ore for strong early-city development.
11. Leverage ports early if they are accessible. Use them to mitigate excess resource types and enable strategic trades. Incorporate this into your short-term plan.
12. Avoid placing settlements at coasts unless a strategic port makes up for reduced resource access. Balance this decision with the long-term expansion potential.
13. When blocking opponents, aim to use roads and settlements to hinder their ability to reach critical resource intersections or high-value expansion spots.
14. Optimize use of development cards by focusing on knights early to maximize robber utility and free up blocked resources. Once Largest Army is secured, analyze buying Victory Point cards or monopolizing rare-development-card strategies.
15. Prioritize achieving milestones like Largest Road or Largest Army for bonus Victory Points.

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers.
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile.
- \ud83d\udd0d marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex.
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section.
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy.
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1).================================= Tool Message =================================
