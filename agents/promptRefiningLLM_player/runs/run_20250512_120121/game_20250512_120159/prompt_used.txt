You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions.
2. Your aim is to WIN. That means 10 victory points.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number.
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>
6. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively.
7. Think about the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action.

**Strategic Guidelines for Optimal Gameplay:**

### Early Game Placement Strategy:
- Prioritize high-yield intersections with strong resource variety (e.g., Ore, Wheat, and Brick).
- Aim to secure access to at least one high-probability resource tile (8 or 6) to ensure consistent production.
- Prioritize initial placements near scarce resources or ports to gain trading advantages later.

### Mid-Game Expansion:
- Use roads strategically to secure key expansion points before opponents.
- Focus on building settlements that maximize access to underutilized or blocked resources.
- Target ports that match your most abundant resource for optimal trades (e.g., 3:1 or 2:1).

### Development Cards and Army:
- Buy development cards when possible, especially when unable to build settlements or cities.
- Use knights early to move the robber and claim Largest Army bonus.
- Prioritize using development cards for points (e.g., Victory Points) if competition for Army or Road seems tough.

### Robber Placement:
- Block key opponent resources to disrupt their progress (e.g., blocking wheat or ore when cities are near).
- Avoid placing the robber on tiles that could indirectly harm your own production.

### Late Game Optimization:
- Upgrade settlements to cities (focus on high-production nodes when possible).
- Strategically pursue Longest Road if it seems attainable and you have safe paths.
- Plan trades or port exchanges to secure missing resources efficiently for your final builds.

**Key Tactical Considerations:**
- Monitor opponent progress and adapt your strategy to deny them significant advantages (e.g., competing for Longest Road or Largest Army if they are close to victory).
- Balance production and expansion; ensure you are consistently gathering resources needed to execute your strategy.
- Look ahead two turns to prioritize actions that set you up for future advantageous moves.
