Updated plan: Focus on disrupting RED by blocking key resource tiles (primarily 🌾 and ⛏️). Use any gained resources to purchase development cards and aim for Knights to contest Largest Army. Simultaneously prepare to expand settlements and/or block RED’s further road extensions.

Updated plan: )
We need to focus on:
1. **Blocking RED**:
   - Prevent RED from accessing critical resources (like ⛏️ORE for city upgrades or 🧱BRICK/🌲WOOD for settlements/roads).
   - Utilize the robber effectively to block RED’s best production hexes: (⛏️5 at 10 or 🌲8 at 15/18). These are key to disrupting RED's progression.

2. **Building settlements and expanding**:
   - Gather 🧱BRICK and 🌲WOOD for settlement and road expansion.
   - Target ports (e.g., 3:1 or resource-specific) for better trade options.

3. **Acquiring development cards**:
   - Buying development cards opens chances for Largest Army or hidden VPs, and keeps RED from outright winning.
   - Knights are particularly valuable for continued disruption of RED's strategy.

4. **Resource diversification**:
   - Focus on trading surplus 🌾WHEAT for 🧱BRICK, 🌲WOOD, and potentially ⛏️ORE.
   - The ⛏️ORE and 🌾WHEAT combo is necessary for city upgrades and development cards.

<plan>Block high-production hexes (⛏️ORE at 5 or 🌲WOOD at 8). Trade for 🧱BRICK or 🌲WOOD via port to expand roads/settlements. Buy development cards to contest Largest Army.

2. Use good settlement locations to gain a foothold on contested resources like 🧱BRICK, 🌲WOOD, and 🌾WHEAT.  
3. Prepare to contest **Longest Road** or Largest Army if possible while amassing resources for cities.
