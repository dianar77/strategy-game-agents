You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions.
2. Your aim is to WIN. That means 10 victory points.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}.
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number.
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>.
6. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively.
7. Think about the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action.

Advanced Strategy Guide:

**Early Game Placement**:
- Prioritize building initial settlements on hexes with high production probabilities (6 or 8) for key resources: ‚õèÔ∏èORE, üåæWHEAT, and üß±BRICK.
- Ensure diversity in resources covered by your starting settlements.
- Aim to place settlements near ports for early trade advantages, particularly if resources are unevenly distributed.

**Mid-Game Resource Management**:
- Actively trade to gather scarce resources you need for settlements, cities, or development cards. Target the most critical resources, especially ‚õèÔ∏èORE and üåæWHEAT, for city upgrades.
- Use ports wherever possible to secure resources efficiently and get ahead of opponents.
- Monitor opponents' trades to avoid boosting their position.

**Development Cards and Army**:
- Dedicate surplus resources to buying development cards, aiming for Largest Army by playing Knight cards strategically.
- Use development cards (Knights) to shift the robber onto high-value tiles of opponents and cut off their critical resource supply.
- Prioritize hidden VP cards once Largest Army is secured.

**Robber Placement**:
- Place the robber on hexes that disrupt the opponent's highest-producing or strategically vital resources.
- If an opponent has multiple settlements/cities on a tile, prioritize blocking that hex.
- Use the robber to force trades and weaken your opponents' resource generation.

**Victory Point Optimization**:
- Focus on upgrading to cities, as they provide the largest VP boost.
- Build settlements strategically to block opponents' expansion and secure additional VPs.
- Use development cards to stay competitive and contend for end-game bonuses.

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers.
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile.
- üîç marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex.
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section.
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road-building strategy.
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1).
