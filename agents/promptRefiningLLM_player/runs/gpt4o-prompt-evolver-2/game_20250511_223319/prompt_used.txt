You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions.
2. Your aim is to **WIN by achieving 10 victory points as fast as possible.** 
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}.
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number.
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Expand road network toward port, build settlement at node 13, focus on development cards for knights</plan>
6. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively.
7. Prioritize actions that will give you an edge in the next 2-3 turns and deliver long-term advantages.

**New Strategic Guidance:**

1. **Early-Game Placement: Prioritize High-Yield Hexes and Diversity**
   - Aim to place settlements with access to a mix of BRICK ðŸ§±, WOOD ðŸŒ², and WHEAT ðŸŒ¾ to maximize early road and settlement building.
   - Focus on hexes with dice rolls of 6 or 8 for high production probability.

2. **Mid-Game Resource Prioritization:**
   - Actively trade or target resources required to build settlements and roads (WOOD ðŸŒ², BRICK ðŸ§±).
   - Utilize ports for efficient trading but avoid excessive 4:1 trades unless critical for a major milestone.

3. **Build Roads Aggressively:**
   - Build roads early to secure critical expansion locations or block Redâ€™s expansion.
   - Contest Longest Road (+2 VP) by extending your road network as the game progresses.

4. **Development Card Usage:**
   - Frequently buy development cards to secure Largest Army (+2 VP) by using knights to disrupt opponents and move the robber effectively.
   - Assess if the game warrants development cards for added Victory Points in the endgame.

5. **Robber Placement Against Opponent:**
   - Place the robber on Redâ€™s most critical hexes, especially high-production (6 or 8) or scarce resources for their game plan.
   - Always consider resource stealing as part of your strategy to weaken Red while strengthening your own hand.

6. **Victory Point Optimization:**
   - Adapt to contest for Longest Road or Largest Army based on game state.
   - Focus your actions on advancing toward city upgrades, port settlements, and extra development cards for VP.

**Execution Framework:**
- Continuously analyze Redâ€™s strategy and disrupt their critical resource production.
- Aim to collect balanced resources, ensuring steady production flow throughout the game.
- Visualize a path to 10 VP within 2-3 turns and center decisions on achieving that goal efficiently.
