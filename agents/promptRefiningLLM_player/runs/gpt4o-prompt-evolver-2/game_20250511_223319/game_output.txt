Updated plan: Expand road network toward node 13, build settlement next turn at node 13. Focus on increasing resource diversity (üêëSHEEP, üå≤WOOD). Contest Longest Road later if feasible while building toward city upgrades and Largest Army.

Updated plan: Build settlement at Node 9 to secure WOOD üå≤ and BRICK üß± for early expansions. Immediately plan road building toward a high-WHEAT üåæ or port node to secure trade options or expand resource diversity.

Game state prepared for LLM (length: 1924 chars)
Updated plan: Expand road network toward Node 10 for settlement near high-WHEAT üåæ production hex (üåæ5, üåæ10). Diversify resources with WHEAT üåæ to unlock city upgrades and sustain development card purchases.

Updated plan: Expand road network to node 19 for settlement near high-production WHEAT üåæ10 (‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê) and BRICK üß±6 (‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê). Prioritize settlement building at node 19 to diversify resources. Contest Longest Road mid-game while transitioning to city upgrades and Largest Army (development cards).

Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2014 chars)
Updated plan: - Focus on acquiring WOOD üå≤ and BRICK üß± for road/settlement building. Prioritize trading if possible.
- Keep an eye on Red's expansion and contest Longest Road as the game progresses.
- Aim to expand settlements toward nodes with higher production probability (e.g., nodes adjacent to üåæ10, üß±6, or üêë4 if possible).
- Purchase Development Cards to secure Largest Army in the mid-game and move the robber strategically to disrupt Red's strategy.

Updated plan: 1. Prioritize gaining **WOOD üå≤** and **BRICK üß±** (for roads and settlements). Since you lack access to these resources, consider targeting Red's production of these resources with the robber.
2. Contest **Longest Road** by expanding the road network as soon as WOOD üß± and BRICK üå≤ are obtained.
3. Keep pressure on Red by placing the robber on their most critical tiles. Specifically:
   - Target **üß±6** if they primarily need brick.
   - Target **üåæ5** if they need wheat for cities or settlements.
   - Steal resources when moving the robber.
4. Monitor Red‚Äôs expansion and disrupt them as they are advancing quickly (3 settlements and 6 cards). Aggressive disruption is key.
5. Save your 3 üåæ for future trades or city upgrades as your resource pool grows.

Updated plan: Target balanced resource collection (WOOD üß± and BRICK üå≤) for roads and settlements. Contest Longest Road by expanding my network. Move the robber to üß±6 on my next turn to disrupt Red‚Äôs production. Build settlements at critical nodes (#13 or #14 near hex üå≤9) and invest in development cards strategically.
LLM chose action 3: Trade port: Give 4 üåæWHEAT for 1 üß±BRICK
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2502 chars)
Updated plan: : expanding toward strategic settlement nodes near ports.

---

#### Action [2]: Build road at (10, 11)
- This road moves toward a **dead-end location** with no immediate opportunities for settlement.

---

#### Action [3]: Build road at (2, 9)
- This closes off Red‚Äôs access to nearby nodes but doesn‚Äôt actively advance your position toward VP.

---

#### Action [4]: Build road at (8, 9)
- An aggressive choice that blocks Red‚Äôs expansion toward ports but leaves you without better settlement opportunities.

---

#### Action [5]: Build road at (20, 22)
- Similar to Action [1], but doesn‚Äôt directly lead toward priority nodes like **13** or **9.**

---

#### Action [6]: Build road at (19, 21)
- Expands toward üåæ10 (‚≠ê‚≠ê), but you‚Äôre already producing üåæWHEAT here at node 19. No long-term strategic advantage to this road.

---

### Recommended Action:
After analyzing the options, the **best action** is to **build a road toward node 13** using Action [1]. This aligns with the strategic goal of securing critical resources üå≤WOOD and üß±BRICK for balanced production while contesting Red's expansion toward ports.

---

### Strategic Plan Update:
<plan> 
Expand road network toward node 13, secure settlement at critical hex üå≤9 üß±6. Focus on balanced resource collection to build roads and settlements aggressively. Invest in development cards for knights and Largest Army while contesting Longest Road.

Updated plan: Continue expanding the road network toward node 13 to secure key resources. Focus on blocking Red‚Äôs expansion while building toward either Longest Road or Largest Army. Buy development cards aggressively once resource diversity improves, aiming to utilize knights to weaken Red further. Ensure settlements prioritize balanced production for long-term sustainability.

- Focus your next turn on:
  - Building roads to expand toward critical nodes.
  - Trading or collecting missing resources for settlements and development cards.
  - Contesting Longest Road or Largest Army as mid-game goals.

- Focus next turn on gathering resources for road and settlement building.
- Use trades (if possible) to obtain wood and brick for rapid expansion.
- Prioritize buying development cards to compete for Largest Army, which will provide both knights to move the robber and potential hidden VP cards.
