   - Target **🌾5** if they need wheat for cities or settlements.
   - Steal resources when moving the robber.
4. Monitor Red’s expansion and disrupt them as they are advancing quickly (3 settlements and 6 cards). Aggressive disruption is key.
5. Save your 3 🌾 for future trades or city upgrades as your resource pool grows.

Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2765 chars)
Updated plan: Target balanced resource collection (WOOD 🧱 and BRICK 🌲) for roads and settlements. Contest Longest Road by expanding my network. Move the robber to 🧱6 on my next turn to disrupt Red’s production. Build settlements at critical nodes (#13 or #14 near hex 🌲9) and invest in development cards strategically.
LLM chose action 3: Trade port: Give 4 🌾WHEAT for 1 🧱BRICK
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2502 chars)
Updated plan: : expanding toward strategic settlement nodes near ports.

---

#### Action [2]: Build road at (10, 11)
- This road moves toward a **dead-end location** with no immediate opportunities for settlement.

---

#### Action [3]: Build road at (2, 9)
- This closes off Red’s access to nearby nodes but doesn’t actively advance your position toward VP.

---

#### Action [4]: Build road at (8, 9)
- An aggressive choice that blocks Red’s expansion toward ports but leaves you without better settlement opportunities.

---

#### Action [5]: Build road at (20, 22)
- Similar to Action [1], but doesn’t directly lead toward priority nodes like **13** or **9.**

---

#### Action [6]: Build road at (19, 21)
- Expands toward 🌾10 (⭐⭐), but you’re already producing 🌾WHEAT here at node 19. No long-term strategic advantage to this road.

---

### Recommended Action:
After analyzing the options, the **best action** is to **build a road toward node 13** using Action [1]. This aligns with the strategic goal of securing critical resources 🌲WOOD and 🧱BRICK for balanced production while contesting Red's expansion toward ports.

---

### Strategic Plan Update:
<plan> 
Expand road network toward node 13, secure settlement at critical hex 🌲9 🧱6. Focus on balanced resource collection to build roads and settlements aggressively. Invest in development cards for knights and Largest Army while contesting Longest Road.
LLM chose action 1: Build a road at edge (0, 20) (Cost: 1 🌲WOOD, 1 🧱BRICK)

Updated plan: Continue expanding the road network toward node 13 to secure key resources. Focus on blocking Red’s expansion while building toward either Longest Road or Largest Army. Buy development cards aggressively once resource diversity improves, aiming to utilize knights to weaken Red further. Ensure settlements prioritize balanced production for long-term sustainability.

Updated plan: - Move the robber to **6-brick** to weaken Red’s resource generation.
- Focus your next turn on:
  - Building roads to expand toward critical nodes.
  - Trading or collecting missing resources for settlements and development cards.
  - Contesting Longest Road or Largest Army as mid-game goals.

Updated plan: - Move the robber to 🧱6 to block Red’s brick production.
- Focus next turn on gathering resources for road and settlement building.
- Use trades (if possible) to obtain wood and brick for rapid expansion.
- Prioritize buying development cards to compete for Largest Army, which will provide both knights to move the robber and potential hidden VP cards.
