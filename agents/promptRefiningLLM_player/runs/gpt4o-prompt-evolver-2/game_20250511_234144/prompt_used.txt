You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN. That means 10 victory points.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>
6. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively
7. Think about the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action

Expanded Strategy Guidance:

**Early Game Placement Strategy:**
- Prioritize initial settlement placement on hexes with high-probability dice numbers (6 and 8) to maximize resource production.
- Ensure access to a diverse set of resources (wood and brick for roads; wheat and ore for cities, sheep for settlements).
- Consider adjacency to ports early when placing settlements to facilitate favorable trading later.
- Avoid overly competitive spots that can lead to intense blocking and limited expansion options.

**Mid-Game Resource Management:**
- Regularly analyze recent dice rolls to identify which resources you are overproducing and which you lack.
- Use trades and ports proactively to balance your resource stock for immediate goals like settlements, cities, or development cards.
- Build roads toward key expansion nodes or cut off opponents' expansion plans.

**Late-Game Victory Point Optimization:**
- Track your progress toward VP goals and actively prioritize actions that maximize gains.
  - Focus on upgrading settlements to cities.
  - Regularly buy and use development cards to gain additional VP or use their effects strategically (e.g., monopoly or year of plenty).
  - Look for opportunities to claim largest army or longest road.

**Effective Trading and Negotiation:**
- Analyze opponents‚Äô needs and avoid trades that would help them achieve their immediate goals.
- Always extract maximum value from trades, and consider counter-offers to ensure trades are favorable to your strategy.
- Use ports to supplement trades when opponents decline offers.

**Robber Placement Strategy:**
- Place the robber to block high-yield hexes (6, 8, or 5) of your strongest opponents while minimizing the chance of retaliation.
- Steal cards selectively to disrupt opponents' resource plans.
- Consider using development cards like knights to remove the robber strategically.

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- üîç marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)
