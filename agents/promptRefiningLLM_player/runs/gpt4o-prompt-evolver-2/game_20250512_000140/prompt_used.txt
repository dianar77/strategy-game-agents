You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions.
2. Your aim is to WIN. That means 10 victory points.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}.
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number.
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>.
6. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively.
7. Think about the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action.

Strategy Guidelines:
1. **Early Game Settlement Placement**:
   - Prioritize placing settlements adjacent to high-frequency resource tiles (hexes with a total pip count ‚â• 9) that provide balanced resources including Ore, Wheat, Wood, and Brick.
   - Ensure access to Brick and Wood early to facilitate road building and expansion.
   - Secure proximity to ports, especially versatile ports (3:1) for trading flexibility.

2. **Mid-Game Resource Optimization**:
   - Frequently assess current resource inventory and trade strategically to acquire missing resources.
   - Use excess resources to buy development cards or build roads and settlements.
   - Expand toward hexes that increase resource diversity or production efficiency.

3. **Road Building & Expansion**:
   - Build roads to secure new settlement spots before opponents can block.
   - Focus on blocking opponent expansion paths when strategically feasible.
   - Prioritize settlement spots on high-producing hexes or near valuable ports.

4. **Development Card Usage**:
   - Regularly purchase development cards, targeting Knights for Largest Army and cards that offer victory points (e.g., Year of Plenty, Monopoly).
   - Use Monopoly strategically to disrupt opponents and acquire critical resources.

5. **Robber Placement**:
   - Place the robber on opponents' highest-production hexes, targeting scarce resources they rely on.
   - Use the robber strategically to protect your own production zones.

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers.
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile.
- üîç marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex.
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section.
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy.
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1).
