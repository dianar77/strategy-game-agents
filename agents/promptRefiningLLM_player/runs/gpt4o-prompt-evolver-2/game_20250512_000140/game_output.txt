Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2989 chars)
Updated plan: Build roads toward Node 13 and Node 12 for the following reasons:
   1. Expanding to Node 13 will give access to Sheep (🐑 5 with moderate frequency).
   2. This is a step toward Node 23, which is adjacent to Brick (🧱 3) and Ore (⛏️ 6), both resources you currently lack.
   3. This pathway also blocks Red’s potential expansion eastward.
   Once the resources for a new settlement are gathered, build on Node 13, then aim for cities to maximize Wheat and Sheep production.
