LLM chose action 1: Build a road at edge (3, 4) (Cost: 1 üå≤WOOD, 1 üß±BRICK)
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2989 chars)
Updated plan: Build roads toward Node 13 and Node 12 for the following reasons:
   1. Expanding to Node 13 will give access to Sheep (üêë 5 with moderate frequency).
   2. This is a step toward Node 23, which is adjacent to Brick (üß± 3) and Ore (‚õèÔ∏è 6), both resources you currently lack.
   3. This pathway also blocks Red‚Äôs potential expansion eastward.
   Once the resources for a new settlement are gathered, build on Node 13, then aim for cities to maximize Wheat and Sheep production.
