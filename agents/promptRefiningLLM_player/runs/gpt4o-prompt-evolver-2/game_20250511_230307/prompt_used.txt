You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions.
2. Your aim is to WIN. That means achieving 10 victory points.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}.
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number.
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>
6. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively.
7. Think about the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action.
8. Take note of opportunities for trading with other players to overcome resource shortages.

Strategic Framework for Winning:

**Early Game Placement Strategy:**
- Prioritize settlement locations with access to at least two high-probability (6 or 8) resource hexes.
- Ensure a diverse resource mix that includes brick, wood, grain, and ore.
- Seek proximity to ports if viable for trading flexibility.
- Consider building roads towards high-value nodes or blocking opponents‚Äô expansion.

**Mid-Game Resource Management:**
- Continuously evaluate your needs for building roads, settlements, and cities. Use trades to focus on acquiring missing resources.
- Trade aggressively‚Äîeven at slight losses‚Äîto maintain steady progress.
  - Example: Trade more common resources like sheep or grain for rarer ones like ore or brick.
- Build roads strategically to secure placements for future settlements before opponents claim them.

**Late-Game Victory Point Optimization:**
- Prioritize expanding cities before building new settlements if doing so maximizes points with fewer resources.
- Invest in development cards often to secure hidden VP cards and Largest Army.
- Block opponents by breaking potential Longest Road chains or Largest Army accumulations.

**Development Card Usage:**
- Knights: Use for both securing Largest Army and removing the robber from critical tiles.
- Victory Points: Remember these are hidden points‚Äîprioritize unblocking the board.
- Monopoly: Identify turns with high resource activity and play to extract maximum advantage.
- Year of Plenty: Target rare resources like ore and brick.

**Robber Placement Strategy:**
- Place the robber on tiles that most impact the leading opponent‚Äôs production.
- Prioritize blocking high-frequency tiles (e.g., 6 or 8).
- Steal from opponents holding resources that align with your immediate goals.

**Trading and Negotiation:**
- Always know your opponents‚Äô needs and use this to your advantage in trades.
- Set up mutually beneficial trades but avoid helping an opponent too significantly.
- Push trades that align with your long-term strategy, even if they aren‚Äôt optimal for others (e.g., brick for settlement expansions).

**Dynamic Planning:**
- Continuously re-evaluate the board state each turn. Adjust your strategy depending on opponents‚Äô progress and current resources.
- Adapt road building to block opponents‚Äô strategies or secure essential nodes.

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers.
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile.
- üîç marks the robber‚Äôs location, blocking resource production on that hex.
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section.
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy.
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1).

Focus on securing an early lead through strategic placement choices and resource optimization to dominate the mid-to-late game phases.
