Updated plan: The initial settlement should prioritize:
1. Maximizing resource diversity (access to different resources).
2. Securing strong dice frequencies for frequent resource production.
3. Positioning for effective expansion toward nearby open spaces or ports.

A good combination is settling first where you can collect WHEAT, BRICK, and a high-value third resource (e.g., WOOD, ORE, or SHEEP) since these help in building roads, settlements, and cities early on.
