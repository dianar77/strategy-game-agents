Name: read_foo

You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN. That means 10 victory points.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>
6. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively
7. Think about the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

Game state prepared for LLM (length: 3273 chars)
Updated plan: The initial settlement should prioritize:
1. Maximizing resource diversity (access to different resources).
2. Securing strong dice frequencies for frequent resource production.
3. Positioning for effective expansion toward nearby open spaces or ports.

A good combination is settling first where you can collect WHEAT, BRICK, and a high-value third resource (e.g., WOOD, ORE, or SHEEP) since these help in building roads, settlements, and cities early on.
LLM chose action 16: Build a settlement at node 16 (Cost: 1 🌲WOOD, 1 🧱BRICK, 1 🌾WHEAT, 1 🐑SHEEP)
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2117 chars)

Let’s start by talking about some of the overall strategies you can take in Catan. The first strategy is the “Balanced Approach”. In this strategy you are simply trying to diversify your resources as much as possible by placing your settlements on a wide variety of resources, with a variety of different numbers. The goal of this strategy is to ensure that you have access to every material in the game, without relying on trading with other players or the bank. This is a very basic strategy that [...] The second resource-based strategy is the “Ore / Wheat” Strategy. This strategy focuses on building cities and buying development cards, and lends itself towards getting the largest army card. By building cities as early as possible you can increase your resource gathering, with the added bonus that your first cities will probably be on your original settlements which should be in prime locations on the board. While you can technically win with only your first two cities, the largest army, and [...] Rather than attempting to collect every resource, it’s generally more effective to focus on only a few resources. The two main ways to do this are the “Wood / Brick” strategy, and the “Ore / Wheat” strategy.

Additionally, since some of these tactics are a bit cold-blooded (doing whatever it takes to win), don’t expect everything included herein to keep your competition happy — user discretion is advised. Even though Catan is just a game and you should be able to do what’s best to win, people do take moves personally. Sometimes keeping people happy at the expense of short-term wins builds goodwill that could pay off down the line.

Anyways, let’s get started…

1. Know your competition

2. Bluffing [...] Here are some examples:

3. Cut people off, but don’t let it happen to you

Cut people off

Don’t get cut off

4. Avoid being the clear leader

5. Diversify your resources and number production

6. How to play your development cards

7. Robbers can decide games

Here are some pointers:

8. Always speak up

9. Think about win-scenarios

10. The person with the most points isn’t always winning

11. Yes, 11’s and 3’s roll

12. Table presence

13. Card tracking

================================== Ai Message ==================================

Based on insights from the red game strategy, the effectiveness of the current "Ore/Wheat" strategy can be refined further. Here’s my interpretation:

### Key Learnings:
1. **Ore/Wheat Strategy Dominance**: Access to ore and wheat early on ensures faster city upgrades and robust development card purchases.
2. **Road and Port Play**: Ports were underutilized. Prioritizing nodes adjacent to diverse and frequently rolled resources (6s, 8s) near ports is essential.
3. **Balanced Expansion**: Focusing too narrowly on robbers and monopolizing specific tiles caused constraints. A more dynamic win scenario with settlements and Longest Road strategy must be factored in.

### New Optimized Strategy for Prompt Refinement:
- **Diversify Initial Placement**: Prioritize double placements with high dice probabilities (6, 8) for balanced resource access (consider main resources: brick, wood, ore, and wheat).
- **Solidify a Port Strategy**: Early roads should target trading ports for resource conversion, aligning with the "few rich resources where 2:1 or 3:1 is possible."
- **Mid-game Adaptability**: Balance settlements/cities and progress toward Longest Road, while aiming to build Largest Army leveraging development cards.

### Action Plan:
I'll update the prompt to reflect this strategy and align it further with expert advice from articles and guides!

### New Prompt Update:
I will integrate these insights and rewrite the current prompt for a sharper strategy execution.

    new_text: You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the board and make decisions that will maximize your victory potential. 

Rules:
1. Assess the board step-by-step, analyzing dice probabilities, resources, and possible strategic placements.
2. Your goal is to WIN by achieving 10 victory points.
3. Your finalized decision needs to be boxed like \boxed{3}.
4. Your single integer response corresponds to the action number only.

Enhanced Gameplay Guide:
- Balance your focus across resources but specialize in either "ORE/WHEAT strategy" for city development and Largest Army or "BRICK/WOOD strategy" to excel at road-building and settlements. Having ports nearby for trade efficiency helps accelerate your chosen strategy.

Strategic Plan Mechanics:
- Use <plan> to update your ongoing plan:
  e.g.: <plan>Secure port node 8-6; upgrade settlement #16 into a city.</plan>

Winning Play-by-Play Approach:
1. Pick high-dice hotspots for settlements early for maximized rolls.
2. Prioritize expanding roads connecting efficient paths while optimizing nodes next phase.
3. Adapt dynamically with Roll History: steal robbers tactically but shift ports where redundant.

================================== Ai Message ==================================

The updated prompt fell short again, with the PromptRefiningLLMPlayer losing more decisively this time. The average victory points decreased, signaling unmet priorities in balancing settlement upgrades, road expansion, and development cards.

### Key Observations:
1. **Resource Prioritization Trouble**: The player struggled to gather critical resources like ore and wheat efficiently for city upgrades, resulting in stagnation.
2. **Lack of Road Strategy Application**: Longest Road was not aggressively contested, leaving easy points for the opponent.
3. **Development Cards and Army**: The Largest Army was not secured, limiting opportunities to interrupt the opponent’s progress or gain critical points.

### Adjustments and Actions for Further Prompt Refinement:
The strategy needs better alignment to prioritize faster expansions, targeted road builds, and effective use of development cards. Let me refine this further and test again.

 Call ID: call_w0tgVErtD1PRHS0MxYtiD5nf
  Args:
    new_text: You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your ultimate goal is to win by reaching 10 victory points. Prioritize an efficient strategy based on the following principles:

### Key Guidelines:
1. **Focus on Both Short-Term and Long-Term Goals**: Develop a diverse and complementary resource base, balancing immediate profitability with future scalability.
2. **Prioritize Critical Resources**: Target nodes with high probability dice rolls (e.g., 6 and 8). Ensure access to at least wood, brick, wheat, and ore for balanced expansion potential.
3. **Dynamic Adaptation**: Plan 2-3 turns ahead. Opt for actions that align with your long-term roadmap while dynamically responding to game state changes.

### Strategic Objectives:
1. Aim to build cities early for resource amplification (prioritize the Ore/Wheat strategy).
2. Aggressively pursue Largest Army using development cards.
3. Position for Longest Road if it complements your placements or counters the opponent.

### Gameplay Rules:
1. Think step by step and analyze board, resources, trades, and build progression carefully.
2. Use <plan>...</plan> tags to outline an updated plan after each turn.
3. Always box your final action choice with \boxed{action}.

### Tips for Better Resource Management:
- **Ports**: Leverage ports to trade surplus resources efficiently.
- **Robber**: Use robbers to block critical enemy resources while enhancing trades with stolen cards.
- **Build Priorities**: Expand settlements strategically and upgrade to cities quickly to compound resource benefits.

Adapt and refine your strategy to dominate the game.

================================== Ai Message ==================================

The updated prompt still didn't lead to a victory. With 5 victory points out of 10, the key issues persisted:

### Key Observations from the Loss:
1. **Inability to Convert Settlements to Cities**: The player failed to prioritize sufficient ore and wheat resources for city upgrades.
2. **Neglect of Resource Efficiency**: Prolonged focus on robber placement without meaningful resource conversion or acquisition led to stagnation.
3. **Missed Development Card Opportunities**: While some development cards were purchased, the lack of sufficient focus on utilizing them aggressively (e.g., through knights) limited progress toward Largest Army.
4. **Lack of Road Versatility**: Roads were not built effectively to challenge for Longest Road or enable swift expansion of settlements.

### Next Steps:
I'll adjust the prompt to better balance resource acquisition, city upgrades, development cards, and road expansions. Time to refine the strategy further and increase competitiveness.

 Call ID: call_CzGtJf9pQpJaehwWQ4hkgc3l
  Args:
    new_text: You are playing Settlers of Catan. Aim to WIN by achieving 10 victory points using the following refined strategies:

### Gameplay Principles:
1. **Resource Prioritization**: Focus on acquiring ore, wheat, brick, and wood early to enable city upgrades and settlements. Use dice roll probabilities (6, 8) to select high-value nodes.
2. **Aggressive Development Card Use**: Buy development cards consistently to target Largest Army for victory points and strategic robber control.
3. **Expand Via Roads Strategically**: Build roads to secure settlement opportunities near ports or contested nodes. Pivot to Longest Road if it blocks opponents or grants you the bonus.

### Dynamic Play-by-Play Strategy:
1. Analyze game state, resources, and dice probabilities at each turn.
2. Use <plan>...</plan> tags to define your strategy based on resource availability and game progress.
3. Prioritize city upgrades early for resource amplification and settlements to diversify production.
4. Use robber tactically to block critical opponent nodes and steal resources.
5. When stuck, use ports to trade surplus resources for missing ones.

### Plan Mechanics:
1. Balance city-building, settlement expansion, and development card purchases to ensure point generation across multiple paths.
2. Constantly adapt to block the opponent’s progress toward Longest Road or Largest Army.

Align every action with long-term progress toward 10 victory points and dynamically counter the opponent’s strategy when possible.

2. Target 🧱6 (-1, 0, 1) since it blocks RED's crucial 🧱 production.
3. Steal a random resource from RED, prioritizing diversification of resources (hope for 🧱BRICK or ⛏️ORE).
4. Evaluate resources post-steal: 
   - Convert or build toward a 🏙️ city at 🏠 node 4 (🌲/🌾 heavy production).
   - If RED is about to win, consider using robber to block their 🌾 nodes as a fallback.

Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2613 chars)
Updated plan: 1. **Move Robber**: Move it to (-1, 1, 0) to block RED’s 🌾8 node and steal a resource. This denies them wheat and targets a strong production hex. Aim to steal 🧱BRICK or ⛏️ORE—it’s the most helpful for your city or settlement plans.
2. **Trade via Port**: Use the 🐑 port to trade 4 🐑SHEEP for 1 ore (if a trade is possible, based on the stolen resource). This prepares you for building a city or a development card.
3. **Reassess Build Options**:  
   - With 2 ore and 4 wheat in hand, prioritize upgrading settlements to cities (4 VP total needed for 10 VP).  
   - Alternatively, buy development cards to work toward Largest Army (3 VP required for 10 VP).  
4. **Robber Use**: If you acquire another knight card, aim to claim Largest Army, which provides a +2 VP bonus and blocks RED’s development card strategies.
LLM chose action 3: Move robber to (-1, 1, 0) and steal from RED
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 3142 chars)
Updated plan: 1. **Use the Robber Decisively**:  
   - Move the robber to the 🌾8 hex (position **(-1, 1, 0)**). This blocks RED and their best wheat producing tile, crucial for their city-building plans. Steal a resource from RED to disrupt their next move. If possible, steal ⛏️ORE or 🧱BRICK to set yourself up for the next move.

2. **Buy a Development Card**:  
   - With 1 🐑SHEEP, 1 🌾WHEAT, and 1 ⛏️ORE in hand, purchasing a development card is the optimal choice. This gives you the chance to draw a knight (working toward Largest Army) or a victory point.

3. **Prioritize Largest Army**:  
   - Play knights aggressively to claim Largest Army (2 VP bonus). You already have 1 played knight, so you only need 2 more to secure this path to victory.  
   - Block RED with the robber each time you play a knight.

4. **Future Turns**:  
   - If you steal ⛏️ORE or trade for ore, quickly upgrade a settlement into a city. Doubling resource production from high-probability tiles (🌾8 and 🐑9) is key for sustained progress.  
   - Stay vigilant of RED’s road network and deny them Longest Road if the opportunity arises.

Updated plan: 1. **Robber Placement:** Move the robber to **🌾8 (-1, 1, 0)**. This blocks RED’s wheat production and delays their city upgrades.  
   - Steal one resource from RED (target wheat or ore if possible).  
2. **Buy Development Card:** Use your available 🌾WHEAT, 🐑SHEEP, and ⛏️ORE resources to purchase a development card.  
   - Target knights to secure Largest Army (3 VP).  
   - Long-term goal: Utilize robber strategically and block RED further.  
3. **Future Resource Usage:** Focus on upgrading settlements to cities (cost: 2 🌾WHEAT + 3 ⛏️ORE) to increase your resource income at high-probability nodes.

Updated plan: 1. **Robber Placement**: Move the robber to **🌾8 (-1, 1, 0)** to block RED’s wheat production. Steal a resource from RED, prioritizing **sheep** or **ore** to buy a development card.
2. **Play Road Building Card** (ONLY if RED tries to immediately expand Longest Road or threatens your future settlement spots; otherwise, save it for flex use).
3. **Buy Development Card** (if resources align after stealing). Target knights to secure Largest Army and additional robbers.
4. **Prepare for a City**: Once resources are gathered, prioritize upgrading **node 4 (5 + 8)** to amplify your already-strong wheat and wood production.
5. **Adapt to Threats**: If RED moves closer to 10 VP through Longest Road, pivot to disrupt their road strategy and reclaim the bonus.

Updated plan: 1. **Move Robber**: Place the robber on RED’s **🌾8** wheat node to block their production and steal a resource.  
2. **Resource Use After Robber**: If you steal 🐑SHEEP, buy a development card. If you steal 🧱BRICK, hold to prepare for a settlement. If neither, trade **4 🌾WHEAT** for 🐑SHEEP and buy a development card.  
3. **Road Building Card**: SAVE the Road Building card for later and adapt if RED makes a decisive move on Longest Road next turn.
LLM chose action 1: End your turn
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2552 chars)
Updated plan: 1. **Move Robber**:
   - Place it on 🌾8 (-1, 1, 0), blocking RED's wheat production. This indirectly slows their ability to upgrade settlements to cities.
   - *Steal a resource from RED*. Depending on what we steal, the next steps are:
     - 🐑 **SHEEP**: Buy a development card to pursue Largest Army and leverage strategic robber placement.
     - 🧱 **BRICK**: Save for settlement-building as we also have 🌾WHEAT available.
     - Neither 🐑 nor 🧱: Trade **4 🌾WHEAT** with the bank for 🐑SHEEP and buy a development card.
2. **Prioritize Development Cards**:
   - Work toward Largest Army for +2 Victory Points, ensuring both robber control and defensive opportunities.
3. **Reserve Road Building Card**:
   - Hold this card for Longest Road pivot or settlement expansion as RED cannot significantly extend roads next turn.

Updated plan: 1. **Move Robber**:
   - Place the Robber on **🌾8 (-1, 1, 0)** to block RED’s critical wheat production and slow down their ability to build cities or settlements.
   - **Steal a resource from RED**. Depending on what we get:
     - **🐑SHEEP**: Purchase a **Development Card** immediately to work toward Largest Army and potentially gain a Knight or Victory Point.
     - **🧱BRICK**: Save it for future settlement-building when combined with road expansion using the Road Building card.
     - Neither 🧱 nor 🐑: Trade surplus resources (e.g., **4 🌾WHEAT**) at the bank for **🐑SHEEP** and still purchase a Development Card.
2. **Prepare for Largest Army**:
   - Focus on securing **Largest Army** as the faster route to +2 Victory Points. You already have 2 played Knights, needing just 1 more to get the bonus.
3. **Reserve Road Building**:
   - Hold the **Road Building card** for a decisive Longest Road pivot or settlement claim in later turns to block RED and secure the win.

**After completing this plan, you will end your turn and re-evaluate based on RED’s next move.**

   - Place the Robber on 🌾8 (-1, 1, 0) to block RED’s wheat production, which is critical for their city-building and settlement expansion.
   - **Steal a card from RED**. This could provide you with a resource you need to take action this turn.

2. **Based on the stolen resource**:
   - If you steal a 🐑SHEEP: Use it to purchase a **Development Card**.
   - If you steal a 🧱BRICK or other resource:
     - Trade with the Bank (e.g., 4 🌾WHEAT -> 🐑SHEEP) to purchase a Development Card.
     - Save resources if Development Card purchase is not possible this turn.

3. **Keep the Road Building card for later**:
   - Do not use the **Road Building** card yet. Save it for a decisive road-building maneuver to either secure a settlement or compete for Longest Road in the future.

4. **End your turn**:
   - Re-evaluate the game situation and RED’s next move after ending the turn.

Updated plan: 1. **Move the Robber to 🌾8** (high-impact block on RED's wheat production).
   - Steal a resource from RED. If you get 🧱BRICK or ⛏️ORE, proceed with the next step.

2. **Make a Trade (if important resources are still missing)**:
   - If Red's steal gives no 🧱 or 🧱ORE, explore port trading 4 🌾WHEAT for 🧱BRICK, enabling a settlement or development card purchase.

3. **Consider Playing "Road Building" for Strategic Growth**:
   - If you can block RED from expanding roads further or set up paths to settlements, this might be the best use of the card.
   - Make this decision based on where you play roads and its game-long impact.

4. **Safety Plan—End Turn**:
   - Avoid unnecessary trades to save resources for future settlements or a city.

================================== Ai Message ==================================

The latest refinement still resulted in another loss for the PromptRefiningLLMPlayer with an unchanged score of 5 victory points. Here's the analysis:

### Continued Challenges:
1. **Failure to Transition to Cities**: Despite buying development cards and some road-building progress, city upgrades continue to be delayed due to insufficient prioritization of ore and wheat.
2. **Development Cards Plateau**: While development cards were bought, their use lacked substantial impact. Largest Army remained unclaimed.
3. **No Road Dominance**: Roads were built inconsistently. The player did not pivot toward Longest Road when other avenues stalled.

### Next Steps:
The strategy needs a more robust mechanism for achieving synergy between resource generation, city-building, and road expansion. I'll further refine the prompt to better prioritize actions that lead concurrently to victory points from cities, roads, and army while dynamically countering Red's progress.

 Call ID: call_NoqI2v2AfsPWD2TmwY3uO0mf
  Args:
    new_text: You are playing as BLUE in Settlers of Catan. Your ultimate goal is to WIN by achieving 10 victory points. Focus on a dynamic and balanced approach across resource management, city upgrades, road expansion, and development cards.

### Winning Strategy Guidelines:
1. **Prioritize Cities and Resource Amplification**:
   - Focus on upgrading settlements to cities early, especially on nodes with high-value dice rolls (6, 8) for ore and wheat.
2. **Claim Victory with Development Cards**:
   - Aggressively buy development cards and aim to secure Largest Army through knights. Use the robber strategically to disrupt opponent resource generation.
3. **Road and Settlement Expansion**:
   - Build roads to secure strategic nodes for settlements and prepare to contest Longest Road if advantageous.

### Action Plan:
1. **Early Game**:
   - Prioritize settlements and roads to secure resource diversity (wood, brick, wheat, and ore).
   - Target nodes near ports to enhance trading capabilities.
2. **Mid Game**:
   - Upgrade settlements to cities while maintaining balanced resource acquisition.
   - Purchase development cards to prepare for knights and potential Largest Army.
   - Build roads strategically to block RED or secure settlement opportunities.
3. **Late Game**:
   - Focus on victory point generation through cities, Largest Army, and Longest Road (if achievable).
   - Dynamically counter RED's progress by blocking key nodes with the robber and responding to their road expansion.

### Rules for Decision-Making:
1. Evaluate the current board state and adapt plans dynamically, updating your strategy after every turn using <plan>...</plan> tags.
2. Box your final action choice for each turn using \boxed{action}.
3. Always consider how your action aligns with the long-term objective of reaching 10 victory points.

================================== Ai Message ==================================

The PromptRefiningLLMPlayer significantly improved its performance and reached 8 Victory Points, which is closer to the winning threshold of 10 Victory Points. However, the player still fell short compared to RED's consistent dominance.

### Key Observations:
1. **Improved Progress**: The player managed to construct cities and buy development cards, securing 8 VPs through diverse strategies (cities, Largest Army, and road building).
2. **Insufficient Decisiveness**: The delay in upgrading settlements to cities and lack of decisive Longest Road control allowed RED to reach 10 VPs first.
3. **Strategic Planning Needs Fine-Tuning**:
   - Too much focus was placed on small trades and minor road placements.
   - The Largest Army bonus was secured but wasn’t enough to outweigh missed opportunities for faster city upgrades or settlement expansions.

### Next Steps:
- Refine the prompt to emphasize timely upgrades, aggressive road expansion for Longest Road, and prioritization of high-yield strategies (cities and development cards) over secondary moves like robber placement on low-impact tiles.

Would you like me to proceed with refining the prompt further based on these insights?
