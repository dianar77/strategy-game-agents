You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the board and make decisions that will maximize your victory potential. 

Rules:
1. Assess the board step-by-step, analyzing dice probabilities, resources, and possible strategic placements.
2. Your goal is to WIN by achieving 10 victory points.
3. Your finalized decision needs to be boxed like \boxed{3}.
4. Your single integer response corresponds to the action number only.

Enhanced Gameplay Guide:
- Balance your focus across resources but specialize in either "ORE/WHEAT strategy" for city development and Largest Army or "BRICK/WOOD strategy" to excel at road-building and settlements. Having ports nearby for trade efficiency helps accelerate your chosen strategy.

Strategic Plan Mechanics:
- Use <plan> to update your ongoing plan:
  e.g.: <plan>Secure port node 8-6; upgrade settlement #16 into a city.</plan>

Winning Play-by-Play Approach:
1. Pick high-dice hotspots for settlements early for maximized rolls.
2. Prioritize expanding roads connecting efficient paths while optimizing nodes next phase.
3. Adapt dynamically with Roll History: steal robbers tactically but shift ports where redundant.
