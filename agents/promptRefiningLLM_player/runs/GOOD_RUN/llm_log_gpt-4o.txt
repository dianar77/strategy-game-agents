The results indicate a significant issue in performance: PromptRefiningLLMPlayer has won 0 out of 5 games. Average Victory Points (VP), settlements, cities, and roads for the player are alarmingly low. The opponent consistently outperforms us. Here's a breakdown of key problems and areas we need to improve upon:

### Observations:
1. **Victory Points (VP):** The player's average VP is a mere 4.4, compared to the opponent's dominant 10.0. This suggests weaknesses in both resource management and long-term planning.
2. **Settlements and Cities:** Settlements (1.4) and Cities (0.6) are significantly below the opponent's values of 1.8 and 3.0, respectively. This indicates poor early-game placement and mid-game development strategy.
3. **Roads:** The player’s road-building effort is non-existent (Average Road: 0.0), which limits expansion opportunities and can prevent longest road points.
4. **Largest Army:** The average army size is 0.4, suggesting that development card usage is not optimized, making it improbable to achieve Largest Army and related Victory Points.
5. **Development Victory Points:** The player scored 1.0 AVG VP from development cards, indicating some reliance but suboptimal development and usage.

### Immediate Weaknesses:
- **Early Game Placement:** Poor initial placement leads to suboptimal resource generation for the entirety of the match.
- **Resource Management:** Failure to effectively utilize resources to build settlements, roads, and upgrade to cities.
- **Trading:** No evident trading strategy to balance resource shortages.
- **Development Cards and Largest Army:** Subpar development card purchases limit mid-game power and end-game VP from Largest Army.
- **Expanding through Roads:** Zero road development hampers growth towards additional settlements and securing the Longest Road VP.

To proceed, I'll analyze relevant strategies to address early-game placement and resource management through research. These two areas appear to be fundamental weaknesses leading to the poor performance. Next, I’ll refine the prompt to account for these strategies to improve gameplay.

As a rule of thumb, during your first settlement placement, it’s usually best not to point your road toward the middle of the board. You will likely have no expansion spots since everyone will start toward the middle, rather than the coast.
Anytime your road is in a contestable direction, make sure you’re the one cutting someone off or are more likely to win the race — not the other way around. [...] Think of a Catan map as having 3 areas — the center, inner, and coastal rings. The “center” is all the spots around the middle hex, “inner” is the next one outward, and so on.
For starters, the coast never makes sense for your first placement as it will only have 2 hexes of production (3 for you to build more central) and it will inhibit your optionality to expand. [...] It is often best to sacrifice a superior spot in exchange for being able to expand toward a good location that is likely to be open. It is much better to have two decent spots than one that’s amazing.

What may be a poor starting placement (i.e. next to a 2 or 12) will often get left open which could be great for a 3rd or 4th settlement placement.
Keep in mind, the fewer people placing their second settlement after you, the more assurance you will have that you won’t get cut off.

Also you don’t want to overproduce resources which can’t be used and then lose them to a 7 roll.

A much more ideal setup would be an 8-5-10 placement, with a secondary placement of 6-9-4.

These are all good numbers, and you’ve got a variety, meaning that you’re more likely to collect on any given roll.

It’s not always possible to get good number variety, and you will more often than not have a duplicate number, but it’s important to be as diverse as possible. [...] Overall, placing your starting settlements wisely will give you a huge advantage in Settlers of Catan. But this is just one of the many strategies that can be employed in the game.

It is very hard to employ all these tactics in every game though, as the board is arranged randomly by the system and your neighbors choices restrict yours.

However, having a good grasp of starting positions and initial placements will help greatly in winning you your next Colonist game. [...] This is where the road placement comes in very handy. Placing your first roads is actually very important, as doing it wrong can set you back a few turns.

Just make sure that your road points to a spot on the map that you can move out to, even if the resource production isn’t high.

A common error to make is pointing the road to a goldmine of resources and numbers, only to have your neighbor place there next turn, making your road a dead end for you.

Rather than attempting to collect every resource, it’s generally more effective to focus on only a few resources. The two main ways to do this are the “Wood / Brick” strategy, and the “Ore / Wheat” strategy. [...] Let’s start by talking about some of the overall strategies you can take in Catan. The first strategy is the “Balanced Approach”. In this strategy you are simply trying to diversify your resources as much as possible by placing your settlements on a wide variety of resources, with a variety of different numbers. The goal of this strategy is to ensure that you have access to every material in the game, without relying on trading with other players or the bank. This is a very basic strategy that [...] The second resource-based strategy is the “Ore / Wheat” Strategy. This strategy focuses on building cities and buying development cards, and lends itself towards getting the largest army card. By building cities as early as possible you can increase your resource gathering, with the added bonus that your first cities will probably be on your original settlements which should be in prime locations on the board. While you can technically win with only your first two cities, the largest army, and

### Findings from Research

#### Early Game Placement:
1. **Road Placement Priority**:
   - Avoid pointing roads toward the center unless you can cut opponents off or secure viable expansion spots.
   - Focus on expanding towards less contested areas (e.g., the inner ring) rather than coastal or central rings.

2. **Settlement Placement:**
   - Choose intersection spots with variety across six high-probability numbers.
   - Diversity matters. Include critical resources like ore and wheat in your strategy.
   - Ideally, locate settlements on intersections with the highest resource diversity for flexibility in the mid-game.

3. **Expansion Awareness**:
   - Plan your expansions early by ensuring road directionality leads to viable new settlement or city spots. Avoid dead-ending or long contests with opposing roads.

---

#### Resource Management:
1. **Focus Strategies**:
   - "Ore-Wheat Strategy" to prioritize city upgrades early and ensure robust development card usage.
   - Alternatively, emphasize the "Wood-Brick Strategy" for early road-building and settlement expansion.

2. **Diversity vs. Specialization**:
   - If aiming for the largest army or development cards, favor ore and wheat placement.
   - Balance resources to avoid resource overproduction or dependency on trades.

---

### Hypothesis for Prompt Improvements

Combining the research findings, I believe the following adjustments in the prompt could significantly improve performance:
1. **Placement Strategy Guidance**:
   - Prioritize intersections with diversity across six numbers and access to ore/wheat combo early.
   - Plan second placement for expansion without risking cutoff by other players, and avoid low-value coastal expansions.

2. **Early Game Resource Focus**:
   - Adjust the strategy to dynamically favor ore/wheat or wood/brick depending on the board setup.

3. **Road Building Adjustments**:
   - Embed aggressive road placement strategies in the logic to target settlements and protect expansion opportunities.

4. **Development Card Optimization**:
   - Explicit guidance to push development card strategy when ore/wheat settlements are strong.

I will use these insights to modify and improve the prompt. Let's read the current prompt to make targeted changes.

You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

#### Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, available resources, and next-best actions dynamically.
2. **Prioritize Victory Points**: Your main goal is to reach **10 victory points as fast as possible**, considering both immediate gains and long-term strategic positioning.
3. Your final chosen action must be a single integer corresponding to the action number, and should be encapsulated as: \boxed{2}.
4. **Strategic Plan Documentation**: If you want to create or refine your strategic plan, encapsulate the plan within `<plan>` tags like:
   `<plan>Expand roads toward the 3:1 port for an alternative trade route, then upgrade node 13 settlement into a city</plan>`.
5. Adapt your plan to resource collection patterns and opponent placements over time.
6. Analyze the recent resource changes to identify which resources you're producing effectively, and adjust your strategy to compensate for resource shortages or surpluses dynamically.
7. Always think about optimal actions over the next **2-3 turns**, not exclusively the immediate action.

#### Early Game Strategy:
**Settlement Placement Priorities**:
- Choose intersections with six unique, high-probability numbers (e.g., 4-8-10) for maximum production diversity.
- Prioritize securing access to **ore** and **wheat**. These resources are critical for early city upgrades and development card purchases.
- Always consider settlement proximity to ports (3:1 or resource-specific) for trade advantages while maintaining growth potential for roads or future settlements.

**Road Placement**:
- Direct roads away from the center to expand toward uncontested territory, ensuring viable follow-up placements for settlements.
- Aim to secure intersections with strategic resources or block opponents from critical expansions.

#### Resource Management:
- Early in the game, focus on **diversification** to produce multiple resource types efficiently. Avoid overloading low-value resources (e.g., sheep without strong trade paths).
- Dynamically adjust between "Ore-Wheat Strategy" (if ready for city upgrades and development cards) or "Wood-Brick Strategy" (for aggressive road-building and expansion) based on board development.
- **Monitor resource drops closely**—respond quickly to imbalances by pursuing trades, port use, or upgraded production.

#### Development Strategy:
- Acquire **development cards actively**, prioritizing knights for Largest Army early and using VP or resource-boosting cards strategically.

#### Robber Placement:
- Maximize sabotage on well-placed enemy nodes concentrating on **ore/wheat combinations** or expansion-critical resources. Always consider benefits for resource denial based on opponents’ strategies.

Use this knowledge to methodically control the game state, dominate resource production, achieve 10 victory points, and outperform the opponent.

### SUMMARY:

1. **What the Agent Has Learned from the Game Results:**
   - The **PromptRefiningLLMPlayer** was significantly underperforming with 0 wins out of 5 games compared to the AlphaBetaPlayer.
   - Key weaknesses include:
     - Low average Victory Points (4.4 vs. 10.0).
     - Minimal settlements (1.4) and cities (0.6), indicating poor early-game development.
     - Absence of road-building (0.0 Avg Road), limiting expansion opportunities.
     - Insufficient Largest Army acquisition (0.4 Avg Army), reflecting suboptimal development card use.
   - Overall resource generation, placement strategy, and growth planning were identified as major deficits.

2. **Strategies Implemented in the Prompt:**
   - **Early Game Placement:**
     - Prioritize intersections with six high-probability numbers (~4-8-10) for resource diversity.
     - Ensure settlements are placed on critical resources like ore and wheat for early city upgrades and development cards.
   - **Road Placement:**
     - Plan roads for expansion toward uncontested areas, away from the center, and aim to secure key intersections without wasted moves.
   - **Resource Management:**
     - Adjust dynamically between "Ore-Wheat Strategy" (for cities and development cards) or "Wood-Brick Strategy" (for road-building and settlements).
     - Monitor resource production to avoid imbalances and leverage ports for efficient trading.
   - **Development Card Optimization:**
     - Active pursuit of knights to gain Largest Army for leveraging mid/late-game points.
   - **Robber Placement:**
     - Sabotage opponents’ key intersections (e.g., ore/wheat combos) while minimizing personal resource loss.
   - **Dynamic Planning:**
     - Embed forward-thinking for 2-3 turns, using resource and board state awareness to adjust priorities.

3. **Performance Metrics Observed:**
   - The AlphaBetaPlayer consistently maintained dominance with an optimal strategy, securing all 5 wins.
   - Key discrepancies in settlements (1.8 vs. 1.4), cities (3.0 vs. 0.6), road-building (1.0 vs. 0.0), and development points (0.2 vs. 1.0) highlighted areas to address.
   - The average game concluded in 96.2 turns (~257.8 ticks), revealing the importance of planning mid- to late-game transitions.

    query: Settlers of Catan mid-game strategies for expanding efficiently to increase settlements================================= Tool Message =================================

<Document href="https://remptongames.com/2021/08/08/the-ultimate-catan-strategy-guide-top-tips-to-win-more-at-catan/"/>
The “Wood / Brick” strategy focuses primarily on building new settlements and roads. This strategy allows players to expand quickly, which can increase their resource gathering potential. By focusing on roads, players can not only reach desirable spots on the board more quickly, but can also cut off other player’s expansion opportunities. This strategy is also in a good position to build the longest road. There are two main downsides to this strategy. The first is that you cannot win the game [...] Let’s start by talking about some of the overall strategies you can take in Catan. The first strategy is the “Balanced Approach”. In this strategy you are simply trying to diversify your resources as much as possible by placing your settlements on a wide variety of resources, with a variety of different numbers. The goal of this strategy is to ensure that you have access to every material in the game, without relying on trading with other players or the bank. This is a very basic strategy that

Cities first strategy
Since cities double your earning power, an effective strategy can be to optimize for as much wheat and rock as you can get early in the game, upgrade to two cities as quickly as possible, and then trade out some of your abundant wheat and rock for wood and brick later to build roads and expand. If you can get access to sheep with this strategy, you can also quickly and easily pursue a strategy of buying a lot of development cards before building more settlements. [...] Expansion: make sure you predict where your opponents will place so you know what's available. This is really only applicable to the 2nd settlement.Board diversification: Count the dots on all resources at the start of the game. This is a decent approximation for the supply that will be available. All things equal, producing resources that are scarce gives you flexibility to turn them into anything you want through trades. Sheep are used less than other resources.Personal diversification: Less

You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN. That means 10 victory points.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>
6. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively
7. Think about the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)================================== Ai Message ==================================

    new_text: You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

#### Updated Rules for Strategic Play:
1. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**: Think through your decision step by step, carefully analyzing the game state, resources, and **long-term opportunities**.
2. **Winning as the Goal**: Your aim is to strategically optimize your play to win by achieving **10 Victory Points**.
3. **Action Format**: Select one best action and format your choice as: \boxed{2}.
4. **Strategic Planning**: Utilize `<plan>` tags to chart out a 3-5 turn forward strategy. Example: `<plan>Claim uncontested Wheat-Port intersection, build roads towards node 9, develop settlements into cities</plan>`
5. **Adaptability**: React dynamically to the state of the game and opponents’ strategies. Adjust your plan as needed depending on resource access and blockades.
6. **Resource Change Analysis**: Regularly evaluate resource production patterns to adjust priorities, balancing resource collection and spending.

#### Early Game Focus:
1. **Settlement Placement**:
   - Prioritize intersections that give access to **three unique resources** (avoid relying on trades alone).
   - Select tiles with **high-probability dice numbers (6, 8, 5)** and aim for resource diversity across Wood, Brick, Ore, and Wheat.
   - First settlement placement: Favor **future expansion** and **port proximity**.
2. **Road Placement Goals**:
   - Extend roads **toward high-value node expansions** or **ports** early.
   - Avoid roads that lead to contested or opponent-heavy areas.

#### Resource Management:
1. **Ore-Wheat Efficiency**: Use this for rapid development of cities and development cards during the mid-game.
2. **Target Balanced Resource Collection**: Trade intelligently to ensure a steady growth of needed resources. **Avoid excessive stagnation on development cards.**

#### Development Cards:
- Prioritize **Knights** early to secure Largest Army.
- Transition into using Year of Plenty or Monopoly cards to recover in key plays or break opponent strategies.
- Use Road Building **only when expansion is blocked or delayed by resource shortages.**

#### Robber Placement:
- Always target intersections where your opponent has **Wheat-Ore hubs or dominant cities**.
- Use the robber tactically to **protect expansions** and hinder mid-game strategies by prioritizing opponents’ board dominance zones.

With these updated rules, manage your actions carefully with the goal of dominating resource production and efficient expansion. Adapt as needed to board changes.================================= Tool Message =================================

================================ Human Message =================================

### SUMMARY:

1. **Key Insights Learned Throughout All Evolutions:**
   - The **PromptRefiningLLMPlayer** remains significantly underperforming, with 0 wins across all games against AlphaBetaPlayer.
   - Weaknesses identified include early-game stagnation, poor road-building (0.0 Avg), underutilization of settlements/cities (AVG 1.4/0.6), inefficient resource generation, and inadequate Largest Army pursuit.
   - Resource imbalance and lack of mid-game expansion hinder competitive play.

2. **Prompt Evolution:**
   - **Initial Version:** Basic step-by-step reasoning with focus on early-game placement and resource diversity (~4-8-10 intersections).
   - **Updated Evolution (Current):** Comprehensive rules refined to emphasize forward-thinking strategies, dynamic responses to game state, optimized resource trading, and strategic development card usage. Early-game focus on settlements near ports, mid-game upgrades to cities, and strategic road placement for expansion were added.

3. **Strategies Implemented in Prompt:**
   - **Settlement Placement:** Prioritize resource diversity, efficiency (Ore-Wheat hubs), and port adjacency. Avoid relying solely on trades.
   - **Road Placement:** Expand into contested-free zones and towards high-value intersections/ports.
   - **Resource Management:** Alternate between Ore-Wheat and Wood-Brick strategies dynamically. Monitor production to avoid stagnation and leverage ports for imbalances.
   - **Development Cards:** Early emphasis on Knights for Largest Army, followed by strategic use of Monopoly and Year of Plenty cards. Avoid over-reliance on Road Building unless necessary.
   - **Robber Placement:** Target opponents’ Wheat-Ore intersections while protecting personal expansions.
   - **Dynamic Planning:** Adapt forward plans based on resource generation patterns and opponents’ actions.

4. **Performance Observed:**
   - Some improvement in average Victory Points (5.8 vs. 4.4 in earlier games).
   - Increased focus on Development Points (Avg 1.8).
   - However, AlphaBetaPlayer continues to outperform across settlements (1.8 vs. 1.4), cities (3.2 vs. 0.8), and roads (1.0 vs. 0.0).

5. **Remaining Challenges:**
   - The prompt still struggles to guide the LLM in optimizing mid-game expansion and efficient road building.
   - Reliance on ports for resource compensation limits proactive decision-making.
   - Largest Army remains underutilized despite updated strategies.
   - Transitioning from resource collection to city/settlement upgrades still lags, leading to slower overall gameplay.

**Sequential Steps:**  
Evolution 0: Basic placement and reasoning.  
Evolution 1: Introduced dynamic planning, resource tracking, and broader strategic planning.  
Evolution 2 (Current): Integrated port advantages, mid-game adjustments, and refined early resource strategies.

### Plan for Improvement:
Based on the analysis of the logs and the current prompt, it's clear that certain aspects of gameplay need further refinement to improve player performance. Key areas to target include:

1. **Underperformance in Early Game Placement Strategy**:
   - Settlement placement strategies need adjustments to prioritize a **strong Ore-Wheat economy** augmented with Brick-Wood for flexibility.
   - Port-based strategies (especially 3:1 ports) should complement, not dominate, settlement placements and road expansions.

2. **Poor Performance in Mid-Game Expansion**:
   - The player needs to ensure consistent resource generation and expansion toward contested/strategic areas.
   - Identify and exploit the highest-value nodes (e.g., intersections with 6 and 8 dice values) consistently.

3. **Overlooked Efficiency in Road-Building**:
   - Road-building needs to coordinate directly with settlement planning rather than being fragmented.
   - Additional emphasis should be on preventing opponent expansions.

4. **Underuse of Knights for Largest Army**:
   - There is hesitation in development card purchases—Knights should be prioritized heavily in games where the opponent is not focused on Largest Army.

5. **Late-Game Acceleration via Cities and Trades**:
   - Transitioning from settlement expansion to city building isn't occurring rapidly enough.
   - Trading strategies, especially with ports, can expedite resource availability for needed upgrades.

---

#### Hypothesis:
1. Enhancing the prompt with **specific conditional steps for every phase of the game** (early, mid, and late) may help the LLM align decisions to win-state goals more effectively.
2. Explicitly reinforcing actions such as **rapid city upgrades**, **Knight accumulation**, and **cautious robber deployment** might improve performance metrics while hindering opponent plans.

I will now refine the prompt based on these insights.

</Document>================================== Ai Message ==================================

#### Insights from Research:
1. **City-First Strategy**:
   - Players relying on the city-plus-army strategy aim to build two cities immediately. This involves strategically placing initial settlements to hog Ore and Wheat resources.
   - Early cities lead to development card accumulation (Knights for Largest Army and Victory Point cards).
   - Road building often relies on Development Cards rather than resource production.

2. **Prioritize Ore-Wheat Nodes**:
   - Choose settlements on Ore-Wheat spots even if initial Brick/Wood placements are weak. Complement with trades or late-game resource balance strategies.
   - Avoid overcommitment to road-building; focus on generating Ore-Wheat and trading away Sheep, Wood, and Brick.

3. **Transitioning from Soldiers to Victory Points**:
   - Development cards (Army focus) should lead the mid-game transition, with attention moving to City upgrades and eventual Victory Points.

4. **Adapt Resource Scarcity**:
   - Encourage trading strategies to compensate for resource shortages, especially for Wood/Brick when focused on cities.

  Args:
    new_text: You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

#### Framework for Dominance:
1. **Step-by-Step Analysis**:
   - Evaluate your resources, opponents' positions, and available actions.
   - Think strategically about the next **3-5 turns** and align every action toward your long-term plan.
2. **Victory Goal**:
   - Your aim is to win by achieving **10 Victory Points** through settlements, cities, development cards, or control over Largest Army/Longest Road.
3. **Action Decision Format**:
   - Choose one action and present it as: \boxed{3}.
4. **Strategic Planning**:
   - Lay out a concise forward-thinking strategy in `<plan>` tags with a focus on achieving specific objectives. Example:
     `<plan>Upgrade settlement at node 8 into a city, build roads towards contested Wheat-Ore hub, prioritize Largest Army</plan>`.

#### Early Game Focus:
1. **Settlement Placement**:
   - Place settlements to maximize Ore and Wheat access, as they are critical for City upgrades and Development Cards.
   - Favor nodes with **high-probability numbers (6, 8, 5)** and intersections providing **resource diversity** (Ore-Wheat-Brick or Ore-Wheat-Wood).
   - Secure proximity to ports (3:1 first, followed by 2:1 for surplus resources).
2. **Road Placement**:
   - Build roads strategically toward uncontested high-value nodes or ports. Extend towards expansion objectives without wasting resources.
   - Avoid blocking, unless denying a crucial intersection from an opponent.

#### Mid-Game Strategy:
1. **City Building and Upgrades**:
   - Immediate upgrades to cities (Ore-Wheat conversion).
   - Target **city building** over additional settlements once key nodes are occupied.
   - Leverage ports to mitigate resource shortages dynamically.
2. **Largest Army Focus**:
   - Prioritize Knight purchases through development cards to secure Largest Army.
   - Use additional cards (Monopoly, Year of Plenty) strategically for city upgrades or resource denial.
3. **Continual Resource Monitoring**:
   - Trade aggressively to balance gaps in Brick/Wood or Ore/Wheat depending on board position.
   - Avoid stagnation; adjust plans if key resources cannot be generated efficiently.

#### Robber and Opponent Control:
1. **Robber Placement**:
   - Target intersections with high Ore/Wheat yields for dominant opponents or competitive nodes.
   - Use the robber proactively to hinder Largest Army challengers or slow expansions.
2. **Diplomacy and Trades**:
   - Offer trades that accelerate your progress while hindering opponents’ key resource collections.

#### Endgame Acceleration:
1. **Victory Point Maximization**:
   - Transition into victory points from Development Cards if Largest Army is achieved.
   - Use Monopoly/Year of Plenty for critical city builds in the final stages.
2. **Road Control when Necessary**:
   - If uncontested, build Road networks to secure Longest Road for additional points as a fallback win condition (but avoid over-investing early game).

The game results show that **PromptRefiningLLMPlayer** is being comprehensively outperformed by AlphaBetaPlayer. A closer look emphasizes significant weaknesses in our player's strategy across all stages of the game:

**Key Observations from Results:**
1. **Victory Points (Avg VP):**
   - **AlphaBetaPlayer:** 10.0
   - **PromptRefiningLLMPlayer:** 3.0
   - PromptRefiningLLMPlayer struggled to compete in victory points, largely due to suboptimal city-building and lack of expansion.

2. **Settlements and Cities:**
   - **AlphaBetaPlayer:** Avg 3.6 Settlements, 2.2 Cities
   - **PromptRefiningLLMPlayer:** Avg 1.6 Settlements, 0.4 Cities
   - Our player is lagging in both early-game settlement placement and mid/late-game city upgrades, resulting in weaker resource generation and lower VP.

3. **Road Building:**
   - PromptRefiningLLMPlayer has an **average road count of 0.0**, indicating a complete failure in road-building strategies. This severely hampers expansion and the possibility of competing for Longest Road.

4. **Largest Army and Development VPs:**
   - Largest Army is absent for our player (Avg 0.0 Army).
   - The development card points (Avg 0.6 VP) suggest some attempt was made toward securing development VP, but the Largest Army pursuit was not aggressive enough.

**Performance Issues by Game Stage:**
- **Early Game:**
  - Initial placement strategy falters in ensuring effective expansion opportunities. Our player fails to access key Ore-Wheat combinations often needed for city-building momentum.
  - Lack of effective road placement prevents board control and expansion to favorable territories.

- **Mid-Game:**
  - Transition from settlements to city upgrades is exceptionally weak. Insufficient production of Ore and Wheat coupled with poor resource trades create bottlenecks.

- **Late Game:**
  - Victory optimization strategies are nearly absent. Our player does not pivot effectively between Largest Army, Longest Road, or alternate VP strategies.

---

### Next Steps:
1. **In-depth Strategic Research:** Investigate best practices for:
   - Road-building strategies to unlock critical intersections.
   - Securing Largest Army through optimized Knight card usage.
   - Early game settlement and city placement with a focus on Ore/Wheat-heavy builds.
   - Transitioning effectively to city upgrades and development cards during the mid-game.

2. **Prompt Refinement:** Target prompt improvements based on findings above, focusing on:
   - Aggressive road placement strategies to enable expansion.
   - Balancing largest army and settlement domination strategies.
   - Strengthening early-game settlement placement priorities.

3. **Test Adjustments:** Test with the new insights and refine further as needed.

Now, let's perform relevant research and refine the current prompt.

    query: best road placement strategies in Catan for expansion================================= Tool Message =================================

<Document href="https://medium.com/@noahmiller400/ultimate-strategy-guide-to-starting-settlements-in-catan-2a55be1819be"/>
As a rule of thumb, during your first settlement placement, it’s usually best not to point your road toward the middle of the board. You will likely have no expansion spots since everyone will start toward the middle, rather than the coast.
Anytime your road is in a contestable direction, make sure you’re the one cutting someone off or are more likely to win the race — not the other way around. [...] Even if it means choosing a slightly worse initial placement, it could be much better being two roads away from the coast if it will gain you access to two hexes with your next settlement.

Especially if the intersection of the two hexes has a port, this is even better.
However, this tactic does come with additional risk that you will be cut off and should only be done if you’re confident that the expansion will be unobstructed.
#10. Will your placement be offensive? [...] It is often best to sacrifice a superior spot in exchange for being able to expand toward a good location that is likely to be open. It is much better to have two decent spots than one that’s amazing.

What may be a poor starting placement (i.e. next to a 2 or 12) will often get left open which could be great for a 3rd or 4th settlement placement.
Keep in mind, the fewer people placing their second settlement after you, the more assurance you will have that you won’t get cut off.

<Document href="https://blog.colonist.io/guide-to-catan-starting-strategies/"/>
The key to effective expansion is the placement of your roads. Always remember to point your roads outwards if you’re planning to employ an expansion strategy.

Oftentimes, if your placement puts both numbers and resources in your favor, you can get away with hunkering down a corner of the map.

That said, making sure you have room to grow is a very wise thought to have, as you might find yourself boxed in if you neglect it during any of your placements. [...] This is where the road placement comes in very handy. Placing your first roads is actually very important, as doing it wrong can set you back a few turns.

Just make sure that your road points to a spot on the map that you can move out to, even if the resource production isn’t high.

A common error to make is pointing the road to a goldmine of resources and numbers, only to have your neighbor place there next turn, making your road a dead end for you. [...] In addition, this would also give you a pretty good idea on how you would want your game to progress.

There are three main strategies you can focus on:

Settlements and Longest Road - Your essential resources would be high amount of Lumber, Brick and some amount of Wool, and Wheat.

Hybrid Expansion  - Occupying as much as you can of the map thereby acquiring more resources. For this strategy you will need to produce a balanced amount of all resources.

The Largest Army is a little more consistent with most players finishing with about 4 Knights. I'd imagine that the cost of building more knights is a big part of this. Compared to roads, knights need more resources, more valuable resources in the end game, and have some randomness in that each dev card is not guaranteed to be a knight.
When to claim longest road/largest army [...] likely to have people trade with you, etc. Either way, we can see that both of these are late-game targets. In general, you should try to claim LR/LA in the last 20% or even 10% of the game. For reference, we know from the first post in this series that the average game lasts ~71 rolls. So you should try to snag either LR/LA with about 7-14 rolls left (~3 more chances to build). [...] We have all been there. You shoot out to an early point lead by claiming the Longest Road only to fail to maintain your lead after wave after wave of being targeted by the robber. Or the happier version, you snag Longest Road or Largest Army right at the end, creating a 2 or 4 point swing to secure your victory. Today, I want to dive into these two bonuses to look at how valuable are they, and when should you be trying to claim them.

- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1). Prioritize settlement placements adjacent to useful ports providing trade flexibility.

Improved Strategies:
1. **Settlement Placement:** At the beginning, prioritize node combinations that maximize Ore and Wheat while offering room for expansion. Focus on port proximity or nodes enabling effective balance of resources like Brick and Lumber.

2. **Road Placement:** Your first road placement should head toward open expansion zones or contested intersections that allow strategic advantage over opponents. Never place roads without clear expansion goals. Defensive placements to block opponents from securing good nodes should be prioritized when feasible.

3. **City Building:** Make city upgrades a priority in the mid-game, especially for nodes producing high Ore/Wheat numbers. City-building enhances resource production and facilitates Development Card acquisition.

4. **Largest Army:** Maintain an aggressive focus on acquiring Development Cards containing Knight cards. Begin playing Knights as soon as possible to pursue Largest Army actively. Knights also serve as tools for protecting your key nodes from robber interference.

5. **Robber Placement:** Use the robber to disrupt opponents’ high-yield hexes to slow their game while protecting your most critical nodes. Robbing opponents ahead in VP or resource generation is crucial.

6. **Resource Management and Trading:** Leverage ports and strategic trades to balance shortages in Brick/Wood during the early game and Ore/Wheat during the mid to late game.

7. **Endgame Acceleration:** Solidify Victory Points through city upgrades, Largest Army, and fallback Longest Road victories. Time your moves to secure bonuses (LR/LA) in the final 10-20% of the game when opponents have limited prevention options.================================= Tool Message =================================

SUMMARY:

1. **Key Insights Learned Throughout All Evolutions:**
   - **PromptRefiningLLMPlayer** has yet to win against AlphaBetaPlayer, consistently struggling with strategic decision-making, road placement, and resource optimization.
   - Persistent weaknesses include poor road-building (Avg 0.0), underuse of settlements/cities (1.4/0.6), lack of Largest Army focus, and mid-game stagnation due to resource imbalance and delayed city upgrades.
   - Resource mismanagement, compounded by ineffective robber placement and poor trading, slows early-to-mid-game transitions.

2. **Prompt Evolution:**
   - **Initial Version:** Focused on simple reasoning, early settlement placement, and resource diversity.
   - **Evolution 1:** Introduced dynamic planning, resource tracking, Ore/Wheat placement prioritization, and better early-to-mid game transitions.
   - **Evolution 2:** Enhanced port strategies, prioritized Largest Army pursuit, refined early city-building strategies, and introduced dynamic resource trading.
   - **Evolution 3 (Current):** Focused on city-first approaches, aggressive Largest Army acquisition, improved road placement for expansion, and targeted robber placement.

3. **Strategies Implemented in Prompt:**
   - **Settlement Placement:** Prioritized high Ore-Wheat nodes, port proximity, and resource diversity.
   - **Road Placement:** Focused on expanding toward key intersections and ports, aiming for controlled and strategic expansions.
   - **City Building:** Emphasized early upgrades at critical nodes for improved resource output.
   - **Dynamic Resource Management:** Leveraged trades and ports to mitigate shortages, balancing early-game Brick/Wood needs with late-game Ore/Wheat demands.
   - **Development Cards:** Enhanced focus on Knights for Largest Army while using Monopoly and Year of Plenty for recovery and tactical gains.
   - **Robber Placement:** Targeted opponents’ critical nodes strategically, aiming to disrupt resource dominance.
   - **Endgame Acceleration:** Pursued victory points through cities, development cards, and fallback Longest Road strategies. Largest Army remains the primary mid-to-late game focus.

4. **Performance Observed:**
   - Average Victory Points have fluctuated (5.8 in Evolution 1, 3.8 in Evolution 2, and 3.0 in Evolution 3), reflecting adjustments to strategic focus and ongoing testing.
   - Incremental improvements in Largest Army pursuit (Avg 0.6 Dev VP) but continued weaknesses in road-building (Avg 0.0) and expansion-related VP contributions.
   - AlphaBetaPlayer continues to outperform in settlements (3.6 vs. 1.6), cities (2.2 vs. 0.4), and roads (1.0 vs. 0.0).

5. **Remaining Challenges:**
   - **Mid-Game Stagnation:** Weak transition from settlement expansion to resource-efficient city-building.
   - **Ineffective Road Placement:** Lack of expansion momentum and failure to compete for Longest Road.
   - **Largest Army Pursuit:** Needs more aggressive Knight card play and consistent Development Card acquisition.
   - **Late-Game Acceleration:** Inefficiency in securing victory points in the final stages, including better timing for Largest Army or Longest Road.

**Sequential Steps:**  
Evolution 0: Basic placement and reasoning.  
Evolution 1: Dynamic planning and resource tracking (Ore/Wheat prioritization).  
Evolution 2: Port-focused strategies, refined city upgrades, and Largest Army integration.  
Evolution 3 (Current): Aggressive city-first strategies, road-building improvements, and deeper dynamic planning around robber use.

}================================== Ai Message ==================================

From the game results and performance insights, it's clear that while we have made some incremental improvements in Largest Army pursuit (reflected in Development Card VP increases), critical gaps remain:

1. **Lack of Settlements (Avg 0.8):** An extremely low average reinforces that early-game settlement placement strategies are ineffective or being countered. This must be fundamentally reworked to prioritize viable nodes with a balance of diversity and production.
   
2. **Poor Road Placement (Avg 0.2):** Strategically ineffective road construction hampers the player's ability to expand settlements and potentially compete for Longest Road. Focus must shift to purposeful road-building aligned with future settlement/city plans.
   
3. **Resource Management:** Mid-game stagnation highlights resource mismanagement—particularly in balancing early-game (Wood/Brick for roads/settlements) and late-game (Ore/Wheat for cities) transitions.

4. **Largest Army and Development Cards:** While there is improvement in Development Card VP, a lack of consistent Knight play (Avg Army 0.4) shows room for more directed focus on leveraging Knights aggressively for Largest Army.

5. **Reactive Strategies:** Robber placement and dynamic trading haven't created sufficient disruption for AlphaBetaPlayer's advantage or sustained benefits to our player.

### Next Steps and Planned Prompt Enhancements

**Objectives:**
- Improve **Settlement Placement** to secure strong production probabilities early while aligning road-building for potential expansions.
- Refine **Road Placement** to strategically enable expansions and improve competition for Longest Road (a crucial fallback strategy).
- Address resources by integrating **Dynamic Trading Tactics** (especially with ports) and adopting more **efficient resource prioritization.**
- Maximize Development Card benefits with enhanced focus on Knights for Largest Army while maintaining tactical use of Monopoly and Year of Plenty.
- Strengthen **Robber Utility**—targeting AlphaBetaPlayer's critical production nodes while creating disruption at opportune moments.

Next, I will research refined strategies for Settlements, Roads, and transitioning resources effectively into mid-game and late-game.

Name: web_search_tool_call

<Document href="https://blog.colonist.io/guide-to-catan-starting-strategies/"/>
In addition, this would also give you a pretty good idea on how you would want your game to progress.

There are three main strategies you can focus on:

Settlements and Longest Road - Your essential resources would be high amount of Lumber, Brick and some amount of Wool, and Wheat.

Hybrid Expansion  - Occupying as much as you can of the map thereby acquiring more resources. For this strategy you will need to produce a balanced amount of all resources. [...] The key to effective expansion is the placement of your roads. Always remember to point your roads outwards if you’re planning to employ an expansion strategy.

Oftentimes, if your placement puts both numbers and resources in your favor, you can get away with hunkering down a corner of the map.

That said, making sure you have room to grow is a very wise thought to have, as you might find yourself boxed in if you neglect it during any of your placements. [...] 3. Scarcity - Monopolizing Resources

While placing the first settlement. Going for scarcity is usually a good option. This means that if there isn’t much of a certain resource and you can monopolize that resource do it.

Trading that resource to others will be a piece of cake since they will not be able to obtain that resource easily with other methods.

4. Observe Thy Neighbor

<Document href="https://medium.com/@noahmiller400/ultimate-strategy-guide-to-starting-settlements-in-catan-2a55be1819be"/>
As a rule of thumb, during your first settlement placement, it’s usually best not to point your road toward the middle of the board. You will likely have no expansion spots since everyone will start toward the middle, rather than the coast.
Anytime your road is in a contestable direction, make sure you’re the one cutting someone off or are more likely to win the race — not the other way around. [...] Think of a Catan map as having 3 areas — the center, inner, and coastal rings. The “center” is all the spots around the middle hex, “inner” is the next one outward, and so on.
For starters, the coast never makes sense for your first placement as it will only have 2 hexes of production (3 for you to build more central) and it will inhibit your optionality to expand. [...] It is often best to sacrifice a superior spot in exchange for being able to expand toward a good location that is likely to be open. It is much better to have two decent spots than one that’s amazing.

What may be a poor starting placement (i.e. next to a 2 or 12) will often get left open which could be great for a 3rd or 4th settlement placement.
Keep in mind, the fewer people placing their second settlement after you, the more assurance you will have that you won’t get cut off.

Trades: If you find yourself considering this strategy, try to skyrocket the value of your dominant resource by occupying most of its production on board. And use this monopoly to get good trades.
Expansion: Keep a decent scope of expansion as having you cannot rely on port to drag you on for the whole game, you need to have production on most resources eventually.

Name: web_search_tool_call

<Document href="https://www.instructables.com/Catan-strategy-guide/"/>
This strategy focuses on sprawling across the board, building a long road and settlements along it. Players who like this strategy look for lots of wood and brick in their initial placements. A typical winning combination will involve 2 cities, 4 settlements and longest road. This strategy looks stronger than it is, because it typically lets you race to 7 points (5 settlements + longest road) but stalls catastrophically in the end game when you desperately need ore and everyone is pounding you [...] This strategy aims to collect more resources than anyone else, and use the sheer weight of production volume to overwhelm your competitors. It makes no special attempt at either Longest Road or Largest Army until a powerful engine based on 6-8 points of cities and settlements is in place, at which point resources are rolling in at a furious pace and you coast to victory. However, it is likely the more focused strategies will shut you out of both of the bonus cards unless you are really crushing [...] Obvious leads make you a target. Longest Road in particular should be picked up as late as possible. Joining up two separate road segments with a big road-building push and unveiling 2 victory point cards can give you the win from 6 points. Largest Army on the other hand needs to be more openly competed for, because of the play-only-one-development-card-per-turn rule. Victory point cards are great to have because they create uncertainty in your opponents (is it a VP or a monopoly card?).

Focusing on gaining wood and brick will allow you to expand your road system.  Build five contiguous road segments and you claim the Longest Road tile and the two Victory Points that come along with it. [...] One of my regular gaming friends likes to go after the Longest Road.  I decided to try and follow this idea and focused solely on the two things necessary for roads: brick and wood.  I soon learned that while the Longest Road is helpful, my approach to placing those first Settlements needed to be better balanced.

Do:- everything you can to get your first city. Liberally trade away sheep/brick/wood to do so. - encourage other players to compete for longest road.- make sure you leave at least one spot open for building a settlement. It is possible to win with 2 cities, largest army and 4 victory point cards, but you'd have to play well and get very lucky.- not get distracted by all that road- and settlement-building. Get those cities out.- hog the ore. Your strategy relies on you having the cities, and [...] Do:- start road, settlement, road, settlement. One of the settlements should be a port, ideally 3:1. These 4 settlements will be your engine of production. Now look to upgrade to cities (unless hand management and/or other opportunities dictate otherwise). Upgrade to cities before building settlements IF your settlement locations are secure.- It's often easier for the Producer to steal the Longest Road from the Explorer than it is to steal the Largest Army from the Commander or Developer.- win [...] Do:- keep your options open. This strategy and the Commander are only subtly different, and if you have 3 ore, 2 wheat and 2 sheep early, you might just want to build that city instead of buying two development cards.- secure about same amount of ore as wheat, and 2/3 of this amount of sheep. You really don’t need any brick or wood to speak of when playing this strategy - you'll get all you need from development cards and robbing other players.

This is about speed and map control. You get wood and brick early, expand fast, grab key settlement locations, and go for Longest Road. Itâs great for disrupting others but struggles late-game without access to ore for cities.

Combining the insights from the game logs and strategy research, I will enhance the prompt focusing on addressing settlement placement weaknesses, road-building inefficiencies, and mid-game resource stagnation. Let’s integrate the following improvements into the new prompt:

---

### Key Additions to the Prompt:

#### **Settlement Placement and Expansion Strategy**
1. Prioritize initial settlement placement on nodes with balanced resource diversity **(Ore/Wheat focus for cities, Wood/Brick for roads)** while ensuring growth potential (expandable spots near ports or viable intersections).
2. Focus on leveraging nodes with **high probability numbers (6/8/9)** while balancing essential complementary resources.
3. Avoid settling near the board's center unless advantageous. Roads should extend outward to ensure room for expansion to avoid being boxed in.

#### **Road Placement and Expansion**
1. Build roads with clear objectives: reaching high-value intersections, settlement spots, or ports. Roads should lead to **contestable nearby spots** rather than centrally congested areas.
2. Early-game Wood and Brick should focus on **efficient road chains**, enabling both Longest Road competition and strategic settlement placements.

#### **Mid-to-Late Game Resource Transition**
1. Liberally trade away early-game resources like **Sheep, Brick, and Wood** to prioritize obtaining Ore and Wheat for city upgrades as the game's tempo accelerates.
2. Once roads and settlements establish a **production engine**, transition to upgrading 2–3 settlements into cities as fast as possible. Maintain port utility.

#### **Dynamic Trading Tactics**
1. Always aim to monopolize scarce resources. If opponents lack Brick/Ore, use trades to maximize long-term resource supply while controlling their production bottlenecks.
2. Utilize ports and dynamic trades to rebalance resources frequently—especially in cases of shortages and robber setbacks.

#### **Robber Placement**
1. Target strong-resource nodes of AlphaBetaPlayer strategically, especially Ore/Wheat clusters that disrupt their city advancement.
2. Shift the robber away from nodes critical to our player’s own production before launching an aggressive round of expansion or card play.

#### **Development Cards and Largest Army**
1. Invest heavily in Development Cards, focusing on **Knights for Largest Army** early to mid-game.
2. Use Monopoly and Year of Plenty strategically in mid-to-late game recovery scenarios (e.g., when resources are unevenly distributed).
3. Save Victory Point cards for endgame while leveraging uncertainty to keep opponents unaware of final hand possibilities.

#### **Victory Point Optimization**
1. Mid-to-late game should diversify VP paths: cities, Development Cards (**Largest Army**), and fallback Longest Road strategies. Utilize simultaneous approaches rather than being overly reliant on one tactic.
2. Aim for an adaptive strategy: exploit largest road setups in the endgame opportunistically while positioning cities and settlements as production focal points.

Strategic Guidelines:

1. **Settlement Placement:**
   - Prioritize initial settlements on nodes with balanced resource diversity (Ore/Wheat focus for cities, Wood/Brick for roads).
   - Target nodes with high-probability numbers (6/8/9) while ensuring room for expansion (toward ports/intersections).
   - Avoid central placements unless highly advantageous; expand outward to avoid being boxed in.

2. **Road Placement:**
   - Build roads toward high-value expansions: settlements, ports, or intersections.
   - Prioritize Wood and Brick for efficient road chains, enabling both strategic settlement placements and Longest Road competition.

3. **Mid-to-Late Game Resource Transition:**
   - Liberally trade early-game resources like Sheep/Brick/Wood to secure Ore/Wheat for cities.
   - Use road and settlement expansion to establish a resource-production engine. Prioritize upgrading settlements to cities once production stabilizes.

4. **Dynamic Trading:**
   - Monopolize scarce resources when possible. Diplomatically increase trade value for resources opponents lack.
   - Utilize ports frequently to optimize resource balance and mitigate shortages.

5. **Robber Placement:**
   - Target opponents' key nodes and disrupt their resource flow—particularly Ore/Wheat clusters.
   - Avoid blocking yourself; shift the robber away from critical production nodes for strategic recovery.

6. **Development Cards:**
   - Focus on Knights to aggressively secure Largest Army.
   - Use Monopoly and Year of Plenty tactically to recover resources and disrupt opponents.
   - Save Victory Point Development Cards for late-game surprise advantage.

7. **Victory Point Optimization:**
   - Diversify VP strategies mid-to-late game: cities, Development Cards, Largest Army, and Longest Road.
   - Opportunistically secure Longest Road late game through efficient road-building strategies and connect segments at critical moments.
   - Combine proactive and reactive moves to maximize VP accumulation.

SUMMARY:

1. **Key Insights Learned Throughout All Evolutions:**
   - **PromptRefiningLLMPlayer** remains unable to win against AlphaBetaPlayer, consistently struggling with settlement expansion, road-building, and effective resource transitions.
   - Persistent weaknesses include low settlement (Avg 0.8) and road-building (Avg 0.2) contributions, mid-game stagnation due to resource mismanagement, and underperformance in Largest Army pursuit.
   - Late-game inefficiency in securing diversified victory points, coupled with suboptimal robber placement and reactive trading, limits momentum.

2. **Prompt Evolution:**
   - **Initial Version:** Focused on simple reasoning and basic resource diversity for early settlement placement.
   - **Evolution 1:** Introduced dynamic planning, resource tracking, Ore/Wheat prioritization, and improved early-to-mid game transitions.
   - **Evolution 2:** Enhanced port usage, introduced Largest Army focus, refined city-building strategies, and reactive trading.
   - **Evolution 3:** Prioritized city-first strategies, improved robber tactics, and emphasized road-building for strategic expansion.
   - **Evolution 4 (Current):** Integrated advanced settlement placement based on resource probability and expansion potential, optimized roads for Longest Road and future settlements, and established dynamic resource trading for mid-to-late game transitions.

3. **Strategies Implemented in Prompt:**
   - **Settlement Placement:** Targets high-probability nodes (6/8/9), prioritizes Ore-Wheat and expansion potential while maintaining resource diversity.
   - **Road Placement:** Strategically builds toward intersections, ports, and contestable nodes while enabling Longest Road as a fallback.
   - **City Building:** Transitions settlements into cities early to stabilize resource production and accelerate mid-game development.
   - **Dynamic Resource Management:** Trades early-game resources (Wood/Brick) for city-critical resources (Ore/Wheat) mid-game. Ports are regularly leveraged.
   - **Development Cards:** Aggressively secures Knights for Largest Army and tactically utilizes Monopoly/Year of Plenty for resource recovery.
   - **Robber Placement:** Focuses on disrupting opponents' key production nodes while minimizing self-disruption.
   - **Victory Point Focus:** Diversifies strategies across cities, Development Cards, Largest Army, and opportunistic Longest Road expansions.

4. **Performance Observed:**
   - Victory Points remain stalled (Avg 6.2), with incremental improvements in Development Card VP (1.4) and Largest Army pursuit (Avg Army 0.4).
   - Resource trades and robber placement show some refinement but require better timing and execution.
   - AlphaBetaPlayer continues to dominate in resource balancing and settlement/city-building (4.0 settlements vs. 0.8; 2.2 cities vs. 1.4).

5. **Remaining Challenges:**
   - **Road Building (Avg 0.2):** Expansion momentum is too weak to capitalize on Longest Road or enable settlement growth.
   - **Largest Army:** Knight plays remain inconsistent and insufficiently aggressive to compete for Largest Army.
   - **Mid-Game Stagnation:** Ineffective transition strategies between early settlement expansion and late-game city infrastructure.
   - **Final Scoring:** Inefficiency in converting resources and actions into endgame victory points remains a critical weakness.

**Sequential Steps:**
Evolution 0: Basic placement and reasoning.  
Evolution 1: Dynamic planning and resource tracking (Ore/Wheat prioritization).  
Evolution 2: Port strategies, Largest Army pursuit, refined city upgrades.  
Evolution 3: City-first strategies, road placement for expansion, improved robber use.  
Evolution 4 (Current): Strategic settlement placement, efficient road-building, dynamic resource trading for mid-to-late game gains.

}================================== Ai Message ==================================

The latest game results reveal persistent weaknesses in road building, settlement expansion, and mid-game resource optimization. The **PromptRefiningLLMPlayer** secured only 1 win and had an average VP of 5.4 compared to **AlphaBetaPlayer's** 9.6. Notable deficiencies include:

1. **Road Building (AVG Roads: 0.0):** The player is failing to expand via roads, a critical limitation that stifles settlement growth and Longest Road potential.
2. **Settlement Placement (AVG Settlements: 1.6 vs. 3.0):** Limited settlement expansion is reducing resource access, hindering mid-to-late game transitions.
3. **Mid-Game Resource Stagnation:** While city-building has seen marginal improvement, it remains inadequate to stabilize resource production.
4. **Largest Army (AVG Army: 0.2):** Ineffective knight usage remains a key bottleneck, with no credible competition for Largest Army.
5. **Trade Execution:** Dynamic trades have not been leveraged optimally to address early-game resource gaps, especially for Ore and Wheat.

These statistics underscore the need for further optimization in several focus areas. I'll now perform a more detailed analysis and propose targeted improvements. Let me start by analyzing the performance history in detail and gathering insights into the weaknesses exhibited in the recent games.

Road Building: try to play this when you have a settlement ready to go at the end of it. A favorite hand of mine is 2W, 2B, 1Wh, 1S and a RB card - building 3 roads then plopping a settlement on the end is a great surprise way to destroy another player's carefully laid plans for expansion. [...] Do:- everything you can to get your first city. Liberally trade away sheep/brick/wood to do so. - encourage other players to compete for longest road.- make sure you leave at least one spot open for building a settlement. It is possible to win with 2 cities, largest army and 4 victory point cards, but you'd have to play well and get very lucky.- not get distracted by all that road- and settlement-building. Get those cities out.- hog the ore. Your strategy relies on you having the cities, and [...] - trade before you build. If you need wood for a road and sheep for a settlement, trade for both before placing the road - your opponents may be less inclined to trade you that sheep when they see where you're going to put the settlement!

As a rule of thumb, during your first settlement placement, it’s usually best not to point your road toward the middle of the board. You will likely have no expansion spots since everyone will start toward the middle, rather than the coast.
Anytime your road is in a contestable direction, make sure you’re the one cutting someone off or are more likely to win the race — not the other way around.

The research surfaced critical strategies that could immediately address existing deficiencies in our gameplay regarding **road building**, **settlement expansion**, and **mid-to-late game momentum**:

### Key Strategies from Research:
1. **Road and Settlement Expansion:**
   - Prioritize **road placement** leading to viable uncontested settlement spots or ports, ensuring that the road supports settlement building directly. Avoid pointing roads toward congested areas unless you are confident in cutting off other players.
   - Emphasize **quick road-and-settlement combos**: aim to optimize resources that allow simultaneously building roads and settlements to clinch strategic locations abruptly.

2. **Dynamic Resource Transitions:**
   - Early-game strategy should focus on **diverse resources** (Wood, Brick, Wheat, Ore) to support road and settlement expansion while keeping ports in view for trading flexibility.
   - Trade aggressively early for cities to then stabilize mid-game resource acquisition through city production.

3. **Hybrid Strategy (Ore/Wheat with Limited Road Building Option):**
   - Incorporate strong **Ore-Wheat-Sheep (OWS)** placements for city-building while retaining moderate access to Wood and Brick for roads. This balance ensures a mid-game transition to strategic expansions for additional settlements, cities, or ports.

4. **Largest Army and Robber Placement:**
   - Invest in early **Knights** with development cards to solidify Largest Army ambitions while using robbers tactically to disrupt top competitors' resource generation.

5. **Targeted Robber Placement**:
   - Always prioritize hexes of high probability (e.g., 6/8/9) owned by dominant players. Avoid self-harm when robbing, and focus on limiting opponents' key resources such as Ore or Wheat.

Given these insights and previous performance deficiencies, I will enhance and refine the current prompt.

You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN. That means 10 victory points.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>
6. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively
7. Think about the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action

7. Think about the next 2-3 turns strategically, not just the immediate action.
8. Always weigh opportunity costs and consider endgame strategies.

Enhanced Strategy:
- **Settlement Placement:** Prioritize high-probability nodes (6/8/9) with expansion potential. Avoid congested middle spots unless ensuring dominance. Expand toward ports and viable spots for additional settlements. Maintain Ore-Wheat-Sheep (OWS) setups with modicum access to Wood and Brick to enable hybrid strategies.

- **Road Placement:** Strategically build roads toward settlement nodes or key ports, leaving little room for competitors to contest or block expansions. Execute quick road-and-settlement combinations deliberately. Build toward ports to enable resource flexibility mid- and late-game. Use roads tactically for Longest Road as a fallback.

- **Dynamic Resource Trading:** Aggressively trade resources to optimize city-building early (Ore/Wheat priority) and transition effectively into mid-game expansions. Make calculated trades prior to constructing roads or buildings to prepare opponents tactically. Use ports regularly to enhance specialized trades.

- **Development Cards Usage:** Invest early in Knights for Largest Army ambitions. Utilize Monopoly or Year of Plenty strategically for sudden expansions or city-building momentum. Keep Victory Point cards concealed until necessary.

- **Robber Placement:** Focus robber deployment on high-frequency hexes (6/8/9) owned by top competitors, targeting critical resources such as Ore or Wheat. Avoid self-harm and leverage placement tactically based on situational analysis.

- **Victory Point Optimization:** Balance cities, Development Cards, Largest Army, and opportunistic Longest Road expansions to ensure all avenues for reaching 10 victory points are pursued effectively.

- **Mid-to-Late Game Momentum:** Stabilize Ore-Wheat-Sheep production through cities early, then actively seek settlement expansions and port upgrades for diversified resource collection and trade flexibility.

The prompt has been updated with strategies addressing weaknesses in road placement, settlement placement, resource trading effectiveness, and mid-to-late game transitions. By incorporating researched strategies, the player should now prioritize tactical road expansion, settlement growth, and dynamic resource optimization, alongside Largest Army ambitions.

Testing can now proceed to evaluate the impact of these changes.Evolve Counter: -1
