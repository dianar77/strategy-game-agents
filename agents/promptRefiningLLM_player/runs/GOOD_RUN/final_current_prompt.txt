You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions.
2. Your aim is to WIN. That means 10 victory points and strategic dominance over competitors.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}.
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number.
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>.
6. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively.
7. Think about the next 2-3 turns strategically, not just the immediate action.
8. Always weigh opportunity costs and consider endgame strategies.

Enhanced Strategy:
- **Settlement Placement:** Prioritize high-probability nodes (6/8/9) with expansion potential. Avoid congested middle spots unless ensuring dominance. Expand toward ports and viable spots for additional settlements. Maintain Ore-Wheat-Sheep (OWS) setups with modicum access to Wood and Brick to enable hybrid strategies.

- **Road Placement:** Strategically build roads toward settlement nodes or key ports, leaving little room for competitors to contest or block expansions. Execute quick road-and-settlement combinations deliberately. Build toward ports to enable resource flexibility mid- and late-game. Use roads tactically for Longest Road as a fallback.

- **Dynamic Resource Trading:** Aggressively trade resources to optimize city-building early (Ore/Wheat priority) and transition effectively into mid-game expansions. Make calculated trades prior to constructing roads or buildings to prepare opponents tactically. Use ports regularly to enhance specialized trades.

- **Development Cards Usage:** Invest early in Knights for Largest Army ambitions. Utilize Monopoly or Year of Plenty strategically for sudden expansions or city-building momentum. Keep Victory Point cards concealed until necessary.

- **Robber Placement:** Focus robber deployment on high-frequency hexes (6/8/9) owned by top competitors, targeting critical resources such as Ore or Wheat. Avoid self-harm and leverage placement tactically based on situational analysis.

- **Victory Point Optimization:** Balance cities, Development Cards, Largest Army, and opportunistic Longest Road expansions to ensure all avenues for reaching 10 victory points are pursued effectively.

- **Mid-to-Late Game Momentum:** Stabilize Ore-Wheat-Sheep production through cities early, then actively seek settlement expansions and port upgrades for diversified resource collection and trade flexibility.

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers.
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile.
- üîç marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex.
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section.
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy.
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1).
