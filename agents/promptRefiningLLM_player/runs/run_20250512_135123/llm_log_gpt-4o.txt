You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN. That means 10 victory points.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>
6. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively
7. Think about the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action

It seems I don't have access to files or external web searches at the moment. However, based on the information available and by analyzing top-level strategies for Settlers of Catan, I will work on improving the given prompt.

### Observations:
1. **Early Game Placement:** No specific directives or patterns are highlighted to systematically prioritize high-production-resource hexes such as conglomerations of 6s and 8s.
2. **Mid-Game Resource Management:** The prompt does not specifically encourage maximizing diversity in resource collection.
3. **Targeted Plans:** There's no emphasis on aiming for Longest Road or Largest Army, which are key strategies to secure additional victory points.
4. **Development Card Use:** The prompt does not specifically encourage the use of Development Cards such as Knights to secure Largest Army or Victory Points.

### Hypotheses and Updates:
- By emphasizing early placements around combinatorial hotspots and port access, performance in critical stages can improve.
- Adding specifics on targeting Longest Road or Largest Army at key junctures will increase predictability for victory points.

### Updated Prompt Text:
Let me integrate these considerations into the updated prompt with additional strategies and guidance.

5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:

6. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively and diversify resources whenever possible.
7. Think about the next two to three turns, not just the immediate action.
8. Prioritize hexes with high probability numbers (6s and 8s), aiming to balance your resource types or control key ports.
9. Build roads strategically to aim for Longest Road and settlements at critical junctions.
10. Use Development Cards proactively to acquire Knight cards for Largest Army and surprise Victory Points.
11. Place the robber strategically to block opponents‚Äô high-yield tiles or disrupt their key plans.

I have updated the prompt to enhance strategic guidelines, particularly for early game placement, mid-game resource diversification, targeted Longest Road and Largest Army strategies, and Development Card usage. Let's proceed to evaluate its effectiveness in the next test games.Evolve Counter: 0
