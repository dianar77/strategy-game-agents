It looks like our player, a RandomPlayer as the BLUE player, lost the game to AlphaBetaPlayer (RED), scoring only 2 victory points. This is a significant gap, indicating that our agent is performing quite poorly. The primary objective now is to identify specific areas where our player's strategy failed and implement improvements.

### Observations from the Game:
1. **Victory Points**: Our agent scored only 2 victory points, far from the required 10 points to win, while the opponent reached 5 victory points.
2. **Development**: Our agent failed to make significant progress in terms of cities, roads, or the largest army bonus. There are likely issues in terms of resource allocation and prioritization.

### Plan to Improve the Prompt:
To refine the performance, I will:
1. Research early game placement strategies, as this is foundational to setting up resource generation and expansion. 
2. Investigate effective resource optimization and trading strategies, which might explain the lack of development in roads, cities, and victory points.
3. Explore robber placement strategies, to hinder the AlphaBetaPlayer's momentum.

I will first analyze the existing prompt to identify gaps and then integrate solutions targeting the weaknesses revealed in this game.

Let me begin by reading the current prompt.

You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN. That means 10 victory points.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>
6. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively
7. Think about the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action

- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)================================== Ai Message ==================================

The current prompt provides a solid foundation for analyzing the game state, focusing on resource gathering, planning for future moves, and strategic actions to maximize victory points. However, certain aspects need to be improved to address identified weaknesses from the game results. I will focus on targeted enhancements in:

1. **Early Game Placement Strategy**: This is critical for resource generation and long-term development.
2. **Resource Optimization and Mid-Game Planning**: Addressing the lack of roads, settlements, and cities.
3. **Robber Placement Strategy**: Ensuring the opponent's growth is stifled by strategic robber placement.

Let me start by researching effective early-game placement strategies to anchor improvements in our player's opening moves. This is essential since poor initial placement could have led to low resource output and subsequent failures.

It seems I can't currently perform online searches to gather information on early-game strategies. Instead, I will rely on my own knowledge about Settlers of Catan strategies to construct a better prompt.

### Early Game Placement Strategy
A strong opening involves placing settlements on hexes that balance resource variety and frequency (based on dice roll probabilities). Players should prioritize:
- Access to brick and wood for early road building.
- Access to ore and wheat for cities and development cards.
- A high probability sum for starting settlements (e.g., 8 and 6 on primary resources).

### Resource Optimization & Trading
Mid-game strategies should enhance versatility through trading or securing port access. Resources such as wheat and ore gain importance for city upgrades.

### Robber Placement
The robber is a critical tool for disrupting the leading player's production. It should be used strategically to restrict their access to essential resources, especially ore and wheat.

Next, I will edit the prompt to include these strategies explicitly.

7. Think about the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action

Strategy Enhancements:

Early Game Placement:
- Place your initial settlements on hexes with high resource probability numbers (especially 6 and 8).
- Ensure access to a variety of resources (brick, wood, wheat, and ore). Having brick and wood early on is crucial for road building.
- Prioritize positions near ports to facilitate efficient trading later in the game.

Mid-Game Resource Optimization:
- Monitor the resources you are lacking and trade strategically to acquire them. Use ports if you have access.
- Shift focus to collecting wheat and ore for city upgrades and development cards as the game progresses.

Robber Placement Strategy:
- Target the opponent's key resource hexes, particularly those producing wheat and ore, to hinder their development.
- Consider blocking hexes with high production probabilities (e.g., with dice values 6 or 8) that are crucial for the opponent.

Victory Point Optimization:
- Aim to build at least one city and several settlements, balancing road building for expansion with upgrading settlements to cities.
- Invest in development cards strategically, aiming for key cards like "Largest Army" or victory points.

The results indicate that our player, RandomPlayer (BLUE), lost significantly against AlphaBetaPlayer (RED). The primary concerns are:

1. **Low Victory Points**: The RandomPlayer scored only 2 points compared to AlphaBetaPlayer's 5 points.
2. **Ineffective Resource Management**: Likely suboptimal placements, resource usage, or lack of focus on critical tasks like building settlements, roads, or cities.
3. **No Development Card Usage**: No development cards or army utilization by RandomPlayer, suggesting poor strategic planning to acquire or use these resources.
4. **Robber and Trading Neglect**: Both robber placements and trading strategies appear neglected, as there were no disruptions to AlphaBetaPlayer’s resource pool.

Given these gaps, I'll focus on researching and updating the prompt in areas requiring improvement (early placement, resource management, and other mid-to-late game strategies). First, I'll read the current prompt for context.

You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN. That means 10 victory points.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>
6. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively
7. Think about the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)================================== Ai Message ==================================

The current prompt provides basic instructions for interpreting the game state and decision-making, but it lacks detailed guidance for specific strategies, especially in the following critical areas:

1. **Early Game Placement**: No explicit guidance on prioritizing high-production value nodes or diversity of resources.
2. **Resource Management**: Limited focus on balancing resources or leveraging ports effectively.
3. **Development Cards**: No instruction on when or why to target development card acquisition.
4. **Robber and Trading Strategies**: Absence of strategic considerations for robber placement or effective trading.

I'll start by conducting research into these specific gameplay strategies to improve the prompt.

It seems I cannot access external resources for research at the moment. I will instead use general principles of Settlers of Catan strategy, combined with our observations from the game results, to improve the prompt.

Here’s the targeted improvement plan:

**Early Game Placement Strategy**:
- Focus on high dice probability numbers (6 or 8), especially with resource diversity (wood, brick, wheat).
- Prioritize locations with connectivity to multiple resource types and proximity to ports.

**Mid-Game Resource Management**:
- Build roads effectively toward ports for trading advantages.
- Balance the production and spending of resources to avoid stagnation.

**Development Card Usage**:
- Plan for strategic acquisition of development cards, focusing on knights for Largest Army and Victory Points cards.

**Robber Placement Strategy**:
- Use the robber to hinder opponents by blocking high-production tiles key to their progress.

**Trading Strategy**:
- Initiate trades to overcome resource shortages and monopolize critical resources for win conditions.

I’ll incorporate these strategies into the prompt to address all observed weaknesses.

7. Think about the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action.

Strategies to Win:

Early Game Placement:
- Prioritize settlement locations on high-dice probability numbers (6 and 8) to maximize resource production.
- Ensure diversity in resources (brick, wood, wheat, ore, sheep) for balanced progression.
- Look for locations with connectivity to multiple resource tiles and proximity to ports.

Mid-Game Resource Management:
- Use roads to connect to ports for efficient trading opportunities.
- If resource production is imbalanced, actively trade or build toward resources you lack.
- Construct settlements on resource-rich locations whenever possible, upgrading them to cities once resources allow.

Development Cards:
- Target development cards for both Largest Army (using knight cards) and potential Victory Point cards.
- Stockpile knights strategically to control the robber and maintain flexibility.

Robber Placement:
- Block high-production tiles of opponents, especially ones producing critical resources they need.
- Be cautious and retaliatory when selecting robber placements to discourage aggressive play against you.

Trading Strategy:
- Initiate trades to compensate for any lack of resources essential to your plans.
- Monopolize and hoard critical resources (e.g., brick and wood in the early game).

Focus on executing these strategies while considering future turns and adapting to opponents’ moves. Ensure a balance of resource production, trading, and proactive development for late-game victory point optimization.================================= Tool Message =================================
