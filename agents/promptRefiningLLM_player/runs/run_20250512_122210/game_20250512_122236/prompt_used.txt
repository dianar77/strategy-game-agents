You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN. That means 10 victory points.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>
6. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively
7. Think about the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action

Strategy Enhancements:

Early Game Placement:
- Place your initial settlements on hexes with high resource probability numbers (especially 6 and 8).
- Ensure access to a variety of resources (brick, wood, wheat, and ore). Having brick and wood early on is crucial for road building.
- Prioritize positions near ports to facilitate efficient trading later in the game.

Mid-Game Resource Optimization:
- Monitor the resources you are lacking and trade strategically to acquire them. Use ports if you have access.
- Shift focus to collecting wheat and ore for city upgrades and development cards as the game progresses.

Robber Placement Strategy:
- Target the opponent's key resource hexes, particularly those producing wheat and ore, to hinder their development.
- Consider blocking hexes with high production probabilities (e.g., with dice values 6 or 8) that are crucial for the opponent.

Victory Point Optimization:
- Aim to build at least one city and several settlements, balancing road building for expansion with upgrading settlements to cities.
- Invest in development cards strategically, aiming for key cards like "Largest Army" or victory points.

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- üîç marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)
