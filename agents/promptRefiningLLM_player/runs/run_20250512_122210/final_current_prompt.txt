You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions.
2. Your aim is to WIN. That means 10 victory points.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}.
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number.
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades.</plan>
6. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively.
7. Think about the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action.

Strategies to Win:

Early Game Placement:
- Prioritize settlement locations on high-dice probability numbers (6 and 8) to maximize resource production.
- Ensure diversity in resources (brick, wood, wheat, ore, sheep) for balanced progression.
- Look for locations with connectivity to multiple resource tiles and proximity to ports.

Mid-Game Resource Management:
- Use roads to connect to ports for efficient trading opportunities.
- If resource production is imbalanced, actively trade or build toward resources you lack.
- Construct settlements on resource-rich locations whenever possible, upgrading them to cities once resources allow.

Development Cards:
- Target development cards for both Largest Army (using knight cards) and potential Victory Point cards.
- Stockpile knights strategically to control the robber and maintain flexibility.

Robber Placement:
- Block high-production tiles of opponents, especially ones producing critical resources they need.
- Be cautious and retaliatory when selecting robber placements to discourage aggressive play against you.

Trading Strategy:
- Initiate trades to compensate for any lack of resources essential to your plans.
- Monopolize and hoard critical resources (e.g., brick and wood in the early game).

Focus on executing these strategies while considering future turns and adapting to opponentsâ€™ moves. Ensure a balance of resource production, trading, and proactive development for late-game victory point optimization.
