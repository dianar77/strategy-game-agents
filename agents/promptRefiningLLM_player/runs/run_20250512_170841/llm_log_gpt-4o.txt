You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN. That means 10 victory points.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>
6. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively
7. Think about the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)================================== Ai Message ==================================

### Observations:
From the game results and prompt analysis, there are several areas for improvement:
1. **Early Game Placement Strategy:** The player is not establishing a strong foothold early in the game, as evident from consistently low victory points (avg 2.0 for the player).
2. **Mid-Game Resource Management:** There is no evidence of strategic planning around resource collection or port utilization.
3. **Development Card Usage:** The player is failing to leverage development cards, leaving potential points and strategic advantages untapped.

### Hypothesis for Improvement:
The prompt can provide more specific guidance and focus on:
1. Placing settlements early near high-yield resources (e.g. prioritizing hexes with numbers 6 or 8).
2. Building roads toward ports.
3. Encouraging strategic use of development cards for potential victory points and capabilities (e.g., knights to fight the robber).

### Updated Prompt:
```plaintext
You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, considering all elements: resource yield, connectivity, and threat from opponents.
2. Your aim is to WIN. That means securing 10 victory points as efficiently as possible.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number.
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, do so in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build settlements on high-yield resource nodes (preferably adjacent to hexes with numbers 6 or 8), focus on claiming key ports early through roads, and prioritize city upgrades before late-game development card usage.</plan>
6. Analyze the game state with focus on:
   - The productivity of hexes near your settlements or potential settlement sites.
   - The position of competitors and the availability of resources for critical builds.
   - Opportunities to break opponent's monopolies and prioritize blocking their progress.
7. Prioritize Development Cards at critical points in the game when resource gathering allows it. Use knights strategically to move the robber and block opponent advancements.
8. Always plan for the next 2-3 turns, aiming for maximizing victory point pathways while maintaining flexibility.

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hex tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers.
- High-yield tiles (numbers 6, 8, and sometimes 9) should be prioritized for settlement placement.
- Nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile.
- 🔍 marks the robber location, blocking resource production; plan to move the robber when possible to strategic nodes.
- Port nodes allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1) and should be utilized when lacking critical resources.
```

### Next Steps:
Test this updated prompt and observe how the decisions improve AlphaBetaPlayer's outcomes, focusing on win rates, resource management, and early game placement.Evolve Counter: 0

================================ Human Message =================================

SUMMARY:

1. **Learnings from Game Results:**
   - The player exhibited consistently low performance, only achieving an average of 2.0 victory points per game compared to AlphaBetaPlayer's 5.4.
   - Resource utilization and strategic planning were lacking, resulting in minimal settlement upgrades, city development, and road advancement.
   - Development cards were not utilized effectively, leaving potential victory point gains untapped.
   - The player failed to establish dominance on high-yield resources or ports, critical for resource flow and long-term growth.

2. **Strategies Implemented in the Updated Prompt:**
   - **Early Game Focus:** Place settlements near high-yield resource hexes (preferably numbers like 6 and 8), prioritizing initial control of key resource-producing areas.
   - **Port Utilization:** Build roads toward ports early to enable efficient trading and boost resource flexibility.
   - **City Upgrades:** Shift focus to upgrading settlements into cities for higher resource output before late-game development card usage.
   - **Development Card Utilization:** Encourage strategic usage of knights to move the robber and block opponents, while chasing available victory points.
   - **Long-Term Planning:** Introduce planning for the next 2–3 turns, emphasizing pathways to victory points while maintaining adaptability in the face of opponent threats.

3. **Performance Metrics Observed:**
   - The RandomPlayer remains winless (0 wins across 5 games), highlighting ineffective gameplay strategies.
   - Average turns per game: 40.8, with games lasting around 0.876 seconds each, indicating shorter game durations but weak productivity by the player.
   - No significant improvement observed yet in settlement upgrades, city development, or road building metrics.

Based on the analysis and results, the existing prompt lacks specific guidance on prioritizing early-game placement, resource optimization, and strategic development card usage. To address these issues, I will refine the prompt with several enhancements targeting early and mid-game strategies.

Current observed weakness:
- The player is not dominating critical resource hexes (e.g., 6s and 8s) or gaining access to ports.
- Development cards are underutilized, particularly knights and victory point cards.
- Resource management and optimization across turns lack foresight.
- Road building does not aid in settlement-forging strategies or port acquisition.

Improvements based on this analysis will be incorporated as follows:
1. Prioritize placement near high-frequency resource hexes (6, 8) in the early game.
2. Emphasize connection to ports for resource trading flexibility using targeted road-building strategies.
3. Update the strategic plan to actively monitor collected resources and plan conversions to cities and settlements effectively.
4. Enhance development card usage strategy, especially for knights to block opponents and secure Longest Army.
5. Explicitly promote actions to accumulate victory points alongside blocks or trades that hinder rival players.

  Args:
    new_text: You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions. Consider your resource production, potential trading opportunities, and opponent positioning.
2. Your aim is to WIN. That means using strategic decisions to reach 10 victory points efficiently.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}.
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number.
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Prioritize settlement placement on 6 and 8 hexes, build roads toward the 2:1 ore port, upgrade specific settlements to cities for resource boost, and buy development cards strategically.</plan>
6. Make decisions to collect a mix of resources that supports early game settlement building, mid-game city upgrades, and long-term development card purchases.
7. Block opponents with the robber on high-value hexes they depend on, while prioritizing growth opportunities for your own resource production and path to victory points.
8. Focus on upgrading at least two settlements to cities as early as possible to amplify resource production.
9. Aim for mid and late-game control of Longest Road or Largest Army for bonus points if feasible.

Strategic Priorities in Each Game Phase:
1. Early Game:
- During initial settlement placement, prioritize high-frequency resource hexes (6, 8) and aim for resource diversity (wood, brick, wheat, and ore are critical).
- Prioritize building near ports, especially those offering 2:1 trade ratios for your most abundant resource.

2. Mid Game:
- Build roads that connect current settlements to high-value nodes or ports where new settlements can be established.
- Use resources to upgrade settlements into cities first before investing heavily in development cards, unless blocking an opponent is urgently required.
- Monitor the board for opportunities to disrupt opponent strategies by controlling critical nodes or blocking paths.

3. Late Game:
- Focus on maximizing victory points through strategic settlement building, city upgrades, development card purchases, and road/army bonuses.
- Trade resources efficiently, leveraging port access or trading with opponents only when it significantly benefits your strategy.

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers.
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile.
- [🔍] marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex.
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section.
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road-building strategy.
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1).

Always aim to maintain flexibility in your strategy while focusing on your primary goal: acquiring 10 victory points efficiently.================================= Tool Message =================================
