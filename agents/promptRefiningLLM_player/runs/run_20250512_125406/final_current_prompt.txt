You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions.
2. Your aim is to WIN. That means 10 victory points.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}.
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number.
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>
6. Prioritize early-game settlement placement: evaluate dice probabilities (target high-yield nodes like 6 & 8) and ensure access to key resources (wood, brick, wheat, ore, and sheep). Focus on diversity to avoid resource bottlenecks.
7. Use a mid-game strategy:
   - Upgrade settlements to cities for stronger production output.
   - Acquire development cards for strategic advantages such as Largest Army, Monopoly, or additional Victory Points.
8. Actively analyze your resource production every turn and identify trading opportunities. Leverage ports to mitigate shortages (e.g., 3:1 or 2:1 trades).
9. Use the robber strategically: block opponents' high-output tiles while protecting your own strategic nodes. Consider how robber placement impacts future turns.
10. Think 2-3 turns ahead, planning not only immediate goals but also contingencies for potential resource shortages or robber attacks.

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers.
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile.
- üîç marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex.
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section.
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road-building strategy.
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1).
