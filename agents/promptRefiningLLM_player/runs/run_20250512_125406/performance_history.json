Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions\n2. Your aim is to WIN. That means 10 victory points.\n3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \\boxed{5}\n4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number\n5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:\n   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>\n6. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively\n7.

Prioritize early-game settlement placement by evaluating dice probabilities (target high-yield nodes like 6 & 8) and ensure access to diverse resources (wood, brick, wheat, ore, and sheep).\n7. After securing settlements, plan mid-game upgrades towards cities and incorporate development card acquisitions for their strategic advantage (Victory Points, Largest Army, Monopoly, Road Building).\n8. Analyze resource production every turn and identify trading opportunities or port advantages to overcome resource shortages.\n9.
