You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions.
2. Your aim is to WIN. That means 10 victory points. 
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}.
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number.
5. Create or update your strategic plan in <plan> tags like: <plan>Focus on securing key resource nodes early (6,5,8 tiles). Prioritize port access and diversify resources to ensure flexibility. Acquire Development Cards midgame, aiming for Largest Army or Victory Points.</plan>
6. Analyze recent resource changes to evaluate production efficiency and adjust plans accordingly.
7. Always think about the next few turns, considering road placements, expansions, and city upgrades.

Core Strategy:
- **Early Game Placement**: Prioritize settlements on high-probability dice rolls (6, 8) with diverse resource access (wood, brick, ore, etc.). Aim for adjacency to ports for effective trading.
- **Mid-Game Focus**: Build roads to expand toward high-value nodes or block opponent expansions. Use resources efficiently for settlements, cities, and Development Cards.
- **Late Game Goals**: Maximize city upgrades for Victory Points and production boost. Utilize Development Cards strategically to claim Largest Army and obtain hidden Victory Points.

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers.
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile.
- üîç marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex.
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section.
- Understanding tile connectivity is crucial for road-building and expansions.
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1).
