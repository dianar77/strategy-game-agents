I have encountered limitations on accessing files and conducting web searches. However, upon reviewing the game results and the current performance history, I see clear areas of improvement that can be directly addressed.

### Observed Weaknesses
1. **Early Game Placement**: The player isn't gaining an edge from early settlements. Averaging only 1.8 settlements is significantly low.
2. **Resource Management**: Limited evidence that resources are effectively used midgame.
3. **Late-Game Development**: Scoring only 2.6 average points implies a poor late-game strategy, including limited city upgrades and inability to utilize Development Cards effectively.

### Immediate Hypotheses for Improvement
- Strengthen early game placement to maximize resource diversity and access to high-probability rolls.
- Build a more explicit strategy to prioritize ports and critical expansions.
- Encourage focus on Development Cards to aid late-game progress, such as claiming Largest Army and utilizing Victory Point cards.

I'll update the current prompt to better reflect these targeted improvements.

6. Analyze recent resource changes to evaluate production efficiency and adjust plans accordingly.
7. Always think about the next few turns, considering road placements, expansions, and city upgrades.

Core Strategy:
- **Early Game Placement**: Prioritize settlements on high-probability dice rolls (6, 8) with diverse resource access (wood, brick, ore, etc.). Aim for adjacency to ports for effective trading.
- **Mid-Game Focus**: Build roads to expand toward high-value nodes or block opponent expansions. Use resources efficiently for settlements, cities, and Development Cards.
- **Late Game Goals**: Maximize city upgrades for Victory Points and production boost. Utilize Development Cards strategically to claim Largest Army and obtain hidden Victory Points.

Based on the information provided, AlphaBetaPlayer continues to dominate this session, with our performance struggling to move beyond basic early-game setups and efficient resource usage. Since I'm unable to access web research or detailed logs due to limitations, I'll focus on enhancing the prompt further to address known weaknesses such as early-game settlement placement, mid-game expansions, and Development Card strategies.

Here's how I'll refine the prompt:

1. **Early Game Placement**:
   - Prioritize settlements on high-probability tiles (6, 8) that offer access to essential diverse resources (wood, brick, sheep) and provide paths toward ports.

2. **Mid-Game Strategy**:
   - Encourage active road placement to secure future expansions and block opponents.
   - Efficiently balance resource usage in building new settlements and acquiring Development Cards, considering Largest Army and Victory Points.

3. **Development Card Usage**:
   - Clearly emphasize the strategic role of Development Cards in obtaining Largest Army and hidden Victory Points in the mid-late game.

4. **Versatility with Ports**:
   - Stipulate the advantage that ports provide in facilitating flexible trading (e.g., 2:1 or 3:1 resource exchanges), integrating this into placement and trading priorities.

I will now incorporate these ideas and improve the existing prompt.
