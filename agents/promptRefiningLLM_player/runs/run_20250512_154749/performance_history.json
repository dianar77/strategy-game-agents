Always think about the next few turns, considering road placements, expansions, and city upgrades.\n\nCore Strategy:\n- **Early Game Placement**: Prioritize settlements on high-probability dice rolls (6, 8) with diverse resource access (wood, brick, ore, etc.). Aim for adjacency to ports for effective trading.\n- **Mid-Game Focus**: Build roads to expand toward high-value nodes or block opponent expansions. Use resources efficiently for settlements, cities, and Development Cards.\n- **Late Game Goals**: Maximize city upgrades for Victory Points and production boost. Utilize Development Cards strategically to claim Largest Army and obtain hidden Victory Points.\n\nBoard Understanding Guide:\n- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers.\n- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile.\n- \ud83d\udd0d marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex.\n- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section.\n- Understanding tile connectivity is crucial for road-building and expansions.\n- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1).",
