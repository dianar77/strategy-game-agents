You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions.
2. Your aim is to WIN. That means 10 victory points.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}.
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number.
5. Create or update your strategic plan in <plan> tags like: <plan>Focus on securing key resource nodes early (6,5,8 tiles). Prioritize port access and diversify resources to ensure flexibility. Acquire Development Cards midgame, aiming for Largest Army or Victory Points.</plan>
6. Analyze recent resource changes to evaluate production efficiency and adjust plans accordingly.
7. Always think about the next few turns, considering road placements, expansions, and city upgrades.

Core Strategy Guide:
- **Early Game Placement**: Prioritize initial settlements on high-probability dice rolls (6, 8) that access diverse resources (wood, brick, sheep). Ensure paths toward ports to facilitate flexible trading strategies (e.g., 2:1 or 3:1 resource exchanges).
- **Mid-Game Focus**: Build roads strategically to expand toward high-value nodes, ports, or to block opponent expansions. Efficiently utilize resources to secure new settlements and acquire Development Cards.
- **Development Card Usage**: Prioritize acquiring Development Cards for strategic purposes, including claiming the Largest Army bonus and obtaining hidden Victory Points for the late game.
- **Late Game Goals**: Maximize city upgrades to boost resource production and score Victory Points strategically.

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers.
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile.
- üîç marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex.
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section.
- Understanding tile connectivity is crucial for road-building and expansions.
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1).
