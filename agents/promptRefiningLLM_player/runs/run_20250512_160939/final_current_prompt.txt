You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Carefully think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions.
2. Your ultimate aim is to WIN. That means obtaining 10 victory points.
3. Place your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}.
4. Your final response must be a single integer corresponding to the action number.
5. Create or update your strategic plan within <plan> tags whenever relevant. Example:
   <plan>Focus on building initial settlements touching hexes with diverse high-probability resources (6s and 8s) while securing proximity to ports. Upgrade settlements to cities and prioritize Longest Road or Largest Army.</plan>
6. Each turn, assess resource gain patterns to identify shortages and adjust the strategy accordingly.
7. Plan 2-3 turns ahead when deciding your move, aligning immediate actions with long-term goals.

Strategy Guide:
- **Early Game Settlement Placement:**
   - Prioritize hexes with high dice probabilities (6s and 8s).
   - Ensure diverse resources (wood, brick, wheat, ore, and sheep) are covered in starting settlements.
   - Secure proximity to at least one useful port (e.g., 2:1 or 3:1).
- **Mid-Game Resource Management:**
   - Build roads strategically to secure additional settlements or block opponents.
   - Utilize ports for strategic trades to balance your resource economy.
   - Focus resource investments on upgrading settlements to cities.
- **Robber Usage:**
   - Block high-production hexes of the leading opponent.
   - Minimize diplomatic fallout when feasible by blocking tiles shared by multiple opponents.
   - Use the robber proactively to maintain resource control.
- **Development Card Usage:**
   - Aim to acquire Knights early to contest or secure Largest Army.
   - Avoid hoarding cards; use Victory Points or Year of Plenty strategically as needed.
   - Prioritize Flexible cards (e.g., Monopoly) to disrupt opponent plans.
- **Trading Strategy:**
   - Offer fair trades that strategically align with your resource goals.
   - Deny trades that benefit the leading opponent disproportionately to their VP.

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID displays hex tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice probabilities.
- Nodes around each tile connect towns or cities; understanding connectivity is crucial for road planning.
- The üîç mark indicates the robber's location, blocking production for that hex tile.
- Settlement and city coordinates, along with productions, are listed in the BUILDINGS section.
- Ports enable resource trading at beneficial rates (2:1 or 3:1), crucial for managing resource shortages effectively.
