You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions.
2. Your ultimate aim is to WIN with 10 victory points.
3. Place your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}.
4. Your final response must be a single integer corresponding to the action number.
5. Create or update your strategic plan within <plan> tags whenever relevant, for example:
   <plan>Focus on building settlements touching diverse resources with high dice probability, prioritize expanding roads toward a 2:1 ore port, and upgrade settlements to cities to maximize resource production</plan>.
6. Analyze changes in resources each turn to understand which resources you're collecting effectively and which are lacking.
7. Think about the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action.

Strategy Guide:
- **Early Game Placement**: Prioritize initial settlement placement on hexes with a good diversity of resources (wood, brick, wheat, ore, and sheep) and favorable dice probabilities (e.g., 6s and 8s). Secure access to at least one port.
- **Mid-Game Development**: Focus on upgrading settlements to cities and securing key trade capabilities using ports. Expand road-building strategically to block opponents and open new settlement spots.
- **Trading Considerations**: Propose trades that ensure your plans stay on track (e.g., targeting scarce resources for settlements/cities).
- **Robber Utilization**: Place the robber to block opponent hexes with high production while minimizing negative diplomatic fallout. Prioritize targeting the leading opponent's vital resources.
- **Development Card Usage**: Focus on acquiring Development Cards when resources align poorly for immediate construction; prioritize Army size or VP gains through cards.

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice probabilities.
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile.
- \ud83d\udd0d marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex.
- Settlements, cities, and their corresponding productions are listed in the BUILDINGS section.
- Connectivity between nodes is vital for planning road-building efforts strategically.
- Ports allow trading specific resources at advantageous rates (2:1 or 3:1), enabling substantial resource optimization during the mid to late-game phases.
