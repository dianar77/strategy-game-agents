Observing the performance of our player based on the logs, it is apparent that our current prompt yields poor performance compared to "AlphaBetaPlayer". The key weaknesses seem to be:

1. **Early Game Placement Strategy**:
   - Optimal settlement and road placements are critical since it determines initial resource generation and development trajectory.
   - Our choice of nodes may not sufficiently balance access to diverse resources or prioritize high-probability numbers.

2. **Mid-Game Resource Management**:
   - Leveraging ports for resource optimization is missing.
   - Aren't clear strategies being applied to ensure balanced resource acquisition or negotiation.

3. **Limited Robber Placement Strategy**:
   - Effective placement of robbers to target opponents and block vital resource-producing hexes while mitigating retaliation is underutilized.

To start iterating improvements into the prompt, I'll enhance it with specific strategies addressing these weaknesses.

    new_text: You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions.
2. Your ultimate aim is to WIN with 10 victory points.
3. Place your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}.
4. Your final response must be a single integer corresponding to the action number.
5. Create or update your strategic plan within <plan> tags whenever relevant, for example:
   <plan>Focus on building settlements touching diverse resources with high dice probability, prioritize expanding roads toward a 2:1 ore port, and upgrade settlements to cities to maximize resource production</plan>.
6. Analyze changes in resources each turn to understand which resources you're collecting effectively and which are lacking.
7. Think about the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action.

Strategy Guide:
- **Early Game Placement**: Prioritize initial settlement placement on hexes with a good diversity of resources (wood, brick, wheat, ore, and sheep) and favorable dice probabilities (e.g., 6s and 8s). Secure access to at least one port.
- **Mid-Game Development**: Focus on upgrading settlements to cities and securing key trade capabilities using ports. Expand road-building strategically to block opponents and open new settlement spots.
- **Trading Considerations**: Propose trades that ensure your plans stay on track (e.g., targeting scarce resources for settlements/cities).
- **Robber Utilization**: Place the robber to block opponent hexes with high production while minimizing negative diplomatic fallout. Prioritize targeting the leading opponent's vital resources.
- **Development Card Usage**: Focus on acquiring Development Cards when resources align poorly for immediate construction; prioritize Army size or VP gains through cards.

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice probabilities.
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile.
- \ud83d\udd0d marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex.
- Settlements, cities, and their corresponding productions are listed in the BUILDINGS section.
- Connectivity between nodes is vital for planning road-building efforts strategically.
- Ports allow trading specific resources at advantageous rates (2:1 or 3:1), enabling substantial resource optimization during the mid to late-game phases.================================= Tool Message =================================

I've modified the prompt to address the observed weaknesses:

- **Enhanced Early Game Placement Strategy**: Added specifics on balancing resources and targeting high-probability hexes, as well as aiming for port access early.
- **Mid-Game Resource Management**: Highlighted trading with ports and targeted resource acquisition.
- **Robber Placement**: Focused on disrupting opponents strategically while considering the diplomatic consequences.
- **Development Cards**: Emphasized the importance of Development Cards for flexibility and potential VP gains.

SUMMARY:

1. **Agent's Analysis of Game Results**:
   The agent identified key weaknesses in gameplay based on performance metrics. The "RandomPlayer:BLUE" exhibited suboptimal strategies, achieving only 1 win and consistently lower average scores (2.8 VP) compared to "AlphaBetaPlayer:RED(depth=2,value_fn=base_fn,prunning=False)," who achieved 4 wins with an average VP of 4.8. Critical areas of improvement include early settlement placement, resource management, ineffective use of the robber, and insufficient strategy for leveraging ports and development cards.

2. **Strategies Implemented in the Prompt**:
   - **Early Game Settlement Placement**: Focused on diversity in resource acquisition and targeting hexes with higher dice probabilities (e.g., 6s and 8s). Included prioritization of port accessibility.
   - **Mid-Game Resource Management**: Emphasized the strategic use of ports for resource optimization and balanced development of roads and settlements.
   - **Robber Placement Strategy**: Improved tactics for blocking key opponent hexes while minimizing diplomatic effects.
   - **Development Card Usage**: Integrated as a fallback mechanism for resource disparity and a path toward army size or VP gains.

3. **Performance Metrics Observed**:
   - RandomPlayer's winning rate: **20%** (1 out of 5 games), significantly lower than AlphaBetaPlayer's **80%** winning rate.
   - RandomPlayer's average turns per game: **57.8**, with an average score of **2.8 VP**. Key statistics revealed poor management of resources, settlements, cities, roads, and potential VP gains.
   - Game duration averaged at **0.91 hours/game**, indicating prolonged inefficiencies in decision-making.

Overall, the enhancements to the prompt aim to address these weaknesses by improving strategic understanding, multi-turn planning, and resource optimization. Results from the next iteration will be needed to evaluate the effectiveness of these changes.

Based on the collected results and prompt evaluation, here are targeted areas for improvement in the prompt and gameplay:

### Issues Identified:
1. **Early Game Placement:**
   - Missing strategy for optimizing initial settlement placement and securing access to higher probabilities (6s and 8s) alongside diverse resources.
   - Settlements do not prioritize proximity to ports.

2. **Robber Placement:**
   - Ineffective use of the robber for blocking key opponent hexes or leveraging diplomatic maneuvers.

3. **Development Cards:**
   - Neglect strategic use of development cards for acquiring Knight cards early to dominate the Largest Army.

4. **Resource Management:**
   - Underutilization of ports for trading, leading to resource inefficiencies.

### Prompt Refinement:
I will integrate advanced strategies to handle the early game better, improve the mid-game robber usage, and focus on optimization of trading and ports.

    new_text: You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Carefully think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions.
2. Your ultimate aim is to WIN. That means obtaining 10 victory points.
3. Place your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}.
4. Your final response must be a single integer corresponding to the action number.
5. Create or update your strategic plan within <plan> tags whenever relevant. Example:
   <plan>Focus on building initial settlements touching hexes with diverse high-probability resources (6s and 8s) while securing proximity to ports. Upgrade settlements to cities and prioritize Longest Road or Largest Army.</plan>
6. Each turn, assess resource gain patterns to identify shortages and adjust the strategy accordingly.
7. Plan 2-3 turns ahead when deciding your move, aligning immediate actions with long-term goals.

Strategy Guide:
- **Early Game Settlement Placement:**
   - Prioritize hexes with high dice probabilities (6s and 8s).
   - Ensure diverse resources (wood, brick, wheat, ore, and sheep) are covered in starting settlements.
   - Secure proximity to at least one useful port (e.g., 2:1 or 3:1).
- **Mid-Game Resource Management:**
   - Build roads strategically to secure additional settlements or block opponents.
   - Utilize ports for strategic trades to balance your resource economy.
   - Focus resource investments on upgrading settlements to cities.
- **Robber Usage:**
   - Block high-production hexes of the leading opponent.
   - Minimize diplomatic fallout when feasible by blocking tiles shared by multiple opponents.
   - Use the robber proactively to maintain resource control.
- **Development Card Usage:**
   - Aim to acquire Knights early to contest or secure Largest Army.
   - Avoid hoarding cards; use Victory Points or Year of Plenty strategically as needed.
   - Prioritize Flexible cards (e.g., Monopoly) to disrupt opponent plans.
- **Trading Strategy:**
   - Offer fair trades that strategically align with your resource goals.
   - Deny trades that benefit the leading opponent disproportionately to their VP.
