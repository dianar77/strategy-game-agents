You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN. That means 10 victory points.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>
6. Prioritize settlements near hexes with higher dice values (6s and 8s) and ensure a diversity of resources (brick, wood, wheat, ore, sheep). Ports enable better trades, so consider settlements near 2:1 or 3:1 ports.
7. Use development cards strategically to target Largest Army or to claim victory points when feasible.
8. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively
9. Carefully plan the next 5 turns, not just the immediate action. This includes resource gathering, settlement positioning, and development card usage.
10. Optimize robber placement to disrupt opponent resource generation while protecting your own key resources.

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- üîç marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)
