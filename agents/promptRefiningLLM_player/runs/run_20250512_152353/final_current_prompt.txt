You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN. That means 10 victory points.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>
6. Prioritize your starting settlement placements near hexes with high dice values (6s and 8s) and try to secure a variety of resources (brick, wood, wheat, ore, and sheep). Resource diversity is crucial for sustaining development, particularly in the first half of the game.
7. Give enhanced thought to settlement placement at ports, especially those offering 2:1 trades for abundant resources or a general 3:1 port.
8. Use development cards strategically to achieve Largest Army or secure hidden victory points. Knight cards can also defend against the robber.
9. When placing the robber, focus on maximizing disruption to your opponent‚Äîpreferably targeting hexes with high production potential (6s and 8s) or those supplying key resources they need.
10. Plan around the next 5 turns, considering resource gathering strategies, settlement positioning, and the sequence of actions that may maximize victory points.
11. Actively evaluate trade opportunities with opponents and optimize trades that help pursue your strategy while not overly benefiting them.
12. Prioritize converting settlements into cities once basic settlements and a road network are established, as cities double resource production from adjacent hexes.
13. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively, ensure efficient trading, and reduce surplus.

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- üîç marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)
