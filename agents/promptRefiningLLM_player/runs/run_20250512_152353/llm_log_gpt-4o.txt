Building on the data gathered, let's identify key areas for improvement based on the performance analysis and the current prompt. While searching for external strategic information wasn't possible, we can proceed to refine the prompt based on known areas of focus: early game placement, resource management, and mid/late-game strategy development.

The win rate so far is 0%, and the current insights suggest the following adjustments are needed to the prompt:

1. **Early Game Placement**:
   - Early game placement must prioritize high-yield areas, focusing on hexes with higher dice values (6s and 8s).
   - Increase emphasis on spreading to a diversity of resources (brick, wood, wheat, ore, and sheep).

2. **Resource Management and Port Strategy**:
   - Guide the player to actively plan settlements near 2:1 or 3:1 ports to enhance trading flexibility.
   - Ensure it considers the best trade-off between resource generation and port positioning.

3. **Development Card Usage & Robber Placement**:
   - The use of development cards (especially knights for Largest Army) and strategic robber placement could be better highlighted in the prompt.
   - Reinforce the goal of leveraging the robber to both disrupt the opponent and maintain resource control.

4. **Step-by-Step Planning**:
   - Emphasize a stronger forward-looking plan for the next 5 turns to build momentum.

I'll now update the prompt with these strategic refinements.

In this conversation, the user provides game results for a Settlers of Catan AI performance evaluation. The results indicate that the AI agent, "AlphaBetaPlayer," achieved a 0% win rate, prompting an analysis of the underlying issues. The discussion identifies key areas for improvement, including early game settlement placement, resource diversity, port strategy, development card usage, robber placement, and forward-planning over the next few turns.

The assistant identifies and accesses the existing prompt used by the AI but encounters file access issues when attempting to review additional logs and external resources. Based on best practices, the assistant then updates the prompt to include strategic enhancements in resource optimization, settlement priorities, and tactical planning. The updated prompt is saved, and the assistant suggests testing it to measure performance improvements.================================ Human Message =================================

6. Prioritize your starting settlement placements near hexes with high dice values (6s and 8s) and try to secure a variety of resources (brick, wood, wheat, ore, and sheep). Resource diversity is crucial for sustaining development, particularly in the first half of the game.
7. Give enhanced thought to settlement placement at ports, especially those offering 2:1 trades for abundant resources or a general 3:1 port.
8. Use development cards strategically to achieve Largest Army or secure hidden victory points. Knight cards can also defend against the robber.
9. When placing the robber, focus on maximizing disruption to your opponent‚Äîpreferably targeting hexes with high production potential (6s and 8s) or those supplying key resources they need.
10. Plan around the next 5 turns, considering resource gathering strategies, settlement positioning, and the sequence of actions that may maximize victory points.
11. Actively evaluate trade opportunities with opponents and optimize trades that help pursue your strategy while not overly benefiting them.
12. Prioritize converting settlements into cities once basic settlements and a road network are established, as cities double resource production from adjacent hexes.
13. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively, ensure efficient trading, and reduce surplus.

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- üîç marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)================================= Tool Message =================================

I have updated the prompt with specific improvements focused on core strategies like settlement placement, resource prioritization, port utilization, development card usage, robber tactics, and forward planning. The prompt is now ready for testing to assess the impact of these changes on game performance. Let us proceed to evaluate its effectiveness in the next set of games.Evolve Counter: -1
