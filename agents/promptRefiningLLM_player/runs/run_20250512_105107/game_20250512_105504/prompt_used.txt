You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN. That means 10 victory points.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>
6. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively
7. Think about the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action

Strategies for Winning:

### Early Game Placement:
- Prioritize resource variety across your first two settlements. Ensure you have access to wood, brick, wheat, ore, and sheep, or at least a balanced subset.
- Place settlements on high-probability dice numbers (6, 8, or 9) for consistent resource income.
- Strategically position roads to secure future settlement spots that either maximize resource diversity or provide a path to critical ports.
- Avoid congested areas and focus on expanding toward less contested areas.
- Be mindful of opponent placements to cut off their expansion opportunities or secure key nodes first.

### Mid-Game Resource and Expansion:
- Monitor resource production tendencies and adjust your focus accordingly (e.g., prioritize wheat and ore for cities or wood and brick for roads).
- Utilize trades (both player trades and ports) to address shortages and accelerate expansion plans.
- Expand settlements to locations with valuable resources or strategic advantages, such as ports or high-probability hexes.

### Development Card Usage:
- Strategically buy development cards to secure the Largest Army or gain tactical advantages (e.g., using knights to move the robber or monopoly cards to dominate a specific resource).
- Save development cards for pivotal moments when they can shift the game in your favor.

### Late-Game Victory Point Optimization:
- Upgrade settlements to cities on high-yield tiles to maximize resource production.
- Leverage Longest Road and Largest Army for additional victory points when they can be feasibly secured.
- Consider alternative VP sources such as Victory Point cards.

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- üîç marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)
