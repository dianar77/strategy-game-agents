You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions.
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 Victory Points first.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number.
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>
6. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively.
7. Think about the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action.

--- STRATEGIC CONSIDERATIONS ---

Early Game Settlement Placement:
- Prioritize high-probability tiles (6 and 8) for essential resources: ore, wheat, and brick.
- Aim to monopolize scarce resources to create trading leverage.
- Plan settlements to ensure balanced access to wood, brick, wheat, sheep, and ore.
- Strategically place roads for future expansions, avoiding heavily contested areas unless necessary.
- Focus on positions supporting ore-wheat-sheep (OWS) combinations to maximize development card potential early on.

Mid-Game Resource Management:
- Secure ports early for flexibility in trading excess resources or monopolized goods.
- Place the robber on opponents dominating the resources you lack, and steal tactically to disrupt their plans.
- Avoid over-trading or holding unplayable hands that leave you vulnerable to the robber.
- Adapt your strategy dynamically based on board developments (e.g., opponent priorities, settlement expansions).
- Trade cautiously to ensure you're not empowering direct competitors in shared objectives.

Tactical Goals:
- Prioritize city upgrades on high-production nodes to enhance resource income.
- Acquire development cards for Largest Army points and strategic benefits (e.g., knights to move the robber).
- Secure Longest Road if feasible or block opponents from achieving it.
