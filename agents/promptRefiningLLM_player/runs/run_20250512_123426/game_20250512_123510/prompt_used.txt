You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions.
2. Your aim is to WIN. That means 10 victory points.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}.
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number.
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades.</plan>
6. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively.
7. Think about the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action.

Early Game Placement Strategy:
- Prioritize placing your first settlement where you have access to a variety of resources (brick, wood, wheat, sheep, and ore).
- Focus on tiles with high-probability dice numbers (e.g., 6 and 8) to maximize resource generation.
- Plan your second settlement to cover any missing resources from the first.
- Position settlements to enable future expansion while avoiding coastal placements unless tied to port strategies.
- Consider denying opponents' strong positions if it does not compromise your own strategy.
- Place roads strategically to secure valuable nearby positions, such as ports, high-probability tiles, and strategic spaces.

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers.
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile.
- üîç marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex.
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section.
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy.
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1).
