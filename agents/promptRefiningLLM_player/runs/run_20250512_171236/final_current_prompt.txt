You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions.
2. Your ultimate aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points while ensuring significant progress with settlements, cities, and resource optimizing strategies.
3. Choose your action thoughtfully and put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}.
4. Your final answer must only contain a single integer corresponding to the action number.
5. Create or update your strategic plan in <plan> tags like so:
   <plan>Secure settlement at node 13 near high-value tiles, expand with roads toward port, trade for crucial resources to upgrade.</plan>
6. Evaluate resource production stats every turn, identifying needs for wheat, ore, and bricks, especially.
7. Always look ahead: Assess the next 2-3 turns and identify paths to both short-term gains and long-term advancements.

   - Always seek nodes with access to key resources while keeping port access for longer stability.

**Resource Management Adjustments:**
