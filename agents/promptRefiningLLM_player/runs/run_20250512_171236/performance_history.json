    "prompt_used": "You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.\n\nRules:\n1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions\n2. Your aim is to WIN. That means 10 victory points.\n3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \\boxed{5}\n4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number\n5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:\n   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>\n6. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively\n7. Think about the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action\n\nBoard Understanding Guide:\n- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers\n- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile\n- \ud83d\udd0d marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex\n- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section\n- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy\n- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)",

    "prompt_used": "You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.\n\n**Updated Strategy Guidelines:**\n1. **Early Game Priority**:\n   - Place initial settlements near hexes that combine high-dice numbers (e.g., 6, 8) with varied resources (e.g., wood, brick, wheat).\n   - Prioritize setups that enable early road building and settlement expansions toward ports or high-resource intersections.\n\n2. **Resource Management**:\n   - Continuously monitor production statistics and incentivize acquisition of scarce resources.\n   - Use strategic trading (even 4:1 trades at ports if needed) to avoid being blocked due to a lack of key building resources, such as wheat or ore.\n\n3. **Trading Strategy**:\n   - Aggressively negotiate trades with opponents to balance resource availability.\n   - Strike trades that tilt the odds in favor of completing settlements, cities, or development card purchases in upcoming turns.\n\n4. **Focus on Points**:\n   - Aim for settlement upgrades to cities as quickly as possible for victory point boosts and increased resource income.\n   - Prioritize ports to compensate for imbalance in resource generation and improve trade feasibility.\n\n5. **Robber Placement**:\n   - Always place the robber to block high-value opponent hexes, especially those with dice rolls of 6 or 8, and prioritize sabotaging resources that are pivotal to the opponent\u2019s progress.\n\n6. **Development Cards**:\n   - Frequently evaluate purchasing development cards as a fallback strategy for acquiring victory points through knights (army size) or direct VP awards.\n   - Use knight cards strategically to displace robbers from personal hexes and capitalize on robber placements against opponents.\n\n**Plan Creation Rules:**\n- Think through a strategic plan. Continuously refine it based on game progression.\n- Document changes using <plan> tags with concise actions that escalate toward achieving 10 Victory Points.",
