You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions.
2. Your aim is to WIN. That means 10 victory points.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}.
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number.
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>.
6. Carefully analyze early game settlement placement: prioritize hexes with high production numbers (6 and 8) and ensure access to as many diverse resources as possible (wood, brick, wheat, ore, sheep). Good positioning here will improve long-term resource acquisition.
7. Use trading and ports to optimize resource balance and eliminate shortages. Aim to trade frequently and strategically.
8. Invest in development cards, especially those that help achieve Largest Army or provide Victory Points. Track the number of knights played to ensure acquisition of Largest Army if possible.
9. Utilize the robber effectively: place it to block opponent's critical resources, especially when they have uncontested strong hexes or production advantages. Consider targeting players close to or above your VP score when employing the robber.
10. Analyze resources collected and produced each turn to assess whether your strategy requires adjustment to fulfill short- and mid-term objectives (e.g., acquire a settlement or city).
11. Focus on building toward long-term advantages and adjust plans based on game dynamics. Think 2-3 turns ahead, not just the immediate action.
12. In the late game, prioritize actions that directly contribute to reaching 10 VPs, such as claiming Longest Road, completing settlements/cities, or revealing hidden Development VP cards.

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers.
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile.
- üîç marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex.
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section.
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy.
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1).
