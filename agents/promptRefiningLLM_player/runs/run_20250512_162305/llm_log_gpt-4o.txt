It seems there is an issue with accessing the web search tool. I'll focus on analyzing the current prompt and the issues observed from the game logs to produce a more refined strategy.

The current player scored an average of 2.2 points in games while AlphaBetaPlayer had an overwhelming average of 5.2. This suggests key weaknesses in several aspects such as early settlement placement, resource optimization, trading, and general mid- to late-game development. Here‚Äôs how the prompt can be improved to target these:

---

### Observed Weaknesses:
1. **Early Game Settlement Placement**:
   - Vital to get access to a variety of resources and prioritize high-frequency hexes, i.e., those with numbers 6 and 8.
   - The current prompt does not explicitly instruct the player to strategize settlement placement during the early game.

2. **Resource Management & Trading Efficiency**:
   - The player might not be trading or optimizing resources efficiently.
   - The opponent takes better advantage of road building and early settlement expansion.

3. **Development Card Usage**:
   - There's no emphasis on buying and using development cards, which can offer crucial advantages like victory points and the largest army bonus.

4. **Robber Placement**:
   - No apparent guidelines for effective placement of the robber against key opponents to block resources effectively.

---

### Immediate Plan to Update the Prompt
The new prompt will focus on:
- Stressing the importance of early settlement placement with access to diverse, high-producing resources.
- Encouraging consistent resource management with trades and ports.
- Prioritizing development cards strategically.
- Using the robber actively to hinder opponents.

Let me update the prompt with targeted improvements!

7. Use trading and ports to optimize resource balance and eliminate shortages. Aim to trade frequently and strategically.
8. Invest in development cards, especially those that help achieve Largest Army or provide Victory Points.
9. Utilize the robber effectively: place it to block opponent's critical resources, especially when they have uncontested strong hexes or production advantages.

I have refined the prompt to ensure our player focuses on:
- Strategic early settlement placement.
- More effective use of trading, ports, and development cards.
- Utilizing the robber to block critical resources of opponents.

SUMMARY:

1. **What the agent has learned from the game results**:
   - The player's performance was significantly weaker compared to the AlphaBetaPlayer, which dominated with 5 wins and an average of 5.2 victory points (VP) per game. The RandomPlayer averaged only 2.2 VPs and failed to win any games, indicating fundamental weaknesses.
   - Weak areas identified include early settlement placement, poor resource management, lack of trading strategy, underutilization of development cards, and ineffective use of the robber. These shortcomings hindered the player's ability to expand quickly or contest critical game objectives like the Largest Army or Longest Road.

2. **What strategies were implemented in the prompt**:
   - The revised prompt focuses on improving critical areas:
     - **Early Game Settlement Placement**: Emphasizes prioritizing high-frequency hexes (e.g., 6 and 8) and ensuring access to diverse resources.
     - **Resource Optimization**: Highlights the importance of effective trading and utilizing ports to overcome resource shortages.
     - **Development Cards Priority**: Encourages strategic investment in cards to secure advantages like Larger Army and victory points.
     - **Robber Effectiveness**: Instructs on placing the robber to block opponents' key resources and hinder their progress.
     - **Long-term Strategy**: Stresses planning for the next 2-3 turns to build toward cumulative advantages.

3. **Performance metrics observed**:
   - **Average Victory Points (VP)**: RandomPlayer consistently underperformed with an average of 2.2 VPs compared to 5.2 VPs for the AlphaBetaPlayer. This indicates poor mid- to late-game development.
   - **Average Turns**: Games lasted an average of 40.2 turns and 104.4 ticks, suggesting inefficiencies in the RandomPlayer's gameplay progression.
   - **Strategic Gaps**: Key metrics like building settlements, cities, and roads were all far below optimal levels compared to AlphaBetaPlayer's results, highlighting the need for deeper strategic adjustments.

The refined prompt implements focused strategies to address these deficiencies, ensuring the player adopts a more calculated and competitive approach in subsequent games.

It appears that I encountered issues reading the game log file and using the web search tool, which will hinder my next steps. Let me proceed by analyzing the current data further and hypothesizing improvements for the prompt based on the information at hand.

### Analysis Based on Available Data

From the performance history and summaries:
- **Settlement Placement**: Our player might not effectively prioritize hex yields or diversity of resources, despite explicit instructions.
- **Resource Management**: Trading strategies may be weak, and ports may not be utilized properly.
- **Development Card Play**: Our player is not investing in development cards enough to compete for Largest Army, which can result in a significant point increase.
- **Robber Usage**: The robber remains underutilized as no effective blocks on opponent resources are reflected.
  
### Hypotheses for Further Improvements

1. **Early Settlement Placement**
   - Emphasize clear priorities for selecting resource-rich hexes based on production frequency (6s, 8s) and balanced resource access.
   - Ensure initial road placements are angled toward key future expansions like ports or high-value settlement spots.

2. **Mid-Game Strategy**
   - Strengthen instructions to maximize trades to achieve specific short-term goals (e.g., enable city upgrades or critical road-building steps).
   - Encourage constant tracking of opponent progress to disrupt them via the robber placement or blocking key expansions.

3. **Development Card Usage**
   - Mandate monitoring development card usage to reach 3 Knights quickly for Largest Army.
   - Leverage VP cards sooner whenever they can alter the leaderboard ranking.

4. **Late Game Goals**
   - Highlight winning conditions like obtaining 10 VPs directly through remaining settlements, cities, or Longest Road efforts.
   
I propose adding these refinements to the prompt. Let me proceed with writing the enhanced strategy into the prompt.

    new_text: You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions.
2. Your aim is to WIN. That means 10 victory points.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}.
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number.
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>.
6. Carefully analyze early game settlement placement: prioritize hexes with high production numbers (6 and 8) and ensure access to as many diverse resources as possible (wood, brick, wheat, ore, sheep). Good positioning here will improve long-term resource acquisition.
7. Use trading and ports to optimize resource balance and eliminate shortages. Aim to trade frequently and strategically.
8. Invest in development cards, especially those that help achieve Largest Army or provide Victory Points. Track the number of knights played to ensure acquisition of Largest Army if possible.
9. Utilize the robber effectively: place it to block opponent's critical resources, especially when they have uncontested strong hexes or production advantages. Consider targeting players close to or above your VP score when employing the robber.
10. Analyze resources collected and produced each turn to assess whether your strategy requires adjustment to fulfill short- and mid-term objectives (e.g., acquire a settlement or city).
11. Focus on building toward long-term advantages and adjust plans based on game dynamics. Think 2-3 turns ahead, not just the immediate action.
12. In the late game, prioritize actions that directly contribute to reaching 10 VPs, such as claiming Longest Road, completing settlements/cities, or revealing hidden Development VP cards.

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers.
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile.
- üîç marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex.
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section.
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy.
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1).================================= Tool Message =================================

I have implemented a more detailed set of strategic guidelines to address settlement placement, mid-game resource management, development card prioritization, and late-game VP optimization. The next step is to observe the player's performance using this updated prompt and refine further based on the results.Evolve Counter: -1
