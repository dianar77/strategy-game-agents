Updated plan: Place the initial settlement at Node 2 to prioritize high-yield Ore (6) and Wheat (5) for cities and Development Cards. This ensures early access to critical resources while retaining expansion flexibility. Build roads toward ports or unclaimed nodes to maintain growth potential. Use Ore and Wheat dominance to focus on city upgrades and secure Longest Road or Largest Army bonuses strategically.

Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2382 chars)
Updated plan: 1. Play the Knight card to block **🌾8**, hampering Red's Wheat production, and steal a resource.
2. Focus on building resources for upgrading a settlement to a city (goal: node **9** for Wheat and Ore boost).
3. Once sufficient resources are gathered, prioritize buying Development Cards to strengthen the push for the Largest Army bonus (+2 VP).
4. Use the robber aggressively to continually pressure Red’s resource generation.
5. Avoid pursuing Longest Road for now unless directly positioned to win.
LLM chose action 0: Play Knight card - Move the robber and steal a resource
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2676 chars)
Updated plan: Continue focusing on upgrading settlements to cities, starting with nodes near high-yield resources (e.g., **9** for 🧱, 🌾, ⛏️). Target Development Cards early to secure the Largest Army bonus (+2 VP) and Knights for targeted robber usage. Use the robber to aggressively slow down Red's Wheat production (🌾8, 🌾5) to hinder their expansion. Avoid unnecessary road building unless Longest Road becomes a viable contest option later.

2. Use the robber to block 🌾8 (a critical RED node) and steal resources to balance your own hand (ideally aiming for 🌲WOOD or 🐑SHEEP).
3. Purchase Development Cards after balancing resources through maritime trade or steals, aiming for victory points and Knights (to maintain Largest Army dominance).
4. Reserve road building for securing a new settlement location. Contest Longest Road only later if it directly enables a win.
LLM chose action 3: Trade port: Give 4 ⛏️ORE for 1 🐑SHEEP
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2576 chars)
Updated plan: Prioritize buying Development Cards to secure hidden Victory Points or reinforce Largest Army dominance. Use Knights to strategically block Red's critical production hexes (🌾8). Target resource accumulation through trade or well-placed robber steals to expand settlements while remaining vigilant of Red’s victory progression. Contest Longest Road only as a last resort.
LLM chose action 1: Buy a development card (1 🐑SHEEP, 1 🌾WHEAT, 1 ⛏️ORE)
Only one action available. Selecting it automatically without API call.
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2333 chars)
Updated plan: - Play the Knight card to move the robber to block 🌾8 on RED’s hex, targeting their critical resource production and stealing a resource to help with city upgrades or Development Card purchases.
- Focus next turns on using high-yield hexes to gather resources for city upgrades and expanding settlements (likely toward ports).
- Prioritize Development Card purchasing post-Knight action to secure hidden Victory Points and additional dominance in Largest Army.
- Contest Longest Road only as secondary priority unless RED threatens to win with another network extension.
LLM chose action 0: Play Knight card - Move the robber and steal a resource
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2737 chars)
Updated plan: 1. Move the robber to 🌾8 to block RED’s Wheat production and steal a resource. Stealing increases the chance of gaining either Ore or Wheat, both of which are critical for your next moves.
2. Focus on gathering resources to upgrade a settlement to a city at the next opportunity.
3. After securing the next city upgrade, prioritize purchasing Development Cards to boost Largest Army (if not yet maxed) or to secure hidden VP cards.
4. Use further robber placements to disrupt RED’s resource generation (target ⛏️6 or critical nodes they depend on).
5. Consider road-building only if there’s a viable settlement spot that accelerates your resource generation or Longest Road by extension.
LLM chose action 3: Move robber to (-1, 0, 1) and steal from RED
Only one action available. Selecting it automatically without API call.
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 3099 chars)
Updated plan: 1. Move the robber to 🌾8 to block RED's Wheat production and steal a resource. Target Ore or Wheat for strategic city upgrades.
2. Build roads only if directly contributing to a viable settlement/port or contesting Longest Road later.
3. Upgrade cities at high-yield nodes for more resources (Ore/Wheat).
4. Focus on Development Cards (Largest Army and hidden VP).
5. Use robber placements strategically to block RED’s high-yield hexes (🌾8, ⛏️6).
LLM chose action 0: End your turn
Only one action available. Selecting it automatically without API call.
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2858 chars)
Updated plan: 1. Focus aggressively on upgrading to cities as soon as Ore becomes available (target ⛏️6, 🌾5 intersections). Expand by unlocking more settlement spots with strategic roads when resources allow.  
2. Delay RED's Wheat production using the robber (target 🌾8). Steal resources to potentially obtain Ore/Wheat for city progress.  
3. Prioritize Development Cards to secure Largest Army progression long-term and aim for hidden VP cards. Use Knights from Development Cards for additional robber disruption.  
4. Build roads only when they enable new settlements or disrupt RED’s Longest Road bonus. Consider contesting Longest Road if viable in the mid-game.  
5. Trade resources effectively or capitalize on ports when possible for Ore and other key gaps in materials.

Updated plan: 1. Move the robber to RED's key Wheat hex (🌾8 at node 16) to disrupt their resource generation and steal resources.
2. Prioritize upgrading settlements to cities at high-yield nodes. Use stolen resources combined with trading or port access to compensate for deficits.
3. Secure more Development Cards to maintain Largest Army and aim for hidden VP cards.
4. Contest Longest Road only if the game risk escalates. Focus resources primarily on city upgrades.

Updated plan: 1. Focus on upgrading settlements to cities by converting resources into WHEAT via port trades.
2. Use the robber to disrupt RED’s critical Wheat hex (🌾8), ensuring RED struggles to build settlements or cities.
3. Prioritize enhancing your VP gains through city upgrades (primary) and hidden VP Development Cards (secondary).
4. Delay road-building unless it provides clear paths to a new settlement or disrupts RED’s expansion.
5. Continue to monitor RED’s resource usage, avoiding trades that might help them reach 10 VP.

2. Focus on upgrading settlements to cities at high-yield nodes for direct VP gains.
3. Purchase Development Cards consistently to target Largest Army enforcement and hidden VP acquisition. Utilize Knights to block RED's critical resource tiles (**🌾8**).
4. Build roads purposefully to contest Longest Road if RED struggles to maintain it in future turns.
