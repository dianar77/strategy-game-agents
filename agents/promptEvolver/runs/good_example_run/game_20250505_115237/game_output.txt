Updated plan: Build settlement at Node 11. Next, focus on building roads toward nodes 7 (to collect ore and wheat) or toward a port for trade flexibility. Prioritize upgrading the initial settlement to a city quickly.
LLM chose action 7: Build a settlement at node 11 (Cost: 1 üå≤WOOD, 1 üß±BRICK, 1 üåæWHEAT, 1 üêëSHEEP)
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 1879 chars)
Updated plan: Build roads toward Node 7, then construct a settlement on Node 7. Prioritize upgrading Node 7 to a city once it is established, as ore (‚õèÔ∏è) and wheat (üåæ) will support this goal. If resources permit, consider building further roads toward highly productive nodes or a port for trade flexibility.
LLM chose action 0: Build a road at edge (11, 12) (Cost: 1 üå≤WOOD, 1 üß±BRICK)

Updated plan: Focus on trading excess Ore to build roads toward Node 7 (starting with Brick). Build a settlement at Node 7 as soon as possible. Once the settlement is established, focus on upgrading Node 7 to a city to strengthen Ore and Wheat production. If resources permit, consider a secondary goal of acquiring a port for better trading ratios.

Updated plan: Block Red's Brick production at (-1, 1, 0) to slow their road-building and expansion. Continue gathering resources to expand toward Node 7. Once at Node 7, build a settlement, then prioritize city upgrades for higher resource generation. Monitor Red‚Äôs progress on Longest Road and Largest Army bonuses, and pivot to competing for one if necessary.

Updated plan: 1. Trade 4 ‚õèÔ∏èORE for 1 üåæWHEAT.
2. Save resources for either:
   - Building a road and settlement on Node 7 in the next turn, or
   - Upgrading a settlement to a city once additional üåæWHEAT is acquired.
3. Continue to block RED's üåæ8 or move the robber to üåæ9 to prevent RED's win.
