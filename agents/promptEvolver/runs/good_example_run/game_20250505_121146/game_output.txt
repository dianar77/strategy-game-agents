LLM chose action 1: Build a settlement at node 2 (Cost: 1 🌲WOOD, 1 🧱BRICK, 1 🌾WHEAT, 1 🐑SHEEP)
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 1551 chars)
Updated plan: Focus on expanding toward the 🌾6 hex using road-building. Early settlement near the 🌾6 hex will ensure a robust Wheat supply, critical for city upgrades and Development Cards. Prioritize developing cities on high-yield spots and acquiring Development Cards for Largest Army. Block opponents’ progress strategically with the robber while securing essential resources. Avoid unnecessary actions that divert from VP progression.
LLM chose action 1: Build a road at edge (2, 9) (Cost: 1 🌲WOOD, 1 🧱BRICK)
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 3351 chars)
Updated plan: Place the settlement on **Node 6** to prioritize access to 🌾6 (critical for city upgrades), combine it with 🐑8, and plan future expansions toward nodes with Ore or ports. Focus on upgrading one of the two settlements into a city as soon as possible to increase resource production. Secure Development Cards early to start progressing toward Largest Army (+2 VP).

Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2303 chars)
Updated plan: Prioritize collecting Ore and Wheat actively. Use the resources to upgrade settlements into cities to increase VP and production output. Invest in Development Cards as secondary priority to secure Largest Army (+2 VP) and unlock hidden Victory Points. Place the robber strategically to hinder opponents’ progress toward resource accumulation or VP gains, particularly targeting 🌾 or ⛏️ production. Expand settlements only if they provide access to critical missing resources or high-frequency tiles (e.g., 🔢6/🔢8).

Game state prepared for LLM (length: 3376 chars)
Updated plan: Focus on upgrading settlements into cities using Wheat and Ore collected via Year of Plenty and dice rolls. Push for Development Cards to secure Largest Army bonus (+2 VP) and uncover hidden VP cards. Prioritize robbing opponents strategically to slow their progress toward city upgrades or settlement expansions. Expand settlements only when critical resources or high-frequency hexes (🔢6/🔢8) are accessible. Avoid wasteful trades; reserve resources for impactful actions like city upgrades or Development Card purchases.

Updated plan: Focus on securing Wheat 🌾 and Ore ⛏️ for efficient city upgrades while strategically blocking RED’s key resources to hinder their city progression or ability to buy Development Cards.

Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2333 chars)

Begin progressing toward Largest Army and addressing resource deficiencies aggressively. Prioritize every action that directly contributes to Victory Point progression.
LLM chose action 0: Play Knight card - Move the robber and steal a resource
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2548 chars)
Updated plan: Focus on collecting Ore and Wheat for city upgrades and Development Cards. Prioritize disrupting RED's strategic momentum by blocking critical resource hexes like Ore (⛏️) and Wheat (🌾) with the robber. Build toward city upgrades and Largest Army (+2 VP bonus) while maintaining pressure on RED’s progress. Ensure every action contributes directly to critical resource acquisition or VP gains.

Updated plan: 1. **Buy a Development Card immediately**:
   - Costs: 1 🐑Sheep, 1 🌾Wheat, 1 ⛏️Ore.
   - This either progresses Largest Army, grants a hidden Victory Point, or provides resource flexibility (e.g., Monopoly or more Year of Plenty cards).
2. After obtaining a Development Card, review its results and adapt future steps.
   - If it’s a Knight, play it on our next turn to block **Red’s critical hexes**.
   - If it’s a Victory Point, reevaluate the path to 10 VP (settlement or city builds).
3. **Focus Next Turn**: Aim to acquire resources (Wheat + Ore) for city upgrades on the two settlements near **🌾10/6** tiles. Avoid unnecessary trades or road building unless essential for achieving a settlement or city.
