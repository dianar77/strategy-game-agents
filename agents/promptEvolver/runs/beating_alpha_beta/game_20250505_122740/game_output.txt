Updated plan: Based on the above factors, building a settlement at **Node 22** provides:
1. Access to three vital resources‚Äîore (‚õèÔ∏è8), sheep (üêë10), and wheat (üåæ3)‚Äîfor future city upgrades and development card purchases.
2. Strong dice probabilities (8 and 10) for a consistent resource income.
3. A balanced position on the board with flexibility for future expansion (e.g., nodes near ports or brick).
LLM chose action 18: Build a settlement at node 22 (Cost: 1 üå≤WOOD, 1 üß±BRICK, 1 üåæWHEAT, 1 üêëSHEEP)
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2051 chars)
Updated plan: - My next settlement should aim to strengthen resource diversity. Moving toward **node 23/20** and connecting to **node 16 (üåæ3, ‚õèÔ∏è8)** is logical.
   - Road placement at **(22, 23)** aligns with this expansion while maintaining the current advantage.
   - Long-term, securing **cities** (requires ore and wheat) and/or **development cards** (potential for Largest Army) becomes the focus.

Updated plan: The goal is to advance toward gaining new settlement spots for resource diversity (wood from node 18, sheep from node 22) and upgrading settlements to cities. Simultaneously, RED‚Äôs settlements must be weakened by blocking key resources, especially üåæ9 and üå≤6.

Game state prepared for LLM (length: 1978 chars)
Updated plan: - Focus on gathering wheat and ore for upgrading a settlement to a city (preferably Node 16 for üåæ3 and ‚õèÔ∏è8).
- Use YEAR_OF_PLENTY strategically to grab brick/wheat or other needed resources when preparing to expand/build.
- Hold onto the KNIGHT card until it can deliver a stronger impact (e.g., blocking RED‚Äôs progress further when needed or claiming Largest Army).
- Monitor RED's road-building progress for potential Longest Road risks.
- Expand towards ports when possible to enable better trading in the mid-game.
LLM chose action 1: End your turn
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 3488 chars)
Updated plan: 1. **Short-Term Goal (Immediate Action):**
   - Use the **"Year of Plenty" development card** to gather resources needed for upgrading to a city at **Node 16**. You'll need:
     - Wheat (üåæ, 1 needed)
     - Ore (‚õèÔ∏è, 2 needed)
   - Select: **Action [10] Play Year of Plenty card - Take ('WHEAT', 'ORE')**.

2. **Mid-Term Goal (Next Moves):**
   - After acquiring the resources, aim to roll favorable numbers or trade to gather the final ore you need for upgrading to a city (settlement -> city adds crucial VP).

3. **Long-Term Goals:**
   - Build towards a port (to enable better trades, especially for scarce wheat).
   - Use Knight strategically to hinder RED when they become a more imminent threat.
   - Continue aiming for cities and development cards toward Largest Army.

Only one action available. Selecting it automatically without API call.
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2633 chars)
Updated plan: 1. **Roll the Dice:** This is the starting step to gather resources organically. Your settlements are adjacent to potentially high-yield tiles like ‚õèÔ∏è8. This can help you begin collecting the **ore** (‚õèÔ∏è) you need for upgrading to a city.
2. Post-roll decisions will depend on the resources gained:
   - If you roll useful resources, consider trading or using the "Year of Plenty" card to fill in gaps for a city.
   - If resources are insufficient, continue building towards development cards, cities, and road expansion.
3. **Hold Knight Cards Strategically:** Save Knight cards for when RED becomes a larger threat or when you need to block a critical resource tile like üåæ9 or üå≤6. Accumulate more cards if aiming for Largest Army.
4. Short-term priority is upgrading Node 16 to a **city**, as it will boost your resource generation significantly.
LLM chose action 1: Roll the dice
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2708 chars)
Updated plan: Given the current game state:
1. Resources are unavailable, meaning I cannot build or upgrade right now. 
2. RED does not appear to be an immediate threat with only 2 victory points and limited expansion possibilities.
3. Playing a Knight card now would likely result in minimal benefit since RED has only 2 resource cards, and the robbing mechanic would not decisively affect their strategy.
4. The strategic priority is still upgrading Node 16 to a city, but resources must be gathered first. Rolling for future resource production is essential, and saving Knight cards for future turns remains a better option.
5. Ending the turn is optimal to move forward without wasting development cards unnecessarily.
LLM chose action 1: End your turn
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2563 chars)
Updated plan: 1. Roll the dice to produce resources and progress toward your goal of upgrading Node 16 to a city.
2. Save the Knight cards for later use when:
   - You can steal from an opponent with more resources.
   - You need to strategically block a key resource or disrupt threats.
   - You're aiming to claim **Largest Army** for additional VPs.
3. Focus on resource collection and positioning your gameplay toward building cities and reaching 10 VPs.
LLM chose action 1: Roll the dice
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2307 chars)
Updated plan: Objective: Since we do not have enough resources to take an immediate action such as building or upgrading, and playing a Knight card is not strategically advantageous at the moment, the best decision is to end the turn. We need to focus on accumulating more resources in the upcoming turns to upgrade our settlement at Node 16 to a city (gaining an additional 2 VP) and plan further expansions. Saving the Knight cards for later use when they can secure **Largest Army** or disrupt an opponent's strategy is a better approach.
LLM chose action 1: End your turn
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2386 chars)
Updated plan: Based on the game state, my primary goal is to acquire resources to upgrade my settlement at Node 16 to a city, which will increase production on üåæ3 and ‚õèÔ∏è8 tiles and grant me 2 VP. Since I only have 1 üåæWHEAT and no other resources, my immediate focus should be rolling the dice to generate resources. Playing a Knight card now does not directly benefit me because:
- I have no critical need to block opponents' production or steal resources at this moment.
- The Largest Army bonus requires 3 played Knight cards, so holding onto my Knights for later strategic opportunities is wise.
Thus, the best action is to roll the dice to collect resources and move closer to my objective.
LLM chose action 1: Roll the dice
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2543 chars)
Updated plan: Our immediate goal is to generate resources to upgrade the settlement at Node 16 into a city, granting 2 additional VP while improving our production on üåæ3 and ‚õèÔ∏è8 tiles. Since we currently have 1 üåæWHEAT and need additional ‚õèÔ∏èORE and üåæWHEAT for the upgrade, we must focus on accumulating resources strategically. Rolling the dice will produce resources, and playing a Knight card offers no immediate benefit for our strategy this turn. Therefore, the optimal move is to end the turn and proceed to the next roll to collect more resources.
LLM chose action 1: End your turn
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2397 chars)
Updated plan: Our plan is to upgrade the settlement at Node 16 into a city to rapidly increase resource production (üåæ3 and ‚õèÔ∏è8 tiles) and earn 2 victory points. This requires accumulating resources, specifically ‚õèÔ∏èORE and üåæWHEAT. Given our current inventory of 1 üåæWHEAT and no ‚õèÔ∏èORE, the best option is to roll the dice to generate resources. Playing a Knight card to move the robber serves no immediate benefit, as it doesn't accelerate our resource collection or VP gain. Therefore, our optimal strategic move this turn is rolling the dice (action 1).
LLM chose action 1: Roll the dice
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2402 chars)
Updated plan: Our current strategy is focused on upgrading the settlement at Node 16 into a city, as this provides a significant boost in resource production and 2 additional victory points. To achieve this, we need 3 üåæWHEAT and 2 ‚õèÔ∏èORE, but currently, we only have 1 üåæWHEAT and no ‚õèÔ∏èORE. The immediate priority is to maximize resource generation through dice rolls. Playing a Knight card does not align with this plan because it does not directly accelerate resource collection or VP gain at this moment, and no opponent is close to 10 VP or threatening control over critical resources.

Action 1, rolling the dice to generate resources, will advance the plan by providing additional cards that can help us build or trade for the needed materials.
LLM chose action 1: End your turn
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2556 chars)
Updated plan: The immediate priority is to roll the dice to gather resources. This action aligns with our goal of upgrading the settlement at Node 16 into a city, which requires an additional 2 ‚õèÔ∏èORE and 2 üåæWHEAT. Since we currently have no trade infrastructure (e.g., port) and limited resources, rolling the dice is the most logical move to potentially gain resources or generate trading opportunities. Playing a Knight card or moving the robber does not align with our current goal, as there are no pressing threats or advantageous opportunities to steal critical resources from opponents. Once resources are generated, the plan is to assess whether trading or further resource collection is needed to construct the desired city.

Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2544 chars)
LLM chose action 0: Play Knight card - Move the robber and steal a resource
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2739 chars)
Updated plan: My plan is to move the robber to block the üåæ9 tile (0, -1, 1), denying Red access to wheat and stealing one of their resources (hoping for üåæWHEAT or ‚õèÔ∏èORE). This action slows down Red's pace while targeting resources that benefit my progress. Next, I'll roll or trade using future turns to secure the remaining resources needed for my city upgrade at Node 16.
LLM chose action 2: Move robber to (0, -1, 1) and steal from RED
Only one action available. Selecting it automatically without API call.
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2200 chars)
Updated plan: 1. Roll the dice to collect resources from the remaining tiles. This optimizes chances for wheat (üåæ), ore (‚õèÔ∏è), or other key resources.
2. Collect any resources obtained during the roll phase and assess options for trade or bank conversion in subsequent moves.
3. Consider using the KNIGHT card in a future turn to secure resources or hinder an opponent closer to achieving VP dominance.
4. Proceed to prioritize building a city at Node 16 once required resources (‚õèÔ∏è and üåæ) are acquired, ensuring steady VP progress.
LLM chose action 1: Roll the dice
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2362 chars)
Updated plan: 1. End turn to focus on resource collection during the dice roll in the next phase.
2. Save Knight card for strategic use when RED or other opponents near VP milestones or blocking resource nodes becomes critical.
3. Prioritize upgrading Node 16 to a city by collecting ore (‚õèÔ∏è) and wheat (üåæ) through dice rolls or potential resource trades in coming turns.
4. Maintain defensive posture while preparing to expand VP through cities or development cards.
LLM chose action 1: End your turn
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2294 chars)
Updated plan: The current game situation is relatively early with both players at 2 victory points. RED player does not pose an immediate threat, and there‚Äôs no pressing need to play the Knight card to move the robber‚Äîespecially as RED‚Äôs resource generation is limited (particularly given their settlement placements). With that in mind, my primary objective for this turn is resource collection to work toward upgrading Node 16 into a city, which requires ore (‚õèÔ∏è) and wheat (üåæ). Rolling the dice allows for resource collection and aligns with the strategy to save the Knight card for when resource blocking or stealing becomes more critical.
LLM chose action 1: Roll the dice
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2474 chars)
Updated plan: 1. Prioritize resource collection to upgrade Node 16 into a city. Focus on acquiring 2 more Ore (‚õèÔ∏è) and 1 more Wheat (üåæ).  
2. Save the Knight card until it becomes strategically important, such as blocking a critical resource or when pursuing Largest Army.  
3. Monitor RED‚Äôs resource generation. If RED begins building aggressively, consider countermeasures such as using the robber strategically or limiting their resource access.  
4. Gradually work toward Longest Road or securing critical ports to enhance resource trade flexibility in the middle game.
LLM chose action 1: End your turn
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2400 chars)
Updated plan: 1. Roll the dice to generate resources. Aim to collect **Ore ‚õèÔ∏è** for upgrading Node 16 into a city.
2. Save your Knight card for strategic use later, either to pursue Largest Army or block RED‚Äôs progress.
3. Continue monitoring RED's actions, especially regarding their roads and settlements. Be ready to use the robber on their highest-value resource tile if they pose a significant threat.
4. Once resources are generated, trade or build as necessary to meet your objectives.
LLM chose action 1: Roll the dice
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2323 chars)
Updated plan: 1. **End Turn Now**: Roll the dice on your next turn to generate resources, aiming for ‚õèÔ∏èORE (highest number on üåæ8).
2. **Monitor RED‚Äôs Moves**: Keep an eye on RED‚Äôs resource generation and road-building progress to determine when intervention is needed.
3. **Hold onto the Knight Card**: Use it in the future for:
   - Blocking RED if they become a greater threat.
   - Building toward Largest Army (requires 3 Knight cards played).
   - Stealing a key resource when you lack a critical one.
4. **Focus on Upgrading Node 16**: Once you have 3 ‚õèÔ∏èORE and 2 üåæWHEAT, prioritize upgrading your settlement on Node 16 to a city, as it is on high-production tiles (‚õèÔ∏è8 and üåæ3).
LLM chose action 1: End your turn
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2521 chars)
Updated plan: 1. Roll the dice to attempt to generate ‚õèÔ∏èORE and other resources.
2. Monitor RED's progress and prepare to block them if they begin nearing critical VP thresholds or monopolizing resources.
3. Save the Knight card until there‚Äôs a higher threat or opportunity (e.g., securing Largest Army or blocking RED effectively).
4. Focus resources on upgrading the settlement at Node 16 to a city for VP and resource advantage.
5. Consider trading excess resources or accumulating cards for development card purchases (aiming for Largest Army points and additional VP).
LLM chose action 1: Roll the dice
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2509 chars)
Updated plan: 1. Prioritize upgrading the settlement at **Node 16** to a city for 4 VP and enhanced resource production. This will double your ‚õèÔ∏èORE income to address future city upgrades and development cards.
2. Save the Knight card until a strategic opportunity arises (e.g., blocking RED from monopolizing a key resource or slowing their progress).
3. Avoid spending resources (such as on a development card) until the city upgrade goal is met unless a critical situation arises.
LLM chose action 1: End your turn
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2329 chars)
Updated plan: 1. Roll the dice to generate resources from our settlements.

LLM chose action 1: End your turn
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2092 chars)
Updated plan: - Roll the dice to gather resources. Aim to prioritize wheat and ore production for upgrading to a city.
- Depending on the dice roll, re-evaluate after this turn and consider trading or using development cards to accelerate progress.
- Keep the knight card in reserve for blocking Red‚Äôs progress or strategically using the Largest Army bonus once you're ready to commit to it.
LLM chose action 1: Roll the dice
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2327 chars)
Updated plan: 1. Wheat and ore are priority resources for upgrading settlements to cities. Currently, there isn't enough wheat, so buying a development card could help acquire more resources or long-term bonuses like Largest Army.
2. Save the knight card for a strategic move. Playing it now won't immediately benefit you unless Red has a critical resource you desperately need.
3. Focus on upgrading settlements to cities and positioning for Longest Road or Largest Army later in the game.
4. End turn if no immediate beneficial action is viable, preparing for the next turn and resource accumulation.
LLM chose action 1: End your turn

LLM chose action 1: Roll the dice
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2219 chars)
Updated plan: 1. Move the robber to **Wheat (9)** at **(0, -1, 1)** to block RED's high-yield Wheat production.
2. Steal a resource from RED to increase my own resource pool (critical for city upgrades).
3. In future turns, focus on rolling, resource collection, and securing additional VP through development cards or city upgrades.
LLM chose action 2: Move robber to (0, -1, 1) and steal from RED
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2269 chars)
Updated plan: I will play the Knight card to move the robber onto Red‚Äôs high-yield **üåæWheat (9)** tile, stealing a resource from Red. This move:
1. Slows down Red's settlement and city building by reducing their wheat supply.
2. Potentially gives me a critical resource (brick or wood) missing from my pool.
3. Progresses me toward Largest Army, an important mid/late-game advantage for 2 VP.
LLM chose action 0: Play Knight card - Move the robber and steal a resource
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2404 chars)
Updated plan: I will move the robber to **üåæ9 (0, -1, 1)** to block Red‚Äôs wheat production and steal a resource from them. Wheat is essential for settlements and cities, and this action reduces Red‚Äôs ability to expand or upgrade. Stealing from Red also gives me a chance to acquire a scarce resource like brick or additional wood, which can be used immediately to build roads. This plan ties into maximizing resource acquisition while advancing toward Largest Army for 2 VP.
LLM chose action 1: Move robber to (1, -1, 0) and steal from RED
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2320 chars)
Updated plan: - Focus on buying development cards to work toward securing Largest Army (2 VP). With 2 knights already played, drawing another Knight Card gets us closer to achieving this goal.
- Hold off on road-building and settlement expansion until resources become more favorable.
- Reserve the move-the-robber strategy when RED becomes a bigger threat or when we can strategically block a critical resource coupled with an active action (e.g., city upgrade or settlement expansion).

Updated plan: Buying a development card is strategically sound:
- It uses up resources that are currently not enough for upgrading to a city.
- It increases the probability of securing the Largest Army (2 VP).
- Development cards might also provide valuable instant effects.
- This action aligns with the short-term goal of increasing VP and blocking opponents in future turns.

Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2074 chars)
Updated plan: Play the KNIGHT card, move the robber to RED‚Äôs wheat tile (üåæ9, which they likely need for growth), and steal a resource. This action gives a chance to gather the BRICK or SHEEP required for a settlement.
LLM chose action 0: Play Knight card - Move the robber and steal a resource
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2269 chars)
Updated plan: - The highest-impact move is to block RED‚Äôs wheat production on üåæ9. RED will struggle without wheat to build settlements or upgrade to cities, which also delays their point generation.
- Stealing from RED could yield a *brick* or *sheep*. Brick is particularly useful for building roads, and sheep can help buy development cards.
- The remaining actions either block less critical resources for RED or harm your own production, so they are not optimal.

Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2369 chars)
Updated plan: Rolling the dice is the optimal first step. This provides new resources for me and other players, potentially enabling me to progress toward upgrading my settlement to a city (requires wheat üåæ). Additionally, rolling the dice will allow me to evaluate the updated resource situation for everyone, helping me make strategic decisions for my turn.

Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2412 chars)
Updated plan: The best choice is to **move the robber to (-1, 0, 1)**, where it blocks üå≤6, RED's most productive tile. This ensures RED‚Äôs economy is weakened without affecting your production. Additionally, stealing a resource card from RED could potentially give you something useful, such as üåæWHEAT, needed to upgrade your settlement to a city in subsequent turns. This placement further maintains control of the game by limiting RED‚Äôs growth potential.
LLM chose action 2: Move robber to (-1, 0, 1) and steal from RED
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2352 chars)
Updated plan: Using the Knight card to re-block RED's productive tile, üå≤6, and steal a resource gives me the highest chance to fulfill my objective of securing a city upgrade next turn. It also ensures continued control of "Largest Army" and strategically weakens RED, my main competitor.
LLM chose action 0: Play Knight card - Move the robber and steal a resource
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2341 chars)
Updated plan: Move the robber to üå≤6 (-1, 0, 1), play the Knight to block RED‚Äôs resource generation, and steal a resource. This ensures ongoing control of Largest Army, strategically weakens RED‚Äôs building potential, and might give me a critical resource (üåæWHEAT) for my city upgrade. Aim to use resources collected next turn to upgrade my settlement.
LLM chose action 2: Move robber to (0, -1, 1) and steal from RED
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2248 chars)
Updated plan: 1. Buy a Development Card this turn. If it‚Äôs a Knight, play it next turn to extend Largest Army control and disrupt RED further.
2. Prioritize gathering 1 more üåæWHEAT in the next few turns to upgrade the settlement at node 22 to a city, which will boost resource production and add another victory point.
3. Use the Development Card strategically:
   - If a Knight, block RED‚Äôs high-producing tile (üåæ9 or üå≤6) and steal resources to slow them further.
   - If Year of Plenty or Monopoly, optimize future city progress or disrupt opponents.
4. Long-term: Build towards Longest Road contest or leverage another Development Card to secure VP.

Only one action available. Selecting it automatically without API call.
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2535 chars)
Updated plan: 1. Roll the dice to gather resources and hope for a viable roll that benefits your resource pool. With strong production tiles like ‚õèÔ∏è8 and üêë10 in your control, there‚Äôs a decent chance you'll acquire needed resources or surplus for trading. 
2. Play the Knight card only when strategically advantageous, such as when RED threatens your position, or wait until you roll and assess resource availability. 
3. Focus on upgrading node 22 next turn to a city for long-term resource advantage and immediate VP gain. Then, move toward securing Longest Road or purchasing more Development Cards for additional VP.
LLM chose action 1: Roll the dice
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2726 chars)
Updated plan: The priority is to build a city at Node 22 for +1 VP and üêë10 production. To do this, prioritize gathering üåæWHEAT. Trading 4 ‚õèÔ∏èORE for 1 üåæWHEAT is the most strategic action to prepare for the city upgrade. Next turn, focus on obtaining the remaining üåæWHEAT either via dice rolls or using development cards if necessary.

Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2216 chars)
Updated plan: 1. Roll the dice to try and gather resources (especially ‚õèÔ∏èORE and üåæWHEAT).
2. Use any resulting trades or development card purchases to make progress toward upgrading Node 22 to a city.
3. Play the Knight card strategically in a later turn to block RED or if you need to steal a specific resource.
LLM chose action 1: Roll the dice
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2209 chars)
Updated plan: Given the current situation:
- Using the Knight card now has limited short-term benefits unless I steal a highly useful resource.
- RED is not an immediate threat at 2 VP, and their resource availability is unclear.
- Ending the turn is a safer play, allowing me to proceed with the next roll where I might naturally gather the needed resources for further actions.

**Plan for Next Turn:**
1. Roll the dice and attempt to gather üåæWHEAT and ‚õèÔ∏èORE.
2. If missing resources remain, consider purchasing a development card or progressing the city-building plan.
3. Use the Knight card strategically when blocking resources will have a significant impact or when stealing is more likely to yield needed resources.
LLM chose action 1: End your turn
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2615 chars)
Updated plan: 1. Roll the dice to attempt acquiring resources. Specifically, seek üåæWHEAT and ‚õèÔ∏èORE to work toward a city upgrade.
2. If the roll yields no useful resources, consider trading or using the Knight card strategically next turn to unblock the ‚õèÔ∏è8 hex or steal a needed resource.
3. Avoid using the Knight card prematurely unless it's tactically advantageous.
LLM chose action 1: Roll the dice
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2266 chars)
Updated plan: 1. End this turn without using the Knight card.
2. On the next turn:
    - Roll the dice and see if it provides the resources for a city upgrade (2 üåæWHEAT, 1 ‚õèÔ∏èORE needed).
    - Reassess whether to use the Knight card based on the dice roll and opponent position.
3. Continue aiming for 10 VP through city upgrades, Longest Road (if feasible), and potentially another development card.
LLM chose action 1: End your turn
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2331 chars)
Updated plan: 1. Roll the dice to gain resources and determine your next move based on the roll outcome.
2. Focus on upgrading your remaining settlement to a city for +2 VP.
3. Track opponents‚Äô resource development carefully, particularly RED‚Äôs potential to expand roads or build a city.
4. Save the Knight card until either:
   - You can deny an opponent critical resources (e.g., RED building on key hexes).
   - You need the resource boost to push toward a victory point milestone.
5. Keep flexibility for considering another Development Card purchase, aiming for another VP card or Knight to secure Largest Army.
LLM chose action 1: Roll the dice
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2736 chars)
Updated plan: 1. Move the robber to üß±4 (hex (1, -1, 0)) to block RED‚Äôs brick production, hindering their road-building and settlement expansion.
2. Steal from RED to try and obtain a resource of value to BLUE (brick or wheat).
3. Look for opportunities to upgrade a settlement to a city (requires wheat and ore), while ensuring RED cannot consolidate Longest Road further.

Updated plan: By buying a development card, I aim to strategically push closer toward the 10 VP finish line. A Victory Point development card will win the game instantly once I reveal my reserved VP card. If it‚Äôs a Knight card, I can block opponents like RED more effectively or secure resources. Other utility cards may help address my resource shortages or expand opportunities.

Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2303 chars)
Updated plan: - Currently, my best path to victory is to **maximize resource collection**, escalate to **9 VP**, and **reveal my hidden VP card** for the win. This requires a firm control of Largest Army and access to resources for either:
  - A **third city** (4 VP from cities total, +2 VP Largest Army, +1 VP hidden card = 10 VP).
  - A **new settlement** and possible development card draw.
- Playing the Knight card offers immediate control, but since RED is not yet a threat, I will roll the dice instead to maximize potential winnings.

Updated plan: 1. **Play the Knight Card:**
   - Move the robber to üåæ9 (blocking RED‚Äôs wheat production).
   - Steal one resource from RED (hopefully something critical like üå≤wood, üåæwheat, or üß±brick), further disrupting their strategy while potentially aiding yours.

2. **Buy a Development Card:**
   - After gaining a stolen resource, if you gather the right resources, trade as needed (if necessary) to buy a new card. Development cards have a high potential for **Victory Points**, another **Knight card** (bolstering Largest Army), or utility cards like Monopoly or Road Building.

3. **Reassess Next Turn:**
   - Depending on the stolen resource and the new card, reassess your position for maximizing VP gains.
LLM chose action 1: End your turn
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2634 chars)
Updated plan: Given the current game state, the optimal plan involves rolling the dice to produce resources. You currently have 5 ‚õèÔ∏èORE, and you need üåæWHEAT and üß±BRICK to advance toward building new settlements or upgrading to cities. Rolling the dice maximizes the chance to gather key resources or increase your trading options.  

After rolling, the strategy will depend on the outcome:  
1. If you accumulate resources to build, focus on expanding settlements or upgrading cities to increase victory points directly.  
2. If resources remain insufficient for direct building, consider buying development cards to potentially gain additional victory points, Monopoly cards, or knights to maintain Largest Army.
LLM chose action 1: Roll the dice
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2845 chars)
Updated plan: 1. Expedite generating resources to enable settlement construction or city upgrades. Priority resources: üåæWHEAT, üß±BRICK.
2. Trade excess ‚õèÔ∏èORE for critical missing resources. Current focus should be üåæWHEAT for city upgrades (since you already have ‚õèÔ∏èORE).
3. Preserve the Road Building card for a critical moment (e.g., Longest Road contest or strategic settlement placement).
4. Play patiently‚Äîavoid using the robber for now since RED is not an immediate threat to your advancement.
LLM chose action 4: Trade port: Give 4 ‚õèÔ∏èORE for 1 üåæWHEAT
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2429 chars)
Updated plan: The plan is to accumulate resources for either:
1. Upgrading a settlement to a city (most efficient path to 10 VP).
2. Building new settlements to secure additional resource types.
3. Contesting Longest Road if feasible, though it is a secondary priority compared to city upgrades and new settlements.

Ending the turn now will enable resource collection and analysis of potential new opportunities in the next round. Save the Road Building card for when its use can enable a decisive move toward settlement or road expansion.
LLM chose action 1: End your turn
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2478 chars)
Updated plan: To win, we must stay focused on these priorities:
1. **Upgrade a third settlement to a city**: Cities provide the fastest path to 10 VP through resource production and direct VP gain.
2. **Acquire/build new settlements**: Settlements provide diverse resource generation to support future upgrades or infrastructure.
3. **Plan for Longest Road (if necessary)**: If RED advances significantly toward 10 VP later, use the Road Building card strategically to interrupt or contest Longest Road.
LLM chose action 1: Roll the dice
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2531 chars)
Updated plan: - Buy a development card this turn. Use any utility cards immediately if they provide crucial benefits (resources via Year of Plenty or Monopoly, or Longest Road intervention via Road Building). 
- Focus on upgrading cities as the next major VP target.
- Monitor RED's road-building progress to ensure Longest Road remains contestable if necessary.

Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2632 chars)
Updated plan: 1. Roll the dice first to establish immediate resource gains.
2. Reassess following the dice roll:
   - Use Monopoly if it gives a significant advantage (target important resources based on roll outcomes).
   - Use Road Building to strategically expand your road network, threatening Longest Road or accessing a port.
   - Invest in Development Cards if resource production allows.
3. The focus for the next turns will be:
   - Building more settlements or upgrading cities to gain points.
   - Contesting Longest Road only if feasible without overextending.
LLM chose action 6: Roll the dice
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2846 chars)
Updated plan: 1. Analyze the available options:
   - My current VP is 6, with 2 from Largest Army and 4 from cities.
   - Opponent RED is far behind with only 4 VP, but they have the Longest Road bonus.
   - I have key Development Cards like Monopoly, Road Building, and a hidden Victory Point card to leverage.
   - My immediate resources are limited: 3 üêë (not enough to build or upgrade directly).
   - The best short-term strategy would be either to secure more resources or leverage my Development Cards strategically.

2. Evaluate key actions:
   - Playing the **Monopoly card** could bring significant resources if timed well. I‚Äôll consider which resource is likely stockpiled by opponents (especially RED), targeting key resources like üåæwheat or ‚õèÔ∏èore. However, I currently lack information about resource distributions.
   - Playing the **Road Building card** could help me contest the Longest Road. However, with only 2 roads so far, overcoming RED's 7-segment road network is unlikely in the short term. This would require more setup.
   - Ending the turn (without action) is not ideal, as my current resources aren‚Äôt sufficient to make a big move on the next turn.
   - Investing in Development Cards isn‚Äôt an option, as I lack the required üêëüåæ‚õèÔ∏è resources.

3. Strategic focus:
   - Since RED likely has üåæ(wheat) from their proximity to üåæ9 and üå≤6 tiles, it makes sense to use the **Monopoly card to target wheat**. Wheat is highly valuable for upgrading to cities or purchasing Development Cards, so monopolizing it would cripple Red and position me for future turns.

2. Use Monopoly immediately in the subsequent turn if resource availability aligns with your goals (likely üåæWHEAT or ‚õèÔ∏èORE for city upgrades or Development Cards).
3. Focus future builds on upgrading to cities or building toward key ports/resources for an end-game path to victory.
LLM chose action 1: Roll the dice

   - Analyze resource availability across all players.
   - Use Monopoly on **‚õèÔ∏èORE** (or **üß±BRICK** if more beneficial) to enable building a City or expanding settlements.
3. Use **Road Building** when expansion becomes strategically important, either toward:
   - Ports (to enhance trading efficiency).
   - Resource-rich areas, like üß±4 or üåæ9 tiles.
4. Aim for 10 VP by expanding cities, playing the VP/card, and potentially contesting Longest Road if resources align.

Updated plan: Prioritize rolling the dice to collect resources. Focus on accumulating Wheat üåæ and Brick üß± to push for settlement expansion. After rolling, reassess options based on the resources collected. Using the Knight card is better saved for a turn when its impact will disrupt more opponent progress or secure critical resources. Continue keeping RED's expansion in check strategically.
LLM chose action 1: Roll the dice
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2435 chars)
Updated plan: 1. End the turn to roll for resources on the next turn while observing opponents' moves.
2. Prioritize gathering Wheat üåæ and Brick üß± to build settlements in future turns.
3. Maintain control of Largest Army by saving Knight cards for critical robber placement.
4. Consider blocking RED's critical resource tiles or expansion paths once they become a more imminent threat.
5. Gradually build toward 10 VP via settlements, cities, or development cards.
LLM chose action 1: End your turn
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2502 chars)
Updated plan: 1. Roll the dice to progress toward resource collection and observe opponents' moves.
2. Gather Wheat üåæ and Brick üß± for critical building opportunities in future turns.
3. Maintain Largest Army by preserving Knight cards for impactful robber placement.
4. Use development cards strategically to secure VP in the endgame (especially Knight for Largest Army or VP cards for milestone victory points).
LLM chose action 1: Roll the dice
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2454 chars)
Updated plan: 1. Hold onto the Knight card to use it for a strategic impact later, such as blocking critical RED resource access or stealing an essential resource during a decisive turn.
2. Maintain focus on gaining resources for city building or additional development cards. Your immediate VP progress hinges on either:
   a) Drawing a VP card from the development card deck.
   b) Upgrading another city for an additional +1 VP.
3. Monitor RED‚Äôs potential for expanding **Longest Road** or contesting **Largest Army**.
4. Prioritize ending the turn to preserve resources and development card options for the next turn.
5. Anticipate that RED is lagging in VP and likely plotting to secure either Longest Road dominance or valuable new placements.
LLM chose action 1: End your turn
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2787 chars)
Updated plan: Roll the dice to collect resources for upgrading to cities or buying development cards. Analyze the roll and adapt accordingly. Preserve the Knight card for strategic use in future turns.

LLM chose action 0: Play Knight card - Move the robber and steal a resource
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2456 chars)
Updated plan: Move the robber to (0, -1, 1) to block RED's Wheat (üåæ) production from 9 and steal a resource to potentially benefit BLUE. This disrupts RED's ability to upgrade settlements and aids BLUE's long-term resource needs.
LLM chose action 2: Move robber to (0, -1, 1) and steal from RED
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2485 chars)
Updated plan: - Spend 1 üêëSHEEP, 1 üåæWHEAT, and 1 ‚õèÔ∏èORE to buy a Development Card.
- The probability of drawing a Victory Point card is decent, and drawing a Knight further secures Largest Army. This action aligns with the goal of reaching 10 VP quickly.

Game state prepared for LLM (length: 3335 chars)
Updated plan: - Use the **Year of Plenty** card strategically to gain resources needed to advance actions contributing to VP.
- Given the current resource shortage, the priority will likely be Wheat (**üåæ**) and Ore (**‚õèÔ∏è**) to move towards buying Development Cards or upgrading a settlement to a city.
- If I can secure a Victory Point Development Card from the purchase, I will be at **9 VP**, requiring only 1 more VP to win.
- Alternatively, acquiring Sheep alongside other resources can supplement both Development Cards and Settlement construction.
- Play defensively to ensure opponents do not block critical progress.
LLM chose action 10: Play Year of Plenty card - Take two resources: ('WHEAT', 'ORE')
Only one action available. Selecting it automatically without API call.
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2870 chars)
Updated plan: Move the robber to the üåæ9 tile to block RED's Wheat production and steal a resource from them. This will hinder their ability to grow while potentially giving us the Wheat or Ore we need to progress toward a city or Development Card purchase.
LLM chose action 1: Move robber to (1, -1, 0) and steal from RED
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2308 chars)
Updated plan: - Buy a development card this turn. Aim to draw a Victory Point if possible (50% chance for non-Knight cards). 
- If a Knight is drawn, continue using it to block RED's key resources like Wheat (üåæ9) and slow their development.
- Expand cities or settlements once resources increase. Potential city target: node 16 (üåæ3, ‚õèÔ∏è8).
- Maintain Largest Army bonus while blocking RED's Wheat production to limit their growth.

Only one action available. Selecting it automatically without API call.
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2467 chars)
Updated plan: - Since securing new resources is critical, **roll the dice** and aim to produce ORE (‚õèÔ∏è8) or WHEAT (üåæ3). These resources are essential for purchasing development cards or upgrading settlements to cities.
- Keep the Knight card in reserve for use later. Using it now may disrupt RED slightly, but you don't gain critical resources by playing it. Save it for moments when it strategically stops RED from gaining key resources during their turn or when you can take advantage of the robber in a better way.
- Once resources are acquired (if luck is on your side), prioritize:
  1. Buying development cards (chance for VP, Knight, or valuable action).
  2. Upgrading cities when more resources are available, focusing on high-yield tiles (‚õèÔ∏è8, üåæ3) for double production.
  3. Blocking RED's critical resource tiles when it will have maximum impact.
LLM chose action 1: Roll the dice

LLM chose action 1: End your turn
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2237 chars)
Updated plan: Roll the dice, gather resources, and evaluate the outcome. If sufficient resources are collected, prioritize either building a settlement or purchasing a development card to gain more VP and increase resource generation or capabilities.
LLM chose action 1: Roll the dice
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2301 chars)
Updated plan: The best course of action is to play the Knight card [0], move the robber to target RED (the second strongest player) at a tile they rely heavily on, and try stealing a wheat resource. Wheat is critical for upgrading my city, which would secure 1 VP and push me to 10 victory points for the win.
LLM chose action 0: Play Knight card - Move the robber and steal a resource
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2573 chars)
Updated plan: Move the robber to the üåæ9 tile (0, -1, 1) to block RED's wheat production. This will slow down RED's progress and give BLUE a chance to steal üåæWHEAT, which is crucial for upgrading to a city and reaching 10 VP.

Updated plan: 1. **Goal:** Build a city on your next turn to secure **10 VP** and win the game.
2. **Step 1:** Use the maritime trade port to exchange **4 üêëSHEEP for 1 ‚õèÔ∏èORE**. This gives you the required resources for the city: 2 üåæWHEAT + 3 ‚õèÔ∏èORE.
3. **Step 2:** On your following turn, use these resources to upgrade one of your settlements to a city (preferably at node 16, as it produces üåæ3 and ‚õèÔ∏è8, which are critical resources for future expansion).
4. **Step 3:** Monitor RED‚Äôs progress. RED is currently limited by their resource diversity and production, so they are unlikely to pose an immediate threat.
5. **Step 4:** End your turn after completing this trade and use resources optimally next turn for victory.

Updated plan: Since you already have **2 hidden Victory Points** and access to resources to upgrade a settlement, focus on completing the city upgrade during your next turn. Preserve resources rather than buying a Development Card, which doesn‚Äôt immediately further your victory condition.
LLM chose action 0: End your turn
Only one action available. Selecting it automatically without API call.
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2379 chars)
Updated plan: Since your hidden VP cards already put you at 8 total Victory Points, your focus must be on accelerative actions that could secure the remaining two points. Buying Development Cards is the optimal action this turn because:
1. You have the resources to afford it.
2. Development Cards offer potential Victory Points (or support through knights to solidify Largest Army).
3. Your current resource configuration does not allow any settlement or city upgrades this turn.

Ending the turn without buying a Development Card inhibits progress toward 10 VP and wastes resources.

2. If the card drawn is a Victory Point, you win immediately when your VP is revealed.
3. If the card is not a Victory Point, it could still provide strategic benefits for the next turn.

Updated plan: Since we are already at 9 VP (6 on board + 3 hidden Victory Point cards), the most efficient path to victory is to aim for one additional Victory Point. The best approach is **to stay prepared for resource acquisition** or future development card purchases if rolling the dice yields favorable results. This turn, stabilizing our resource economy without prematurely playing non-Victory Point development cards is key.
LLM chose action 1: Roll the dice
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2554 chars)
Updated plan: Considering the current resource state and victory point tally, the best approach is to end the turn and prepare for the next roll to gather resources or purchase development cards to achieve the final VP. Focus remains on securing the 10th VP via city upgrades, development cards, or blocking RED strategically if necessary in future turns.
LLM chose action 1: End your turn
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2473 chars)
Updated plan: 1. Roll the dice to allow resource production, which gets you closer to gathering the resources needed for your final VP (either through upgrading a city or buying a development card).
2. Monitor the resource output for all players. Key resources to look out for are **ore** and **wheat**, which are needed for city upgrades, or other resources that can be traded for these items.
3. If RED becomes a more immediate threat in subsequent turns, consider playing the Knight card to strategically block them.
4. Focus on winning this turn or setting up a winning play for the next turn.

2. **Play a Knight card** to block RED's üåæ9 tile (already blocked) or a critical tile like ‚õèÔ∏è8, stealing a resource from RED to slow their city-building potential.  
3. Set up resources for a future win condition‚Äîbuilding a road/settlement or upgrading a city‚Äîusing port trades.  
4. Use our resources wisely to maintain flexibility for next turn.
LLM chose action 3: Trade port: Give 4 ‚õèÔ∏èORE for 1 üåæWHEAT
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2629 chars)
Updated plan: 1. Play defensively to **delay RED's progress** while positioning yourself for an immediate victory on your next turn.
   - Since you lack enough resources to build or upgrade, buy a development card to maximize flexibility and defense. A Knight card would allow you to block RED and disrupt them before their next turn.
2. Ensure resources needed for a win (potentially via trading or resource gathering) are ready by next turn.
3. Reveal Victory Point cards at the end of your next turn to secure the win.
