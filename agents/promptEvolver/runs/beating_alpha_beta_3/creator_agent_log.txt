You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN. That means 10 victory points.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>
6. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively
7. Think about the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- üîç marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

## Here a log of results as they are found:

- We were able to create a Python package that implements the Game's core logic.
  No fancy networkX or numpy models, just good old Python objects and readable
  algorithms. Fully tested!

- We build a UI to go along with it. Not only useful for debugging, but if robot
  comes to life, we may want to allow users to play against it!

- WeightedRandomPlayer consistently wins to RandomPlayer.

- ValueFunction exposed that copying game with `deepcopy` is slow. Potential
  road block for Tree-Search algorithms (e.g. mini-max). Played OK. Too slow
  to benchmark really. Computed features.

- Started playing with DRL approaches. Threw away useful features (like production)
  and used RAW representation (someone said automatic feature engineering).

- Started with Policy learning using "Cross Entropy Method" here: ...
  Noticed we face class-imbalance. Infra was still inmature.
  Wasn't getting a meaningful LOSS, so scrapped it.

- Started with Deep Q-Learning. Seemed we were able to achieve a reasonable LOSS
  (MAE=0.05) on a "Discounted Return" with `DISCOUNT_FACTOR=0.999`. Played
  terrible tho. Not better than random (maybe actually worst).

- Tried Deep Q-Learning only on top-examples. Nothing interesting.

- Tried Deep Learning ValueFunction, and doing greedy algorithm on it. Won 63%
  of the games against RandomPlayers. Single-epoch, 32-batch, 75,000 samples.
  RAW Features. Games take around 30s tho.

- Using hand-crafted production and expansion features, we achieved 0.15 MAE.

- Using AutoKeras on hand-crafted production and expansion features yielded
  something like 0.01 MSE. But in performance, still played just like Random
  tho. Did not perform better.

- Got very good performance using VICTORY_POINTS_RETURN with 30GB data set,
  batch size = 256, batchnormalization => dense(64) => dense(1) value func.
  MSE loss, adam with lr=0.001,clipnorm=1. 1 epoch. Achieved ~2.0 MAE.

- First BoardTensor model seems to overfit (places on same nodes). ~200,000 params
  with less than 1,000,000 samples. Still, after normalizing wins 44/100 games
  against random players. NEXT: Try simpler model and more data.

- Second BoardTensor model (adam(0.001,clipnorm=1),
  input1 = 21x11x16 => batchnorm => 1 filter-cnn kernel=3 linear => flatten
  input2 = num-features
  model = input1 + input2 => 64 relu => 32 relu => 1 linear.
  MSE loss on VP RETURN. Batch=256, epoch=1, 2M samples.
  Performed comparable to simple 2-layer on 1M samples.

- We prototyped the Playouts Theorem. It indeed gives a good value function to
  play out random games from a given state. Pretty stable at at least 50 games.
  25 games there was some flakyness... (could stable out given we do this)
  many times. Takes around 0.3 secs to play a random game to completion.

- MCTS (doing 25 playouts for each possible action) wins almost every
  game against randoms, but it takes a while. And it seems some high-branching
  factor situations make it take longer (e.g. monopoly play, late road building).
  Here some results:

- It seems learning the simple problem of whether a player produces OWS
  works well with 1 filter of size 3, linear, unit_norm, and l2-reg. =>
  flat => 1 dense sigmoid. Adding a 0.2 dropout before 1 dense sigmoid
  seemed to help a lot to not overfit. Next steps would like to separate
  edges and nodes from channels (it seems it confuses these two), and add
  max-pooling in an attempt to learn hierarchy (OWS-node, variaty-node, etc...).
  Does EPOCHS help? EPOCHS=2 overfits. Well we get TRAIN_ACC=90%+,TEST_ACC=60%.
- No class weight, simple 1 3x3 filter CNN seems to learn, just needs more data.
- No class weight, using autokerastuner arrives at 96 neurons 1-layer 0.0001 LR.
  Achieves 57% accuracy (using log-loss as objective).

- Practicing on simple problem of given a 2x2 array, trying to learn to count
  the number of 1s. it performs well. With num-samples=100,000, epoch=1,
  2-32-relu layers gets mae: 0.6571, val_mae: 0.0301. Default Adam, with loss=mse.
  With 1 more order of magnitude of data, we can get 1 order of magnitude less error. (val_mae: 0.0034)
  Next steps:

  - Use auto keras to see how much better can we get.
    This achieved val_mae: 0.0496. Not much significant improvement.
  - Use CNN to see how it affects counting.
    This improves model to 0.009 mae (with 100,000 samples). note params increased
    from 4k to 65k (from normal NN to 32-filter CNN). 1-filter got val_mae: 1.3479.
    PROBLEM SOLVED!
  - Next steps: complicated by adding planes of random data. Does it confuse NN?
    Adding 3 extra random data layers, did not confuse NN. Still achieves mae~0.004.
  - Next step: Can we learn AND'ed points across channels?
    Seems that CNN behaves better here (1 3x3 filter) as expected since problem
    is translation invariant. AutoKeras yields a very deep model. DNN get to ~80%
    val_accuracy. CNN gets to 90%+. They seem sensitive to initial values tho.
  - Next step: Does adding random layers disturb the AND learning?
    Yes. It seems CNN have trouble with noisy channels.
  - Next step: What if we add some 2s as well... (here we prove we could learn count-vp-problem)
    Yes. Can learn (without noise channels), to val_mae: 0.1147.

- We fixed a bug in the tensor board representation. Using only the first 13 planes
  allows a CNN to learn if a player has OWS successfully (88% val_accuracy). Results:

- Regroup on Jan 2021.

  - We achieve mae: 5.4591e-11, val_mae: 2.4891e-04 with a deep model on RepA,
    and DISCOUNTED_RETURN. But model doesnt perform well in games. 50 game
    epochs, aiming to use 1K games, but early stopping.
    loss: 1.2714e-20 - mae: 5.4591e-11 - val_loss: 3.2321e-07 - val_mae: 2.4807e-04
  - Similar results with Rep B. But it played terribly...

- Online MCTS is looking promising. Did a first run with a 1-neuron model (normalizing
  features), playouts=25, training everytime there are >1K samples in batches of 64.
  There was a bug in the data as well (was creating samples like root-node => mcts result
  for all branches, instead of branch-node => mcts result). It didn't win games,
  but there seemed to be VP improvement from 2 VP avg to 5 VP avg, in 100 games.

- A heuristic player plays better than WeightedRandom (but we have a memory leak).
  Memory leak was due to @functools.lru with copied boards.

- Simple MiniMax Algorithm takes too long... ~20segs per decision,
  which makes for 30 min games. Even if de-bugged the implementation seems pretty slow.
  As such, alpha-pruning doesnt seem wont help much (even if cuts time by half).

- Using PyPy (removing TF and other Python 3.9 features), speeds up playing random
  games by around 33%s. (1000s games w/CPython3.9 took 2m52s and 1000s games
  w/PyPy3.7 took 1m52s).

- Looked at RL Python Frameworks. keras-rl doesn't work with TF2.0, same with
  stable-baselines. Many undocumented or hard to use. Best one seems to be
  tensorforce. TF-Agents seems possible, but pretty raw API right now.
  Hard to use tensorforce because not clear how to specify Rep B mixed model.

- VictoryPoint player is better than Random (much better) and WeightedRandom (not so much).

- Where able to do a somewhat strong NN with clipnorm=1, 2 layers, 32 and 8 neurons
  batch norm of inputs and batches of 32. 7,000,000 samples divided in 10 epochs.
  Still this player doesnt beat hand-heuristic. (ValueFunctionPlayer). This used
  DISCOUNTED_RETURN. MSE as loss and LR=0.0001.
  `loss: 1.5084e-07 - mae: 2.1945e-04 - val_loss: 4.2677e-05 - val_mae: 5.0571e-04`

- Did a RandomForest, but data seems wrong. Played very poorly. Tried again with
  all Rep 1 features; no dice. Hard to analyze... Probably overfitted. Keeps ending turn.

- Scikit Regression player doesnt win, because just gets a lot of wheat production,
  builds roads to extend as much as they can (dont hold to build settlements),
  place robber on themselves, dont trade (same value); no hand-diversity features.

- Greedy (even when budgeted to run same num playouts as MCTS) does better than
  MCTS.

- ValueFunction 2.0 (using EFFECTIVE_PRODUCTION and REACHABILITY features) plays
  pretty strongly. Better than Greedy=25 and MCTS=100.

- AlphaBeta(depth=2) plays stronger than ValueFunction 2.0. Using VF2.0 as heuristic.

- Tried Bayesian Optimization to search better weights for hand-crafted heuristic,
  but seems too slow and inefective.

- Note: In a random game, 38.6% of actions are roll (action=0), 27% are end turn (action=5557).

## Future Work:

- Should probably try to do NN player with better tuning (more layers, different label).

- Interested in seeing MCTS play in real life. Should compare G10 to MCTS50

- Work on performance.

- Generate data as 1 Big CSV per representation. (samples + labels), (bt + labels)

- Idea: Make test-evaluation framework. Use gaussian optimization to find best weights.

- Attempt DQN Tutorial with TF2.0 Summary Module, to see progress. If works,
  adapt to Catan-DQN Tutorial.

- Paperspace: Dockerfile: Install catanatron, and Pipenv dependencies, so that we can
  experiment/play.py, have a Game in the Overview.ipyn and run a catan-dqn.py job faster
  (should only do when can confirm Data and DQN approach improves...).

- Simplify ROBBER_ACTIONS to "Play Knight" to player with most points.

- Learn from offline MCTS data, using Rep B. (Seems slow to generate MCTS labeled data).

- Use tensorforce (since TF2.0 compatible and DQN Agent will be bug-free).
  Seems hard because API is not too easy.

- Learn an offline DQN (using VPs) with Rep B. That is, use Reward as label (
  so that early moves don't get a 1)

- Consider implementing AlphaBetaPruning to speed up game. Although
  it seems speedup at best might be 1/2 the time, which still doesn't cut it.
  Unless we speed up game copying...

- Actually use MCTS result to improve network. Do online so that we can
  see progress.

  - Add epsilon-playing to ensure we are exploring space. (Well, I think the fact
    that we have random players fixed does this job for now, since we collect
    samples from their perspective as well).

- Play a game against Greedy player. Play against Greedy with look-ahead.

- Idea: Sum up "enemy features". Make it look like its 1 enemy.

- Try Online - DQN approach (using PythonProgramming Tutorial).
- Use Value-Estimator with a tree-lookahead alpha-beta pruning.
- Try CNN-action space. (i.e. BUILD_SETTLEMENT at 3 means plane-board-tensor)
- Try policy-learning and q-learning on simpler action space.
- Try Cross-Entropy approach (using only top X features and dropping END TURNs).
- Try AlphaZero single-neural network learning (state) => (value, action).

  - Use in tree-search (take N top actions to explore via RollOuts).

- Try putting in features back. Is this VPlayer better than Raw Features one?
- Can autokeras use tf.Dataset?
- Using autokeras with whole 1Gb dataset is better?
- Does playing against your V1 self, training on that, improve?
- Try Q-Learning but, iterate on playing, learning, playing, learning... e-greedy.

### Performance Improvements

- Separate immutable state from Board (Map?), so that copying is a lot faster, and
  can cache functions (say node-production) globally (across game copies).

### Toy problems

- Idea: hot-encode 5 layers per player (one per resource) to denote income and buildings.
  then use 3D convolution of size WxHx5 and stride=5 (to not overlap)
- An easier problem would be to count house/city VPs (only uses 1 plane). count-vp-problem.
- Next medium problem will be, guess wheat production (to see if combining the two planes).

## Catan State Space Analysis

- Each tile can be any resource = 19. So 19! resource-tile decisions.
- Each tile must be one of the numbers. So 18! (desert has no number)
- There are 9 ports so: 9! ways of ordering them.
  Finally, there are 19! \* 18! \* 9! boards in Catan. So like 10^38 boards.

Configurations states inside it are upper bounded by:

- Each player has at most 5 houses. 54 choose 5 are ways of putting all 5 houses.
  54 choose 4 are ways of putting 4 houses. Sum\_{i in [0, 5]} (54 choose i) = 3.5M.
  Actually, better ignore colors and consider all 20 houses. So:
  `sum([comb(54, i) for i in range(21)]) = 683689022885551`.
  Actually, including cities, then there are 9 pieces per player that can be in board.
  `sum([comb(54, i) for i in range(4*9 + 1)]) = 17932673125137243`
- There are 14 roads per player so 56 roads in total. 72 possible locations so:
  `sum([comb(72, i) for i in range(56)]) = 4722360822358286581300`

If we include number of cards that makes the state space much much bigger,
but in practice its a lot less (its rare for a player to have 20+ cards). So
just using the Board States we see there are:
10^38 boards. Each with 17932673125137243 \* 4722360822358286581300 configurations,
which is almost like 10^37, so we are talking around 10^68 just possible board-states.

In terms of cards-in-hand state. Assuming on average players have 5 cards in hand,
then out of the 19*5 resource cards we start with, we are talking about:
`comb(19*4, 20) = 1090013712241956540` (or 10^18).

Grand-ballpark estimate is ~**10^100** states in Catan. Chess is 10^123.
Go is 10^360. Number of atoms in the Universe is 10^78.

### Branching Factor

The following stats suggests the decision tree players navigate usually has
around ~5 branches, and very few times something huge like 279 branches
(trading options after a monopoly(?), late road-building card(?)).

```
Branching Factor Stats:
count    94010.000000
mean         4.643772
std          7.684072
min          1.000000
25%          1.000000
50%          1.000000
75%          5.000000
max        279.000000
```

### Average Num Turns and Num Decisions

1000 Random Games result in:

```
AVG Ticks: 959.049
AVG Turns: 275.261
AVG Duration: 0.18782643032073976
AVG VPS: RandomPlayer:Foo[RED] 5.851
AVG VPS: RandomPlayer:Bar[BLUE] 5.871
AVG VPS: RandomPlayer:Baz[ORANGE] 5.766
AVG VPS: RandomPlayer:Qux[WHITE] 6.086
```

So each player makes around 70 decisions per game. Averages around 5.9 VPs per game.

### Performance Bits

- Creating an array with `np.array` is much faster than `tf.convert_to_tensor` and
  `pd.DataFrame` or `pd.Series`.

```
In [1]: timeit.timeit("np.array(array)", setup="import numpy as np; array = list([i for i in range(1000)])", number=1000)
Out[1]: 0.055867002985905856
In [2]: timeit.timeit("tf.convert_to_tensor(array)", setup="import tensorflow as tf; array = list([i for i in range(1000)])", number=1000)
Out[2]: 0.20465714897727594
In [3]: timeit.timeit("pd.DataFrame(array)", setup="import pandas as pd; array = list([i for i in range(1000)])", number=1000)
Out[3]: 0.333771405974403
```

- Game.copy() took 45% of the time when using ValueFunctionPlayer (5.7s).
- 3/21/21 playable_actions is 50% of time when running random 1v1s.
  Accounts for 7s in a 14s 100-game run.

Time Estimates:

- AB2 takes 0.01 seconds per tick.

  Args:
    new_text: You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state, use strategies based on high-impact moves, and generate a clear step toward achieving victory.

Rules:
1. Analyze the game state carefully: prioritize scarce resources, production rates, trades, and impactful placements.
2. Think step-by-step. Project results for 2-3 turns ahead and factor in future resource availability.
3. Aim for 10 victory points.
4. Put your selected action (an integer corresponding to the action number) inside a box like \boxed{5}.
5. Develop and refine strategic plans periodically using <plan> tags:
   <plan>Prioritize city development at nodes rich in üåæWHEAT and ‚õèORE, secure ports with diversified production, and maximize development card benefits</plan>
6. Learn from the recent resource log and modify strategic plans accordingly.

Advanced Strategies:
- Diversity in resource collection is critical; ensure coverage across üåæWHEAT, ‚õèORE, üß±BRICK, üå≤WOOD, and üêëSHEEP for stable gameplay.
- Prioritize developing cities at high-frequency dice rolls and critical long-term production points.
- Early ports acquisitions (2:1 or 3:1) can shift resource bottlenecks into benefits.
- Use robbers strategically: block tiles with high value for opponents and rob tactically.
- Use Development Cards effectively; focus on Largest Army as mid-game dominance.

Optimized Plan Outline:
- Start aggressive in securing high-yield hex grid nodes.
- Limit opponent expansions by cutting off road networks strategically.
- Gradually balance between immediate settlements versus long-term cities/goals.
Game Board Clues: üß±üìùüí° Read hex coordinates often and compute robust probabilities before your next positional actions.

Victory Mentality: Adapt strategic flexibility and analyze whether branching nodes threaten your path to 10 VPs straightforwardly. Integrate trade-offs backed success scenarios consistently.

- **Mid-term**: Prioritize city upgrades at high-production nodes (e.g. üåæWHEAT and ‚õèORE at node 6).
- **Long-term**: Acquire Development Cards to maintain Largest Army and aim for Victory Points. Use robber to block RED‚Äôs critical hexes (üåæ5 and üå≤8).

Updated plan: - **Short-term**: Focus on securing Longest Road while setting up for a new settlement near üß±9 or üåæ5.
- **Mid-term**: Upgrade settlements into cities at high-frequency nodes like üåæ5 or üåæ6.
- **Long-term**: Continue investing in Development Cards for Largest Army maintenance and possible Victory Points. Use robber to block RED's strongest tiles (üåæ5 or üåæ8).

Updated plan: Prioritize building the city at node 13 to increase VP and produce ‚õèÔ∏èORE at a more stable rate. Use recurring ore advantage to amplify development card acquisition (Largest Army or Victory Points) and aim for ports as fallback strategies. Monitor RED‚Äôs moves closely to counter Longest Road expansions strategically.
