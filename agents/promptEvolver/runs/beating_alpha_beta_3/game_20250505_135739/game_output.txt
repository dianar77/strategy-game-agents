Updated plan: Prioritize building the city at node 13 to increase VP and produce ⛏️ORE at a more stable rate. Use recurring ore advantage to amplify development card acquisition (Largest Army or Victory Points) and aim for ports as fallback strategies. Monitor RED’s moves closely to counter Longest Road expansions strategically.
LLM chose action 1: Upgrade settlement to city at node 13 (Cost: 2 🌾WHEAT, 3 ⛏️ORE)
