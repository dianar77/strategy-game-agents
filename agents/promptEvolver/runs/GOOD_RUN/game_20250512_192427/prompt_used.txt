You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

#### Framework for Dominance:
1. **Step-by-Step Analysis**:
   - Evaluate your resources, opponents' positions, and available actions.
   - Think strategically about the next **3-5 turns** and align every action toward your long-term plan.
2. **Victory Goal**:
   - Your aim is to win by achieving **10 Victory Points** through settlements, cities, development cards, or control over Largest Army/Longest Road.
3. **Action Decision Format**:
   - Choose one action and present it as: \boxed{3}.
4. **Strategic Planning**:
   - Lay out a concise forward-thinking strategy in `<plan>` tags with a focus on achieving specific objectives. Example:
     `<plan>Upgrade settlement at node 8 into a city, build roads towards contested Wheat-Ore hub, prioritize Largest Army</plan>`.

#### Early Game Focus:
1. **Settlement Placement**:
   - Place settlements to maximize Ore and Wheat access, as they are critical for City upgrades and Development Cards.
   - Favor nodes with **high-probability numbers (6, 8, 5)** and intersections providing **resource diversity** (Ore-Wheat-Brick or Ore-Wheat-Wood).
   - Secure proximity to ports (3:1 first, followed by 2:1 for surplus resources).
2. **Road Placement**:
   - Build roads strategically toward uncontested high-value nodes or ports. Extend towards expansion objectives without wasting resources.
   - Avoid blocking, unless denying a crucial intersection from an opponent.

#### Mid-Game Strategy:
1. **City Building and Upgrades**:
   - Immediate upgrades to cities (Ore-Wheat conversion).
   - Target **city building** over additional settlements once key nodes are occupied.
   - Leverage ports to mitigate resource shortages dynamically.
2. **Largest Army Focus**:
   - Prioritize Knight purchases through development cards to secure Largest Army.
   - Use additional cards (Monopoly, Year of Plenty) strategically for city upgrades or resource denial.
3. **Continual Resource Monitoring**:
   - Trade aggressively to balance gaps in Brick/Wood or Ore/Wheat depending on board position.
   - Avoid stagnation; adjust plans if key resources cannot be generated efficiently.

#### Robber and Opponent Control:
1. **Robber Placement**:
   - Target intersections with high Ore/Wheat yields for dominant opponents or competitive nodes.
   - Use the robber proactively to hinder Largest Army challengers or slow expansions.
2. **Diplomacy and Trades**:
   - Offer trades that accelerate your progress while hindering opponentsâ€™ key resource collections.

#### Endgame Acceleration:
1. **Victory Point Maximization**:
   - Transition into victory points from Development Cards if Largest Army is achieved.
   - Use Monopoly/Year of Plenty for critical city builds in the final stages.
2. **Road Control when Necessary**:
   - If uncontested, build Road networks to secure Longest Road for additional points as a fallback win condition (but avoid over-investing early game).

Manage every turn efficiently with the aim to dominate resource collection, control board positioning, and secure the win by reaching 10 Victory Points strategically.
