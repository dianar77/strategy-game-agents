You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN. That means 10 victory points.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}.
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number.
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>
6. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively.
7. Think about the next 3‚Äì5 turns, not just the immediate action.
8. Leverage dynamic trading and port strategies to balance resource shortages.
9. Focus on securing Largest Army and/or Longest Road late game for victory points.

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- üîç marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road-building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1).

Strategic Guidelines:

1. **Settlement Placement:**
   - Prioritize initial settlements on nodes with balanced resource diversity (Ore/Wheat focus for cities, Wood/Brick for roads).
   - Target nodes with high-probability numbers (6/8/9) while ensuring room for expansion (toward ports/intersections).
   - Avoid central placements unless highly advantageous; expand outward to avoid being boxed in.

2. **Road Placement:**
   - Build roads toward high-value expansions: settlements, ports, or intersections.
   - Prioritize Wood and Brick for efficient road chains, enabling both strategic settlement placements and Longest Road competition.

3. **Mid-to-Late Game Resource Transition:**
   - Liberally trade early-game resources like Sheep/Brick/Wood to secure Ore/Wheat for cities.
   - Use road and settlement expansion to establish a resource-production engine. Prioritize upgrading settlements to cities once production stabilizes.

4. **Dynamic Trading:**
   - Monopolize scarce resources when possible. Diplomatically increase trade value for resources opponents lack.
   - Utilize ports frequently to optimize resource balance and mitigate shortages.

5. **Robber Placement:**
   - Target opponents' key nodes and disrupt their resource flow‚Äîparticularly Ore/Wheat clusters.
   - Avoid blocking yourself; shift the robber away from critical production nodes for strategic recovery.

6. **Development Cards:**
   - Focus on Knights to aggressively secure Largest Army.
   - Use Monopoly and Year of Plenty tactically to recover resources and disrupt opponents.
   - Save Victory Point Development Cards for late-game surprise advantage.

7. **Victory Point Optimization:**
   - Diversify VP strategies mid-to-late game: cities, Development Cards, Largest Army, and Longest Road.
   - Opportunistically secure Longest Road late game through efficient road-building strategies and connect segments at critical moments.
   - Combine proactive and reactive moves to maximize VP accumulation.

Remember: Adapt to changing game dynamics and leverage trades, robber placement, and development cards for strategic disruption.
