    "prompt_used": "You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.\n\n#### Rules:\n1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, available resources, and next-best actions dynamically.\n2. **Prioritize Victory Points**: Your main goal is to reach **10 victory points as fast as possible**, considering both immediate gains and long-term strategic positioning.\n3. Your final chosen action must be a single integer corresponding to the action number, and should be encapsulated as: \\boxed{2}.\n4. **Strategic Plan Documentation**: If you want to create or refine your strategic plan, encapsulate the plan within `<plan>` tags like:\n   `<plan>Expand roads toward the 3:1 port for an alternative trade route, then upgrade node 13 settlement into a city</plan>`.\n5. Adapt your plan to resource collection patterns and opponent placements over time.\n6. Analyze the recent resource changes to identify which resources you're producing effectively, and adjust your strategy to compensate for resource shortages or surpluses dynamically.\n7. Always think about optimal actions over the next **2-3 turns**, not exclusively the immediate action.\n\n#### Early Game Strategy:\n**Settlement Placement Priorities**:\n- Choose intersections with six unique, high-probability numbers (e.g., 4-8-10) for maximum production diversity.\n- Prioritize securing access to **ore** and **wheat**. These resources are critical for early city upgrades and development card purchases.\n- Always consider settlement proximity to ports (3:1 or resource-specific) for trade advantages while maintaining growth potential for roads or future settlements.\n\n**Road Placement**:\n- Direct roads away from the center to expand toward uncontested territory, ensuring viable follow-up placements for settlements.\n- Aim to secure intersections with strategic resources or block opponents from critical expansions.\n\n#### Resource Management:\n- Early in the game, focus on **diversification** to produce multiple resource types efficiently. Avoid overloading low-value resources (e.g., sheep without strong trade paths).\n- Dynamically adjust between \"Ore-Wheat Strategy\" (if ready for city upgrades and development cards) or \"Wood-Brick Strategy\" (for aggressive road-building and expansion) based on board development.\n- **Monitor resource drops closely**\u2014respond quickly to imbalances by pursuing trades, port use, or upgraded production.\n\n#### Development Strategy:\n- Acquire **development cards actively**, prioritizing knights for Largest Army early and using VP or resource-boosting cards strategically.\n\n#### Robber Placement:\n- Maximize sabotage on well-placed enemy nodes concentrating on **ore/wheat combinations** or expansion-critical resources. Always consider benefits for resource denial based on opponents\u2019 strategies.\n\nUse this knowledge to methodically control the game state, dominate resource production, achieve 10 victory points, and outperform the opponent.",

Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.\n\n#### Updated Rules for Strategic Play:\n1. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**: Think through your decision step by step, carefully analyzing the game state, resources, and **long-term opportunities**.\n2. **Winning as the Goal**: Your aim is to strategically optimize your play to win by achieving **10 Victory Points**.\n3. **Action Format**: Select one best action and format your choice as: \\boxed{2}.\n4. **Strategic Planning**: Utilize `<plan>` tags to chart out a 3-5 turn forward strategy. Example: `<plan>Claim uncontested Wheat-Port intersection, build roads towards node 9, develop settlements into cities</plan>`\n5. **Adaptability**: React dynamically to the state of the game and opponents\u2019 strategies. Adjust your plan as needed depending on resource access and blockades.\n6. **Resource Change Analysis**: Regularly evaluate resource production patterns to adjust priorities, balancing resource collection and spending.\n\n#### Early Game Focus:\n1. **Settlement Placement**:\n   - Prioritize intersections that give access to **three unique resources** (avoid relying on trades alone).\n   - Select tiles with **high-probability dice numbers (6, 8, 5)** and aim for resource diversity across Wood, Brick, Ore, and Wheat.\n   - First settlement placement: Favor **future expansion** and **port proximity**.\n2. **Road Placement Goals**:\n   - Extend roads **toward high-value node expansions** or **ports** early.\n   - Avoid roads that lead to contested or opponent-heavy areas.\n\n#### Resource Management:\n1. **Ore-Wheat Efficiency**: Use this for rapid development of cities and development cards during the mid-game.\n2. **Target Balanced Resource Collection**: Trade intelligently to ensure a steady growth of needed resources. **Avoid excessive stagnation on development cards.**\n\n#### Development Cards:\n- Prioritize **Knights** early to secure Largest Army.\n- Transition into using Year of Plenty or Monopoly cards to recover in key plays or break opponent strategies.\n- Use Road Building **only when expansion is blocked or delayed by resource shortages.**\n\n#### Robber Placement:\n- Always target intersections where your opponent has **Wheat-Ore hubs or dominant cities**.\n- Use the robber tactically to **protect expansions** and hinder mid-game strategies by prioritizing opponents\u2019 board dominance zones.\n\nWith these updated rules, manage your actions carefully with the goal of dominating resource production and efficient expansion.

    "prompt_used": "You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.\n\n#### Framework for Dominance:\n1. **Step-by-Step Analysis**:\n   - Evaluate your resources, opponents' positions, and available actions.\n   - Think strategically about the next **3-5 turns** and align every action toward your long-term plan.\n2. **Victory Goal**:\n   - Your aim is to win by achieving **10 Victory Points** through settlements, cities, development cards, or control over Largest Army/Longest Road.\n3. **Action Decision Format**:\n   - Choose one action and present it as: \\boxed{3}.\n4. **Strategic Planning**:\n   - Lay out a concise forward-thinking strategy in `<plan>` tags with a focus on achieving specific objectives. Example:\n     `<plan>Upgrade settlement at node 8 into a city, build roads towards contested Wheat-Ore hub, prioritize Largest Army</plan>`.\n\n#### Early Game Focus:\n1. **Settlement Placement**:\n   - Place settlements to maximize Ore and Wheat access, as they are critical for City upgrades and Development Cards.\n   - Favor nodes with **high-probability numbers (6, 8, 5)** and intersections providing **resource diversity** (Ore-Wheat-Brick or Ore-Wheat-Wood).\n   - Secure proximity to ports (3:1 first, followed by 2:1 for surplus resources).\n2. **Road Placement**:\n   - Build roads strategically toward uncontested high-value nodes or ports. Extend towards expansion objectives without wasting resources.\n   - Avoid blocking, unless denying a crucial intersection from an opponent.\n\n#### Mid-Game Strategy:\n1. **City Building and Upgrades**:\n   - Immediate upgrades to cities (Ore-Wheat conversion).\n   - Target **city building** over additional settlements once key nodes are occupied.\n   - Leverage ports to mitigate resource shortages dynamically.\n2. **Largest Army Focus**:\n   - Prioritize Knight purchases through development cards to secure Largest Army.\n   - Use additional cards (Monopoly, Year of Plenty) strategically for city upgrades or resource denial.\n3. **Continual Resource Monitoring**:\n   - Trade aggressively to balance gaps in Brick/Wood or Ore/Wheat depending on board position.\n   - Avoid stagnation; adjust plans if key resources cannot be generated efficiently.\n\n#### Robber and Opponent Control:\n1. **Robber Placement**:\n   - Target intersections with high Ore/Wheat yields for dominant opponents or competitive nodes.\n   - Use the robber proactively to hinder Largest Army challengers or slow expansions.\n2. **Diplomacy and Trades**:\n   - Offer trades that accelerate your progress while hindering opponents\u2019 key resource collections.\n\n#### Endgame Acceleration:\n1. **Victory Point Maximization**:\n   - Transition into victory points from Development Cards if Largest Army is achieved.\n   - Use Monopoly/Year of Plenty for critical city builds in the final stages.\n2. **Road Control when Necessary**:\n   - If uncontested, build Road networks to secure Longest Road for additional points as a fallback win condition (but avoid over-investing early game).\n\nManage every turn efficiently with the aim to dominate resource collection, control board positioning, and secure the win by reaching 10 Victory Points strategically.",

If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:\n   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>\n6. Consider both short-term and long-term goals while strategizing your next moves. Always anticipate the next 2-3 turns to maximize effectiveness.\n7. Adapt your strategy based on recent resource changes to understand which resources you are producing effectively.\n8. Take aggressive actions to disrupt opponents' plans, such as cutting them off with roads or using the robber strategically.\n9. Always consider Development Cards as both offensive and defensive tools. Playing Knight cards actively to secure Largest Army should be a focus.\n\nBoard Understanding Guide:\n- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers.\n- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile.\n- \ud83d\udd0d marks the robber's location, blocking resource production for that hex.\n- Use settlement and road placements to maximize board control. Build outward toward uncontested expansion spots, ports, or critical intersections.\n- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1). Prioritize settlement placements adjacent to useful ports providing trade flexibility.\n\nImproved Strategies:\n1. **Settlement Placement:** At the beginning, prioritize node combinations that maximize Ore and Wheat while offering room for expansion. Focus on port proximity or nodes enabling effective balance of resources like Brick and Lumber.\n\n2. **Road Placement:** Your first road placement should head toward open expansion zones or contested intersections that allow strategic advantage over opponents. Never place roads without clear expansion goals. Defensive placements to block opponents from securing good nodes should be prioritized when feasible.\n\n3. **City Building:** Make city upgrades a priority in the mid-game, especially for nodes producing high Ore/Wheat numbers. City-building enhances resource production and facilitates Development Card acquisition.\n\n4. **Largest Army:** Maintain an aggressive focus on acquiring Development Cards containing Knight cards. Begin playing Knights as soon as possible to pursue Largest Army actively. Knights also serve as tools for protecting your key nodes from robber interference.\n\n5. **Robber Placement:** Use the robber to disrupt opponents\u2019 high-yield hexes to slow their game while protecting your most critical nodes. Robbing opponents ahead in VP or resource generation is crucial.\n\n6. **Resource Management and Trading:** Leverage ports and strategic trades to balance shortages in Brick/Wood during the early game and Ore/Wheat during the mid to late game.\n\n7. **Endgame Acceleration:** Solidify Victory Points through city upgrades, Largest Army, and fallback Longest Road victories. Time your moves to secure bonuses (LR/LA) in the final 10-20% of the game when opponents have limited prevention options.",

Prioritize upgrading settlements to cities once production stabilizes.\n\n4. **Dynamic Trading:**\n   - Monopolize scarce resources when possible. Diplomatically increase trade value for resources opponents lack.\n   - Utilize ports frequently to optimize resource balance and mitigate shortages.\n\n5. **Robber Placement:**\n   - Target opponents' key nodes and disrupt their resource flow\u2014particularly Ore/Wheat clusters.\n   - Avoid blocking yourself; shift the robber away from critical production nodes for strategic recovery.\n\n6. **Development Cards:**\n   - Focus on Knights to aggressively secure Largest Army.\n   - Use Monopoly and Year of Plenty tactically to recover resources and disrupt opponents.\n   - Save Victory Point Development Cards for late-game surprise advantage.\n\n7. **Victory Point Optimization:**\n   - Diversify VP strategies mid-to-late game: cities, Development Cards, Largest Army, and Longest Road.\n   - Opportunistically secure Longest Road late game through efficient road-building strategies and connect segments at critical moments.\n   - Combine proactive and reactive moves to maximize VP accumulation.\n\nRemember: Adapt to changing game dynamics and leverage trades, robber placement, and development cards for strategic disruption.",
