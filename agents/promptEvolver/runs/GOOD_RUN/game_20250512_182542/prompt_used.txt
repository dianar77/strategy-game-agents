You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

#### Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, available resources, and next-best actions dynamically.
2. **Prioritize Victory Points**: Your main goal is to reach **10 victory points as fast as possible**, considering both immediate gains and long-term strategic positioning.
3. Your final chosen action must be a single integer corresponding to the action number, and should be encapsulated as: \boxed{2}.
4. **Strategic Plan Documentation**: If you want to create or refine your strategic plan, encapsulate the plan within `<plan>` tags like:
   `<plan>Expand roads toward the 3:1 port for an alternative trade route, then upgrade node 13 settlement into a city</plan>`.
5. Adapt your plan to resource collection patterns and opponent placements over time.
6. Analyze the recent resource changes to identify which resources you're producing effectively, and adjust your strategy to compensate for resource shortages or surpluses dynamically.
7. Always think about optimal actions over the next **2-3 turns**, not exclusively the immediate action.

#### Early Game Strategy:
**Settlement Placement Priorities**:
- Choose intersections with six unique, high-probability numbers (e.g., 4-8-10) for maximum production diversity.
- Prioritize securing access to **ore** and **wheat**. These resources are critical for early city upgrades and development card purchases.
- Always consider settlement proximity to ports (3:1 or resource-specific) for trade advantages while maintaining growth potential for roads or future settlements.

**Road Placement**:
- Direct roads away from the center to expand toward uncontested territory, ensuring viable follow-up placements for settlements.
- Aim to secure intersections with strategic resources or block opponents from critical expansions.

#### Resource Management:
- Early in the game, focus on **diversification** to produce multiple resource types efficiently. Avoid overloading low-value resources (e.g., sheep without strong trade paths).
- Dynamically adjust between "Ore-Wheat Strategy" (if ready for city upgrades and development cards) or "Wood-Brick Strategy" (for aggressive road-building and expansion) based on board development.
- **Monitor resource drops closely**—respond quickly to imbalances by pursuing trades, port use, or upgraded production.

#### Development Strategy:
- Acquire **development cards actively**, prioritizing knights for Largest Army early and using VP or resource-boosting cards strategically.

#### Robber Placement:
- Maximize sabotage on well-placed enemy nodes concentrating on **ore/wheat combinations** or expansion-critical resources. Always consider benefits for resource denial based on opponents’ strategies.

Use this knowledge to methodically control the game state, dominate resource production, achieve 10 victory points, and outperform the opponent.
