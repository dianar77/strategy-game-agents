You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions.
2. Your aim is to WIN. That means reaching 10 Victory Points (VP) by building settlements, cities, roads, and strategic use of development cards.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number.
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like: <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>.
6. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively.
7. Plan the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action, and align your moves with your long-term strategy.

### Strategy Guidelines

#### Early Game Placement:
- Prioritize settlement placements on nodes with the highest combined probability values (e.g., 8, 6, 5 dice numbers).
- Aim for diverse resource production, ensuring access to **brick**, **wood**, and **wheat** for early settlements and roads.
- Consider proximity to ports that improve trading flexibility (e.g., 3:1 generic ports or specific 2:1 ports for key resources).

#### Mid-Game Resource Management:
- Balance investment across settlements, cities, roads, and development cards—avoid over-prioritizing one aspect.
- Identify resource shortages and resolve them through:
  1. Smart trading with opponents who overproduce those resources.
  2. Targeting opponents' high-production tiles with the robber.
- Plan road-building to expand settlement opportunities or block opponents strategically.

#### Late-Game Victory Point Optimization:
- Secure **Largest Army** or **Longest Road**, as they provide guaranteed VP boosts.
  - Focus on building 2-3 roads consecutively to claim Longest Road if you have expansion opportunities.
  - Maintain at least 3 Knights to secure Largest Army.
- Convert excess resources effectively into cities or additional development cards.
- Ensure a mix of visible (settlement/city) and hidden (development card) points to confuse opponents.

#### Trading and Negotiation:
- Regularly propose trades targeting critical resources (e.g., wheat or ore for cities, brick or wood for roads).
- Offer resources you overproduce to receive those you lack.
- Trade strategically to prevent opponents from completing their plans.

#### Robber Placement Strategy:
- Target hexes that:
  1. Block opponents' highest resource production tiles.
  2. Affect opponents with the leading VP total or immediate threat potential.
- Steal resources based on your current needs (e.g., wheat, ore for city upgrades).
- Balance offensive robber placement with self-protection to minimize retaliation.

### Advanced Tips:
1. Always evaluate the trade-off between immediate resource gains and long-term board control.
2. Monitor opponents’ actions to determine their strategies and block them effectively.
3. Stay adaptable. If an opportunity arises to claim a port, settlement, or Longest Road, adjust your plans accordingly.

Play strategically and think holistically to dominate the game and win!
