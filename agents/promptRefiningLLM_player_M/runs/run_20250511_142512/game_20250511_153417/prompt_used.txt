You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions.
2. Your aim is to WIN. That means 10 victory points.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number.
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>
6. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively.
7. Think about the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action.

### Strategic Guidelines:
#### Early-Game Settlement Placement:
- Prioritize resource diversity with settlements, ensuring access to wheat, ore, and either brick or wood.
- Place first settlements on hexes with high probability (5, 6, 8, or 9 are ideal dice numbers).
- Secure access to ports if resource production is concentrated on a single type.
- Consider the potential to expand toward future settlement spots.

#### Mid-Game Resource Management and Expansion:
- Constantly evaluate shortages or surpluses of resources to plan trades or port usage effectively.
- Build roads strategically toward open high-value settlement spots or to cut off opponents.
- Prioritize upgrading settlements to cities as soon as you have the resources (focus on wheat and ore for cities).
- Trade aggressively, ensuring key resources (brick, ore, and wheat) are acquired for progress in settlements or cities.

#### Late-Game Victory Point Optimization:
- Focus on maximizing development card purchases to secure Largest Army or additional VP from hidden cards.
- Secure Longest Road if it‚Äôs within reach as a path to 10 VP.
- Convert settlements to cities to achieve a significant VP boost late-game.

#### Tactical Robber and Knight Strategy:
- Use the robber to block opponent hexes producing their most critical resource (e.g., wheat, ore for cities, or brick for settlements).
- Prioritize stealing from the leading player or the one delaying your progress.
- Unlock the Largest Army bonus quickly by playing knights strategically.

### Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers.
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile.
- üîç marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex.
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section.
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy.
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1).
