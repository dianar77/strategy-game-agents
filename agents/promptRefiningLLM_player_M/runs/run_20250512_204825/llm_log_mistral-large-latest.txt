Colonist Strategies: What are the Best Catan Starting Strategies?

Today we will be giving you pointers on the best starting placement strategies for Settlers of Catan that you can use in Colonist.

Colonist.io

1. Identify Your Goals

The first and most important Catan Strategy is knowing what you want to build. This will dictate which resources you should go after when you place your starting settlements. [...] Also you don’t want to overproduce resources which can’t be used and then lose them to a 7 roll.

A much more ideal setup would be an 8-5-10 placement, with a secondary placement of 6-9-4.

These are all good numbers, and you’ve got a variety, meaning that you’re more likely to collect on any given roll.

It’s not always possible to get good number variety, and you will more often than not have a duplicate number, but it’s important to be as diverse as possible. [...] This is where the road placement comes in very handy. Placing your first roads is actually very important, as doing it wrong can set you back a few turns.

Just make sure that your road points to a spot on the map that you can move out to, even if the resource production isn’t high.

A common error to make is pointing the road to a goldmine of resources and numbers, only to have your neighbor place there next turn, making your road a dead end for you.

While the introductory game comes with a recommended board layout, later games are played on a randomized hex tile layout.  Take a close look at these random layouts at the start of the game. Are there two of the same resource next to one another?  Is at least one of the numbered chits on those tiles reasonably high? Consider placing a Settlement in the most advantageous intersection of those tiles, then build roads and additional Settlements around them to block your opponents from doing the [...] When looking for intersections to place your first Settlements, pay less attention to the type of resource and more attention to the number of dots on the hex tiles that make up the intersections.  The type of resource matters less than the frequency of obtaining them. After all, resources can be traded to the bank at 4:1 or at Ports for an even better return (see below).

That being said, having access to all of the resources is not only important, it may also lead to your mid and end game phases becoming a trivial matter.

Between your two placements, try your best to have access to each needed resource.

For example, if you place on a Lumber-Brick-Wheat combination, your next placement should preferably have Ore and Wool together. This is where complementary placements come in. [...] In addition, this would also give you a pretty good idea on how you would want your game to progress.

There are three main strategies you can focus on:

Settlements and Longest Road - Your essential resources would be high amount of Lumber, Brick and some amount of Wool, and Wheat.

Hybrid Expansion  - Occupying as much as you can of the map thereby acquiring more resources. For this strategy you will need to produce a balanced amount of all resources. [...] Say you’ve found two potential spots that will give you all your resources, only this time, you notice that both the spots have the same numbers!

This means that you’ll produce well if any of those numbers roll, but it also means that you would only collect resources from three different numbers.

I mentioned this earlier: Colonist is a resource management game. But there won’t be anything for you to manage if you’re not producing resources.

<Document href="https://blog.education.nationalgeographic.org/2013/08/29/a-resource-management-lesson-settlers-of-catan/"/>
Different combinations of resources are required to build different things, meaning that the importance of certain resources shifts throughout the game. For example, bricks and lumber are important at the beginning because they are needed to build roads. Sheep and wheat gain importance when the time comes to build settlements, followed by ore when it’s time to build cities. Acquiring these resources depends on the game board, which is (for all purposes) a map of the mythical Catan. [...] The value of specific resources changes as players look to develop their settlements from roads into cities. It’s also important to use the resources that you have. If a seven is rolled and you have more than seven resource cards, you must give up half of them. Wise resource management becomes a key element to winning the game.
Standard 15: How physical systems affect human systems. [...] The goal of Settlers is to be the first person to earn 10 Victory Points. Victory Points are mostly earned by building settlements and cities. To build settlements and cities, one must first build roads. To build all of these things, one must earn resources: brick, lumber, wheat, ore, and sheep.

When Catan (or The Settlers of Catan, as it was originally named) was first published in 1995 it created something of a revelation in board game circles, undeniably changing the way people would look at board games and gaming in general.  Part of Catan’s success has been due to designer Klaus Teuber’s ability to combine different gaming mechanics (resource management, trading, route building, dice rolling) in a way that made the game easy to teach and learn, while maintaining enough depth to

Obvious leads make you a target. Longest Road in particular should be picked up as late as possible. Joining up two separate road segments with a big road-building push and unveiling 2 victory point cards can give you the win from 6 points. Largest Army on the other hand needs to be more openly competed for, because of the play-only-one-development-card-per-turn rule. Victory point cards are great to have because they create uncertainty in your opponents (is it a VP or a monopoly card?). [...] The strategies all kind of blend together in the late game when everyone has multiple cities/settlements/roads/cards, trading is mostly happening with the bank/ports for fear of letting someone else go out on their turn, battle will be fierce for the bonus cards, and development cards are disappearing at a furious rate. Don't stress over settlement positioning in the late game - put them anywhere you can, they're victory points rather than production sources. [...] I've assumed that 6 development cards will get you 3 knights, a victory point, and 6 cards from the knights + Year of Plenty/Road Building/Monopoly cards, and subtracted these from the required production. YMMV.

Thing Two: Catan is won by having ten points.  Those first two Settlements you placed before the game really started?  They’re worth one point each. That means Catan is really only about scoring eight Victory Points. Eight.  Make each point you score — and each point you prevent your opponents from scoring — count.
Be adaptable in your game plan and smart about each one of those points and, like me, you should find your chances of winning improving with each game.
TagsBoard Game Strategy Guides [...] Given the distribution of the types of Development Cards in the deck, the odds are that you’re likely to draw a soldier.  That’s not necessarily a bad thing: soldiers can be used to move the Robber off of one of your tiles, or just to move it to a place that will hinder your opponents.  Even better, three soldiers gets you the Largest Army card. As with the Longest Road, the Largest Army gets you two Victory Points as long as you can hold onto it until the end of the game. [...] I have been caught off guard far too many times and have struggled to find a way to gain those last Victory Points.  My fellow players, however, have clearly planned ahead. For instance, if you’re counting on the extra points Cities give you as part of your winning strategy, make sure you have good access to ore.  If that Longest Road or Largest Army is essential to your win, you need to keep those numbers up so no one steals it away from you. Those unplayed Development Cards start looking more

Experienced players often use hidden development cards to scare away other players from blocking and stealing from them, take away another player’s settlement spot, steal the longest road, shockingly build a city (or two), and even prevent another player from winning on their turn. Development cards offer an additional layer of strategy and players can leverage this favorable information asymmetry to drive the direction of their path to 10 Victory Points. [...] Newer players are very focused on the board in front of them and are always looking to build the next road, settlement, and city. They often overlook development cards since it is off the board. This phenomenon exists in both the online and physical game but it is much more pronounced in the physical version because development cards are more out of sight, placed to the side of each player compared to the centrally located board that is some 30 to 40 times the size of a development card. This [...] While the perceived probability of drawing each development card will shift as the game progresses, it is important to remember that the more hidden development cards that you own relative to other players, the closer your perceived probability is to the actual probability.

6. What’s the Development Card Strategy?

The Catan Development Card Strategy focuses on ignoring wood and brick during the initial placement of settlements and instead prioritizing ore, wheat, and sheep. While it may sound counter intuitive, as wood and brick are essential to expanding your civilization, focusing on these higher-valued resources can be very lucrative. [...] In conclusion, Catan development cards are an important aspect of the game, providing players with various strategies to gain points and win the game. Understanding the cards’ distribution and when they can be played is crucial to maximizing their effectiveness.

- try to avoid trading down to just a few cards with the bank and being stuck unable to build. Chances are, you're doing so for a resource you're finding hard to get and therefore other players will know they can disproportionately hurt you with the robber if they steal it.

- preserve juicy settlement locations with judicious road placement. Lock up that port that's critical to your strategy early. Nothing more infuriating than having an opponent beat you to it. [...] - if you are lacking a resource, don't place the robber on it. You want there to be lots of it in the game so people will trade it to you. Instead, place it on a resource that you have a lot of so you can increase your probability of trading for what you need.

Step 7: Commander [...] Using the robber well is crucial - on average, the robber will turn up once in every six rolls and it also gets moved when playing a knight.

- use it on the person in the strongest position (not necessarily the open points leader). Count unplayed development cards in someone's hand as points. Someone who gets Longest Road early is rarely a threat in the long term.

- use the robber exclusively on your strongest opponent. Avoid motivating more than one of your opponents to seek revenge!

You must move the robber away from its current spot and onto the number token of any other terrain hex or on the desert.

- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

Early Game Placement Strategy:
- Focus on a plentiful resource present on the board and start with a 2:1 port of that resource (may build wide or tall, depending on the board layout).
- Identify your goals: know what you want to build and go after the necessary resources.
- Aim for an 8-5-10 placement with a secondary placement of 6-9-4 to ensure good number variety.
- Place your first roads strategically to avoid dead ends and ensure future expansion.

Mid-Game Resource Management:
- Ensure access to all needed resources between your two placements.
- Complementary placements are key: if you start with Lumber-Brick-Wheat, aim for Ore and Wool in your next placement.
- Adapt your strategy based on the game phase: prioritize different resources as the game progresses.
- Avoid overproducing resources that can't be used effectively.

Late-Game Victory Point Optimization:
- Don't stress over settlement positioning in the late game; focus on placing them anywhere for victory points.
- Pick up Longest Road as late as possible to avoid becoming a target.
- Use victory point cards to create uncertainty among opponents.

Effective Trading and Negotiation:
- Be flexible in negotiations; consider multi-resource trades if 1-for-1 exchanges aren't suitable.
- Use the bank or ports for trading if player negotiations aren't favorable.

Development Card Usage:
- Use development cards strategically to gain an advantage.
- Hidden development cards can deter opponents from blocking or stealing from you.
- Leverage the information asymmetry of development cards to drive your strategy.

Robber Placement Strategy:
- Avoid placing the robber on resources you lack; instead, target resources you have in abundance to increase trade opportunities.
- Use the robber on the strongest opponent, not just the open points leader.
- Consider unplayed development cards in an opponent's hand as potential points.
- Use the robber exclusively on your strongest opponent to avoid motivating multiple opponents to seek revenge.================================= Tool Message =================================

Colonist Strategies: What are the Best Catan Starting Strategies?

Today we will be giving you pointers on the best starting placement strategies for Settlers of Catan that you can use in Colonist.

Colonist.io

1. Identify Your Goals

The first and most important Catan Strategy is knowing what you want to build. This will dictate which resources you should go after when you place your starting settlements. [...] Also you don’t want to overproduce resources which can’t be used and then lose them to a 7 roll.

A much more ideal setup would be an 8-5-10 placement, with a secondary placement of 6-9-4.

These are all good numbers, and you’ve got a variety, meaning that you’re more likely to collect on any given roll.

It’s not always possible to get good number variety, and you will more often than not have a duplicate number, but it’s important to be as diverse as possible. [...] This is where the road placement comes in very handy. Placing your first roads is actually very important, as doing it wrong can set you back a few turns.

Just make sure that your road points to a spot on the map that you can move out to, even if the resource production isn’t high.

A common error to make is pointing the road to a goldmine of resources and numbers, only to have your neighbor place there next turn, making your road a dead end for you.

<Document href="https://www.meeplemountain.com/top-six/top-6-catan-strategies-for-turning-your-losing-streak-around/"/>
While the introductory game comes with a recommended board layout, later games are played on a randomized hex tile layout.  Take a close look at these random layouts at the start of the game. Are there two of the same resource next to one another?  Is at least one of the numbered chits on those tiles reasonably high? Consider placing a Settlement in the most advantageous intersection of those tiles, then build roads and additional Settlements around them to block your opponents from doing the [...] When looking for intersections to place your first Settlements, pay less attention to the type of resource and more attention to the number of dots on the hex tiles that make up the intersections.  The type of resource matters less than the frequency of obtaining them. After all, resources can be traded to the bank at 4:1 or at Ports for an even better return (see below).

That being said, having access to all of the resources is not only important, it may also lead to your mid and end game phases becoming a trivial matter.

Between your two placements, try your best to have access to each needed resource.

For example, if you place on a Lumber-Brick-Wheat combination, your next placement should preferably have Ore and Wool together. This is where complementary placements come in. [...] In addition, this would also give you a pretty good idea on how you would want your game to progress.

There are three main strategies you can focus on:

Settlements and Longest Road - Your essential resources would be high amount of Lumber, Brick and some amount of Wool, and Wheat.

Hybrid Expansion  - Occupying as much as you can of the map thereby acquiring more resources. For this strategy you will need to produce a balanced amount of all resources. [...] Say you’ve found two potential spots that will give you all your resources, only this time, you notice that both the spots have the same numbers!

This means that you’ll produce well if any of those numbers roll, but it also means that you would only collect resources from three different numbers.

I mentioned this earlier: Colonist is a resource management game. But there won’t be anything for you to manage if you’re not producing resources.

<Document href="https://blog.education.nationalgeographic.org/2013/08/29/a-resource-management-lesson-settlers-of-catan/"/>
Different combinations of resources are required to build different things, meaning that the importance of certain resources shifts throughout the game. For example, bricks and lumber are important at the beginning because they are needed to build roads. Sheep and wheat gain importance when the time comes to build settlements, followed by ore when it’s time to build cities. Acquiring these resources depends on the game board, which is (for all purposes) a map of the mythical Catan. [...] The value of specific resources changes as players look to develop their settlements from roads into cities. It’s also important to use the resources that you have. If a seven is rolled and you have more than seven resource cards, you must give up half of them. Wise resource management becomes a key element to winning the game.
Standard 15: How physical systems affect human systems. [...] The goal of Settlers is to be the first person to earn 10 Victory Points. Victory Points are mostly earned by building settlements and cities. To build settlements and cities, one must first build roads. To build all of these things, one must earn resources: brick, lumber, wheat, ore, and sheep.

When Catan (or The Settlers of Catan, as it was originally named) was first published in 1995 it created something of a revelation in board game circles, undeniably changing the way people would look at board games and gaming in general.  Part of Catan’s success has been due to designer Klaus Teuber’s ability to combine different gaming mechanics (resource management, trading, route building, dice rolling) in a way that made the game easy to teach and learn, while maintaining enough depth to

Obvious leads make you a target. Longest Road in particular should be picked up as late as possible. Joining up two separate road segments with a big road-building push and unveiling 2 victory point cards can give you the win from 6 points. Largest Army on the other hand needs to be more openly competed for, because of the play-only-one-development-card-per-turn rule. Victory point cards are great to have because they create uncertainty in your opponents (is it a VP or a monopoly card?). [...] The strategies all kind of blend together in the late game when everyone has multiple cities/settlements/roads/cards, trading is mostly happening with the bank/ports for fear of letting someone else go out on their turn, battle will be fierce for the bonus cards, and development cards are disappearing at a furious rate. Don't stress over settlement positioning in the late game - put them anywhere you can, they're victory points rather than production sources. [...] I've assumed that 6 development cards will get you 3 knights, a victory point, and 6 cards from the knights + Year of Plenty/Road Building/Monopoly cards, and subtracted these from the required production. YMMV.

Thing Two: Catan is won by having ten points.  Those first two Settlements you placed before the game really started?  They’re worth one point each. That means Catan is really only about scoring eight Victory Points. Eight.  Make each point you score — and each point you prevent your opponents from scoring — count.
Be adaptable in your game plan and smart about each one of those points and, like me, you should find your chances of winning improving with each game.
TagsBoard Game Strategy Guides [...] Given the distribution of the types of Development Cards in the deck, the odds are that you’re likely to draw a soldier.  That’s not necessarily a bad thing: soldiers can be used to move the Robber off of one of your tiles, or just to move it to a place that will hinder your opponents.  Even better, three soldiers gets you the Largest Army card. As with the Longest Road, the Largest Army gets you two Victory Points as long as you can hold onto it until the end of the game. [...] I have been caught off guard far too many times and have struggled to find a way to gain those last Victory Points.  My fellow players, however, have clearly planned ahead. For instance, if you’re counting on the extra points Cities give you as part of your winning strategy, make sure you have good access to ore.  If that Longest Road or Largest Army is essential to your win, you need to keep those numbers up so no one steals it away from you. Those unplayed Development Cards start looking more

Experienced players often use hidden development cards to scare away other players from blocking and stealing from them, take away another player’s settlement spot, steal the longest road, shockingly build a city (or two), and even prevent another player from winning on their turn. Development cards offer an additional layer of strategy and players can leverage this favorable information asymmetry to drive the direction of their path to 10 Victory Points. [...] Newer players are very focused on the board in front of them and are always looking to build the next road, settlement, and city. They often overlook development cards since it is off the board. This phenomenon exists in both the online and physical game but it is much more pronounced in the physical version because development cards are more out of sight, placed to the side of each player compared to the centrally located board that is some 30 to 40 times the size of a development card. This [...] While the perceived probability of drawing each development card will shift as the game progresses, it is important to remember that the more hidden development cards that you own relative to other players, the closer your perceived probability is to the actual probability.

6. What’s the Development Card Strategy?

While it may sound counter intuitive, as wood and brick are essential to expanding your civilization, focusing on these higher-valued resources can be very lucrative. [...] In conclusion, Catan development cards are an important aspect of the game, providing players with various strategies to gain points and win the game.

- try to avoid trading down to just a few cards with the bank and being stuck unable to build. Chances are, you're doing so for a resource you're finding hard to get and therefore other players will know they can disproportionately hurt you with the robber if they steal it.

- preserve juicy settlement locations with judicious road placement. Lock up that port that's critical to your strategy early. Nothing more infuriating than having an opponent beat you to it. [...] - if you are lacking a resource, don't place the robber on it. You want there to be lots of it in the game so people will trade it to you. Instead, place it on a resource that you have a lot of so you can increase your probability of trading for what you need.

Step 7: Commander [...] Using the robber well is crucial - on average, the robber will turn up once in every six rolls and it also gets moved when playing a knight.

- use it on the person in the strongest position (not necessarily the open points leader). Count unplayed development cards in someone's hand as points. Someone who gets Longest Road early is rarely a threat in the long term.

- use the robber exclusively on your strongest opponent. Avoid motivating more than one of your opponents to seek revenge!

Shuffle the development cards Y and place them face down beside the resource cards.
Place the 2 special cards and the dice beside the board.
Place the robber in the desert.
The set-up phase has 2 rounds. Each player builds 1 road and 1 settlement per round.
Round One Each player rolls both dice. The player who rolls highest is the starting player and begins. [...] K Knight Cards When you play a “Knight” development card during your turn, you must immediately move the robber Y. Place the knight card face up in front of you.
You must move the robber away from its current spot and onto the number token of any other terrain hex or on the desert.
You then steal 1 resource card from a player who has a settlement or a city adjacent to the robber. If there are 2 or more such players, you may choose your victim.

- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

Early Game Placement Strategy:
- Focus on a plentiful resource present on the board and start with a 2:1 port of that resource (may build wide or tall, depending on the board layout).
- Identify your goals: know what you want to build and go after the necessary resources.
- Aim for an 8-5-10 placement with a secondary placement of 6-9-4 to ensure good number variety.
- Place your first roads strategically to avoid dead ends and ensure future expansion.

Mid-Game Resource Management:
- Ensure access to all needed resources between your two placements.
- Complementary placements are key: if you start with Lumber-Brick-Wheat, aim for Ore and Wool in your next placement.
- Adapt your strategy based on the game phase: prioritize different resources as the game progresses.
- Avoid overproducing resources that can't be used effectively.

Late-Game Victory Point Optimization:
- Don't stress over settlement positioning in the late game; focus on placing them anywhere for victory points.
- Pick up Longest Road as late as possible to avoid becoming a target.
- Use victory point cards to create uncertainty among opponents.

Effective Trading and Negotiation:
- Be flexible in negotiations; consider multi-resource trades if 1-for-1 exchanges aren't suitable.
- Use the bank or ports for trading if player negotiations aren't favorable.

Development Card Usage:
- Use development cards strategically to gain an advantage.
- Hidden development cards can deter opponents from blocking or stealing from you.
- Leverage the information asymmetry of development cards to drive your strategy.

Robber Placement Strategy:
- Avoid placing the robber on resources you lack; instead, target resources you have in abundance to increase trade opportunities.
- Use the robber on the strongest opponent, not just the open points leader.
- Consider unplayed development cards in an opponent's hand as potential points.
- Use the robber exclusively on your strongest opponent to avoid motivating multiple opponents to seek revenge.================================= Tool Message =================================
