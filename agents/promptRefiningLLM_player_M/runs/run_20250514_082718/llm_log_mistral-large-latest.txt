You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN. That means 10 victory points.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>
6. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively
7. Think about the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)================================== Ai Message ==================================

Colonist Strategies: What are the Best Catan Starting Strategies?

Today we will be giving you pointers on the best starting placement strategies for Settlers of Catan that you can use in Colonist.

Colonist.io

1. Identify Your Goals

The first and most important Catan Strategy is knowing what you want to build. This will dictate which resources you should go after when you place your starting settlements. [...] Also you don’t want to overproduce resources which can’t be used and then lose them to a 7 roll.

A much more ideal setup would be an 8-5-10 placement, with a secondary placement of 6-9-4.

These are all good numbers, and you’ve got a variety, meaning that you’re more likely to collect on any given roll.

It’s not always possible to get good number variety, and you will more often than not have a duplicate number, but it’s important to be as diverse as possible. [...] This is where the road placement comes in very handy. Placing your first roads is actually very important, as doing it wrong can set you back a few turns.

Just make sure that your road points to a spot on the map that you can move out to, even if the resource production isn’t high.

A common error to make is pointing the road to a goldmine of resources and numbers, only to have your neighbor place there next turn, making your road a dead end for you.

While the introductory game comes with a recommended board layout, later games are played on a randomized hex tile layout.  Take a close look at these random layouts at the start of the game. Are there two of the same resource next to one another?  Is at least one of the numbered chits on those tiles reasonably high? Consider placing a Settlement in the most advantageous intersection of those tiles, then build roads and additional Settlements around them to block your opponents from doing the [...] When looking for intersections to place your first Settlements, pay less attention to the type of resource and more attention to the number of dots on the hex tiles that make up the intersections.  The type of resource matters less than the frequency of obtaining them. After all, resources can be traded to the bank at 4:1 or at Ports for an even better return (see below).

<Document href="https://blog.education.nationalgeographic.org/2013/08/29/a-resource-management-lesson-settlers-of-catan/"/>
Different combinations of resources are required to build different things, meaning that the importance of certain resources shifts throughout the game. For example, bricks and lumber are important at the beginning because they are needed to build roads. Sheep and wheat gain importance when the time comes to build settlements, followed by ore when it’s time to build cities. Acquiring these resources depends on the game board, which is (for all purposes) a map of the mythical Catan. [...] The value of specific resources changes as players look to develop their settlements from roads into cities. It’s also important to use the resources that you have. If a seven is rolled and you have more than seven resource cards, you must give up half of them. Wise resource management becomes a key element to winning the game.
Standard 15: How physical systems affect human systems. [...] The goal of Settlers is to be the first person to earn 10 Victory Points. Victory Points are mostly earned by building settlements and cities. To build settlements and cities, one must first build roads. To build all of these things, one must earn resources: brick, lumber, wheat, ore, and sheep.

When Catan (or The Settlers of Catan, as it was originally named) was first published in 1995 it created something of a revelation in board game circles, undeniably changing the way people would look at board games and gaming in general.  Part of Catan’s success has been due to designer Klaus Teuber’s ability to combine different gaming mechanics (resource management, trading, route building, dice rolling) in a way that made the game easy to teach and learn, while maintaining enough depth to [...] Each hexagonal resource tile in Catan gets a round chit placed on top of them.  Each chit shows the number that needs to be rolled to produce the resource represented to any player with an adjacent Settlement.  Below each number are a series of dots. These dots indicate how likely that number is to appear on a given roll of the two dice. The more dots, the more likely that number is to be rolled — meaning the more likely those resources will be handed out.

1. Get one of everything. You're going to need all of wood, brick, wheat, sheep, and ore, so why not make sure you have them all at the start? Place your first settlement so you get 3 different resources, and pick up the final 2 with your last placement. [...] The last 4 photos show what you need to build roads, settlements, cities and development cards. Wheat is uniquely a part of 3 different builds, so is the one resource everyone should make sure they have. Ore always needs wheat in order to be played. Wood and brick are always used together in even amounts, so try to balance these. If you end up with a big excess of a resource over something it pairs with, your plans had better include a port. The fact that the same amount of brick and wood are [...] 5. Balance resources. Try to get roughly the same number of pips of wood and brick, and similarly for ore and wheat. Paired resources like 9 of wood and 9 of brick will give you an instant road every time a 9 is rolled, and this sort of synergy is powerful.

6. Where to next? You need to consider options for expansion, and this can be a good tie-breaker in your decision making if you feel two placements are essentially equal. See roads, next step.

Don't stress over settlement positioning in the late game - put them anywhere you can, they're victory points rather than production sources.

Obvious leads make you a target. Longest Road in particular should be picked up as late as possible. Joining up two separate road segments with a big road-building push and unveiling 2 victory point cards can give you the win from 6 points. Largest Army on the other hand needs to be more openly competed for, because of the play-only-one-development-card-per-turn rule. Victory point cards are great to have because they create uncertainty in your opponents (is it a VP or a monopoly card?). [...] The strategies all kind of blend together in the late game when everyone has multiple cities/settlements/roads/cards, trading is mostly happening with the bank/ports for fear of letting someone else go out on their turn, battle will be fierce for the bonus cards, and development cards are disappearing at a furious rate. Don't stress over settlement positioning in the late game - put them anywhere you can, they're victory points rather than production sources. [...] I've assumed that 6 development cards will get you 3 knights, a victory point, and 6 cards from the knights + Year of Plenty/Road Building/Monopoly cards, and subtracted these from the required production. YMMV.

Thing Two: Catan is won by having ten points.  Those first two Settlements you placed before the game really started?  They’re worth one point each. That means Catan is really only about scoring eight Victory Points. Eight.  Make each point you score — and each point you prevent your opponents from scoring — count.
Be adaptable in your game plan and smart about each one of those points and, like me, you should find your chances of winning improving with each game.
TagsBoard Game Strategy Guides [...] Given the distribution of the types of Development Cards in the deck, the odds are that you’re likely to draw a soldier.  That’s not necessarily a bad thing: soldiers can be used to move the Robber off of one of your tiles, or just to move it to a place that will hinder your opponents.  Even better, three soldiers gets you the Largest Army card. As with the Longest Road, the Largest Army gets you two Victory Points as long as you can hold onto it until the end of the game. [...] I have been caught off guard far too many times and have struggled to find a way to gain those last Victory Points.  My fellow players, however, have clearly planned ahead. For instance, if you’re counting on the extra points Cities give you as part of your winning strategy, make sure you have good access to ore.  If that Longest Road or Largest Army is essential to your win, you need to keep those numbers up so no one steals it away from you. Those unplayed Development Cards start looking more

When trading resources with other players, it can be easy for the negotiations to break down when you can’t find a suitable 1 for 1 exchange. However, you greatly increase your likelihood of reaching a deal if you can find things other than what initially brought you to the table over which to trade. A personal favorite of mine is including a promise for one (or both) of the sides not to place the robber on each other the next time they move it. This makes the trade more of a win-win, but it [...] In Settlers of Catan — and in life — the most important negotiations aren’t truly one time events. You still have to interact with your counterpart long after any single negotiation ends, and the tenor of every negotiation influences the relationship that follows. To increase the likelihood of success in future negotiations, it is always a good idea to build goodwill in advance of need. Think of goodwill like a bank that you build up and depletes when you use it. If you build goodwill only when [...] Building goodwill can manifest through taking mercy on a struggling player with robber placement (and letting him or her know), making many trades early in the game, or even rationally explaining to someone you are robbing of resources exactly why you are doing it, so they don’t take it personally and seek retribution.

Reciprocity is among the most powerful “Weapons of Influence,”and you should use it to your advantage.

Experienced players often use hidden development cards to scare away other players from blocking and stealing from them, take away another player’s settlement spot, steal the longest road, shockingly build a city (or two), and even prevent another player from winning on their turn. Development cards offer an additional layer of strategy and players can leverage this favorable information asymmetry to drive the direction of their path to 10 Victory Points. [...] Newer players are very focused on the board in front of them and are always looking to build the next road, settlement, and city. They often overlook development cards since it is off the board. This phenomenon exists in both the online and physical game but it is much more pronounced in the physical version because development cards are more out of sight, placed to the side of each player compared to the centrally located board that is some 30 to 40 times the size of a development card. This [...] While the perceived probability of drawing each development card will shift as the game progresses, it is important to remember that the more hidden development cards that you own relative to other players, the closer your perceived probability is to the actual probability.

- try to avoid trading down to just a few cards with the bank and being stuck unable to build. Chances are, you're doing so for a resource you're finding hard to get and therefore other players will know they can disproportionately hurt you with the robber if they steal it.

- preserve juicy settlement locations with judicious road placement. Lock up that port that's critical to your strategy early. Nothing more infuriating than having an opponent beat you to it. [...] - if you are lacking a resource, don't place the robber on it. You want there to be lots of it in the game so people will trade it to you. Instead, place it on a resource that you have a lot of so you can increase your probability of trading for what you need.

Step 7: Commander [...] Using the robber well is crucial - on average, the robber will turn up once in every six rolls and it also gets moved when playing a knight.

- use it on the person in the strongest position (not necessarily the open points leader). Count unplayed development cards in someone's hand as points. Someone who gets Longest Road early is rarely a threat in the long term.

- use the robber exclusively on your strongest opponent. Avoid motivating more than one of your opponents to seek revenge!

Sort the resource cards into 5 stacks and place them face up beside the board.
Shuffle the development cards Y and place them face down beside the resource cards.
Place the 2 special cards and the dice beside the board.
Place the robber in the desert.
The set-up phase has 2 rounds. Each player builds 1 road and 1 settlement per round.
Round One Each player rolls both dice. The player who rolls highest is the starting player and begins. [...] K Knight Cards When you play a “Knight” development card during your turn, you must immediately move the robber Y. Place the knight card face up in front of you.
You must move the robber away from its current spot and onto the number token of any other terrain hex or on the desert.
You then steal 1 resource card from a player who has a settlement or a city adjacent to the robber. If there are 2 or more such players, you may choose your victim.

Catan: Cities & Knights has an extra provision (a variant, if you will) that allows for the Robber to only come to Catan when the first Barbarian invaders land.

Mastering the Robber’s placement is critical. For example, targeting high-value hexes like ore or wheat can cripple opponents’ strategies. Learn how to weaponize the Robber in our guide to Catan Robber Placement: Your Key to Victory and discover advanced tactics like bluffing with

Here is the revised prompt:

You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN. That means 10 victory points.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>
6. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively
7. Think about the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

Early Game Placement Strategy:
- Identify your goals and the resources needed to achieve them.
- Aim for diverse number placements like 8-5-10 and 6-9-4 to ensure a variety of resources.
- Place roads strategically to avoid dead ends and ensure future expansion options.
- Consider placing settlements near 2:1 ports for a plentiful resource to facilitate trading.

Mid-Game Resource Management:
- Different resources are needed for different builds; prioritize bricks and lumber for roads, sheep and wheat for settlements, and ore for cities.
- Use the resources you have; avoid holding more than seven cards to prevent losing half to a seven roll.
- Balance your resources, especially wood and brick for roads, and ore and wheat for cities.

Late-Game Victory Point Optimization:
- In the late game, focus on placing settlements anywhere to gain victory points rather than production.
- Aim to secure the Longest Road and Largest Army for additional victory points.
- Use development cards strategically to gain an advantage, especially victory point cards to create uncertainty.

Effective Trading and Negotiation:
- Include additional benefits in trades, such as promises not to place the robber on each other.
- Build goodwill with other players to increase the likelihood of successful future negotiations.
- Be cautious with trades; ensure they benefit you more than your opponents.

Development Card Usage:
- Use development cards to scare away opponents, secure settlement spots, and prevent others from winning.
- Leverage the information asymmetry of hidden development cards to drive your strategy.
- Prioritize ore, wheat, and sheep during initial placements to focus on development cards.

Robber Placement Strategy:
- Use the robber to target high-value hexes like ore or wheat to cripple opponents' strategies.
- Place the robber on resources you have in abundance to increase your trading chances.
- Focus the robber on the strongest opponent to hinder their progress.

By following these strategies, you can improve your chances of winning against AlphaBetaPlayer.Evolve Counter: 0
