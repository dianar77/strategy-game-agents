    "prompt_used": "You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.\n\nRules:\n1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions\n2. Your aim is to WIN. That means 10 victory points.\n3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \\boxed{5}\n4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number\n5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:\n   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>\n6. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively\n7. Think about the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action\n\nBoard Understanding Guide:\n- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers\n- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile\n- \ud83d\udd0d marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex\n- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section\n- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy\n- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)",

Colonist Strategies: What are the Best Catan Starting Strategies?

Today we will be giving you pointers on the best starting placement strategies for Settlers of Catan that you can use in Colonist.

Colonist.io

1. Identify Your Goals

The first and most important Catan Strategy is knowing what you want to build. This will dictate which resources you should go after when you place your starting settlements. [...] Also you don‚Äôt want to overproduce resources which can‚Äôt be used and then lose them to a 7 roll.

A much more ideal setup would be an 8-5-10 placement, with a secondary placement of 6-9-4.

These are all good numbers, and you‚Äôve got a variety, meaning that you‚Äôre more likely to collect on any given roll.

It‚Äôs not always possible to get good number variety, and you will more often than not have a duplicate number, but it‚Äôs important to be as diverse as possible. [...] This is where the road placement comes in very handy. Placing your first roads is actually very important, as doing it wrong can set you back a few turns.

Just make sure that your road points to a spot on the map that you can move out to, even if the resource production isn‚Äôt high.

A common error to make is pointing the road to a goldmine of resources and numbers, only to have your neighbor place there next turn, making your road a dead end for you.

While the introductory game comes with a recommended board layout, later games are played on a randomized hex tile layout.¬† Take a close look at these random layouts at the start of the game. Are there two of the same resource next to one another?¬† Is at least one of the numbered chits on those tiles reasonably high? Consider placing a Settlement in the most advantageous intersection of those tiles, then build roads and additional Settlements around them to block your opponents from doing the [...] When looking for intersections to place your first Settlements, pay less attention to the type of resource and more attention to the number of dots on the hex tiles that make up the intersections.¬† The type of resource matters less than the frequency of obtaining them. After all, resources can be traded to the bank at 4:1 or at Ports for an even better return (see below).

That being said, having access to all of the resources is not only important, it may also lead to your mid and end game phases becoming a trivial matter.

Between your two placements, try your best to have access to each needed resource.

For example, if you place on a Lumber-Brick-Wheat combination, your next placement should preferably have Ore and Wool together. This is where complementary placements come in. [...] In addition, this would also give you a pretty good idea on how you would want your game to progress.

There are three main strategies you can focus on:

Settlements and Longest Road - Your essential resources would be high amount of Lumber, Brick and some amount of Wool, and Wheat.

Hybrid Expansion ¬†- Occupying as much as you can of the map thereby acquiring more resources. For this strategy you will need to produce a balanced amount of all resources. [...] Say you‚Äôve found two potential spots that will give you all your resources, only this time, you notice that both the spots have the same numbers!

This means that you‚Äôll produce well if any of those numbers roll, but it also means that you would only collect resources from three different numbers.

I mentioned this earlier: Colonist is a resource management game. But there won‚Äôt be anything for you to manage if you‚Äôre not producing resources.

Different combinations of resources are required to build different things, meaning that the importance of certain resources shifts throughout the game. For example, bricks and lumber are important at the beginning because they are needed to build roads. Sheep and wheat gain importance when the time comes to build settlements, followed by ore when it‚Äôs time to build cities. Acquiring these resources depends on the game board, which is (for all purposes) a map of the mythical Catan. [...] The value of specific resources changes as players look to develop their settlements from roads into cities. It‚Äôs also important to use the resources that you have. If a seven is rolled and you have more than seven resource cards, you must give up half of them. Wise resource management becomes a key element to winning the game.
Standard 15: How physical systems affect human systems. [...] The goal of Settlers is to be the first person to earn 10 Victory Points. Victory Points are mostly earned by building settlements and cities. To build settlements and cities, one must first build roads. To build all of these things, one must earn resources: brick, lumber, wheat, ore, and sheep.

When Catan (or The Settlers of Catan, as it was originally named) was first published in 1995 it created something of a revelation in board game circles, undeniably changing the way people would look at board games and gaming in general.¬† Part of Catan‚Äôs success has been due to designer Klaus Teuber‚Äôs ability to combine different gaming mechanics (resource management, trading, route building, dice rolling) in a way that made the game easy to teach and learn, while maintaining enough depth to

Obvious leads make you a target. Longest Road in particular should be picked up as late as possible. Joining up two separate road segments with a big road-building push and unveiling 2 victory point cards can give you the win from 6 points. Largest Army on the other hand needs to be more openly competed for, because of the play-only-one-development-card-per-turn rule. Victory point cards are great to have because they create uncertainty in your opponents (is it a VP or a monopoly card?). [...] The strategies all kind of blend together in the late game when everyone has multiple cities/settlements/roads/cards, trading is mostly happening with the bank/ports for fear of letting someone else go out on their turn, battle will be fierce for the bonus cards, and development cards are disappearing at a furious rate. Don't stress over settlement positioning in the late game - put them anywhere you can, they're victory points rather than production sources.

When trading resources with other players, it can be easy for the negotiations to break down when you can‚Äôt find a suitable 1 for 1 exchange. However, you greatly increase your likelihood of reaching a deal if you can find things other than what initially brought you to the table over which to trade. A personal favorite of mine is including a promise for one (or both) of the sides not to place the robber on each other the next time they move it. This makes the trade more of a win-win, but it [...] In Settlers of Catan ‚Äî and in life ‚Äî the most important negotiations aren‚Äôt truly one time events. You still have to interact with your counterpart long after any single negotiation ends, and the tenor of every negotiation influences the relationship that follows. To increase the likelihood of success in future negotiations, it is always a good idea to build goodwill in advance of need. Think of goodwill like a bank that you build up and depletes when you use it. If you build goodwill only when [...] Building goodwill can manifest through taking mercy on a struggling player with robber placement (and letting him or her know), making many trades early in the game, or even rationally explaining to someone you are robbing of resources exactly why you are doing it, so they don‚Äôt take it personally and seek retribution.

Reciprocity is among the most powerful ‚ÄúWeapons of Influence,‚Äùand you should use it to your advantage.

Experienced players often use hidden development cards to scare away other players from blocking and stealing from them, take away another player‚Äôs settlement spot, steal the longest road, shockingly build a city (or two), and even prevent another player from winning on their turn. Development cards offer an additional layer of strategy and players can leverage this favorable information asymmetry to drive the direction of their path to 10 Victory Points. [...] Newer players are very focused on the board in front of them and are always looking to build the next road, settlement, and city. They often overlook development cards since it is off the board. This phenomenon exists in both the online and physical game but it is much more pronounced in the physical version because development cards are more out of sight, placed to the side of each player compared to the centrally located board that is some 30 to 40 times the size of a development card. This [...] While the perceived probability of drawing each development card will shift as the game progresses, it is important to remember that the more hidden development cards that you own relative to other players, the closer your perceived probability is to the actual probability. Therefore, by having more hidden development cards and using this information to calculate probabilities more accurately (technical skill), you have more knowledge about the remaining development card deck, minimizing your

Tips for Effective Robber Placement: Focus on players close to winning or holding critical resources. Avoid random placements; always have a clear goal

- try to avoid trading down to just a few cards with the bank and being stuck unable to build. Chances are, you're doing so for a resource you're finding hard to get and therefore other players will know they can disproportionately hurt you with the robber if they steal it.

- preserve juicy settlement locations with judicious road placement. Lock up that port that's critical to your strategy early. Nothing more infuriating than having an opponent beat you to it. [...] - if you are lacking a resource, don't place the robber on it. You want there to be lots of it in the game so people will trade it to you. Instead, place it on a resource that you have a lot of so you can increase your probability of trading for what you need.

Step 7: Commander [...] Using the robber well is crucial - on average, the robber will turn up once in every six rolls and it also gets moved when playing a knight.

- use it on the person in the strongest position (not necessarily the open points leader). Count unplayed development cards in someone's hand as points. Someone who gets Longest Road early is rarely a threat in the long term.

- use the robber exclusively on your strongest opponent. Avoid motivating more than one of your opponents to seek revenge!
