Updated plan: Buy development cards to gain flexibility, build towards Largest Army (+2 VP), and potentially score hidden victory points. While doing this, prepare to expand toward resource diversity (ports or new nodes with üß±BRICK and üå≤WOOD). Long-term goal: claim Longest Road by disrupting RED.

Updated plan: - **Immediate:** Play Knight cards to secure Largest Army and disrupt RED's resource flow. Roll the dice for additional resources.
- **Mid-Term:** Build roads toward a port or critical nodes to expand resource diversity.
- **Long-Term:** Focus on claiming Largest Army (+2 VP), Longest Road (+2 VP), and building cities to win at 10 VP.
LLM chose action 1: Roll the dice
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2372 chars)
Updated plan: 1. Play Knight cards to secure Largest Army and disrupt Red's resource flow. Priority is to block üåæ6 and steal resources from Red.
2. Accumulate resources for roads and settlements at critical positions (aiming toward Longest Road and port access).
3. Upgrade settlements to cities for additional VP and resource production efficiency.
LLM chose action 0: Play Knight card - Move the robber and steal a resource
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2556 chars)
Updated plan: 1. Move robber to üåæ6 and steal from RED to disrupt their resource flow.
2. Use the stolen resource (if helpful) combined with current resources (2 üå≤, 1 üêë) to prioritize next moves:
   - Build roads toward critical nodes or a port.
   - Consider buying a development card if possible to secure Largest Army.
3. Upgrade settlements to cities as resources allow for more VP and production.
LLM chose action 1: Move robber to (1, -1, 0) and steal from RED
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2749 chars)
Updated plan: 1. Play Knight card to move robber to üåæ6 and steal from RED.
2. Build roads toward the port at üèúÔ∏è- hex (edge 5, 16). 
3. Use upcoming resources to upgrade settlements to cities or secure Largest Army through development cards.
4. Focus on disrupting RED with robber placement and counters.

Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2282 chars)
Updated plan: After moving the robber and stealing a resource, focus on drawing more development cards to secure the Largest Army. Simultaneously, build toward port access (ports give trading flexibility for resource shortages). Continue disrupting RED to slow their progress.

Updated plan: Play the Knight card: Move robber to hex üåæ6 to block RED‚Äôs wheat-heavy production, and steal a resource to potentially improve my card pool. This preserves Largest Army, unblocks my ‚õèÔ∏è5 ore production, and aligns with the goal of city upgrades and development cards.
