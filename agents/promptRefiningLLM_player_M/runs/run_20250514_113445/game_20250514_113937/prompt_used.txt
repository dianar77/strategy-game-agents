You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN. That means 10 victory points.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>
6. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively
7. Think about the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- üîç marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

Early Game Placement Strategy:
1. **Identify Your Goals**: Determine what you want to build early on. This will guide your initial settlement placements.
2. **Resource Diversity**: Aim for a variety of resources. An ideal setup could be an 8-5-10 placement, with a secondary placement of 6-9-4. This ensures you collect resources on most rolls.
3. **Road Placement**: Place your first roads strategically. Ensure they point to spots on the map where you can expand, even if the resource production isn't high initially.
4. **Avoid Dead Ends**: Be cautious not to point your road towards a highly productive area that might be blocked by opponents.
5. **Prioritize High Probability Numbers**: Focus on the number of dots on the hex tiles rather than the resource type. High probability numbers increase the frequency of resource collection.
6. **Block Opponents**: Use your settlements and roads to block opponents from accessing high-value intersections.
7. **Avoid the Coast**: The coast never makes sense for your first placement as it will only have 2 hexes of production (3 for you to build more central) and it will inhibit your optionality to expand.
8. **Center, Inner, and Coastal Rings**: Think of a Catan map as having 3 areas ‚Äî the center, inner, and coastal rings. The ‚Äúcenter‚Äù is all the spots around the middle hex, ‚Äúinner‚Äù is the next one outward, and so on.
9. **Contestable Directions**: Anytime your road is in a contestable direction, make sure you‚Äôre the one cutting someone off or are more likely to win the race ‚Äî not the other way around.

Mid-Game Resource Management:
1. **Trade Wisely**: Use ports for better trade rates. Prioritize building towards ports to facilitate better trades.
2. **Diversify Resources**: Ensure you have a balanced mix of resources to support various building and development needs.
3. **Plan Ahead**: Think about the next 2-3 turns and what resources you will need for your planned actions.
4. **Steady Resource Stream**: Place your two first settlements on intersections with six different numbers total with ideally, the highest probability. If you can manage it, the best numbers to be on from the beginning would be 4,5,6,8,9,10 or some combination as close to that as possible.
5. **Avoid Overproduction**: Be cautious not to overproduce resources which can‚Äôt be used and then lose them to a 7 roll.

Late-Game Victory Point Optimization:
1. **Focus on Victory Points**: Prioritize actions that directly or indirectly increase your victory points.
2. **Upgrade Cities**: Upgrading settlements to cities can provide a significant boost in victory points.
3. **Use Development Cards**: Strategically use development cards to gain additional victory points or hinder opponents.
4. **Balance Strategy**: Your path to Victory involves focusing on increasing production early and then using those resources to either build a settlement or city next whichever one is easiest the late game struggles won't [...] Catan, previously known as The Settlers of Catan or simply Settlers, is a multiplayer board game designed by Klaus Teuber. It was first published in 1995 in Germany by Franckh-Kosmos Verlag (Kosmos) as Die Siedler von Catan. Players take on the roles of settlers, each attempting to build and develop holdings while trading and acquiring resources. Players gain victory points as their settlements grow and the first to reach a set number of victory points, typically 10, wins. The game and its many [...] be as bad you might just be the last one to get there though your breakdown is simply going to look like this if you have a chance at longest road you need two cities minimum and preferably three and then two to four settlements depending on cities cities are expensive but require less roads you aren't likely to have both Victory Point cards and longest road but if you have one Victory point card you need three cities if you have two Victory Point cards you can get by with just two cities.

Effective Trading and Negotiation:
1. **Negotiate Fairly**: Offer trades that are beneficial to both parties to increase the likelihood of successful trades.
2. **Use Ports**: Leverage ports for better trade rates, especially if you have an abundance of a particular resource.
3. **Block Opponents**: Be cautious when trading with opponents who are close to winning.
4. **Build Goodwill**: Increase the likelihood of success in future negotiations by building goodwill in advance of need. Think of goodwill like a bank that you build up and depletes when you use it.
5. **Reciprocity**: Use reciprocity to your advantage. If you build goodwill only when [...] Building goodwill can manifest through taking mercy on a struggling player with robber placement (and letting him or her know), making many trades early in the game, or even rationally explaining to someone you are robbing of resources exactly why you are doing it, so they don‚Äôt take it personally and seek retribution.

Development Card Usage:
1. **Knight Cards**: Use knight cards to move the robber and potentially steal resources from opponents.
2. **Victory Point Cards**: Hold onto victory point cards until you are close to winning to avoid becoming a target.
3. **Strategic Use**: Use other development cards strategically to gain advantages or hinder opponents.
4. **Development Card Strategy**: The concept for the Development Card Strategy is to ignore wood and brick completely when you are placing your initial settlements. Instead, you want, in order, Ore, Wheat, and Sheep. Cities and Development Cards are your friends.
5. **Early Cities**: The earlier that you can get cities the better, but you simply cannot wait to buy development cards. You're going to need soldiers to keep the robber off you, and the other, non-VP cards come in handy too. If I'm close to having enough for a city, I'll usually hold out. If I've already bought a couple of cards and have a soldier in waiting, I'll definitely try to save up.

Robber Placement Strategy:
1. **Target Opponents**: Place the robber on tiles where opponents have settlements to disrupt their resource collection.
2. **Protect Yourself**: Avoid placing the robber on tiles where you have settlements unless strategically necessary.
3. **Block High Probability Numbers**: Place the robber on high probability number tiles to maximize disruption.
4. **Affect One Player**: Make sure that you only affect one player with the robber. Affecting two players doubles the revenge factor, as well as doubles the motivation to move it with a soldier card.
5. **Early/Middle Game**: In the early/middle game, you should place the robber on the player to your right. The reason is that it will spend more time there. The player to your right can‚Äôt take the robber off for two or [...] Once in a while, one of the above strategies for the robber may be correct. If someone has nine victory points, and a handful of cards, putting the robber on them probably is the best idea.
6. **End Game**: At the end of the game, placing the robber is pretty easy to figure out. But, what about in the beginning of the game? What about the middle? Placing the robber in the early/middle of the game will absolutely have one intended effect ‚Äì someone will not like you for putting it on them.
7. **Strongest Opponent**: Use the robber well is crucial - on average, the robber will turn up once in every six rolls and it also gets moved when playing a knight. Use it on the person in the strongest position (not necessarily the open points leader). Count unplayed development cards in someone's hand as points. Someone who gets Longest Road early is rarely a threat in the long term.
8. **Avoid Motivating Revenge**: Use the robber exclusively on your strongest opponent. Avoid motivating more than one of your opponents to seek revenge!
