Colonist Strategies: What are the Best Catan Starting Strategies?

Today we will be giving you pointers on the best starting placement strategies for Settlers of Catan that you can use in Colonist.

Colonist.io

1. Identify Your Goals

The first and most important Catan Strategy is knowing what you want to build. This will dictate which resources you should go after when you place your starting settlements. [...] Also you don’t want to overproduce resources which can’t be used and then lose them to a 7 roll.

A much more ideal setup would be an 8-5-10 placement, with a secondary placement of 6-9-4.

These are all good numbers, and you’ve got a variety, meaning that you’re more likely to collect on any given roll.

It’s not always possible to get good number variety, and you will more often than not have a duplicate number, but it’s important to be as diverse as possible. [...] This is where the road placement comes in very handy. Placing your first roads is actually very important, as doing it wrong can set you back a few turns.

Just make sure that your road points to a spot on the map that you can move out to, even if the resource production isn’t high.

A common error to make is pointing the road to a goldmine of resources and numbers, only to have your neighbor place there next turn, making your road a dead end for you.

While the introductory game comes with a recommended board layout, later games are played on a randomized hex tile layout.  Take a close look at these random layouts at the start of the game. Are there two of the same resource next to one another?  Is at least one of the numbered chits on those tiles reasonably high? Consider placing a Settlement in the most advantageous intersection of those tiles, then build roads and additional Settlements around them to block your opponents from doing the [...] When looking for intersections to place your first Settlements, pay less attention to the type of resource and more attention to the number of dots on the hex tiles that make up the intersections.  The type of resource matters less than the frequency of obtaining them. After all, resources can be traded to the bank at 4:1 or at Ports for an even better return (see below).

Setup includes randomly placing large hexagonal tiles (each showing a resource or the desert) in a honeycomb shape and surrounding them with water tiles, some of which contain ports of exchange. Number disks, which will correspond to die rolls (two 6-sided dice are used), are placed on each resource tile. Each player is given two settlements (think: houses) and roads (sticks) which are, in turn, placed on intersections and borders of the resource tiles. Players collect a hand of resource cards [...] to you is to try to go second and i think the idea is that when you're picking fourth amongst really 
great players like this who know where to choose there's going to be fewer options available to 
you late in the game and conversely if you're the first player there's really going to be nothing 
left by the time you get to the eighth pick unless it's a really rich board so going second 
is ideal to get a really strong early pick but not end up with the very worst pick if you [...] In CATAN (formerly The Settlers of Catan), players try to be the dominant force on the island of Catan by building settlements, cities, and roads. On each turn dice are rolled to determine what resources the island produces. Players build by spending resources (sheep, wheat, wood, brick and ore) that are depicted by these resource cards; each land type, with the exception of the unproductive desert, produces a specific resource: hills produce brick, forests produce wood, mountains produce ore,

You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN. That means 10 victory points.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>
6. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively
7. Think about the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy

Early Game Placement Strategy:
1. **Identify Your Goals**: Determine what you want to build early on. This will guide your initial settlement placements.
2. **Resource Diversity**: Aim for a variety of resources. An ideal setup could be an 8-5-10 placement, with a secondary placement of 6-9-4. This ensures you collect resources on most rolls.
3. **Road Placement**: Place your first roads strategically. Ensure they point to spots on the map where you can expand, even if the resource production isn't high initially.
4. **Avoid Dead Ends**: Be cautious not to point your road towards a highly productive area that might be blocked by opponents.
5. **Prioritize High Probability Numbers**: Focus on the number of dots on the hex tiles rather than the resource type. High probability numbers increase the frequency of resource collection.
6. **Block Opponents**: Use your settlements and roads to block opponents from accessing high-value intersections.

Mid-Game Resource Management:
1. **Trade Wisely**: Use ports for better trade rates. Prioritize building towards ports to facilitate better trades.
2. **Diversify Resources**: Ensure you have a balanced mix of resources to support various building and development needs.
3. **Plan Ahead**: Think about the next 2-3 turns and what resources you will need for your planned actions.

Late-Game Victory Point Optimization:
1. **Focus on Victory Points**: Prioritize actions that directly or indirectly increase your victory points.
2. **Upgrade Cities**: Upgrading settlements to cities can provide a significant boost in victory points.
3. **Use Development Cards**: Strategically use development cards to gain additional victory points or hinder opponents.

Effective Trading and Negotiation:
1. **Negotiate Fairly**: Offer trades that are beneficial to both parties to increase the likelihood of successful trades.
2. **Use Ports**: Leverage ports for better trade rates, especially if you have an abundance of a particular resource.
3. **Block Opponents**: Be cautious when trading with opponents who are close to winning.

Development Card Usage:
1. **Knight Cards**: Use knight cards to move the robber and potentially steal resources from opponents.
2. **Victory Point Cards**: Hold onto victory point cards until you are close to winning to avoid becoming a target.
3. **Strategic Use**: Use other development cards strategically to gain advantages or hinder opponents.

Robber Placement Strategy:
1. **Target Opponents**: Place the robber on tiles where opponents have settlements to disrupt their resource collection.
2. **Protect Yourself**: Avoid placing the robber on tiles where you have settlements unless strategically necessary.
3. **Block High Probability Numbers**: Place the robber on high probability number tiles to maximize disruption.================================= Tool Message =================================

Prioritize building towards ports to facilitate better trades.\n2. **Diversify Resources**: Ensure you have a balanced mix of resources to support various building and development needs.\n3. **Plan Ahead**: Think about the next 2-3 turns and what resources you will need for your planned actions.\n\nLate-Game Victory Point Optimization:\n1. **Focus on Victory Points**: Prioritize actions that directly or indirectly increase your victory points.\n2. **Upgrade Cities**: Upgrading settlements to cities can provide a significant boost in victory points.\n3. **Use Development Cards**: Strategically use development cards to gain additional victory points or hinder opponents.\n\nEffective Trading and Negotiation:\n1. **Negotiate Fairly**: Offer trades that are beneficial to both parties to increase the likelihood of successful trades.\n2. **Use Ports**: Leverage ports for better trade rates, especially if you have an abundance of a particular resource.\n3. **Block Opponents**: Be cautious when trading with opponents who are close to winning.\n\nDevelopment Card Usage:\n1. **Knight Cards**: Use knight cards to move the robber and potentially steal resources from opponents.\n2. **Victory Point Cards**: Hold onto victory point cards until you are close to winning to avoid becoming a target.\n3. **Strategic Use**: Use other development cards strategically to gain advantages or hinder opponents.\n\nRobber Placement Strategy:\n1. **Target Opponents**: Place the robber on tiles where opponents have settlements to disrupt their resource collection.\n2. **Protect Yourself**: Avoid placing the robber on tiles where you have settlements unless strategically necessary.\n3. **Block High Probability Numbers**: Place the robber on high probability number tiles to maximize disruption.",

You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN. That means 10 victory points.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>
6. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively
7. Think about the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)================================== Ai Message ==================================

Colonist Strategies: What are the Best Catan Starting Strategies?

Today we will be giving you pointers on the best starting placement strategies for Settlers of Catan that you can use in Colonist.

Colonist.io

1. Identify Your Goals

The first and most important Catan Strategy is knowing what you want to build. This will dictate which resources you should go after when you place your starting settlements. [...] Also you don’t want to overproduce resources which can’t be used and then lose them to a 7 roll.

A much more ideal setup would be an 8-5-10 placement, with a secondary placement of 6-9-4.

These are all good numbers, and you’ve got a variety, meaning that you’re more likely to collect on any given roll.

It’s not always possible to get good number variety, and you will more often than not have a duplicate number, but it’s important to be as diverse as possible. [...] This is where the road placement comes in very handy. Placing your first roads is actually very important, as doing it wrong can set you back a few turns.

Just make sure that your road points to a spot on the map that you can move out to, even if the resource production isn’t high.

A common error to make is pointing the road to a goldmine of resources and numbers, only to have your neighbor place there next turn, making your road a dead end for you.

While the introductory game comes with a recommended board layout, later games are played on a randomized hex tile layout.  Take a close look at these random layouts at the start of the game. Are there two of the same resource next to one another?  Is at least one of the numbered chits on those tiles reasonably high? Consider placing a Settlement in the most advantageous intersection of those tiles, then build roads and additional Settlements around them to block your opponents from doing the [...] When looking for intersections to place your first Settlements, pay less attention to the type of resource and more attention to the number of dots on the hex tiles that make up the intersections.  The type of resource matters less than the frequency of obtaining them. After all, resources can be traded to the bank at 4:1 or at Ports for an even better return (see below).

Setup includes randomly placing large hexagonal tiles (each showing a resource or the desert) in a honeycomb shape and surrounding them with water tiles, some of which contain ports of exchange. Number disks, which will correspond to die rolls (two 6-sided dice are used), are placed on each resource tile. Each player is given two settlements (think: houses) and roads (sticks) which are, in turn, placed on intersections and borders of the resource tiles. Players collect a hand of resource cards [...] to you is to try to go second and i think the idea is that when you're picking fourth amongst really 
great players like this who know where to choose there's going to be fewer options available to 
you late in the game and conversely if you're the first player there's really going to be nothing 
left by the time you get to the eighth pick unless it's a really rich board so going second 
is ideal to get a really strong early pick but not end up with the very worst pick if you [...] In CATAN (formerly The Settlers of Catan), players try to be the dominant force on the island of Catan by building settlements, cities, and roads. On each turn dice are rolled to determine what resources the island produces. Players build by spending resources (sheep, wheat, wood, brick and ore) that are depicted by these resource cards; each land type, with the exception of the unproductive desert, produces a specific resource: hills produce brick, forests produce wood, mountains produce ore,

Different combinations of resources are required to build different things, meaning that the importance of certain resources shifts throughout the game. For example, bricks and lumber are important at the beginning because they are needed to build roads. Sheep and wheat gain importance when the time comes to build settlements, followed by ore when it’s time to build cities. Acquiring these resources depends on the game board, which is (for all purposes) a map of the mythical Catan. [...] The value of specific resources changes as players look to develop their settlements from roads into cities. It’s also important to use the resources that you have. If a seven is rolled and you have more than seven resource cards, you must give up half of them. Wise resource management becomes a key element to winning the game.
Standard 15: How physical systems affect human systems. [...] The goal of Settlers is to be the first person to earn 10 Victory Points. Victory Points are mostly earned by building settlements and cities. To build settlements and cities, one must first build roads. To build all of these things, one must earn resources: brick, lumber, wheat, ore, and sheep.

When Catan (or The Settlers of Catan, as it was originally named) was first published in 1995 it created something of a revelation in board game circles, undeniably changing the way people would look at board games and gaming in general.  Part of Catan’s success has been due to designer Klaus Teuber’s ability to combine different gaming mechanics (resource management, trading, route building, dice rolling) in a way that made the game easy to teach and learn, while maintaining enough depth to [...] Each hexagonal resource tile in Catan gets a round chit placed on top of them.  Each chit shows the number that needs to be rolled to produce the resource represented to any player with an adjacent Settlement.  Below each number are a series of dots. These dots indicate how likely that number is to appear on a given roll of the two dice. The more dots, the more likely that number is to be rolled — meaning the more likely those resources will be handed out.

1. Get one of everything. You're going to need all of wood, brick, wheat, sheep, and ore, so why not make sure you have them all at the start? Place your first settlement so you get 3 different resources, and pick up the final 2 with your last placement. [...] The last 4 photos show what you need to build roads, settlements, cities and development cards. Wheat is uniquely a part of 3 different builds, so is the one resource everyone should make sure they have. Ore always needs wheat in order to be played. Wood and brick are always used together in even amounts, so try to balance these. If you end up with a big excess of a resource over something it pairs with, your plans had better include a port. The fact that the same amount of brick and wood are [...] 5. Balance resources. Try to get roughly the same number of pips of wood and brick, and similarly for ore and wheat. Paired resources like 9 of wood and 9 of brick will give you an instant road every time a 9 is rolled, and this sort of synergy is powerful.

6. Where to next? You need to consider options for expansion, and this can be a good tie-breaker in your decision making if you feel two placements are essentially equal. See roads, next step.

Obvious leads make you a target. Longest Road in particular should be picked up as late as possible. Joining up two separate road segments with a big road-building push and unveiling 2 victory point cards can give you the win from 6 points. Largest Army on the other hand needs to be more openly competed for, because of the play-only-one-development-card-per-turn rule. Victory point cards are great to have because they create uncertainty in your opponents (is it a VP or a monopoly card?). [...] The strategies all kind of blend together in the late game when everyone has multiple cities/settlements/roads/cards, trading is mostly happening with the bank/ports for fear of letting someone else go out on their turn, battle will be fierce for the bonus cards, and development cards are disappearing at a furious rate. Don't stress over settlement positioning in the late game - put them anywhere you can, they're victory points rather than production sources.

I decided to do a note on this victory point issue because… well it’s complicated.
Obtaining an additional victory point change the victory condition, and will either let a player decide which victory point it will replace or ends up changing a victory from a 10 point victory to an 11 point victory. In this last case, it will not save you anything, since the additional victory point is not needed anyway to win. [...] Second, you calculate the probability of having picked (3 knights, no victory point card and one “other”) for our first 4 cards, multiplied by the probability of picking the missing victory point card on the fifth card. In this scenario, there is 5 victory point card left in a deck of 21 cards.
 = 4.11%
In Full: [...] In Catan, victory is declared as soon as you reach 10 points, so an extra victory point means that you’ll get one less victory point from another source. It changes the possible combinations of victory elements you can achieve.
So what do we do when evaluating the probabilities of drawing cards for a particular victory?
Ignore the possibility to draw victory point cards?
Or ignore the impact of drawing those cards when evaluating victories that are not supposed to involve them?

When trading resources with other players, it can be easy for the negotiations to break down when you can’t find a suitable 1 for 1 exchange. However, you greatly increase your likelihood of reaching a deal if you can find things other than what initially brought you to the table over which to trade. A personal favorite of mine is including a promise for one (or both) of the sides not to place the robber on each other the next time they move it. This makes the trade more of a win-win, but it [...] In Settlers of Catan — and in life — the most important negotiations aren’t truly one time events. You still have to interact with your counterpart long after any single negotiation ends, and the tenor of every negotiation influences the relationship that follows. To increase the likelihood of success in future negotiations, it is always a good idea to build goodwill in advance of need. Think of goodwill like a bank that you build up and depletes when you use it. If you build goodwill only when [...] Building goodwill can manifest through taking mercy on a struggling player with robber placement (and letting him or her know), making many trades early in the game, or even rationally explaining to someone you are robbing of resources exactly why you are doing it, so they don’t take it personally and seek retribution.

Reciprocity is among the most powerful “Weapons of Influence,”and you should use it to your advantage.

Experienced players often use hidden development cards to scare away other players from blocking and stealing from them, take away another player’s settlement spot, steal the longest road, shockingly build a city (or two), and even prevent another player from winning on their turn. Development cards offer an additional layer of strategy and players can leverage this favorable information asymmetry to drive the direction of their path to 10 Victory Points.

The concept for the Development Card Strategy is to ignore wood and brick completely when you are placing your initial settlements. Instead, you want, in order, Ore, Wheat, and Sheep. Cities and Development Cards are your friends.  
To achieve 10 victory points, most of the time you'll want to: [...] The hardest decision when playing this strategy seems to be determining when to buy a card and when to wait to buy a city. The earlier that you can get cities the better, but you simply cannot wait to buy development cards. You're going to need soldiers to keep the robber off you, and the other, non-VP cards come in handy too. If I'm close to having enough for a city, I'll usually hold out. If I've already bought a couple of cards and have a soldier in waiting, I'll definitely try to save up. [...] 3rd Player. Initial placement 5 ore, 4 wheat, 8 wheat, 11 wood, 6 brick. Won. Despite my best efforts to play a Development Card strategy, the best placements for ore and wheat gave me brick and wood, so this one played more like an expansion strategy. I finished with longest road, largest army, 2 cities, 2 settlements, and 1 bonus point.
4th Player. Initial placement 4 ore, 3 wheat, 8 sheep, 5 sheep, 11 sheep. Lost. This strategy is not viable with such low quantities of ore and wheat.

My favorite strategy in Catan is the development card strategy. One of the biggest reasons I love this strategy so much is because I win with this strategy more than any other strategy. [...] to start off with because you want to be wrapping up ranking up your resources but let's say that I was able to trade this to one of my teammates for sheep I'm just gonna place then you'd get another resource card and you've got the start of your army which remember army is only two victory points now a pro of this strategy of focusing on getting development cards is as you're getting development cards there are five victory points in this deck plus you've got the largest army so you have the

- try to avoid trading down to just a few cards with the bank and being stuck unable to build. Chances are, you're doing so for a resource you're finding hard to get and therefore other players will know they can disproportionately hurt you with the robber if they steal it.

- preserve juicy settlement locations with judicious road placement. Lock up that port that's critical to your strategy early. Nothing more infuriating than having an opponent beat you to it. [...] - if you are lacking a resource, don't place the robber on it. You want there to be lots of it in the game so people will trade it to you. Instead, place it on a resource that you have a lot of so you can increase your probability of trading for what you need.

Step 7: Commander [...] Using the robber well is crucial - on average, the robber will turn up once in every six rolls and it also gets moved when playing a knight.

- use it on the person in the strongest position (not necessarily the open points leader). Count unplayed development cards in someone's hand as points. Someone who gets Longest Road early is rarely a threat in the long term.

- use the robber exclusively on your strongest opponent. Avoid motivating more than one of your opponents to seek revenge!

Catan: Cities & Knights has an extra provision (a variant, if you will) that allows for the Robber to only come to Catan when the first Barbarian invaders land.

Mastering the Robber’s placement is critical. For example, targeting high-value hexes like ore or wheat can cripple opponents’ strategies. Learn how to weaponize the Robber in our guide to Catan Robber Placement: Your Key to Victory and discover advanced tactics like bluffing with

</Document>================================== Ai Message ==================================

Based on the game results and the performance history, here are the key observations and strategies to improve the prompt for the Catan Player promptRefiningLLM_player_M:

1. **Early Game Placement Strategy**:
   - **Identify Your Goals**: Determine what you want to build early on. This will guide your initial settlement placements.
   - **Resource Diversity**: Aim for a variety of resources. An ideal setup could be an 8-5-10 placement, with a secondary placement of 6-9-4. This ensures you collect resources on most rolls.
   - **Road Placement**: Place your first roads strategically. Ensure they point to spots on the map where you can expand, even if the resource production isn't high initially.
   - **Avoid Dead Ends**: Be cautious not to point your road towards a highly productive area that might be blocked by opponents.
   - **Prioritize High Probability Numbers**: Focus on the number of dots on the hex tiles rather than the resource type. High probability numbers increase the frequency of resource collection.
   - **Block Opponents**: Use your settlements and roads to block opponents from accessing high-value intersections.

2. **Mid-Game Resource Management**:
   - **Trade Wisely**: Use ports for better trade rates. Prioritize building towards ports to facilitate better trades.
   - **Diversify Resources**: Ensure you have a balanced mix of resources to support various building and development needs.
   - **Plan Ahead**: Think about the next 2-3 turns and what resources you will need for your planned actions.

3. **Late-Game Victory Point Optimization**:
   - **Focus on Victory Points**: Prioritize actions that directly or indirectly increase your victory points.
   - **Upgrade Cities**: Upgrading settlements to cities can provide a significant boost in victory points.
   - **Use Development Cards**: Strategically use development cards to gain additional victory points or hinder opponents.

4. **Effective Trading and Negotiation**:
   - **Negotiate Fairly**: Offer trades that are beneficial to both parties to increase the likelihood of successful trades.
   - **Use Ports**: Leverage ports for better trade rates, especially if you have an abundance of a particular resource.
   - **Block Opponents**: Be cautious when trading with opponents who are close to winning.

5. **Development Card Usage**:
   - **Knight Cards**: Use knight cards to move the robber and potentially steal resources from opponents.
   - **Victory Point Cards**: Hold onto victory point cards until you are close to winning to avoid becoming a target.
   - **Strategic Use**: Use other development cards strategically to gain advantages or hinder opponents.

6. **Robber Placement Strategy**:
   - **Target Opponents**: Place the robber on tiles where opponents have settlements to disrupt their resource collection.
   - **Protect Yourself**: Avoid placing the robber on tiles where you have settlements unless strategically necessary.
   - **Block High Probability Numbers**: Place the robber on high probability number tiles to maximize disruption.

### Revised Prompt

You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

**Rules**:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions.
2. Your aim is to WIN. That means 10 victory points.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}.
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number.
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>.
6. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively.
7. Think about the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action.

**Board Understanding Guide**:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers.
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile.
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex.
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section.
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy.
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1).

You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN. That means 10 victory points.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>
6. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively
7. Think about the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)================================== Ai Message ==================================

As a rule of thumb, during your first settlement placement, it’s usually best not to point your road toward the middle of the board. You will likely have no expansion spots since everyone will start toward the middle, rather than the coast.
Anytime your road is in a contestable direction, make sure you’re the one cutting someone off or are more likely to win the race — not the other way around. [...] Think of a Catan map as having 3 areas — the center, inner, and coastal rings. The “center” is all the spots around the middle hex, “inner” is the next one outward, and so on.
For starters, the coast never makes sense for your first placement as it will only have 2 hexes of production (3 for you to build more central) and it will inhibit your optionality to expand.

Placing your initial settlements in Settlers of Catan is crucial for setting up a strong position in the game. Here are some strategies to consider when placing your settlements:
1. Resource Variety

Aim to have access to a variety of resources (brick, wood, wheat, sheep, and ore). A balanced resource base helps you build roads, settlements, and cities effectively.

2. High-Probability Numbers [...] Work with what the dice give you. Sometimes, that will be nothing.
Your strategy in Catan will be based heavily off of your initial placement of your Settlements. The serpentine placement pattern (P1, P2, P3, P4, P4, P3, P2, P1) is very good at balancing out who gets access to the best spots, but think carefully about where you’re going to start and what you’re going to work towards. [...] Cities first strategy
Since cities double your earning power, an effective strategy can be to optimize for as much wheat and rock as you can get early in the game, upgrade to two cities as quickly as possible, and then trade out some of your abundant wheat and rock for wood and brick later to build roads and expand. If you can get access to sheep with this strategy, you can also quickly and easily pursue a strategy of buying a lot of development cards before building more settlements.

Colonist Strategies: What are the Best Catan Starting Strategies?

Today we will be giving you pointers on the best starting placement strategies for Settlers of Catan that you can use in Colonist.

Colonist.io

1. Identify Your Goals

The first and most important Catan Strategy is knowing what you want to build. This will dictate which resources you should go after when you place your starting settlements. [...] Overall, placing your starting settlements wisely will give you a huge advantage in Settlers of Catan. But this is just one of the many strategies that can be employed in the game.

It is very hard to employ all these tactics in every game though, as the board is arranged randomly by the system and your neighbors choices restrict yours.

However, having a good grasp of starting positions and initial placements will help greatly in winning you your next Colonist game. [...] Also you don’t want to overproduce resources which can’t be used and then lose them to a 7 roll.

A much more ideal setup would be an 8-5-10 placement, with a secondary placement of 6-9-4.

These are all good numbers, and you’ve got a variety, meaning that you’re more likely to collect on any given roll.

It’s not always possible to get good number variety, and you will more often than not have a duplicate number, but it’s important to be as diverse as possible.

Different combinations of resources are required to build different things, meaning that the importance of certain resources shifts throughout the game. For example, bricks and lumber are important at the beginning because they are needed to build roads. Sheep and wheat gain importance when the time comes to build settlements, followed by ore when it’s time to build cities. Acquiring these resources depends on the game board, which is (for all purposes) a map of the mythical Catan. [...] The goal of Settlers is to be the first person to earn 10 Victory Points. Victory Points are mostly earned by building settlements and cities. To build settlements and cities, one must first build roads. To build all of these things, one must earn resources: brick, lumber, wheat, ore, and sheep. [...] The value of specific resources changes as players look to develop their settlements from roads into cities. It’s also important to use the resources that you have. If a seven is rolled and you have more than seven resource cards, you must give up half of them. Wise resource management becomes a key element to winning the game.

Given there is a limit of 7 cards before you are at risk of losing half your cards, it can be advantageous to have a steady stream of resources coming into your hand throughout the game. The best way to do this is to place your two first settlements on intersections with six different numbers total with ideally, the highest probability. If you can manage it, the best numbers to be on from the beginning would be 4,5,6,8,9,10 or some combination as close to that as possible.

Having access to all five resources is extremely important and can be a game changer in the mid and late game.

It makes your strategy more flexible, meaning that you can adapt to unique circumstances. Let's take a look into one example:

Analyze blue’s setup. He is going for dev cards + city strategy. He probably will not get to the ore port before red because red has access to wood and brick while blue doesn’t.

When trading resources with other players, it can be easy for the negotiations to break down when you can’t find a suitable 1 for 1 exchange. However, you greatly increase your likelihood of reaching a deal if you can find things other than what initially brought you to the table over which to trade. A personal favorite of mine is including a promise for one (or both) of the sides not to place the robber on each other the next time they move it. This makes the trade more of a win-win, but it [...] In Settlers of Catan — and in life — the most important negotiations aren’t truly one time events. You still have to interact with your counterpart long after any single negotiation ends, and the tenor of every negotiation influences the relationship that follows. To increase the likelihood of success in future negotiations, it is always a good idea to build goodwill in advance of need. Think of goodwill like a bank that you build up and depletes when you use it. If you build goodwill only when [...] Building goodwill can manifest through taking mercy on a struggling player with robber placement (and letting him or her know), making many trades early in the game, or even rationally explaining to someone you are robbing of resources exactly why you are doing it, so they don’t take it personally and seek retribution.

Reciprocity is among the most powerful “Weapons of Influence,”and you should use it to your advantage.

The concept for the Development Card Strategy is to ignore wood and brick completely when you are placing your initial settlements. Instead, you want, in order, Ore, Wheat, and Sheep. Cities and Development Cards are your friends.  
To achieve 10 victory points, most of the time you'll want to: [...] 3rd Player. Initial placement 5 ore, 4 wheat, 8 wheat, 11 wood, 6 brick. Won. Despite my best efforts to play a Development Card strategy, the best placements for ore and wheat gave me brick and wood, so this one played more like an expansion strategy. I finished with longest road, largest army, 2 cities, 2 settlements, and 1 bonus point.
4th Player. Initial placement 4 ore, 3 wheat, 8 sheep, 5 sheep, 11 sheep. Lost. This strategy is not viable with such low quantities of ore and wheat. [...] The hardest decision when playing this strategy seems to be determining when to buy a card and when to wait to buy a city. The earlier that you can get cities the better, but you simply cannot wait to buy development cards. You're going to need soldiers to keep the robber off you, and the other, non-VP cards come in handy too. If I'm close to having enough for a city, I'll usually hold out. If I've already bought a couple of cards and have a soldier in waiting, I'll definitely try to save up.

in this video we're going to go through the development card strategy for Catan so that you can win your next game first part in this strategy is placement now this is the development card strategy so you're going to need wheat sheep and or and these three resources are what you're going to use throughout the game to get development cards so we're going to when you're looking at your first placement try and find a location that is good for that so for example we've got four wheat sheep or sheep [...] to start off with because you want to be wrapping up ranking up your resources but let's say that I was able to trade this to one of my teammates for sheep I'm just gonna place then you'd get another resource card and you've got the start of your army which remember army is only two victory points now a pro of this strategy of focusing on getting development cards is as you're getting development cards there are five victory points in this deck plus you've got the largest army so you have the

Commander: buys 6 development cards to get Largest Army and a victory point, builds 2 roads, 2 settlements and 3 cities. Developer: buys 12 development cards to get Largest Army and 2 victory points, builds 1 settlement and 3 cities.Producer: builds 6 roads, 4 settlements and 4 cities.Explorer: builds 10 roads to get Longest Road, 4 settlements, and 2 cities.Queen of Sheep: replaces all ore needs with sheep, plays Commander, buys 6 development cards to get Largest Army and a victory point, [...] This strategy focuses on development cards, building other things only as an aside when development and resource cards dictate it. They'll usually end up with the Largest Army card and the lion's share of the victory point cards, and generally make a fabulous nuisance of themselves. This is a great strategy if you have good ore/wheat/sheep balance, but is always fun to play, especially because you'll be dropping the robber all over the place but your board position will appear sufficiently weak [...] Using the robber well is crucial - on average, the robber will turn up once in every six rolls and it also gets moved when playing a knight.

- use it on the person in the strongest position (not necessarily the open points leader). Count unplayed development cards in someone's hand as points. Someone who gets Longest Road early is rarely a threat in the long term.

- use the robber exclusively on your strongest opponent. Avoid motivating more than one of your opponents to seek revenge!

You should also make sure that you only affect one player with the robber. Affecting two players doubles the revenge factor, as well as doubles the motivation to move it with a soldier card. If only one person is affected, then the robber will probably spend longer on that spot. As a rule of thumb, in the early/middle game, you should place the robber on the player to your right. The reason is that it will spend more time there. The player to your right can’t take the robber off for two or [...] Once in a while, one of the above strategies for the robber may be correct. If someone has nine victory points, and a handful of cards, putting the robber on them probably is the best idea. At the end of the game, placing the robber is pretty easy to figure out. But, what about in the beginning of the game? What about the middle? Placing the robber in the early/middle of the game will absolutely have one intended effect – someone will not like you for putting it on them. If you’ve hit someone [...] THE ROBBER:  
You’re always supposed to place the robber on the person with the most victory points, right? Or, wait, you’re supposed to place it on a 6 or 8 so that it takes out someone’s best number, correct? Or was it that you should try to put it so that it affects as many people as possible? And of course, you never want to put the robber on someone holding development cards because they probably have a soldier, and they’ll just put it right back on you won’t they?

- try to avoid trading down to just a few cards with the bank and being stuck unable to build. Chances are, you're doing so for a resource you're finding hard to get and therefore other players will know they can disproportionately hurt you with the robber if they steal it.

- preserve juicy settlement locations with judicious road placement. Lock up that port that's critical to your strategy early. Nothing more infuriating than having an opponent beat you to it. [...] - if you are lacking a resource, don't place the robber on it. You want there to be lots of it in the game so people will trade it to you. Instead, place it on a resource that you have a lot of so you can increase your probability of trading for what you need.

Step 7: Commander [...] - block what that opponent needs, rather than their highest producing tile. Their city on the 8 of ore just got hit twice - tempting target, right? Wrong. Block their 4 of wheat instead.

- if your opponents are all similarly positioned, hitting the person to your right (on a tile that they exclusively benefit from) will ensure the robber sits there for as long as possible without retaliation. If they try to get you back you may be able to respond immediately.

It probably goes without saying, but robber placement should hinder the biggest threat to you and in general, experienced Catan gamers will be understanding if that’s what you do.  Less forgiving is when you use it early on, hitting many people at once.  That tends to leave a bad taste in people’s mouths as they look for retribution.  Having multiple people gunning for you is not fun.  Also, if you can’t figure out who to sic the robber on, place it on the person to your right.  There’s a high [...] 3. Understand which resources are scarce:
The interesting thing in Settlers of Catan is that no matter your strategy, you’ll need every resource eventually.  And if one of the resources turns out to be rare, expect competition to be fierce! Use those rare resources to your advantage by trading aggressively and cutting deals that would be borderline highway robbery.

    new_text: You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN. That means 10 victory points.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>
6. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively
7. Think about the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

Early Game Placement Strategy:
1. **Identify Your Goals**: Determine what you want to build early on. This will guide your initial settlement placements.
2. **Resource Diversity**: Aim for a variety of resources. An ideal setup could be an 8-5-10 placement, with a secondary placement of 6-9-4. This ensures you collect resources on most rolls.
3. **Road Placement**: Place your first roads strategically. Ensure they point to spots on the map where you can expand, even if the resource production isn't high initially.
4. **Avoid Dead Ends**: Be cautious not to point your road towards a highly productive area that might be blocked by opponents.
5. **Prioritize High Probability Numbers**: Focus on the number of dots on the hex tiles rather than the resource type. High probability numbers increase the frequency of resource collection.
6. **Block Opponents**: Use your settlements and roads to block opponents from accessing high-value intersections.
7. **Avoid the Coast**: The coast never makes sense for your first placement as it will only have 2 hexes of production (3 for you to build more central) and it will inhibit your optionality to expand.
8. **Center, Inner, and Coastal Rings**: Think of a Catan map as having 3 areas — the center, inner, and coastal rings. The “center” is all the spots around the middle hex, “inner” is the next one outward, and so on.
9. **Contestable Directions**: Anytime your road is in a contestable direction, make sure you’re the one cutting someone off or are more likely to win the race — not the other way around.

Mid-Game Resource Management:
1. **Trade Wisely**: Use ports for better trade rates. Prioritize building towards ports to facilitate better trades.
2. **Diversify Resources**: Ensure you have a balanced mix of resources to support various building and development needs.
3. **Plan Ahead**: Think about the next 2-3 turns and what resources you will need for your planned actions.
4. **Steady Resource Stream**: Place your two first settlements on intersections with six different numbers total with ideally, the highest probability. If you can manage it, the best numbers to be on from the beginning would be 4,5,6,8,9,10 or some combination as close to that as possible.
5. **Avoid Overproduction**: Be cautious not to overproduce resources which can’t be used and then lose them to a 7 roll.

Late-Game Victory Point Optimization:
1. **Focus on Victory Points**: Prioritize actions that directly or indirectly increase your victory points.
2. **Upgrade Cities**: Upgrading settlements to cities can provide a significant boost in victory points.
3. **Use Development Cards**: Strategically use development cards to gain additional victory points or hinder opponents.
4. **Balance Strategy**: Your path to Victory involves focusing on increasing production early and then using those resources to either build a settlement or city next whichever one is easiest the late game struggles won't [...] Catan, previously known as The Settlers of Catan or simply Settlers, is a multiplayer board game designed by Klaus Teuber. It was first published in 1995 in Germany by Franckh-Kosmos Verlag (Kosmos) as Die Siedler von Catan. Players take on the roles of settlers, each attempting to build and develop holdings while trading and acquiring resources. Players gain victory points as their settlements grow and the first to reach a set number of victory points, typically 10, wins. The game and its many [...] be as bad you might just be the last one to get there though your breakdown is simply going to look like this if you have a chance at longest road you need two cities minimum and preferably three and then two to four settlements depending on cities cities are expensive but require less roads you aren't likely to have both Victory Point cards and longest road but if you have one Victory point card you need three cities if you have two Victory Point cards you can get by with just two cities.

Effective Trading and Negotiation:
1. **Negotiate Fairly**: Offer trades that are beneficial to both parties to increase the likelihood of successful trades.
2. **Use Ports**: Leverage ports for better trade rates, especially if you have an abundance of a particular resource.
3. **Block Opponents**: Be cautious when trading with opponents who are close to winning.
4. **Build Goodwill**: Increase the likelihood of success in future negotiations by building goodwill in advance of need. Think of goodwill like a bank that you build up and depletes when you use it.
5. **Reciprocity**: Use reciprocity to your advantage. If you build goodwill only when [...] Building goodwill can manifest through taking mercy on a struggling player with robber placement (and letting him or her know), making many trades early in the game, or even rationally explaining to someone you are robbing of resources exactly why you are doing it, so they don’t take it personally and seek retribution.

Development Card Usage:
1. **Knight Cards**: Use knight cards to move the robber and potentially steal resources from opponents.
2. **Victory Point Cards**: Hold onto victory point cards until you are close to winning to avoid becoming a target.
3. **Strategic Use**: Use other development cards strategically to gain advantages or hinder opponents.
4. **Development Card Strategy**: The concept for the Development Card Strategy is to ignore wood and brick completely when you are placing your initial settlements. Instead, you want, in order, Ore, Wheat, and Sheep. Cities and Development Cards are your friends.
5. **Early Cities**: The earlier that you can get cities the better, but you simply cannot wait to buy development cards. You're going to need soldiers to keep the robber off you, and the other, non-VP cards come in handy too. If I'm close to having enough for a city, I'll usually hold out. If I've already bought a couple of cards and have a soldier in waiting, I'll definitely try to save up.

Robber Placement Strategy:
1. **Target Opponents**: Place the robber on tiles where opponents have settlements to disrupt their resource collection.
2. **Protect Yourself**: Avoid placing the robber on tiles where you have settlements unless strategically necessary.
3. **Block High Probability Numbers**: Place the robber on high probability number tiles to maximize disruption.
4. **Affect One Player**: Make sure that you only affect one player with the robber. Affecting two players doubles the revenge factor, as well as doubles the motivation to move it with a soldier card.
5. **Early/Middle Game**: In the early/middle game, you should place the robber on the player to your right. The reason is that it will spend more time there. The player to your right can’t take the robber off for two or [...] Once in a while, one of the above strategies for the robber may be correct. If someone has nine victory points, and a handful of cards, putting the robber on them probably is the best idea.
6. **End Game**: At the end of the game, placing the robber is pretty easy to figure out. But, what about in the beginning of the game? What about the middle? Placing the robber in the early/middle of the game will absolutely have one intended effect – someone will not like you for putting it on them.
7. **Strongest Opponent**: Use the robber well is crucial - on average, the robber will turn up once in every six rolls and it also gets moved when playing a knight. Use it on the person in the strongest position (not necessarily the open points leader). Count unplayed development cards in someone's hand as points. Someone who gets Longest Road early is rarely a threat in the long term.
8. **Avoid Motivating Revenge**: Use the robber exclusively on your strongest opponent. Avoid motivating more than one of your opponents to seek revenge!================================= Tool Message =================================

Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively\n7. Think about the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action\n\nBoard Understanding Guide:\n- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers\n- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile\n- \ud83d\udd0d marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex\n- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section\n- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy\n- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)\n\nEarly Game Placement Strategy:\n1. **Identify Your Goals**: Determine what you want to build early on. This will guide your initial settlement placements.\n2. **Resource Diversity**: Aim for a variety of resources. An ideal setup could be an 8-5-10 placement, with a secondary placement of 6-9-4. This ensures you collect resources on most rolls.\n3. **Road Placement**: Place your first roads strategically. Ensure they point to spots on the map where you can expand, even if the resource production isn't high initially.\n4. **Avoid Dead Ends**: Be cautious not to point your road towards a highly productive area that might be blocked by opponents.\n5. **Prioritize High Probability Numbers**: Focus on the number of dots on the hex tiles rather than the resource type. High probability numbers increase the frequency of resource collection.\n6. **Block Opponents**: Use your settlements and roads to block opponents from accessing high-value intersections.\n7. **Avoid the Coast**: The coast never makes sense for your first placement as it will only have 2 hexes of production (3 for you to build more central) and it will inhibit your optionality to expand.\n8. **Center, Inner, and Coastal Rings**: Think of a Catan map as having 3 areas \u2014 the center, inner, and coastal rings. The \u201ccenter\u201d is all the spots around the middle hex, \u201cinner\u201d is the next one outward, and so on.\n9. **Contestable Directions**: Anytime your road is in a contestable direction, make sure you\u2019re the one cutting someone off or are more likely to win the race \u2014 not the other way around.\n\nMid-Game Resource Management:\n1. **Trade Wisely**: Use ports for better trade rates. Prioritize building towards ports to facilitate better trades.\n2. **Diversify Resources**: Ensure you have a balanced mix of resources to support various building and development needs.\n3. **Plan Ahead**: Think about the next 2-3 turns and what resources you will need for your planned actions.\n4. **Steady Resource Stream**: Place your two first settlements on intersections with six different numbers total with ideally, the highest probability. If you can manage it, the best numbers to be on from the beginning would be 4,5,6,8,9,10 or some combination as close to that as possible.\n5. **Avoid Overproduction**: Be cautious not to overproduce resources which can\u2019t be used and then lose them to a 7 roll.\n\nLate-Game Victory Point Optimization:\n1. **Focus on Victory Points**: Prioritize actions that directly or indirectly increase your victory points.\n2. **Upgrade Cities**: Upgrading settlements to cities can provide a significant boost in victory points.\n3. **Use Development Cards**: Strategically use development cards to gain additional victory points or hinder opponents.\n4. **Balance Strategy**: Your path to Victory involves focusing on increasing production early and then using those resources to either build a settlement or city next whichever one is easiest the late game struggles won't [...] Catan, previously known as The Settlers of Catan or simply Settlers, is a multiplayer board game designed by Klaus Teuber. It was first published in 1995 in Germany by Franckh-Kosmos Verlag (Kosmos) as Die Siedler von Catan. Players take on the roles of settlers, each attempting to build and develop holdings while trading and acquiring resources. Players gain victory points as their settlements grow and the first to reach a set number of victory points, typically 10, wins. The game and its many [...] be as bad you might just be the last one to get there though your breakdown is simply going to look like this if you have a chance at longest road you need two cities minimum and preferably three and then two to four settlements depending on cities cities are expensive but require less roads you aren't likely to have both Victory Point cards and longest road but if you have one Victory point card you need three cities if you have two Victory Point cards you can get by with just two cities.\n\nEffective Trading and Negotiation:\n1. **Negotiate Fairly**: Offer trades that are beneficial to both parties to increase the likelihood of successful trades.\n2. **Use Ports**: Leverage ports for better trade rates, especially if you have an abundance of a particular resource.\n3. **Block Opponents**: Be cautious when trading with opponents who are close to winning.\n4. **Build Goodwill**: Increase the likelihood of success in future negotiations by building goodwill in advance of need. Think of goodwill like a bank that you build up and depletes when you use it.\n5. **Reciprocity**: Use reciprocity to your advantage. If you build goodwill only when [...] Building goodwill can manifest through taking mercy on a struggling player with robber placement (and letting him or her know), making many trades early in the game, or even rationally explaining to someone you are robbing of resources exactly why you are doing it, so they don\u2019t take it personally and seek retribution.\n\nDevelopment Card Usage:\n1. **Knight Cards**: Use knight cards to move the robber and potentially steal resources from opponents.\n2. **Victory Point Cards**: Hold onto victory point cards until you are close to winning to avoid becoming a target.\n3. **Strategic Use**: Use other development cards strategically to gain advantages or hinder opponents.\n4. **Development Card Strategy**: The concept for the Development Card Strategy is to ignore wood and brick completely when you are placing your initial settlements. Instead, you want, in order, Ore, Wheat, and Sheep. Cities and Development Cards are your friends.\n5. **Early Cities**: The earlier that you can get cities the better, but you simply cannot wait to buy development cards. You're going to need soldiers to keep the robber off you, and the other, non-VP cards come in handy too. If I'm close to having enough for a city, I'll usually hold out. If I've already bought a couple of cards and have a soldier in waiting, I'll definitely try to save up.\n\nRobber Placement Strategy:\n1. **Target Opponents**: Place the robber on tiles where opponents have settlements to disrupt their resource collection.\n2. **Protect Yourself**: Avoid placing the robber on tiles where you have settlements unless strategically necessary.\n3. **Block High Probability Numbers**: Place the robber on high probability number tiles to maximize disruption.\n4. **Affect One Player**: Make sure that you only affect one player with the robber. Affecting two players doubles the revenge factor, as well as doubles the motivation to move it with a soldier card.\n5. **Early/Middle Game**: In the early/middle game, you should place the robber on the player to your right. The reason is that it will spend more time there. The player to your right can\u2019t take the robber off for two or [...] Once in a while, one of the above strategies for the robber may be correct. If someone has nine victory points, and a handful of cards, putting the robber on them probably is the best idea.\n6. **End Game**: At the end of the game, placing the robber is pretty easy to figure out. But, what about in the beginning of the game? What about the middle? Placing the robber in the early/middle of the game will absolutely have one intended effect \u2013 someone will not like you for putting it on them.\n7. **Strongest Opponent**: Use the robber well is crucial - on average, the robber will turn up once in every six rolls and it also gets moved when playing a knight. Use it on the person in the strongest position (not necessarily the open points leader). Count unplayed development cards in someone's hand as points. Someone who gets Longest Road early is rarely a threat in the long term.\n8. **Avoid Motivating Revenge**: Use the robber exclusively on your strongest opponent. Avoid motivating more than one of your opponents to seek revenge!\n",

Colonist Strategies: What are the Best Catan Starting Strategies?

Today we will be giving you pointers on the best starting placement strategies for Settlers of Catan that you can use in Colonist.

Colonist.io

1. Identify Your Goals

The first and most important Catan Strategy is knowing what you want to build. This will dictate which resources you should go after when you place your starting settlements. [...] Also you don’t want to overproduce resources which can’t be used and then lose them to a 7 roll.

A much more ideal setup would be an 8-5-10 placement, with a secondary placement of 6-9-4.

These are all good numbers, and you’ve got a variety, meaning that you’re more likely to collect on any given roll.

It’s not always possible to get good number variety, and you will more often than not have a duplicate number, but it’s important to be as diverse as possible. [...] This is where the road placement comes in very handy. Placing your first roads is actually very important, as doing it wrong can set you back a few turns.

Just make sure that your road points to a spot on the map that you can move out to, even if the resource production isn’t high.

A common error to make is pointing the road to a goldmine of resources and numbers, only to have your neighbor place there next turn, making your road a dead end for you.

While the introductory game comes with a recommended board layout, later games are played on a randomized hex tile layout.  Take a close look at these random layouts at the start of the game. Are there two of the same resource next to one another?  Is at least one of the numbered chits on those tiles reasonably high? Consider placing a Settlement in the most advantageous intersection of those tiles, then build roads and additional Settlements around them to block your opponents from doing the [...] When looking for intersections to place your first Settlements, pay less attention to the type of resource and more attention to the number of dots on the hex tiles that make up the intersections.  The type of resource matters less than the frequency of obtaining them. After all, resources can be traded to the bank at 4:1 or at Ports for an even better return (see below).

Setup includes randomly placing large hexagonal tiles (each showing a resource or the desert) in a honeycomb shape and surrounding them with water tiles, some of which contain ports of exchange. Number disks, which will correspond to die rolls (two 6-sided dice are used), are placed on each resource tile. Each player is given two settlements (think: houses) and roads (sticks) which are, in turn, placed on intersections and borders of the resource tiles. Players collect a hand of resource cards [...] to you is to try to go second and i think the idea is that when you're picking fourth amongst really 
great players like this who know where to choose there's going to be fewer options available to 
you late in the game and conversely if you're the first player there's really going to be nothing 
left by the time you get to the eighth pick unless it's a really rich board so going second 
is ideal to get a really strong early pick but not end up with the very worst pick if you [...] In CATAN (formerly The Settlers of Catan), players try to be the dominant force on the island of Catan by building settlements, cities, and roads. On each turn dice are rolled to determine what resources the island produces. Players build by spending resources (sheep, wheat, wood, brick and ore) that are depicted by these resource cards; each land type, with the exception of the unproductive desert, produces a specific resource: hills produce brick, forests produce wood, mountains produce ore,

Different combinations of resources are required to build different things, meaning that the importance of certain resources shifts throughout the game. For example, bricks and lumber are important at the beginning because they are needed to build roads. Sheep and wheat gain importance when the time comes to build settlements, followed by ore when it’s time to build cities. Acquiring these resources depends on the game board, which is (for all purposes) a map of the mythical Catan. [...] The value of specific resources changes as players look to develop their settlements from roads into cities. It’s also important to use the resources that you have. If a seven is rolled and you have more than seven resource cards, you must give up half of them. Wise resource management becomes a key element to winning the game.
Standard 15: How physical systems affect human systems. [...] The goal of Settlers is to be the first person to earn 10 Victory Points. Victory Points are mostly earned by building settlements and cities. To build settlements and cities, one must first build roads. To build all of these things, one must earn resources: brick, lumber, wheat, ore, and sheep.

When Catan (or The Settlers of Catan, as it was originally named) was first published in 1995 it created something of a revelation in board game circles, undeniably changing the way people would look at board games and gaming in general.  Part of Catan’s success has been due to designer Klaus Teuber’s ability to combine different gaming mechanics (resource management, trading, route building, dice rolling) in a way that made the game easy to teach and learn, while maintaining enough depth to [...] Each hexagonal resource tile in Catan gets a round chit placed on top of them.  Each chit shows the number that needs to be rolled to produce the resource represented to any player with an adjacent Settlement.  Below each number are a series of dots. These dots indicate how likely that number is to appear on a given roll of the two dice. The more dots, the more likely that number is to be rolled — meaning the more likely those resources will be handed out.

1. Get one of everything. You're going to need all of wood, brick, wheat, sheep, and ore, so why not make sure you have them all at the start? Place your first settlement so you get 3 different resources, and pick up the final 2 with your last placement. [...] The last 4 photos show what you need to build roads, settlements, cities and development cards. Wheat is uniquely a part of 3 different builds, so is the one resource everyone should make sure they have. Ore always needs wheat in order to be played. Wood and brick are always used together in even amounts, so try to balance these. If you end up with a big excess of a resource over something it pairs with, your plans had better include a port. The fact that the same amount of brick and wood are [...] 5. Balance resources. Try to get roughly the same number of pips of wood and brick, and similarly for ore and wheat. Paired resources like 9 of wood and 9 of brick will give you an instant road every time a 9 is rolled, and this sort of synergy is powerful.

6. Where to next? You need to consider options for expansion, and this can be a good tie-breaker in your decision making if you feel two placements are essentially equal. See roads, next step.

Obvious leads make you a target. Longest Road in particular should be picked up as late as possible. Joining up two separate road segments with a big road-building push and unveiling 2 victory point cards can give you the win from 6 points. Largest Army on the other hand needs to be more openly competed for, because of the play-only-one-development-card-per-turn rule. Victory point cards are great to have because they create uncertainty in your opponents (is it a VP or a monopoly card?). [...] The strategies all kind of blend together in the late game when everyone has multiple cities/settlements/roads/cards, trading is mostly happening with the bank/ports for fear of letting someone else go out on their turn, battle will be fierce for the bonus cards, and development cards are disappearing at a furious rate. Don't stress over settlement positioning in the late game - put them anywhere you can, they're victory points rather than production sources.

I decided to do a note on this victory point issue because… well it’s complicated.
Obtaining an additional victory point change the victory condition, and will either let a player decide which victory point it will replace or ends up changing a victory from a 10 point victory to an 11 point victory. In this last case, it will not save you anything, since the additional victory point is not needed anyway to win. [...] Second, you calculate the probability of having picked (3 knights, no victory point card and one “other”) for our first 4 cards, multiplied by the probability of picking the missing victory point card on the fifth card. In this scenario, there is 5 victory point card left in a deck of 21 cards.
 = 4.11%
In Full: [...] In Catan, victory is declared as soon as you reach 10 points, so an extra victory point means that you’ll get one less victory point from another source. It changes the possible combinations of victory elements you can achieve.
So what do we do when evaluating the probabilities of drawing cards for a particular victory?
Ignore the possibility to draw victory point cards?
Or ignore the impact of drawing those cards when evaluating victories that are not supposed to involve them?

When trading resources with other players, it can be easy for the negotiations to break down when you can’t find a suitable 1 for 1 exchange. However, you greatly increase your likelihood of reaching a deal if you can find things other than what initially brought you to the table over which to trade. A personal favorite of mine is including a promise for one (or both) of the sides not to place the robber on each other the next time they move it. This makes the trade more of a win-win, but it [...] In Settlers of Catan — and in life — the most important negotiations aren’t truly one time events. You still have to interact with your counterpart long after any single negotiation ends, and the tenor of every negotiation influences the relationship that follows. To increase the likelihood of success in future negotiations, it is always a good idea to build goodwill in advance of need. Think of goodwill like a bank that you build up and depletes when you use it. If you build goodwill only when [...] Building goodwill can manifest through taking mercy on a struggling player with robber placement (and letting him or her know), making many trades early in the game, or even rationally explaining to someone you are robbing of resources exactly why you are doing it, so they don’t take it personally and seek retribution.

Reciprocity is among the most powerful “Weapons of Influence,”and you should use it to your advantage.

Experienced players often use hidden development cards to scare away other players from blocking and stealing from them, take away another player’s settlement spot, steal the longest road, shockingly build a city (or two), and even prevent another player from winning on their turn. Development cards offer an additional layer of strategy and players can leverage this favorable information asymmetry to drive the direction of their path to 10 Victory Points. [...] Newer players are very focused on the board in front of them and are always looking to build the next road, settlement, and city. They often overlook development cards since it is off the board. This phenomenon exists in both the online and physical game but it is much more pronounced in the physical version because development cards are more out of sight, placed to the side of each player compared to the centrally located board that is some 30 to 40 times the size of a development card. This [...] While the perceived probability of drawing each development card will shift as the game progresses, it is important to remember that the more hidden development cards that you own relative to other players, the closer your perceived probability is to the actual probability. Therefore, by having more hidden development cards and using this information to calculate probabilities more accurately (technical skill), you have more knowledge about the remaining development card deck, minimizing your

Catan: Seafarers uses the base game development cards which function exactly the same except for the following exceptions:

In Cities and Knights

Catan: Cities & Knights does not use development cards but uses Progress cards. These are generated through a combination of city improvements and dice rolls but function much the same as regular development cards.

In Traders and Barbarians [...] There are a couple of scenarios in Catan: Traders & Barbarians that use their own sets of development cards with varying abilities.

According to computer simulation tests, the best strategy for winning Catan is the Development Card Strategy.

6. What’s the Development Card Strategy?

The Catan Development Card Strategy focuses on ignoring wood and brick during the initial placement of settlements and instead prioritizing ore, wheat, and sheep. While it may sound counter intuitive, as wood and brick are essential to expanding your civilization, focusing on these higher-valued resources can be very lucrative. [...] In conclusion, Catan development cards are an important aspect of the game, providing players with various strategies to gain points and win the game. Understanding the cards’ distribution and when they can be played is crucial to maximizing their effectiveness.

- try to avoid trading down to just a few cards with the bank and being stuck unable to build. Chances are, you're doing so for a resource you're finding hard to get and therefore other players will know they can disproportionately hurt you with the robber if they steal it.

- preserve juicy settlement locations with judicious road placement. Lock up that port that's critical to your strategy early. Nothing more infuriating than having an opponent beat you to it. [...] - if you are lacking a resource, don't place the robber on it. You want there to be lots of it in the game so people will trade it to you. Instead, place it on a resource that you have a lot of so you can increase your probability of trading for what you need.

Step 7: Commander [...] Using the robber well is crucial - on average, the robber will turn up once in every six rolls and it also gets moved when playing a knight.

- use it on the person in the strongest position (not necessarily the open points leader). Count unplayed development cards in someone's hand as points. Someone who gets Longest Road early is rarely a threat in the long term.

- use the robber exclusively on your strongest opponent. Avoid motivating more than one of your opponents to seek revenge!

    new_text: You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN. That means 10 victory points.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>
6. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively
7. Think about the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

Early Game Placement Strategy:
1. **Identify Your Goals**: Determine what you want to build early on. This will guide your initial settlement placements.
2. **Resource Diversity**: Aim for a variety of resources. An ideal setup could be an 8-5-10 placement, with a secondary placement of 6-9-4. This ensures you collect resources on most rolls.
3. **Road Placement**: Place your first roads strategically. Ensure they point to spots on the map where you can expand, even if the resource production isn't high initially.
4. **Avoid Dead Ends**: Be cautious not to point your road towards a highly productive area that might be blocked by opponents.
5. **Prioritize High Probability Numbers**: Focus on the number of dots on the hex tiles rather than the resource type. High probability numbers increase the frequency of resource collection.
6. **Block Opponents**: Use your settlements and roads to block opponents from accessing high-value intersections.
7. **Avoid the Coast**: The coast never makes sense for your first placement as it will only have 2 hexes of production (3 for you to build more central) and it will inhibit your optionality to expand.
8. **Center, Inner, and Coastal Rings**: Think of a Catan map as having 3 areas — the center, inner, and coastal rings. The "center" is all the spots around the middle hex, "inner" is the next one outward, and so on.
9. **Contestable Directions**: Anytime your road is in a contestable direction, make sure you’re the one cutting someone off or are more likely to win the race — not the other way around.

Mid-Game Resource Management:
1. **Trade Wisely**: Use ports for better trade rates. Prioritize building towards ports to facilitate better trades.
2. **Diversify Resources**: Ensure you have a balanced mix of resources to support various building and development needs.
3. **Plan Ahead**: Think about the next 2-3 turns and what resources you will need for your planned actions.
4. **Steady Resource Stream**: Place your two first settlements on intersections with six different numbers total with ideally, the highest probability. If you can manage it, the best numbers to be on from the beginning would be 4,5,6,8,9,10 or some combination as close to that as possible.
5. **Avoid Overproduction**: Be cautious not to overproduce resources which can’t be used and then lose them to a 7 roll.

Late-Game Victory Point Optimization:
1. **Focus on Victory Points**: Prioritize actions that directly or indirectly increase your victory points.
2. **Upgrade Cities**: Upgrading settlements to cities can provide a significant boost in victory points.
3. **Use Development Cards**: Strategically use development cards to gain additional victory points or hinder opponents.
4. **Balance Strategy**: Your path to Victory involves focusing on increasing production early and then using those resources to either build a settlement or city next whichever one is easiest the late game struggles won't [...] Catan, previously known as The Settlers of Catan or simply Settlers, is a multiplayer board game designed by Klaus Teuber. It was first published in 1995 in Germany by Franckh-Kosmos Verlag (Kosmos) as Die Siedler von Catan. Players take on the roles of settlers, each attempting to build and develop holdings while trading and acquiring resources. Players gain victory points as their settlements grow and the first to reach a set number of victory points, typically 10, wins. The game and its many [...] be as bad you might just be the last one to get there though your breakdown is simply going to look like this if you have a chance at longest road you need two cities minimum and preferably three and then two to four settlements depending on cities cities are expensive but require less roads you aren't likely to have both Victory Point cards and longest road but if you have one Victory point card you need three cities if you have two Victory Point cards you can get by with just two cities.

Effective Trading and Negotiation:
1. **Negotiate Fairly**: Offer trades that are beneficial to both parties to increase the likelihood of successful trades.
2. **Use Ports**: Leverage ports for better trade rates, especially if you have an abundance of a particular resource.
3. **Block Opponents**: Be cautious when trading with opponents who are close to winning.
4. **Build Goodwill**: Increase the likelihood of success in future negotiations by building goodwill in advance of need. Think of goodwill like a bank that you build up and depletes when you use it.
5. **Reciprocity**: Use reciprocity to your advantage. If you build goodwill only when [...] Building goodwill can manifest through taking mercy on a struggling player with robber placement (and letting him or her know), making many trades early in the game, or even rationally explaining to someone you are robbing of resources exactly why you are doing it, so they don’t take it personally and seek retribution.

Development Card Usage:
1. **Knight Cards**: Use knight cards to move the robber and potentially steal resources from opponents.
2. **Victory Point Cards**: Hold onto victory point cards until you are close to winning to avoid becoming a target.
3. **Strategic Use**: Use other development cards strategically to gain advantages or hinder opponents.
4. **Development Card Strategy**: The concept for the Development Card Strategy is to ignore wood and brick completely when you are placing your initial settlements. Instead, you want, in order, Ore, Wheat, and Sheep. Cities and Development Cards are your friends.
5. **Early Cities**: The earlier that you can get cities the better, but you simply cannot wait to buy development cards. You're going to need soldiers to keep the robber off you, and the other, non-VP cards come in handy too. If I'm close to having enough for a city, I'll usually hold out. If I've already bought a couple of cards and have a soldier in waiting, I'll definitely try to save up.

Robber Placement Strategy:
1. **Target Opponents**: Place the robber on tiles where opponents have settlements to disrupt their resource collection.
2. **Protect Yourself**: Avoid placing the robber on tiles where you have settlements unless strategically necessary.
3. **Block High Probability Numbers**: Place the robber on high probability number tiles to maximize disruption.
4. **Affect One Player**: Make sure that you only affect one player with the robber. Affecting two players doubles the revenge factor, as well as doubles the motivation to move it with a soldier card.
5. **Early/Middle Game**: In the early/middle game, you should place the robber on the player to your right. The reason is that it will spend more time there. The player to your right can’t take the robber off for two or [...] Once in a while, one of the above strategies for the robber may be correct. If someone has nine victory points, and a handful of cards, putting the robber on them probably is the best idea.
6. **End Game**: At the end of the game, placing the robber is pretty easy to figure out. But, what about in the beginning of the game? What about the middle? Placing the robber in the early/middle of the game will absolutely have one intended effect — someone will not like you for putting it on them.
7. **Strongest Opponent**: Use the robber well is crucial - on average, the robber will turn up once in every six rolls and it also gets moved when playing a knight. Use it on the person in the strongest position (not necessarily the open points leader). Count unplayed development cards in someone's hand as points. Someone who gets Longest Road early is rarely a threat in the long term.
8. **Avoid Motivating Revenge**: Use the robber exclusively on your strongest opponent. Avoid motivating more than one of your opponents to seek revenge!================================= Tool Message =================================

This will guide your initial settlement placements.\n2. **Resource Diversity**: Aim for a variety of resources. An ideal setup could be an 8-5-10 placement, with a secondary placement of 6-9-4. This ensures you collect resources on most rolls.\n3. **Road Placement**: Place your first roads strategically. Ensure they point to spots on the map where you can expand, even if the resource production isn't high initially.\n4. **Avoid Dead Ends**: Be cautious not to point your road towards a highly productive area that might be blocked by opponents.\n5. **Prioritize High Probability Numbers**: Focus on the number of dots on the hex tiles rather than the resource type. High probability numbers increase the frequency of resource collection.\n6. **Block Opponents**: Use your settlements and roads to block opponents from accessing high-value intersections.\n\nMid-Game Resource Management:\n1. **Trade Wisely**: Use ports for better trade rates.

Players gain victory points as their settlements grow and the first to reach a set number of victory points, typically 10, wins. The game and its many [...] be as bad you might just be the last one to get there though your breakdown is simply going to look like this if you have a chance at longest road you need two cities minimum and preferably three and then two to four settlements depending on cities cities are expensive but require less roads you aren't likely to have both Victory Point cards and longest road but if you have one Victory point card you need three cities if you have two Victory Point cards you can get by with just two cities.\n\nEffective Trading and Negotiation:\n1. **Negotiate Fairly**: Offer trades that are beneficial to both parties to increase the likelihood of successful trades.\n2. **Use Ports**: Leverage ports for better trade rates, especially if you have an abundance of a particular resource.\n3. **Block Opponents**: Be cautious when trading with opponents who are close to winning.\n4. **Build Goodwill**: Increase the likelihood of success in future negotiations by building goodwill in advance of need. Think of goodwill like a bank that you build up and depletes when you use it.\n5. **Reciprocity**: Use reciprocity to your advantage. If you build goodwill only when [...] Building goodwill can manifest through taking mercy on a struggling player with robber placement (and letting him or her know), making many trades early in the game, or even rationally explaining to someone you are robbing of resources exactly why you are doing it, so they don\u2019t take it personally and seek retribution.\n\nDevelopment Card Usage:\n1. **Knight Cards**: Use knight cards to move the robber and potentially steal resources from opponents.\n2. **Victory Point Cards**: Hold onto victory point cards until you are close to winning to avoid becoming a target.\n3. **Strategic Use**: Use other development cards strategically to gain advantages or hinder opponents.\n4. **Development Card Strategy**: The concept for the Development Card Strategy is to ignore wood and brick completely when you are placing your initial settlements. Instead, you want, in order, Ore, Wheat, and Sheep. Cities and Development Cards are your friends.\n5. **Early Cities**: The earlier that you can get cities the better, but you simply cannot wait to buy development cards. You're going to need soldiers to keep the robber off you, and the other, non-VP cards come in handy too. If I'm close to having enough for a city, I'll usually hold out. If I've already bought a couple of cards and have a soldier in waiting, I'll definitely try to save up.\n\nRobber Placement Strategy:\n1. **Target Opponents**: Place the robber on tiles where opponents have settlements to disrupt their resource collection.\n2. **Protect Yourself**: Avoid placing the robber on tiles where you have settlements unless strategically necessary.\n3. **Block High Probability Numbers**: Place the robber on high probability number tiles to maximize disruption.\n4. **Affect One Player**: Make sure that you only affect one player with the robber. Affecting two players doubles the revenge factor, as well as doubles the motivation to move it with a soldier card.\n5. **Early/Middle Game**: In the early/middle game, you should place the robber on the player to your right. The reason is that it will spend more time there. The player to your right can\u2019t take the robber off for two or [...] Once in a while, one of the above strategies for the robber may be correct. If someone has nine victory points, and a handful of cards, putting the robber on them probably is the best idea.\n6. **End Game**: At the end of the game, placing the robber is pretty easy to figure out. But, what about in the beginning of the game? What about the middle? Placing the robber in the early/middle of the game will absolutely have one intended effect \u2013 someone will not like you for putting it on them.\n7. **Strongest Opponent**: Use the robber well is crucial - on average, the robber will turn up once in every six rolls and it also gets moved when playing a knight. Use it on the person in the strongest position (not necessarily the open points leader). Count unplayed development cards in someone's hand as points. Someone who gets Longest Road early is rarely a threat in the long term.\n8. **Avoid Motivating Revenge**: Use the robber exclusively on your strongest opponent. Avoid motivating more than one of your opponents to seek revenge!\n",

You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN. That means 10 victory points.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>
6. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively
7. Think about the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)================================== Ai Message ==================================

Colonist Strategies: What are the Best Catan Starting Strategies?

Today we will be giving you pointers on the best starting placement strategies for Settlers of Catan that you can use in Colonist.

Colonist.io

1. Identify Your Goals

The first and most important Catan Strategy is knowing what you want to build. This will dictate which resources you should go after when you place your starting settlements. [...] Also you don’t want to overproduce resources which can’t be used and then lose them to a 7 roll.

A much more ideal setup would be an 8-5-10 placement, with a secondary placement of 6-9-4.

These are all good numbers, and you’ve got a variety, meaning that you’re more likely to collect on any given roll.

It’s not always possible to get good number variety, and you will more often than not have a duplicate number, but it’s important to be as diverse as possible. [...] This is where the road placement comes in very handy. Placing your first roads is actually very important, as doing it wrong can set you back a few turns.

Just make sure that your road points to a spot on the map that you can move out to, even if the resource production isn’t high.

A common error to make is pointing the road to a goldmine of resources and numbers, only to have your neighbor place there next turn, making your road a dead end for you.

While the introductory game comes with a recommended board layout, later games are played on a randomized hex tile layout.  Take a close look at these random layouts at the start of the game. Are there two of the same resource next to one another?  Is at least one of the numbered chits on those tiles reasonably high? Consider placing a Settlement in the most advantageous intersection of those tiles, then build roads and additional Settlements around them to block your opponents from doing the [...] When looking for intersections to place your first Settlements, pay less attention to the type of resource and more attention to the number of dots on the hex tiles that make up the intersections.  The type of resource matters less than the frequency of obtaining them. After all, resources can be traded to the bank at 4:1 or at Ports for an even better return (see below).

Setup includes randomly placing large hexagonal tiles (each showing a resource or the desert) in a honeycomb shape and surrounding them with water tiles, some of which contain ports of exchange. Number disks, which will correspond to die rolls (two 6-sided dice are used), are placed on each resource tile. Each player is given two settlements (think: houses) and roads (sticks) which are, in turn, placed on intersections and borders of the resource tiles. Players collect a hand of resource cards [...] to you is to try to go second and i think the idea is that when you're picking fourth amongst really 
great players like this who know where to choose there's going to be fewer options available to 
you late in the game and conversely if you're the first player there's really going to be nothing 
left by the time you get to the eighth pick unless it's a really rich board so going second 
is ideal to get a really strong early pick but not end up with the very worst pick if you [...] In CATAN (formerly The Settlers of Catan), players try to be the dominant force on the island of Catan by building settlements, cities, and roads. On each turn dice are rolled to determine what resources the island produces. Players build by spending resources (sheep, wheat, wood, brick and ore) that are depicted by these resource cards; each land type, with the exception of the unproductive desert, produces a specific resource: hills produce brick, forests produce wood, mountains produce ore,

Different combinations of resources are required to build different things, meaning that the importance of certain resources shifts throughout the game. For example, bricks and lumber are important at the beginning because they are needed to build roads. Sheep and wheat gain importance when the time comes to build settlements, followed by ore when it’s time to build cities. Acquiring these resources depends on the game board, which is (for all purposes) a map of the mythical Catan. [...] The value of specific resources changes as players look to develop their settlements from roads into cities. It’s also important to use the resources that you have. If a seven is rolled and you have more than seven resource cards, you must give up half of them. Wise resource management becomes a key element to winning the game.
Standard 15: How physical systems affect human systems. [...] The goal of Settlers is to be the first person to earn 10 Victory Points. Victory Points are mostly earned by building settlements and cities. To build settlements and cities, one must first build roads. To build all of these things, one must earn resources: brick, lumber, wheat, ore, and sheep.

When Catan (or The Settlers of Catan, as it was originally named) was first published in 1995 it created something of a revelation in board game circles, undeniably changing the way people would look at board games and gaming in general.  Part of Catan’s success has been due to designer Klaus Teuber’s ability to combine different gaming mechanics (resource management, trading, route building, dice rolling) in a way that made the game easy to teach and learn, while maintaining enough depth to [...] Each hexagonal resource tile in Catan gets a round chit placed on top of them.  Each chit shows the number that needs to be rolled to produce the resource represented to any player with an adjacent Settlement.  Below each number are a series of dots. These dots indicate how likely that number is to appear on a given roll of the two dice. The more dots, the more likely that number is to be rolled — meaning the more likely those resources will be handed out.

1. Get one of everything. You're going to need all of wood, brick, wheat, sheep, and ore, so why not make sure you have them all at the start? Place your first settlement so you get 3 different resources, and pick up the final 2 with your last placement. [...] The last 4 photos show what you need to build roads, settlements, cities and development cards. Wheat is uniquely a part of 3 different builds, so is the one resource everyone should make sure they have. Ore always needs wheat in order to be played. Wood and brick are always used together in even amounts, so try to balance these. If you end up with a big excess of a resource over something it pairs with, your plans had better include a port. The fact that the same amount of brick and wood are [...] 5. Balance resources. Try to get roughly the same number of pips of wood and brick, and similarly for ore and wheat. Paired resources like 9 of wood and 9 of brick will give you an instant road every time a 9 is rolled, and this sort of synergy is powerful.

6. Where to next? You need to consider options for expansion, and this can be a good tie-breaker in your decision making if you feel two placements are essentially equal. See roads, next step.

Obvious leads make you a target. Longest Road in particular should be picked up as late as possible. Joining up two separate road segments with a big road-building push and unveiling 2 victory point cards can give you the win from 6 points. Largest Army on the other hand needs to be more openly competed for, because of the play-only-one-development-card-per-turn rule. Victory point cards are great to have because they create uncertainty in your opponents (is it a VP or a monopoly card?). [...] The strategies all kind of blend together in the late game when everyone has multiple cities/settlements/roads/cards, trading is mostly happening with the bank/ports for fear of letting someone else go out on their turn, battle will be fierce for the bonus cards, and development cards are disappearing at a furious rate. Don't stress over settlement positioning in the late game - put them anywhere you can, they're victory points rather than production sources.

I decided to do a note on this victory point issue because… well it’s complicated.
Obtaining an additional victory point change the victory condition, and will either let a player decide which victory point it will replace or ends up changing a victory from a 10 point victory to an 11 point victory. In this last case, it will not save you anything, since the additional victory point is not needed anyway to win. [...] Second, you calculate the probability of having picked (3 knights, no victory point card and one “other”) for our first 4 cards, multiplied by the probability of picking the missing victory point card on the fifth card. In this scenario, there is 5 victory point card left in a deck of 21 cards.
 = 4.11%
In Full: [...] In Catan, victory is declared as soon as you reach 10 points, so an extra victory point means that you’ll get one less victory point from another source. It changes the possible combinations of victory elements you can achieve.
So what do we do when evaluating the probabilities of drawing cards for a particular victory?
Ignore the possibility to draw victory point cards?
Or ignore the impact of drawing those cards when evaluating victories that are not supposed to involve them?

When trading resources with other players, it can be easy for the negotiations to break down when you can’t find a suitable 1 for 1 exchange. However, you greatly increase your likelihood of reaching a deal if you can find things other than what initially brought you to the table over which to trade. A personal favorite of mine is including a promise for one (or both) of the sides not to place the robber on each other the next time they move it. This makes the trade more of a win-win, but it [...] In Settlers of Catan — and in life — the most important negotiations aren’t truly one time events. You still have to interact with your counterpart long after any single negotiation ends, and the tenor of every negotiation influences the relationship that follows. To increase the likelihood of success in future negotiations, it is always a good idea to build goodwill in advance of need. Think of goodwill like a bank that you build up and depletes when you use it. If you build goodwill only when [...] Building goodwill can manifest through taking mercy on a struggling player with robber placement (and letting him or her know), making many trades early in the game, or even rationally explaining to someone you are robbing of resources exactly why you are doing it, so they don’t take it personally and seek retribution.

Reciprocity is among the most powerful “Weapons of Influence,”and you should use it to your advantage.

Experienced players often use hidden development cards to scare away other players from blocking and stealing from them, take away another player’s settlement spot, steal the longest road, shockingly build a city (or two), and even prevent another player from winning on their turn. Development cards offer an additional layer of strategy and players can leverage this favorable information asymmetry to drive the direction of their path to 10 Victory Points. [...] Newer players are very focused on the board in front of them and are always looking to build the next road, settlement, and city. They often overlook development cards since it is off the board. This phenomenon exists in both the online and physical game but it is much more pronounced in the physical version because development cards are more out of sight, placed to the side of each player compared to the centrally located board that is some 30 to 40 times the size of a development card. This [...] While the perceived probability of drawing each development card will shift as the game progresses, it is important to remember that the more hidden development cards that you own relative to other players, the closer your perceived probability is to the actual probability. Therefore, by having more hidden development cards and using this information to calculate probabilities more accurately (technical skill), you have more knowledge about the remaining development card deck, minimizing your

According to computer simulation tests, the best strategy for winning Catan is the Development Card Strategy.

6. What’s the Development Card Strategy?

The Catan Development Card Strategy focuses on ignoring wood and brick during the initial placement of settlements and instead prioritizing ore, wheat, and sheep. While it may sound counter intuitive, as wood and brick are essential to expanding your civilization, focusing on these higher-valued resources can be very lucrative. [...] In conclusion, Catan development cards are an important aspect of the game, providing players with various strategies to gain points and win the game. Understanding the cards’ distribution and when they can be played is crucial to maximizing their effectiveness.

- try to avoid trading down to just a few cards with the bank and being stuck unable to build. Chances are, you're doing so for a resource you're finding hard to get and therefore other players will know they can disproportionately hurt you with the robber if they steal it.

- preserve juicy settlement locations with judicious road placement. Lock up that port that's critical to your strategy early. Nothing more infuriating than having an opponent beat you to it. [...] - if you are lacking a resource, don't place the robber on it. You want there to be lots of it in the game so people will trade it to you. Instead, place it on a resource that you have a lot of so you can increase your probability of trading for what you need.

Step 7: Commander [...] Using the robber well is crucial - on average, the robber will turn up once in every six rolls and it also gets moved when playing a knight.

- use it on the person in the strongest position (not necessarily the open points leader). Count unplayed development cards in someone's hand as points. Someone who gets Longest Road early is rarely a threat in the long term.

- use the robber exclusively on your strongest opponent. Avoid motivating more than one of your opponents to seek revenge!

- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

Early Game Placement Strategy:
1. **Identify Your Goals**: Determine what you want to build early on. This will guide your initial settlement placements.
2. **Resource Diversity**: Aim for a variety of resources. An ideal setup could be an 8-5-10 placement, with a secondary placement of 6-9-4. This ensures you collect resources on most rolls.
3. **Road Placement**: Place your first roads strategically. Ensure they point to spots on the map where you can expand, even if the resource production isn't high initially.
4. **Avoid Dead Ends**: Be cautious not to point your road towards a highly productive area that might be blocked by opponents.
5. **Prioritize High Probability Numbers**: Focus on the number of dots on the hex tiles rather than the resource type. High probability numbers increase the frequency of resource collection.
6. **Block Opponents**: Use your settlements and roads to block opponents from accessing high-value intersections.
7. **Avoid the Coast**: The coast never makes sense for your first placement as it will only have 2 hexes of production (3 for you to build more central) and it will inhibit your optionality to expand.
8. **Center, Inner, and Coastal Rings**: Think of a Catan map as having 3 areas — the center, inner, and coastal rings. The "center" is all the spots around the middle hex, "inner" is the next one outward, and so on.
9. **Contestable Directions**: Anytime your road is in a contestable direction, make sure you’re the one cutting someone off or are more likely to win the race — not the other way around.

Mid-Game Resource Management:
1. **Trade Wisely**: Use ports for better trade rates. Prioritize building towards ports to facilitate better trades.
2. **Diversify Resources**: Ensure you have a balanced mix of resources to support various building and development needs.
3. **Plan Ahead**: Think about the next 2-3 turns and what resources you will need for your planned actions.
4. **Steady Resource Stream**: Place your two first settlements on intersections with six different numbers total with ideally, the highest probability. If you can manage it, the best numbers to be on from the beginning would be 4,5,6,8,9,10 or some combination as close to that as possible.
5. **Avoid Overproduction**: Be cautious not to overproduce resources which can’t be used and then lose them to a 7 roll.

Late-Game Victory Point Optimization:
1. **Focus on Victory Points**: Prioritize actions that directly or indirectly increase your victory points.
2. **Upgrade Cities**: Upgrading settlements to cities can provide a significant boost in victory points.
3. **Use Development Cards**: Strategically use development cards to gain additional victory points or hinder opponents.
4. **Balance Strategy**: Your path to Victory involves focusing on increasing production early and then using those resources to either build a settlement or city next whichever one is easiest the late game struggles won't [...] Catan, previously known as The Settlers of Catan or simply Settlers, is a multiplayer board game designed by Klaus Teuber. It was first published in 1995 in Germany by Franckh-Kosmos Verlag (Kosmos) as Die Siedler von Catan. Players take on the roles of settlers, each attempting to build and develop holdings while trading and acquiring resources. Players gain victory points as their settlements grow and the first to reach a set number of victory points, typically 10, wins. The game and its many [...] be as bad you might just be the last one to get there though your breakdown is simply going to look like this if you have a chance at longest road you need two cities minimum and preferably three and then two to four settlements depending on cities cities are expensive but require less roads you aren't likely to have both Victory Point cards and longest road but if you have one Victory point card you need three cities if you have two Victory Point cards you can get by with just two cities.

Effective Trading and Negotiation:
1. **Negotiate Fairly**: Offer trades that are beneficial to both parties to increase the likelihood of successful trades.
2. **Use Ports**: Leverage ports for better trade rates, especially if you have an abundance of a particular resource.
3. **Block Opponents**: Be cautious when trading with opponents who are close to winning.
4. **Build Goodwill**: Increase the likelihood of success in future negotiations by building goodwill in advance of need. Think of goodwill like a bank that you build up and depletes when you use it.
5. **Reciprocity**: Use reciprocity to your advantage. If you build goodwill only when [...] Building goodwill can manifest through taking mercy on a struggling player with robber placement (and letting him or her know), making many trades early in the game, or even rationally explaining to someone you are robbing of resources exactly why you are doing it, so they don’t take it personally and seek retribution.

Development Card Usage:
1. **Knight Cards**: Use knight cards to move the robber and potentially steal resources from opponents.
2. **Victory Point Cards**: Hold onto victory point cards until you are close to winning to avoid becoming a target.
3. **Strategic Use**: Use other development cards strategically to gain advantages or hinder opponents.
4. **Development Card Strategy**: The concept for the Development Card Strategy is to ignore wood and brick completely when you are placing your initial settlements. Instead, you want, in order, Ore, Wheat, and Sheep. Cities and Development Cards are your friends.
5. **Early Cities**: The earlier that you can get cities the better, but you simply cannot wait to buy development cards. You're going to need soldiers to keep the robber off you, and the other, non-VP cards come in handy too. If I'm close to having enough for a city, I'll usually hold out. If I've already bought a couple of cards and have a soldier in waiting, I'll definitely try to save up.

Robber Placement Strategy:
1. **Target Opponents**: Place the robber on tiles where opponents have settlements to disrupt their resource collection.
2. **Protect Yourself**: Avoid placing the robber on tiles where you have settlements unless strategically necessary.
3. **Block High Probability Numbers**: Place the robber on high probability number tiles to maximize disruption.
4. **Affect One Player**: Make sure that you only affect one player with the robber. Affecting two players doubles the revenge factor, as well as doubles the motivation to move it with a soldier card.
5. **Early/Middle Game**: In the early/middle game, you should place the robber on the player to your right. The reason is that it will spend more time there. The player to your right can’t take the robber off for two or [...] Once in a while, one of the above strategies for the robber may be correct. If someone has nine victory points, and a handful of cards, putting the robber on them probably is the best idea.
6. **End Game**: At the end of the game, placing the robber is pretty easy to figure out. But, what about in the beginning of the game? What about the middle? Placing the robber in the early/middle of the game will absolutely have one intended effect — someone will not like you for putting it on them.
7. **Strongest Opponent**: Use the robber well is crucial - on average, the robber will turn up once in every six rolls and it also gets moved when playing a knight. Use it on the person in the strongest position (not necessarily the open points leader). Count unplayed development cards in someone's hand as points. Someone who gets Longest Road early is rarely a threat in the long term.

If you build goodwill only when [...] Building goodwill can manifest through taking mercy on a struggling player with robber placement (and letting him or her know), making many trades early in the game, or even rationally explaining to someone you are robbing of resources exactly why you are doing it, so they don\u2019t take it personally and seek retribution.\n\nDevelopment Card Usage:\n1. **Knight Cards**: Use knight cards to move the robber and potentially steal resources from opponents.\n2. **Victory Point Cards**: Hold onto victory point cards until you are close to winning to avoid becoming a target.\n3. **Strategic Use**: Use other development cards strategically to gain advantages or hinder opponents.\n4. **Development Card Strategy**: The concept for the Development Card Strategy is to ignore wood and brick completely when you are placing your initial settlements.

If someone has nine victory points, and a handful of cards, putting the robber on them probably is the best idea.\n6. **End Game**: At the end of the game, placing the robber is pretty easy to figure out. But, what about in the beginning of the game? What about the middle? Placing the robber in the early/middle of the game will absolutely have one intended effect \u2013 someone will not like you for putting it on them.\n7. **Strongest Opponent**: Use the robber well is crucial - on average, the robber will turn up once in every six rolls and it also gets moved when playing a knight. Use it on the person in the strongest position (not necessarily the open points leader). Count unplayed development cards in someone's hand as points. Someone who gets Longest Road early is rarely a threat in the long term.\n8. **Avoid Motivating Revenge**: Use the robber exclusively on your strongest opponent.

If you can manage it, the best numbers to be on from the beginning would be 4,5,6,8,9,10 or some combination as close to that as possible.\n5. **Avoid Overproduction**: Be cautious not to overproduce resources which can\u2019t be used and then lose them to a 7 roll.\n\nLate-Game Victory Point Optimization:\n1. **Focus on Victory Points**: Prioritize actions that directly or indirectly increase your victory points.\n2. **Upgrade Cities**: Upgrading settlements to cities can provide a significant boost in victory points.\n3. **Use Development Cards**: Strategically use development cards to gain additional victory points or hinder opponents.\n4. **Balance Strategy**: Your path to Victory involves focusing on increasing production early and then using those resources to either build a settlement or city next whichever one is easiest the late game struggles won't [...] Catan, previously known as The Settlers of Catan or simply Settlers, is a multiplayer board game designed by Klaus Teuber. It was first published in 1995 in Germany by Franckh-Kosmos Verlag (Kosmos) as Die Siedler von Catan. Players take on the roles of settlers, each attempting to build and develop holdings while trading and acquiring resources. Players gain victory points as their settlements grow and the first to reach a set number of victory points, typically 10, wins. The game and its many [...] be as bad you might just be the last one to get there though your breakdown is simply going to look like this if you have a chance at longest road you need two cities minimum and preferably three and then two to four settlements depending on cities cities are expensive but require less roads you aren't likely to have both Victory Point cards and longest road but if you have one Victory point card you need three cities if you have two Victory Point cards you can get by with just two cities.\n\nEffective Trading and Negotiation:\n1. **Negotiate Fairly**: Offer trades that are beneficial to both parties to increase the likelihood of successful trades.\n2. **Use Ports**: Leverage ports for better trade rates, especially if you have an abundance of a particular resource.\n3. **Block Opponents**: Be cautious when trading with opponents who are close to winning.\n4. **Build Goodwill**: Increase the likelihood of success in future negotiations by building goodwill in advance of need. Think of goodwill like a bank that you build up and depletes when you use it.\n5. **Reciprocity**: Use reciprocity to your advantage. If you build goodwill only when [...] Building goodwill can manifest through taking mercy on a struggling player with robber placement (and letting him or her know), making many trades early in the game, or even rationally explaining to someone you are robbing of resources exactly why you are doing it, so they don\u2019t take it personally and seek retribution.\n\nDevelopment Card Usage:\n1. **Knight Cards**: Use knight cards to move the robber and potentially steal resources from opponents.\n2. **Victory Point Cards**: Hold onto victory point cards until you are close to winning to avoid becoming a target.\n3. **Strategic Use**: Use other development cards strategically to gain advantages or hinder opponents.\n4. **Development Card Strategy**: The concept for the Development Card Strategy is to ignore wood and brick completely when you are placing your initial settlements. Instead, you want, in order, Ore, Wheat, and Sheep. Cities and Development Cards are your friends.\n5. **Early Cities**: The earlier that you can get cities the better, but you simply cannot wait to buy development cards. You're going to need soldiers to keep the robber off you, and the other, non-VP cards come in handy too. If I'm close to having enough for a city, I'll usually hold out. If I've already bought a couple of cards and have a soldier in waiting, I'll definitely try to save up.\n\nRobber Placement Strategy:\n1. **Target Opponents**: Place the robber on tiles where opponents have settlements to disrupt their resource collection.\n2. **Protect Yourself**: Avoid placing the robber on tiles where you have settlements unless strategically necessary.\n3. **Block High Probability Numbers**: Place the robber on high probability number tiles to maximize disruption.\n4. **Affect One Player**: Make sure that you only affect one player with the robber. Affecting two players doubles the revenge factor, as well as doubles the motivation to move it with a soldier card.\n5. **Early/Middle Game**: In the early/middle game, you should place the robber on the player to your right. The reason is that it will spend more time there. The player to your right can\u2019t take the robber off for two or [...] Once in a while, one of the above strategies for the robber may be correct. If someone has nine victory points, and a handful of cards, putting the robber on them probably is the best idea.\n6. **End Game**: At the end of the game, placing the robber is pretty easy to figure out. But, what about in the beginning of the game? What about the middle? Placing the robber in the early/middle of the game will absolutely have one intended effect \u2014 someone will not like you for putting it on them.\n7. **Strongest Opponent**: Use the robber well is crucial - on average, the robber will turn up once in every six rolls and it also gets moved when playing a knight. Use it on the person in the strongest position (not necessarily the open points leader). Count unplayed development cards in someone's hand as points. Someone who gets Longest Road early is rarely a threat in the long term.\n8. **Avoid Motivating Revenge**: Use the robber exclusively on your strongest opponent. Avoid motivating more than one of your opponents to seek revenge!",

You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN. That means 10 victory points.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>
6. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively
7. Think about the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)================================== Ai Message ==================================

Colonist Strategies: What are the Best Catan Starting Strategies?

Today we will be giving you pointers on the best starting placement strategies for Settlers of Catan that you can use in Colonist.

Colonist.io

1. Identify Your Goals

The first and most important Catan Strategy is knowing what you want to build. This will dictate which resources you should go after when you place your starting settlements. [...] Also you don’t want to overproduce resources which can’t be used and then lose them to a 7 roll.

A much more ideal setup would be an 8-5-10 placement, with a secondary placement of 6-9-4.

These are all good numbers, and you’ve got a variety, meaning that you’re more likely to collect on any given roll.

It’s not always possible to get good number variety, and you will more often than not have a duplicate number, but it’s important to be as diverse as possible. [...] This is where the road placement comes in very handy. Placing your first roads is actually very important, as doing it wrong can set you back a few turns.

Just make sure that your road points to a spot on the map that you can move out to, even if the resource production isn’t high.

A common error to make is pointing the road to a goldmine of resources and numbers, only to have your neighbor place there next turn, making your road a dead end for you.

While the introductory game comes with a recommended board layout, later games are played on a randomized hex tile layout.  Take a close look at these random layouts at the start of the game. Are there two of the same resource next to one another?  Is at least one of the numbered chits on those tiles reasonably high? Consider placing a Settlement in the most advantageous intersection of those tiles, then build roads and additional Settlements around them to block your opponents from doing the [...] When looking for intersections to place your first Settlements, pay less attention to the type of resource and more attention to the number of dots on the hex tiles that make up the intersections.  The type of resource matters less than the frequency of obtaining them. After all, resources can be traded to the bank at 4:1 or at Ports for an even better return (see below).

Setup includes randomly placing large hexagonal tiles (each showing a resource or the desert) in a honeycomb shape and surrounding them with water tiles, some of which contain ports of exchange. Number disks, which will correspond to die rolls (two 6-sided dice are used), are placed on each resource tile. Each player is given two settlements (think: houses) and roads (sticks) which are, in turn, placed on intersections and borders of the resource tiles. Players collect a hand of resource cards [...] to you is to try to go second and i think the idea is that when you're picking fourth amongst really 
great players like this who know where to choose there's going to be fewer options available to 
you late in the game and conversely if you're the first player there's really going to be nothing 
left by the time you get to the eighth pick unless it's a really rich board so going second 
is ideal to get a really strong early pick but not end up with the very worst pick if you [...] In CATAN (formerly The Settlers of Catan), players try to be the dominant force on the island of Catan by building settlements, cities, and roads. On each turn dice are rolled to determine what resources the island produces. Players build by spending resources (sheep, wheat, wood, brick and ore) that are depicted by these resource cards; each land type, with the exception of the unproductive desert, produces a specific resource: hills produce brick, forests produce wood, mountains produce ore,

Different combinations of resources are required to build different things, meaning that the importance of certain resources shifts throughout the game. For example, bricks and lumber are important at the beginning because they are needed to build roads. Sheep and wheat gain importance when the time comes to build settlements, followed by ore when it’s time to build cities. Acquiring these resources depends on the game board, which is (for all purposes) a map of the mythical Catan. [...] The value of specific resources changes as players look to develop their settlements from roads into cities. It’s also important to use the resources that you have. If a seven is rolled and you have more than seven resource cards, you must give up half of them. Wise resource management becomes a key element to winning the game.
Standard 15: How physical systems affect human systems. [...] The goal of Settlers is to be the first person to earn 10 Victory Points. Victory Points are mostly earned by building settlements and cities. To build settlements and cities, one must first build roads. To build all of these things, one must earn resources: brick, lumber, wheat, ore, and sheep.

When Catan (or The Settlers of Catan, as it was originally named) was first published in 1995 it created something of a revelation in board game circles, undeniably changing the way people would look at board games and gaming in general.  Part of Catan’s success has been due to designer Klaus Teuber’s ability to combine different gaming mechanics (resource management, trading, route building, dice rolling) in a way that made the game easy to teach and learn, while maintaining enough depth to [...] Each hexagonal resource tile in Catan gets a round chit placed on top of them.  Each chit shows the number that needs to be rolled to produce the resource represented to any player with an adjacent Settlement.  Below each number are a series of dots. These dots indicate how likely that number is to appear on a given roll of the two dice. The more dots, the more likely that number is to be rolled — meaning the more likely those resources will be handed out.

1. Get one of everything. You're going to need all of wood, brick, wheat, sheep, and ore, so why not make sure you have them all at the start? Place your first settlement so you get 3 different resources, and pick up the final 2 with your last placement. [...] The last 4 photos show what you need to build roads, settlements, cities and development cards. Wheat is uniquely a part of 3 different builds, so is the one resource everyone should make sure they have. Ore always needs wheat in order to be played. Wood and brick are always used together in even amounts, so try to balance these. If you end up with a big excess of a resource over something it pairs with, your plans had better include a port. The fact that the same amount of brick and wood are [...] 5. Balance resources. Try to get roughly the same number of pips of wood and brick, and similarly for ore and wheat. Paired resources like 9 of wood and 9 of brick will give you an instant road every time a 9 is rolled, and this sort of synergy is powerful.

6. Where to next? You need to consider options for expansion, and this can be a good tie-breaker in your decision making if you feel two placements are essentially equal. See roads, next step.

Obvious leads make you a target. Longest Road in particular should be picked up as late as possible. Joining up two separate road segments with a big road-building push and unveiling 2 victory point cards can give you the win from 6 points. Largest Army on the other hand needs to be more openly competed for, because of the play-only-one-development-card-per-turn rule. Victory point cards are great to have because they create uncertainty in your opponents (is it a VP or a monopoly card?). [...] The strategies all kind of blend together in the late game when everyone has multiple cities/settlements/roads/cards, trading is mostly happening with the bank/ports for fear of letting someone else go out on their turn, battle will be fierce for the bonus cards, and development cards are disappearing at a furious rate. Don't stress over settlement positioning in the late game - put them anywhere you can, they're victory points rather than production sources.

I decided to do a note on this victory point issue because… well it’s complicated.
Obtaining an additional victory point change the victory condition, and will either let a player decide which victory point it will replace or ends up changing a victory from a 10 point victory to an 11 point victory. In this last case, it will not save you anything, since the additional victory point is not needed anyway to win. [...] Second, you calculate the probability of having picked (3 knights, no victory point card and one “other”) for our first 4 cards, multiplied by the probability of picking the missing victory point card on the fifth card. In this scenario, there is 5 victory point card left in a deck of 21 cards.
 = 4.11%
In Full: [...] In Catan, victory is declared as soon as you reach 10 points, so an extra victory point means that you’ll get one less victory point from another source. It changes the possible combinations of victory elements you can achieve.
So what do we do when evaluating the probabilities of drawing cards for a particular victory?
Ignore the possibility to draw victory point cards?
Or ignore the impact of drawing those cards when evaluating victories that are not supposed to involve them?

When trading resources with other players, it can be easy for the negotiations to break down when you can’t find a suitable 1 for 1 exchange. However, you greatly increase your likelihood of reaching a deal if you can find things other than what initially brought you to the table over which to trade. A personal favorite of mine is including a promise for one (or both) of the sides not to place the robber on each other the next time they move it. This makes the trade more of a win-win, but it [...] In Settlers of Catan — and in life — the most important negotiations aren’t truly one time events. You still have to interact with your counterpart long after any single negotiation ends, and the tenor of every negotiation influences the relationship that follows. To increase the likelihood of success in future negotiations, it is always a good idea to build goodwill in advance of need. Think of goodwill like a bank that you build up and depletes when you use it. If you build goodwill only when [...] Building goodwill can manifest through taking mercy on a struggling player with robber placement (and letting him or her know), making many trades early in the game, or even rationally explaining to someone you are robbing of resources exactly why you are doing it, so they don’t take it personally and seek retribution.

Reciprocity is among the most powerful “Weapons of Influence,”and you should use it to your advantage.

Experienced players often use hidden development cards to scare away other players from blocking and stealing from them, take away another player’s settlement spot, steal the longest road, shockingly build a city (or two), and even prevent another player from winning on their turn. Development cards offer an additional layer of strategy and players can leverage this favorable information asymmetry to drive the direction of their path to 10 Victory Points. [...] Newer players are very focused on the board in front of them and are always looking to build the next road, settlement, and city. They often overlook development cards since it is off the board. This phenomenon exists in both the online and physical game but it is much more pronounced in the physical version because development cards are more out of sight, placed to the side of each player compared to the centrally located board that is some 30 to 40 times the size of a development card. This [...] While the perceived probability of drawing each development card will shift as the game progresses, it is important to remember that the more hidden development cards that you own relative to other players, the closer your perceived probability is to the actual probability.

According to computer simulation tests, the best strategy for winning Catan is the Development Card Strategy.

6. What’s the Development Card Strategy?

The Catan Development Card Strategy focuses on ignoring wood and brick during the initial placement of settlements and instead prioritizing ore, wheat, and sheep. While it may sound counter intuitive, as wood and brick are essential to expanding your civilization, focusing on these higher-valued resources can be very lucrative.

- try to avoid trading down to just a few cards with the bank and being stuck unable to build. Chances are, you're doing so for a resource you're finding hard to get and therefore other players will know they can disproportionately hurt you with the robber if they steal it.

- preserve juicy settlement locations with judicious road placement. Lock up that port that's critical to your strategy early. Nothing more infuriating than having an opponent beat you to it. [...] - if you are lacking a resource, don't place the robber on it. You want there to be lots of it in the game so people will trade it to you. Instead, place it on a resource that you have a lot of so you can increase your probability of trading for what you need.

Step 7: Commander [...] Using the robber well is crucial - on average, the robber will turn up once in every six rolls and it also gets moved when playing a knight.

- use it on the person in the strongest position (not necessarily the open points leader). Count unplayed development cards in someone's hand as points. Someone who gets Longest Road early is rarely a threat in the long term.

- use the robber exclusively on your strongest opponent. Avoid motivating more than one of your opponents to seek revenge!

Early Game Placement Strategy:
1. **Identify Your Goals**: Determine what you want to build early on. This will guide your initial settlement placements.
2. **Resource Diversity**: Aim for a variety of resources. An ideal setup could be an 8-5-10 placement, with a secondary placement of 6-9-4. This ensures you collect resources on most rolls.
3. **Road Placement**: Place your first roads strategically. Ensure they point to spots on the map where you can expand, even if the resource production isn't high initially.
4. **Avoid Dead Ends**: Be cautious not to point your road towards a highly productive area that might be blocked by opponents.
5. **Prioritize High Probability Numbers**: Focus on the number of dots on the hex tiles rather than the resource type. High probability numbers increase the frequency of resource collection.
6. **Block Opponents**: Use your settlements and roads to block opponents from accessing high-value intersections.
7. **Avoid the Coast**: The coast never makes sense for your first placement as it will only have 2 hexes of production (3 for you to build more central) and it will inhibit your optionality to expand.
8. **Center, Inner, and Coastal Rings**: Think of a Catan map as having 3 areas — the center, inner, and coastal rings. The "center" is all the spots around the middle hex, "inner" is the next one outward, and so on.
9. **Contestable Directions**: Anytime your road is in a contestable direction, make sure you’re the one cutting someone off or are more likely to win the race — not the other way around.

Mid-Game Resource Management:
1. **Trade Wisely**: Use ports for better trade rates. Prioritize building towards ports to facilitate better trades.
2. **Diversify Resources**: Ensure you have a balanced mix of resources to support various building and development needs.
3. **Plan Ahead**: Think about the next 2-3 turns and what resources you will need for your planned actions.
4. **Steady Resource Stream**: Place your two first settlements on intersections with six different numbers total with ideally, the highest probability. If you can manage it, the best numbers to be on from the beginning would be 4,5,6,8,9,10 or some combination as close to that as possible.
5. **Avoid Overproduction**: Be cautious not to overproduce resources which can’t be used and then lose them to a 7 roll.

Late-Game Victory Point Optimization:
1. **Focus on Victory Points**: Prioritize actions that directly or indirectly increase your victory points.
2. **Upgrade Cities**: Upgrading settlements to cities can provide a significant boost in victory points.
3. **Use Development Cards**: Strategically use development cards to gain additional victory points or hinder opponents.
4. **Balance Strategy**: Your path to Victory involves focusing on increasing production early and then using those resources to either build a settlement or city next whichever one is easiest the late game struggles won't [...] Catan, previously known as The Settlers of Catan or simply Settlers, is a multiplayer board game designed by Klaus Teuber. It was first published in 1995 in Germany by Franckh-Kosmos Verlag (Kosmos) as Die Siedler von Catan. Players take on the roles of settlers, each attempting to build and develop holdings while trading and acquiring resources. Players gain victory points as their settlements grow and the first to reach a set number of victory points, typically 10, wins. The game and its many [...] be as bad you might just be the last one to get there though your breakdown is simply going to look like this if you have a chance at longest road you need two cities minimum and preferably three and then two to four settlements depending on cities cities are expensive but require less roads you aren't likely to have both Victory Point cards and longest road but if you have one Victory point card you need three cities if you have two Victory Point cards you can get by with just two cities.

Effective Trading and Negotiation:
1. **Negotiate Fairly**: Offer trades that are beneficial to both parties to increase the likelihood of successful trades.
2. **Use Ports**: Leverage ports for better trade rates, especially if you have an abundance of a particular resource.
3. **Block Opponents**: Be cautious when trading with opponents who are close to winning.
4. **Build Goodwill**: Increase the likelihood of success in future negotiations by building goodwill in advance of need. Think of goodwill like a bank that you build up and depletes when you use it.
5. **Reciprocity**: Use reciprocity to your advantage. If you build goodwill only when [...] Building goodwill can manifest through taking mercy on a struggling player with robber placement (and letting him or her know), making many trades early in the game, or even rationally explaining to someone you are robbing of resources exactly why you are doing it, so they don’t take it personally and seek retribution.

Development Card Usage:
1. **Knight Cards**: Use knight cards to move the robber and potentially steal resources from opponents.
2. **Victory Point Cards**: Hold onto victory point cards until you are close to winning to avoid becoming a target.
3. **Strategic Use**: Use other development cards strategically to gain advantages or hinder opponents.
4. **Development Card Strategy**: The concept for the Development Card Strategy is to ignore wood and brick completely when you are placing your initial settlements. Instead, you want, in order, Ore, Wheat, and Sheep. Cities and Development Cards are your friends.
5. **Early Cities**: The earlier that you can get cities the better, but you simply cannot wait to buy development cards. You're going to need soldiers to keep the robber off you, and the other, non-VP cards come in handy too. If I'm close to having enough for a city, I'll usually hold out. If I've already bought a couple of cards and have a soldier in waiting, I'll definitely try to save up.

Robber Placement Strategy:
1. **Target Opponents**: Place the robber on tiles where opponents have settlements to disrupt their resource collection.
2. **Protect Yourself**: Avoid placing the robber on tiles where you have settlements unless strategically necessary.
3. **Block High Probability Numbers**: Place the robber on high probability number tiles to maximize disruption.
4. **Affect One Player**: Make sure that you only affect one player with the robber. Affecting two players doubles the revenge factor, as well as doubles the motivation to move it with a soldier card.
5. **Early/Middle Game**: In the early/middle game, you should place the robber on the player to your right. The reason is that it will spend more time there. The player to your right can’t take the robber off for two or [...] Once in a while, one of the above strategies for the robber may be correct. If someone has nine victory points, and a handful of cards, putting the robber on them probably is the best idea.
6. **End Game**: At the end of the game, placing the robber is pretty easy to figure out. But, what about in the beginning of the game? What about the middle? Placing the robber in the early/middle of the game will absolutely have one intended effect — someone will not like you for putting it on them.
7. **Strongest Opponent**: Use the robber well is crucial - on average, the robber will turn up once in every six rolls and it also gets moved when playing a knight. Use it on the person in the strongest position (not necessarily the open points leader). Count unplayed development cards in someone's hand as points. Someone who gets Longest Road early is rarely a threat in the long term.
