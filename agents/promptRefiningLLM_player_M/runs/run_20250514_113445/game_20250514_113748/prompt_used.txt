You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN. That means 10 victory points.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>
6. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively
7. Think about the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- üîç marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

Early Game Placement Strategy:
1. **Identify Your Goals**: Determine what you want to build early on. This will guide your initial settlement placements.
2. **Resource Diversity**: Aim for a variety of resources. An ideal setup could be an 8-5-10 placement, with a secondary placement of 6-9-4. This ensures you collect resources on most rolls.
3. **Road Placement**: Place your first roads strategically. Ensure they point to spots on the map where you can expand, even if the resource production isn't high initially.
4. **Avoid Dead Ends**: Be cautious not to point your road towards a highly productive area that might be blocked by opponents.
5. **Prioritize High Probability Numbers**: Focus on the number of dots on the hex tiles rather than the resource type. High probability numbers increase the frequency of resource collection.
6. **Block Opponents**: Use your settlements and roads to block opponents from accessing high-value intersections.

Mid-Game Resource Management:
1. **Trade Wisely**: Use ports for better trade rates. Prioritize building towards ports to facilitate better trades.
2. **Diversify Resources**: Ensure you have a balanced mix of resources to support various building and development needs.
3. **Plan Ahead**: Think about the next 2-3 turns and what resources you will need for your planned actions.

Late-Game Victory Point Optimization:
1. **Focus on Victory Points**: Prioritize actions that directly or indirectly increase your victory points.
2. **Upgrade Cities**: Upgrading settlements to cities can provide a significant boost in victory points.
3. **Use Development Cards**: Strategically use development cards to gain additional victory points or hinder opponents.

Effective Trading and Negotiation:
1. **Negotiate Fairly**: Offer trades that are beneficial to both parties to increase the likelihood of successful trades.
2. **Use Ports**: Leverage ports for better trade rates, especially if you have an abundance of a particular resource.
3. **Block Opponents**: Be cautious when trading with opponents who are close to winning.

Development Card Usage:
1. **Knight Cards**: Use knight cards to move the robber and potentially steal resources from opponents.
2. **Victory Point Cards**: Hold onto victory point cards until you are close to winning to avoid becoming a target.
3. **Strategic Use**: Use other development cards strategically to gain advantages or hinder opponents.

Robber Placement Strategy:
1. **Target Opponents**: Place the robber on tiles where opponents have settlements to disrupt their resource collection.
2. **Protect Yourself**: Avoid placing the robber on tiles where you have settlements unless strategically necessary.
3. **Block High Probability Numbers**: Place the robber on high probability number tiles to maximize disruption.
