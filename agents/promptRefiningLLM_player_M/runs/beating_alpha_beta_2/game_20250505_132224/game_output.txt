2. Target 🧱6 (-1, 0, 1) since it blocks RED's crucial 🧱 production.
3. Steal a random resource from RED, prioritizing diversification of resources (hope for 🧱BRICK or ⛏️ORE).
4. Evaluate resources post-steal: 
   - Convert or build toward a 🏙️ city at 🏠 node 4 (🌲/🌾 heavy production).
   - If RED is about to win, consider using robber to block their 🌾 nodes as a fallback.

Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2613 chars)
Updated plan: 1. **Move Robber**: Move it to (-1, 1, 0) to block RED’s 🌾8 node and steal a resource. This denies them wheat and targets a strong production hex. Aim to steal 🧱BRICK or ⛏️ORE—it’s the most helpful for your city or settlement plans.
2. **Trade via Port**: Use the 🐑 port to trade 4 🐑SHEEP for 1 ore (if a trade is possible, based on the stolen resource). This prepares you for building a city or a development card.
3. **Reassess Build Options**:  
   - With 2 ore and 4 wheat in hand, prioritize upgrading settlements to cities (4 VP total needed for 10 VP).  
   - Alternatively, buy development cards to work toward Largest Army (3 VP required for 10 VP).  
4. **Robber Use**: If you acquire another knight card, aim to claim Largest Army, which provides a +2 VP bonus and blocks RED’s development card strategies.
LLM chose action 3: Move robber to (-1, 1, 0) and steal from RED
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 3142 chars)
Updated plan: 1. **Use the Robber Decisively**:  
   - Move the robber to the 🌾8 hex (position **(-1, 1, 0)**). This blocks RED and their best wheat producing tile, crucial for their city-building plans. Steal a resource from RED to disrupt their next move. If possible, steal ⛏️ORE or 🧱BRICK to set yourself up for the next move.

2. **Buy a Development Card**:  
   - With 1 🐑SHEEP, 1 🌾WHEAT, and 1 ⛏️ORE in hand, purchasing a development card is the optimal choice. This gives you the chance to draw a knight (working toward Largest Army) or a victory point.

3. **Prioritize Largest Army**:  
   - Play knights aggressively to claim Largest Army (2 VP bonus). You already have 1 played knight, so you only need 2 more to secure this path to victory.  
   - Block RED with the robber each time you play a knight.

4. **Future Turns**:  
   - If you steal ⛏️ORE or trade for ore, quickly upgrade a settlement into a city. Doubling resource production from high-probability tiles (🌾8 and 🐑9) is key for sustained progress.  
   - Stay vigilant of RED’s road network and deny them Longest Road if the opportunity arises.

Updated plan: 1. **Robber Placement:** Move the robber to **🌾8 (-1, 1, 0)**. This blocks RED’s wheat production and delays their city upgrades.  
   - Steal one resource from RED (target wheat or ore if possible).  
2. **Buy Development Card:** Use your available 🌾WHEAT, 🐑SHEEP, and ⛏️ORE resources to purchase a development card.  
   - Target knights to secure Largest Army (3 VP).  
   - Long-term goal: Utilize robber strategically and block RED further.  
3. **Future Resource Usage:** Focus on upgrading settlements to cities (cost: 2 🌾WHEAT + 3 ⛏️ORE) to increase your resource income at high-probability nodes.

Updated plan: 1. **Robber Placement**: Move the robber to **🌾8 (-1, 1, 0)** to block RED’s wheat production. Steal a resource from RED, prioritizing **sheep** or **ore** to buy a development card.
2. **Play Road Building Card** (ONLY if RED tries to immediately expand Longest Road or threatens your future settlement spots; otherwise, save it for flex use).
3. **Buy Development Card** (if resources align after stealing). Target knights to secure Largest Army and additional robbers.
4. **Prepare for a City**: Once resources are gathered, prioritize upgrading **node 4 (5 + 8)** to amplify your already-strong wheat and wood production.
5. **Adapt to Threats**: If RED moves closer to 10 VP through Longest Road, pivot to disrupt their road strategy and reclaim the bonus.

2. **Resource Use After Robber**: If you steal 🐑SHEEP, buy a development card. If you steal 🧱BRICK, hold to prepare for a settlement. If neither, trade **4 🌾WHEAT** for 🐑SHEEP and buy a development card.  
3. **Road Building Card**: SAVE the Road Building card for later and adapt if RED makes a decisive move on Longest Road next turn.
LLM chose action 1: End your turn
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2552 chars)
Updated plan: 1. **Move Robber**:
   - Place it on 🌾8 (-1, 1, 0), blocking RED's wheat production. This indirectly slows their ability to upgrade settlements to cities.
   - *Steal a resource from RED*. Depending on what we steal, the next steps are:
     - 🐑 **SHEEP**: Buy a development card to pursue Largest Army and leverage strategic robber placement.
     - 🧱 **BRICK**: Save for settlement-building as we also have 🌾WHEAT available.
     - Neither 🐑 nor 🧱: Trade **4 🌾WHEAT** with the bank for 🐑SHEEP and buy a development card.
2. **Prioritize Development Cards**:
   - Work toward Largest Army for +2 Victory Points, ensuring both robber control and defensive opportunities.
3. **Reserve Road Building Card**:
   - Hold this card for Longest Road pivot or settlement expansion as RED cannot significantly extend roads next turn.

Updated plan: 1. **Move Robber**:
   - Place the Robber on **🌾8 (-1, 1, 0)** to block RED’s critical wheat production and slow down their ability to build cities or settlements.
   - **Steal a resource from RED**. Depending on what we get:
     - **🐑SHEEP**: Purchase a **Development Card** immediately to work toward Largest Army and potentially gain a Knight or Victory Point.
     - **🧱BRICK**: Save it for future settlement-building when combined with road expansion using the Road Building card.
     - Neither 🧱 nor 🐑: Trade surplus resources (e.g., **4 🌾WHEAT**) at the bank for **🐑SHEEP** and still purchase a Development Card.
2. **Prepare for Largest Army**:
   - Focus on securing **Largest Army** as the faster route to +2 Victory Points. You already have 2 played Knights, needing just 1 more to get the bonus.
3. **Reserve Road Building**:
   - Hold the **Road Building card** for a decisive Longest Road pivot or settlement claim in later turns to block RED and secure the win.

**After completing this plan, you will end your turn and re-evaluate based on RED’s next move.**

   - Place the Robber on 🌾8 (-1, 1, 0) to block RED’s wheat production, which is critical for their city-building and settlement expansion.
   - **Steal a card from RED**. This could provide you with a resource you need to take action this turn.

2. **Based on the stolen resource**:
   - If you steal a 🐑SHEEP: Use it to purchase a **Development Card**.
   - If you steal a 🧱BRICK or other resource:
     - Trade with the Bank (e.g., 4 🌾WHEAT -> 🐑SHEEP) to purchase a Development Card.
     - Save resources if Development Card purchase is not possible this turn.

3. **Keep the Road Building card for later**:
   - Do not use the **Road Building** card yet. Save it for a decisive road-building maneuver to either secure a settlement or compete for Longest Road in the future.

4. **End your turn**:
   - Re-evaluate the game situation and RED’s next move after ending the turn.

2. If you steal 🐑SHEEP (or if you have 1 🐑SHEEP and 1 🧱BRICK after trading):

Updated plan: 1. **Move the Robber to 🌾8** (high-impact block on RED's wheat production).
   - Steal a resource from RED. If you get 🧱BRICK or ⛏️ORE, proceed with the next step.

2. **Make a Trade (if important resources are still missing)**:
   - If Red's steal gives no 🧱 or 🧱ORE, explore port trading 4 🌾WHEAT for 🧱BRICK, enabling a settlement or development card purchase.

3. **Consider Playing "Road Building" for Strategic Growth**:
   - If you can block RED from expanding roads further or set up paths to settlements, this might be the best use of the card.
   - Make this decision based on where you play roads and its game-long impact.

4. **Safety Plan—End Turn**:
   - Avoid unnecessary trades to save resources for future settlements or a city.

   - If the robber's steal fails to grant critical resources, move on to port trading.
2. Use the **ROAD_BUILDING card** to block Red’s path and/or expand Blue’s reach toward contested nodes for settlement building.
   - Place roads where strategic nodes provide a long-term resource gain for new settlements or cities.
