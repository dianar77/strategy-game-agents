You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN. That means 10 victory points.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>
6. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively
7. Think about the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- üîç marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

Early Game Strategy:
1. Prioritize building settlements on high-probability resource tiles (5, 6, 8, 9).
2. Ensure access to a variety of resources to avoid being blocked by the robber.
3. Build toward ports to facilitate better trading opportunities.
4. Avoid clustering settlements too close together to maximize resource collection.

Mid-Game Resource Management:
1. Focus on upgrading settlements to cities for increased resource production.
2. Use development cards strategically to gain advantages or disrupt opponents.
3. Trade wisely to acquire needed resources without benefiting opponents too much.

Late-Game Victory Point Optimization:
1. Aim for hidden victory points through development cards.
2. Build to the longest road or largest army for additional points.
3. Block opponents from reaching key victory points.

Effective Trading and Negotiation:
1. Always be open to trading but avoid seeming desperate.
2. Use ports effectively for better trade rates.
3. Be aware of opponents' resources and needs to negotiate better deals.

Development Card Usage:
1. Use knights to move the robber and disrupt opponents' resource collection.
2. Save victory point cards for late-game to surprise opponents.
3. Use other development cards situationaly to gain advantages.

Robber Placement Strategy:
1. Place the robber on high-probability tiles to disrupt opponents.
2. Target tiles that opponents have heavily invested in.
3. Use the robber to protect your own tiles from being blocked.
