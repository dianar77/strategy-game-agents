You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN. That means 10 victory points.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>
6. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively
7. Think about the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action

Strategic Guidelines:
- **Early Game Placement**: Focus settlement placement on tiles with high production probability (6, 8) for critical resources (brick, wood, wheat, ore). Ensure diversity to enable road-building and city upgrades.
- **Road Building**: Prioritize road building for settlement expansions and seizing Longest Road. Connect to ports when possible for better trading rates.
- **Resource Management**: Minimize 4:1 trades if better options are available (ports or trading with other players). Look to convert surplus resources into useful expansions or purchases.
- **Development Cards**: Time development card purchases to maximize strategic advantages (e.g., Largest Army, stopping other players).
- **Robber Placement**: Always aim to target the opponent‚Äôs highest-resource-producing tiles (especially contested resources like ore or wheat).

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- üîç marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road-building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)
