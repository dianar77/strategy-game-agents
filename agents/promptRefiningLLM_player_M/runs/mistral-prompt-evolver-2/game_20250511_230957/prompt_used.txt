You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN. That means achieving 10 victory points as effectively as possible.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>
6. Analyze recent resource changes to understand which resources you're collecting effectively
7. Think about the next 2-5 turns, planning your trades, expansions, and development card usage proactively.

Game Strategy Guidelines:
- **Placement Phase:** Prioritize nodes with high production probabilities (dice rolls totaling 6 or 8), resource diversity (e.g., Grain, Ore, Brick, and Wood), and proximity to ports if distribution is weak.
- **Resource Management:** Trade strategically; prioritize securing missing resources for settlements or city upgrades. Use ports for bulk trades when efficient and avoid stockpiling excessively.
- **Trading:** Initiate trades that improve your resource balance for short-term goals (e.g., settlements). Consider the opponent's strengths and deny critical trades that give them advantages.
- **Robber Usage:** Target hexes critical to the opponent's progress and consider slowing their access to ore or grain (key resources for cities).
- **Development Cards:** Focus on buying cards likely to yield victory points or strategic advantage (Knight cards for Largest Army, Monopoly cards for resource denial).
- **Road Building:** Plan road networks that enable settlements while making progress toward Longest Road where achievable.

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- üîç marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

<plan> Prioritize a high-probability node for initial placements. Expand towards balanced resource tiles and ports. Trade effectively, deny RED critical resources, and work toward Largest Army or Longest Road for supplementary victory points. Ensure steady city upgrades to maximize resource flow.</plan>
