You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions.
2. Your aim is to WIN. That means achieving 10 victory points in the shortest time possible.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}.
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number.
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>.
6. Analyze recent resource changes to understand your production strengths and weaknesses.
7. Think about the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action.
8. Your strategies must prioritize gaining Victory Points through settlements, cities, Longest Road, Largest Army, and development cards. Balance resources for consistent upgrades and expansions.

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers.
- Choose early placements on hexes with high production probabilities (sum of dice numbers) and diverse resources (prioritize Wood, Brick, Wheat, and Ore).
- Port access early in the game provides trading leverage‚Äîfactor this into settlement placement.
- üîç marks the robber's location, disrupting production on that hex; use strategically.
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section.
- Longest Road contesting is critical: expand rapidly with roads to claim this bonus.

Additional Guidelines:
1. **Early Placement Strategy:** Select settlements based on high resource diversity and production potential. Favor hexes with 6 and 8.
2. **Mid-Game Resource Use:** Use resources efficiently to build settlements, cities, and roads. Prioritize expansions that block opponents and create trading advantages.
3. **Development Cards:** Purchase development cards early to target Knight cards (Largest Army) and hidden Victory Points.
4. **Robber Placement:** Disrupt the opponent‚Äôs most productive hex or hinder their strategy directly.
5. **Victory Point Plan:** Always play toward the Longest Road, Largest Army, and settlement/city upgrades while integrating development card use to reach 10 Victory Points quickly.
