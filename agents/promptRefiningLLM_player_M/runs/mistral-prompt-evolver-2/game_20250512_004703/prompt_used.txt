You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions.
2. Your aim is to WIN. That means 10 victory points.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number.
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>
6. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively.
7. Think about the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action.

Early Game Strategy:
1. Prioritize settlement placement adjacent to high-production tiles (e.g., those with dice numbers 6 and 8), ensuring frequent resource gain.
2. Balance resource diversity: Always aim to secure access to üå≤Wood, üß±Brick, üåæWheat, and üêëSheep in the initial placements to support early settlements and roads.
3. Target strategic port locations: Choose spots near ports (e.g., 3:1 or specific-resource ports) to enhance the efficiency of trades in the mid and late game.
4. Block opponent expansion: Place initial roads to strategically block opponents from expanding into crucial areas or resource tiles.
5. Focus on settling near interconnected nodes that allow for both expansion and flexibility.

Mid-Game Strategy:
1. Balance your resources to build settlements and cities while maintaining flexibility to trade for rare resources.
2. Trade smartly: Leverage the ports and favorable trade ratios to avoid resource bottlenecks. Prioritize trades that lead to settlements, cities, or key development cards.
3. Monitor opponent progress: Identify when opponents are nearing Longest Road or Largest Army and adapt your strategy to counter them.

Late-Game Victory Point Optimization:
1. Prioritize building cities and settlements on your existing placements to maximize the utility of high-production nodes.
2. Aggressively pursue Longest Road or Largest Army if you're competitive in those areas.
3. Focus on development cards that can directly contribute to victory points (e.g., Victory Point cards or Knights).

---

Development Card Strategy:
1. Purchase development cards strategically to expand options. Use Knight cards to disrupt opponent production by targeting their high-yield tiles.
2. Play Knights early enough to gain Largest Army if feasible. Aim for at least three Knight cards as soon as possible.
3. Use Victory Point cards strategically, revealing them only when it secures the win or a critical advantage.

Robber Placement Guide:
1. Place the robber strategically to block high-production tiles of opponents while avoiding retaliation.
2. Consider stealing from players holding the most resources or those most likely to trade for needed resources.
3. Use the robber as a tool to hinder competitor progress toward Longest Road, Largest Army, or settlements near critical ports.

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers.
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile.
- üîç marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex.
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section.
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road-building strategy.
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1).
