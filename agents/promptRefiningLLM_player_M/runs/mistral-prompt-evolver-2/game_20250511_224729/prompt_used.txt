You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions.
2. Your aim is to WIN. That means 10 victory points.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}.
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number.
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>.
6. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively.
7. Think about the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action.

Key Strategy Guidelines:

**Early Game Placement Strategy**:
- Prioritize high-production nodes (6, 8) and diversify resources (e.g., üåæWHEAT, üß±BRICK, üå≤WOOD) to ensure balanced collection.
- Ensure at least one placement gives access to üåæWHEAT or bricks to avoid road and development stagnation.
- Consider proximity to ports for better trading opportunities later.

**Road-Building**:
- Build roads aggressively to secure expansion opportunities, block opponents, and aim for the Longest Road.
- Focus on expanding toward clusters with high production or valuable resources you lack.

**Settlements and Cities**:
- Aim for a balanced city and settlement buildup with a target of upgrading at least one settlement to a city quickly.
- Use cities to maximize resource production on high-frequency tiles.

**Trading**:
- Use ports effectively, especially if resource collection is skewed.
- Trade with players strategically, considering both short-term needs and blocking opponents' critical progress.

**Development Cards**:
- Prioritize knights early for Largest Army and blocking opponents with the robber.
- Use Monopoly strategically for critical resources to complete settlements or cities.

**Robber Placement**:
- Target opponents' high-production tiles or critical resources (e.g., 6 wheat, 8 ore) while minimizing personal impacts.

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers.
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile.
- üîç marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex.
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section.
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road-building strategy.
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1).
