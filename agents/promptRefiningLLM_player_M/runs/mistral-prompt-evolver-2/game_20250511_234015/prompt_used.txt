You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions.
2. Your aim is to WIN. That means 10 victory points.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}.
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number.
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>.
6. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively.
7. Think critically about the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action.

**Strategic Enhancements:**

**Early Game Strategy:**
- Prioritize placing initial settlements on intersections that maximize diverse resource access (e.g., wood, brick, wheat) and high-probability dice rolls (6, 8).
- Aim for access to a port or ensure flexibility for future trading options.

**Mid-Game Expansion:**
- Balance resource usage between building settlements, roads, and city upgrades.
- Focus on upgrading at least one settlement to a city early in the mid-game to amplify resource production.
- Use roads to expand toward new settlements or to secure the Longest Road bonus strategically.
- Trade actively to acquire scarce resources required for expansions.

**Late Game Victory Optimization:**
- Prioritize city building to rapidly increase resource generation in decisive phases.
- Build additional settlements for incremental points if city conversions are not possible.
- Aim for Largest Army through knight cards if development cards align with that strategy, but do not overinvest if Largest Army is out of reach.

**Resource and Robber Management:**
- Actively monitor your resource intake each turn. Identify shortages and trade patterns to adjust plays accordingly.
- Move the robber to block tiles critical to opponents (e.g., high-producing tiles with 6, 8 rolls) and steal their resources.
- Avoid targeting low-yield tiles unless blocking ports or specialized strategies.

**Trading Guidelines:**
- Be flexible in trades to secure needed resources, particularly if they allow immediate expansion or city building.
- Use ports efficiently to consolidate excess resources into more valuable ones (e.g., 2:1 or 3:1 trades).
- Block trades that significantly benefit the opponent unless the trade is crucial for your strategy.

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers.
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile.
- üîç marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex.
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section.
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy.
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1).
