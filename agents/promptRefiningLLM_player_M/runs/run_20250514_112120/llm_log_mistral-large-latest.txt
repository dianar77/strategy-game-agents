Colonist Strategies: What are the Best Catan Starting Strategies?

Today we will be giving you pointers on the best starting placement strategies for Settlers of Catan that you can use in Colonist.

Colonist.io

1. Identify Your Goals

The first and most important Catan Strategy is knowing what you want to build. This will dictate which resources you should go after when you place your starting settlements. [...] Also you don’t want to overproduce resources which can’t be used and then lose them to a 7 roll.

A much more ideal setup would be an 8-5-10 placement, with a secondary placement of 6-9-4.

These are all good numbers, and you’ve got a variety, meaning that you’re more likely to collect on any given roll.

It’s not always possible to get good number variety, and you will more often than not have a duplicate number, but it’s important to be as diverse as possible. [...] This is where the road placement comes in very handy. Placing your first roads is actually very important, as doing it wrong can set you back a few turns.

Just make sure that your road points to a spot on the map that you can move out to, even if the resource production isn’t high.

A common error to make is pointing the road to a goldmine of resources and numbers, only to have your neighbor place there next turn, making your road a dead end for you.

While the introductory game comes with a recommended board layout, later games are played on a randomized hex tile layout.  Take a close look at these random layouts at the start of the game. Are there two of the same resource next to one another?  Is at least one of the numbered chits on those tiles reasonably high? Consider placing a Settlement in the most advantageous intersection of those tiles, then build roads and additional Settlements around them to block your opponents from doing the [...] When looking for intersections to place your first Settlements, pay less attention to the type of resource and more attention to the number of dots on the hex tiles that make up the intersections.  The type of resource matters less than the frequency of obtaining them. After all, resources can be traded to the bank at 4:1 or at Ports for an even better return (see below).

Setup includes randomly placing large hexagonal tiles (each showing a resource or the desert) in a honeycomb shape and surrounding them with water tiles, some of which contain ports of exchange. Number disks, which will correspond to die rolls (two 6-sided dice are used), are placed on each resource tile. Each player is given two settlements (think: houses) and roads (sticks) which are, in turn, placed on intersections and borders of the resource tiles. Players collect a hand of resource cards [...] to you is to try to go second and i think the idea is that when you're picking fourth amongst really 
great players like this who know where to choose there's going to be fewer options available to 
you late in the game and conversely if you're the first player there's really going to be nothing 
left by the time you get to the eighth pick unless it's a really rich board so going second 
is ideal to get a really strong early pick but not end up with the very worst pick if you [...] In CATAN (formerly The Settlers of Catan), players try to be the dominant force on the island of Catan by building settlements, cities, and roads. On each turn dice are rolled to determine what resources the island produces. Players build by spending resources (sheep, wheat, wood, brick and ore) that are depicted by these resource cards; each land type, with the exception of the unproductive desert, produces a specific resource: hills produce brick, forests produce wood, mountains produce ore,

You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN. That means 10 victory points.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>
6. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively
7. Think about the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)================================== Ai Message ==================================

- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

Early Game Placement Strategy:
1. Identify Your Goals: Know what you want to build and which resources you need.
2. Diversify Numbers: Aim for a variety of dice numbers to increase the likelihood of collecting resources on any given roll. An ideal setup could be an 8-5-10 placement, with a secondary placement of 6-9-4.
3. Road Placement: Ensure your first roads point to spots on the map that allow for expansion, even if the resource production isn't high. Avoid dead ends where neighbors can block your path.
4. Resource Frequency: Pay more attention to the number of dots on the hex tiles rather than the type of resource. Resources can be traded, so focus on tiles with high-frequency numbers.
5. Optimal Turn Order: Aim to go second in the turn order to secure a strong early pick while avoiding the worst pick later in the game.

Mid-Game Resource Management:
1. Trade Wisely: Use ports and trade with other players to acquire the resources you need. Avoid overproducing resources that can't be used effectively.
2. Plan Ahead: Think about the next 2-3 turns and plan your resource management accordingly.

Late-Game Victory Point Optimization:
1. Focus on acquiring victory points through city upgrades, development cards, and longest road/largest army awards.
2. Block Opponents: Strategically place settlements and roads to block opponents from expanding and gaining victory points.

Effective Trading and Negotiation:
1. Use Ports: Trade resources at ports for better rates.
2. Negotiate with Players: Engage in trades with other players to get the resources you need while preventing opponents from gaining an advantage.

Development Card Usage:
1. Strategic Use: Use development cards wisely to gain advantages such as additional resources, victory points, or moving the robber.
2. Timing: Play development cards at the right time to maximize their impact.

Robber Placement Strategy:
1. Target Opponents: Place the robber on tiles that are crucial to your opponents' resource collection.
2. Block High-Value Tiles: Prioritize placing the robber on tiles with high-frequency numbers to disrupt opponents' resource gathering.================================= Tool Message =================================

You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN. That means 10 victory points.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>
6. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively
7. Think about the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)================================== Ai Message ==================================

As a rule of thumb, during your first settlement placement, it’s usually best not to point your road toward the middle of the board. You will likely have no expansion spots since everyone will start toward the middle, rather than the coast.
Anytime your road is in a contestable direction, make sure you’re the one cutting someone off or are more likely to win the race — not the other way around. [...] Think of a Catan map as having 3 areas — the center, inner, and coastal rings. The “center” is all the spots around the middle hex, “inner” is the next one outward, and so on.
For starters, the coast never makes sense for your first placement as it will only have 2 hexes of production (3 for you to build more central) and it will inhibit your optionality to expand.

Placing your initial settlements in Settlers of Catan is crucial for setting up a strong position in the game. Here are some strategies to consider when placing your settlements:
1. Resource Variety

Aim to have access to a variety of resources (brick, wood, wheat, sheep, and ore). A balanced resource base helps you build roads, settlements, and cities effectively.

2. High-Probability Numbers [...] Work with what the dice give you. Sometimes, that will be nothing.
Your strategy in Catan will be based heavily off of your initial placement of your Settlements. The serpentine placement pattern (P1, P2, P3, P4, P4, P3, P2, P1) is very good at balancing out who gets access to the best spots, but think carefully about where you’re going to start and what you’re going to work towards. [...] Cities first strategy
Since cities double your earning power, an effective strategy can be to optimize for as much wheat and rock as you can get early in the game, upgrade to two cities as quickly as possible, and then trade out some of your abundant wheat and rock for wood and brick later to build roads and expand. If you can get access to sheep with this strategy, you can also quickly and easily pursue a strategy of buying a lot of development cards before building more settlements.

Colonist Strategies: What are the Best Catan Starting Strategies?

Today we will be giving you pointers on the best starting placement strategies for Settlers of Catan that you can use in Colonist.

Colonist.io

1. Identify Your Goals

The first and most important Catan Strategy is knowing what you want to build. This will dictate which resources you should go after when you place your starting settlements. [...] Overall, placing your starting settlements wisely will give you a huge advantage in Settlers of Catan. But this is just one of the many strategies that can be employed in the game.

It is very hard to employ all these tactics in every game though, as the board is arranged randomly by the system and your neighbors choices restrict yours.

However, having a good grasp of starting positions and initial placements will help greatly in winning you your next Colonist game. [...] Also you don’t want to overproduce resources which can’t be used and then lose them to a 7 roll.

A much more ideal setup would be an 8-5-10 placement, with a secondary placement of 6-9-4.

These are all good numbers, and you’ve got a variety, meaning that you’re more likely to collect on any given roll.

It’s not always possible to get good number variety, and you will more often than not have a duplicate number, but it’s important to be as diverse as possible.

Different combinations of resources are required to build different things, meaning that the importance of certain resources shifts throughout the game. For example, bricks and lumber are important at the beginning because they are needed to build roads. Sheep and wheat gain importance when the time comes to build settlements, followed by ore when it’s time to build cities. Acquiring these resources depends on the game board, which is (for all purposes) a map of the mythical Catan. [...] The goal of Settlers is to be the first person to earn 10 Victory Points. Victory Points are mostly earned by building settlements and cities. To build settlements and cities, one must first build roads. To build all of these things, one must earn resources: brick, lumber, wheat, ore, and sheep. [...] The value of specific resources changes as players look to develop their settlements from roads into cities. It’s also important to use the resources that you have. If a seven is rolled and you have more than seven resource cards, you must give up half of them. Wise resource management becomes a key element to winning the game.

Given there is a limit of 7 cards before you are at risk of losing half your cards, it can be advantageous to have a steady stream of resources coming into your hand throughout the game. The best way to do this is to place your two first settlements on intersections with six different numbers total with ideally, the highest probability.

Having access to all five resources is extremely important and can be a game changer in the mid and late game.

It makes your strategy more flexible, meaning that you can adapt to unique circumstances. Let's take a look into one example:

Analyze blue’s setup. He is going for dev cards + city strategy. He probably will not get to the ore port before red because red has access to wood and brick while blue doesn’t.

When trading resources with other players, it can be easy for the negotiations to break down when you can’t find a suitable 1 for 1 exchange. However, you greatly increase your likelihood of reaching a deal if you can find things other than what initially brought you to the table over which to trade. A personal favorite of mine is including a promise for one (or both) of the sides not to place the robber on each other the next time they move it. This makes the trade more of a win-win, but it [...] In Settlers of Catan — and in life — the most important negotiations aren’t truly one time events. You still have to interact with your counterpart long after any single negotiation ends, and the tenor of every negotiation influences the relationship that follows. To increase the likelihood of success in future negotiations, it is always a good idea to build goodwill in advance of need. Think of goodwill like a bank that you build up and depletes when you use it. If you build goodwill only when [...] Building goodwill can manifest through taking mercy on a struggling player with robber placement (and letting him or her know), making many trades early in the game, or even rationally explaining to someone you are robbing of resources exactly why you are doing it, so they don’t take it personally and seek retribution.

Reciprocity is among the most powerful “Weapons of Influence,”and you should use it to your advantage.

The concept for the Development Card Strategy is to ignore wood and brick completely when you are placing your initial settlements. Instead, you want, in order, Ore, Wheat, and Sheep. Cities and Development Cards are your friends.  
To achieve 10 victory points, most of the time you'll want to: [...] 3rd Player. Initial placement 5 ore, 4 wheat, 8 wheat, 11 wood, 6 brick. Won. Despite my best efforts to play a Development Card strategy, the best placements for ore and wheat gave me brick and wood, so this one played more like an expansion strategy. I finished with longest road, largest army, 2 cities, 2 settlements, and 1 bonus point.
4th Player. Initial placement 4 ore, 3 wheat, 8 sheep, 5 sheep, 11 sheep. Lost. This strategy is not viable with such low quantities of ore and wheat. [...] The hardest decision when playing this strategy seems to be determining when to buy a card and when to wait to buy a city. The earlier that you can get cities the better, but you simply cannot wait to buy development cards. You're going to need soldiers to keep the robber off you, and the other, non-VP cards come in handy too. If I'm close to having enough for a city, I'll usually hold out. If I've already bought a couple of cards and have a soldier in waiting, I'll definitely try to save up.

They'll usually end up with the Largest Army card and the lion's share of the victory point cards, and generally make a fabulous nuisance of themselves. This is a great strategy if you have good ore/wheat/sheep balance, but is always fun to play, especially because you'll be dropping the robber all over the place but your board position will appear sufficiently weak [...] Using the robber well is crucial - on average, the robber will turn up once in every six rolls and it also gets moved when playing a knight.

- use it on the person in the strongest position (not necessarily the open points leader). Count unplayed development cards in someone's hand as points. Someone who gets Longest Road early is rarely a threat in the long term.

- use the robber exclusively on your strongest opponent. Avoid motivating more than one of your opponents to seek revenge!

You should also make sure that you only affect one player with the robber. Affecting two players doubles the revenge factor, as well as doubles the motivation to move it with a soldier card. If only one person is affected, then the robber will probably spend longer on that spot. As a rule of thumb, in the early/middle game, you should place the robber on the player to your right. The reason is that it will spend more time there. The player to your right can’t take the robber off for two or [...] Once in a while, one of the above strategies for the robber may be correct.

You’re always supposed to place the robber on the person with the most victory points, right? Or, wait, you’re supposed to place it on a 6 or 8 so that it takes out someone’s best number, correct? Or was it that you should try to put it so that it affects as many people as possible? And of course, you never want to put the robber on someone holding development cards because they probably have a soldier, and they’ll just put it right back on you won’t they?

- try to avoid trading down to just a few cards with the bank and being stuck unable to build. Chances are, you're doing so for a resource you're finding hard to get and therefore other players will know they can disproportionately hurt you with the robber if they steal it.

- preserve juicy settlement locations with judicious road placement. Lock up that port that's critical to your strategy early. Nothing more infuriating than having an opponent beat you to it. [...] - if you are lacking a resource, don't place the robber on it. You want there to be lots of it in the game so people will trade it to you. Instead, place it on a resource that you have a lot of so you can increase your probability of trading for what you need.

Step 7: Commander [...] - block what that opponent needs, rather than their highest producing tile. Their city on the 8 of ore just got hit twice - tempting target, right? Wrong. Block their 4 of wheat instead.

- if your opponents are all similarly positioned, hitting the person to your right (on a tile that they exclusively benefit from) will ensure the robber sits there for as long as possible without retaliation. If they try to get you back you may be able to respond immediately.

It probably goes without saying, but robber placement should hinder the biggest threat to you and in general, experienced Catan gamers will be understanding if that’s what you do.  Less forgiving is when you use it early on, hitting many people at once.  That tends to leave a bad taste in people’s mouths as they look for retribution.  Having multiple people gunning for you is not fun.  Also, if you can’t figure out who to sic the robber on, place it on the person to your right.  There’s a high [...] 3. Understand which resources are scarce:
The interesting thing in Settlers of Catan is that no matter your strategy, you’ll need every resource eventually.  And if one of the resources turns out to be rare, expect competition to be fierce! Use those rare resources to your advantage by trading aggressively and cutting deals that would be borderline highway robbery.

 Call ID: v2e0jRBv7
  Args:
    new_text: You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN. That means 10 victory points.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>
6. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively
7. Think about the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

Early Game Placement Strategy:
1. Identify Your Goals: Know what you want to build and which resources you need.
2. Diversify Numbers: Aim for a variety of dice numbers to increase the likelihood of collecting resources on any given roll. An ideal setup could be an 8-5-10 placement, with a secondary placement of 6-9-4.
3. Road Placement: Ensure your first roads point to spots on the map that allow for expansion, even if the resource production isn't high. Avoid dead ends where neighbors can block your path.
4. Resource Frequency: Pay more attention to the number of dots on the hex tiles rather than the type of resource. Resources can be traded, so focus on tiles with high-frequency numbers.
5. Optimal Turn Order: Aim to go second in the turn order to secure a strong early pick while avoiding the worst pick later in the game.
6. Coastal Placement: Avoid placing your first settlement on the coast as it limits expansion options and reduces resource collection.
7. Center and Inner Rings: Focus on placing settlements in the center and inner rings of the board for better resource access and expansion opportunities.

Mid-Game Resource Management:
1. Trade Wisely: Use ports and trade with other players to acquire the resources you need. Avoid overproducing resources that can't be used effectively.
2. Plan Ahead: Think about the next 2-3 turns and plan your resource management accordingly.
3. Resource Variety: Aim to have access to all five resources to maintain flexibility in your strategy.
4. Steady Resource Stream: Place your settlements on intersections with high-probability numbers to ensure a steady stream of resources.
5. Avoid Overproduction: Be mindful of the 7-card limit to avoid losing half your resources if a 7 is rolled.

Late-Game Victory Point Optimization:
1. Focus on acquiring victory points through city upgrades, development cards, and longest road/largest army awards.
2. Block Opponents: Strategically place settlements and roads to block opponents from expanding and gaining victory points.
3. Development Cards: Use development cards wisely to gain additional resources, victory points, or move the robber.
4. Year of Plenty: Save Year of Plenty cards for combinations that result in a 3 victory point turn.

Effective Trading and Negotiation:
1. Use Ports: Trade resources at ports for better rates.
2. Negotiate with Players: Engage in trades with other players to get the resources you need while preventing opponents from gaining an advantage.
3. Build Goodwill: Build goodwill with other players to increase the likelihood of successful future negotiations.
4. Reciprocity: Use the principle of reciprocity to your advantage in negotiations.
5. Avoid Helping Opponents: Be cautious of trades that benefit opponents more than you.

Development Card Usage:
1. Strategic Use: Use development cards wisely to gain advantages such as additional resources, victory points, or moving the robber.
2. Timing: Play development cards at the right time to maximize their impact.
3. Largest Army: Aim to build the largest army for additional victory points.
4. Resource Focus: Focus on collecting wheat, sheep, and ore for development cards.
5. Early Cities: Build cities early to increase resource production and acquire development cards.

Robber Placement Strategy:
1. Target Opponents: Place the robber on tiles that are crucial to your opponents' resource collection.
2. Block High-Value Tiles: Prioritize placing the robber on tiles with high-frequency numbers to disrupt opponents' resource gathering.
3. Single Player Impact: Aim to affect only one player with the robber to avoid multiple retaliations.
4. Early/Middle Game: Place the robber on the player to your right to ensure it stays longer on that tile.
5. Late Game: Focus on the strongest opponent or the player closest to winning.
6. Resource Scarcity: Place the robber on resources that are scarce to increase your trading power.
7. Avoid Personal Need: Avoid placing the robber on resources you need to prevent hindering your own progress.================================= Tool Message =================================
