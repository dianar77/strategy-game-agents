You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN. That means 10 victory points.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>
6. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively
7. Think about the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- üîç marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

Early Game Placement Strategy:
1. Identify Your Goals: Know what you want to build and which resources you need.
2. Diversify Numbers: Aim for a variety of dice numbers to increase the likelihood of collecting resources on any given roll. An ideal setup could be an 8-5-10 placement, with a secondary placement of 6-9-4.
3. Road Placement: Ensure your first roads point to spots on the map that allow for expansion, even if the resource production isn't high. Avoid dead ends where neighbors can block your path.
4. Resource Frequency: Pay more attention to the number of dots on the hex tiles rather than the type of resource. Resources can be traded, so focus on tiles with high-frequency numbers.
5. Optimal Turn Order: Aim to go second in the turn order to secure a strong early pick while avoiding the worst pick later in the game.
6. Coastal Placement: Avoid placing your first settlement on the coast as it limits expansion options and reduces resource collection.
7. Center and Inner Rings: Focus on placing settlements in the center and inner rings of the board for better resource access and expansion opportunities.

Mid-Game Resource Management:
1. Trade Wisely: Use ports and trade with other players to acquire the resources you need. Avoid overproducing resources that can't be used effectively.
2. Plan Ahead: Think about the next 2-3 turns and plan your resource management accordingly.
3. Resource Variety: Aim to have access to all five resources to maintain flexibility in your strategy.
4. Steady Resource Stream: Place your settlements on intersections with high-probability numbers to ensure a steady stream of resources.
5. Avoid Overproduction: Be mindful of the 7-card limit to avoid losing half your resources if a 7 is rolled.

Late-Game Victory Point Optimization:
1. Focus on acquiring victory points through city upgrades, development cards, and longest road/largest army awards.
2. Block Opponents: Strategically place settlements and roads to block opponents from expanding and gaining victory points.
3. Development Cards: Use development cards wisely to gain additional resources, victory points, or move the robber.
4. Year of Plenty: Save Year of Plenty cards for combinations that result in a 3 victory point turn.

Effective Trading and Negotiation:
1. Use Ports: Trade resources at ports for better rates.
2. Negotiate with Players: Engage in trades with other players to get the resources you need while preventing opponents from gaining an advantage.
3. Build Goodwill: Build goodwill with other players to increase the likelihood of successful future negotiations.
4. Reciprocity: Use the principle of reciprocity to your advantage in negotiations.
5. Avoid Helping Opponents: Be cautious of trades that benefit opponents more than you.

Development Card Usage:
1. Strategic Use: Use development cards wisely to gain advantages such as additional resources, victory points, or moving the robber.
2. Timing: Play development cards at the right time to maximize their impact.
3. Largest Army: Aim to build the largest army for additional victory points.
4. Resource Focus: Focus on collecting wheat, sheep, and ore for development cards.
5. Early Cities: Build cities early to increase resource production and acquire development cards.

Robber Placement Strategy:
1. Target Opponents: Place the robber on tiles that are crucial to your opponents' resource collection.
2. Block High-Value Tiles: Prioritize placing the robber on tiles with high-frequency numbers to disrupt opponents' resource gathering.
3. Single Player Impact: Aim to affect only one player with the robber to avoid multiple retaliations.
4. Early/Middle Game: Place the robber on the player to your right to ensure it stays longer on that tile.
5. Late Game: Focus on the strongest opponent or the player closest to winning.
6. Resource Scarcity: Place the robber on resources that are scarce to increase your trading power.
7. Avoid Personal Need: Avoid placing the robber on resources you need to prevent hindering your own progress.
