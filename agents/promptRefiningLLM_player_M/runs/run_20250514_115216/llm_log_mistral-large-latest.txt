    "prompt_used": "You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.\n\nRules:\n1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions\n2. Your aim is to WIN. That means 10 victory points.\n3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \\boxed{5}\n4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number\n5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:\n   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>\n6. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively\n7. Think about the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action\n\nBoard Understanding Guide:\n- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers\n- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile\n- \ud83d\udd0d marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex\n- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section\n- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy\n- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)",

Colonist Strategies: What are the Best Catan Starting Strategies?

Today we will be giving you pointers on the best starting placement strategies for Settlers of Catan that you can use in Colonist.

Colonist.io

1. Identify Your Goals

The first and most important Catan Strategy is knowing what you want to build. This will dictate which resources you should go after when you place your starting settlements. [...] Also you don‚Äôt want to overproduce resources which can‚Äôt be used and then lose them to a 7 roll.

A much more ideal setup would be an 8-5-10 placement, with a secondary placement of 6-9-4.

These are all good numbers, and you‚Äôve got a variety, meaning that you‚Äôre more likely to collect on any given roll.

It‚Äôs not always possible to get good number variety, and you will more often than not have a duplicate number, but it‚Äôs important to be as diverse as possible. [...] This is where the road placement comes in very handy. Placing your first roads is actually very important, as doing it wrong can set you back a few turns.

Just make sure that your road points to a spot on the map that you can move out to, even if the resource production isn‚Äôt high.

A common error to make is pointing the road to a goldmine of resources and numbers, only to have your neighbor place there next turn, making your road a dead end for you.

While the introductory game comes with a recommended board layout, later games are played on a randomized hex tile layout.¬† Take a close look at these random layouts at the start of the game. Are there two of the same resource next to one another?¬† Is at least one of the numbered chits on those tiles reasonably high? Consider placing a Settlement in the most advantageous intersection of those tiles, then build roads and additional Settlements around them to block your opponents from doing the [...] When looking for intersections to place your first Settlements, pay less attention to the type of resource and more attention to the number of dots on the hex tiles that make up the intersections.¬† The type of resource matters less than the frequency of obtaining them. After all, resources can be traded to the bank at 4:1 or at Ports for an even better return (see below).

Setup includes randomly placing large hexagonal tiles (each showing a resource or the desert) in a honeycomb shape and surrounding them with water tiles, some of which contain ports of exchange. Number disks, which will correspond to die rolls (two 6-sided dice are used), are placed on each resource tile. Each player is given two settlements (think: houses) and roads (sticks) which are, in turn, placed on intersections and borders of the resource tiles. Players collect a hand of resource cards [...] to you is to try to go second and i think the idea is that when you're picking fourth amongst really¬†
great players like this who know where to choose there's going to be fewer options available to¬†
you late in the game and conversely if you're the first player there's really going to be nothing¬†
left by the time you get to the eighth pick unless it's a really rich board so going second¬†
is ideal to get a really strong early pick but not end up with the very worst pick if you [...] In CATAN (formerly The Settlers of Catan), players try to be the dominant force on the island of Catan by building settlements, cities, and roads. On each turn dice are rolled to determine what resources the island produces. Players build by spending resources (sheep, wheat, wood, brick and ore) that are depicted by these resource cards; each land type, with the exception of the unproductive desert, produces a specific resource: hills produce brick, forests produce wood, mountains produce ore,

That being said, having access to all of the resources is not only important, it may also lead to your mid and end game phases becoming a trivial matter.

Between your two placements, try your best to have access to each needed resource.

For example, if you place on a Lumber-Brick-Wheat combination, your next placement should preferably have Ore and Wool together. This is where complementary placements come in. [...] In addition, this would also give you a pretty good idea on how you would want your game to progress.

There are three main strategies you can focus on:

Settlements and Longest Road - Your essential resources would be high amount of Lumber, Brick and some amount of Wool, and Wheat.

Hybrid Expansion ¬†- Occupying as much as you can of the map thereby acquiring more resources. For this strategy you will need to produce a balanced amount of all resources. [...] Say you‚Äôve found two potential spots that will give you all your resources, only this time, you notice that both the spots have the same numbers!

This means that you‚Äôll produce well if any of those numbers roll, but it also means that you would only collect resources from three different numbers.

I mentioned this earlier: Colonist is a resource management game. But there won‚Äôt be anything for you to manage if you‚Äôre not producing resources.

Different combinations of resources are required to build different things, meaning that the importance of certain resources shifts throughout the game. For example, bricks and lumber are important at the beginning because they are needed to build roads. Sheep and wheat gain importance when the time comes to build settlements, followed by ore when it‚Äôs time to build cities. Acquiring these resources depends on the game board, which is (for all purposes) a map of the mythical Catan. [...] The value of specific resources changes as players look to develop their settlements from roads into cities. It‚Äôs also important to use the resources that you have. If a seven is rolled and you have more than seven resource cards, you must give up half of them. Wise resource management becomes a key element to winning the game.
Standard 15: How physical systems affect human systems. [...] The goal of Settlers is to be the first person to earn 10 Victory Points. Victory Points are mostly earned by building settlements and cities. To build settlements and cities, one must first build roads. To build all of these things, one must earn resources: brick, lumber, wheat, ore, and sheep.

When Catan (or The Settlers of Catan, as it was originally named) was first published in 1995 it created something of a revelation in board game circles, undeniably changing the way people would look at board games and gaming in general.¬† Part of Catan‚Äôs success has been due to designer Klaus Teuber‚Äôs ability to combine different gaming mechanics (resource management, trading, route building, dice rolling) in a way that made the game easy to teach and learn, while maintaining enough depth to

Obvious leads make you a target. Longest Road in particular should be picked up as late as possible. Joining up two separate road segments with a big road-building push and unveiling 2 victory point cards can give you the win from 6 points. Largest Army on the other hand needs to be more openly competed for, because of the play-only-one-development-card-per-turn rule. Victory point cards are great to have because they create uncertainty in your opponents (is it a VP or a monopoly card?). [...] The strategies all kind of blend together in the late game when everyone has multiple cities/settlements/roads/cards, trading is mostly happening with the bank/ports for fear of letting someone else go out on their turn, battle will be fierce for the bonus cards, and development cards are disappearing at a furious rate. Don't stress over settlement positioning in the late game - put them anywhere you can, they're victory points rather than production sources.

I decided to do a note on this victory point issue because‚Ä¶ well it‚Äôs complicated.
Obtaining an additional victory point change the victory condition, and will either let a player decide which victory point it will replace or ends up changing a¬†victory from a 10 point victory to an 11 point victory. In this last case, it will not save you anything, since the additional victory point is not needed anyway to win. [...] Second, you calculate¬†the probability¬†of having picked (3¬†knights, no victory point¬†card and¬†one ‚Äúother‚Äù) for our first 4 cards, multiplied by the probability of picking the missing victory point card on the fifth card. In this scenario, there is 5 victory point card left in a deck of 21 cards.
 = 4.11%
In Full: [...] In Catan, victory is declared as soon as you reach 10 points, so an extra¬†victory point¬†means that you‚Äôll get one less victory point from another source. It changes the possible combinations of victory elements¬†you can achieve.
So what do we do when evaluating the probabilities of drawing cards for a particular victory?
Ignore the possibility to draw victory point cards?
Or ignore the impact of drawing those cards when evaluating victories that are not supposed to involve them?

When trading resources with other players, it can be easy for the negotiations to break down when you can‚Äôt find a suitable 1 for 1 exchange. However, you greatly increase your likelihood of reaching a deal if you can find things other than what initially brought you to the table over which to trade. A personal favorite of mine is including a promise for one (or both) of the sides not to place the robber on each other the next time they move it. This makes the trade more of a win-win, but it [...] In Settlers of Catan ‚Äî and in life ‚Äî the most important negotiations aren‚Äôt truly one time events. You still have to interact with your counterpart long after any single negotiation ends, and the tenor of every negotiation influences the relationship that follows. To increase the likelihood of success in future negotiations, it is always a good idea to build goodwill in advance of need. Think of goodwill like a bank that you build up and depletes when you use it. If you build goodwill only when [...] Building goodwill can manifest through taking mercy on a struggling player with robber placement (and letting him or her know), making many trades early in the game, or even rationally explaining to someone you are robbing of resources exactly why you are doing it, so they don‚Äôt take it personally and seek retribution.

Reciprocity is among the most powerful ‚ÄúWeapons of Influence,‚Äùand you should use it to your advantage.

Experienced players often use hidden development cards to scare away other players from blocking and stealing from them, take away another player‚Äôs settlement spot, steal the longest road, shockingly build a city (or two), and even prevent another player from winning on their turn. Development cards offer an additional layer of strategy and players can leverage this favorable information asymmetry to drive the direction of their path to 10 Victory Points. [...] Newer players are very focused on the board in front of them and are always looking to build the next road, settlement, and city. They often overlook development cards since it is off the board. This phenomenon exists in both the online and physical game but it is much more pronounced in the physical version because development cards are more out of sight, placed to the side of each player compared to the centrally located board that is some 30 to 40 times the size of a development card. This [...] While the perceived probability of drawing each development card will shift as the game progresses, it is important to remember that the more hidden development cards that you own relative to other players, the closer your perceived probability is to the actual probability. Therefore, by having more hidden development cards and using this information to calculate probabilities more accurately (technical skill), you have more knowledge about the remaining development card deck, minimizing your

In Cities and Knights

Catan: Cities & Knights does not use development cards but uses Progress cards. These are generated through a combination of city improvements and dice rolls but function much the same as regular development cards.

In Traders and Barbarians [...] There are a couple of scenarios in Catan: Traders & Barbarians that use their own sets of development cards with varying abilities.

According to computer simulation tests, the best strategy for winning Catan is the Development Card Strategy.

6. What‚Äôs the Development Card Strategy?

The Catan Development Card Strategy focuses on ignoring wood and brick during the initial placement of settlements and instead prioritizing ore, wheat, and sheep. While it may sound counter intuitive, as wood and brick are essential to expanding your civilization, focusing on these higher-valued resources can be very lucrative. [...] In conclusion, Catan development cards are an important aspect of the game, providing players with various strategies to gain points and win the game. Understanding the cards‚Äô distribution and when they can be played is crucial to maximizing their effectiveness.

- try to avoid trading down to just a few cards with the bank and being stuck unable to build. Chances are, you're doing so for a resource you're finding hard to get and therefore other players will know they can disproportionately hurt you with the robber if they steal it.

- preserve juicy settlement locations with judicious road placement. Lock up that port that's critical to your strategy early. Nothing more infuriating than having an opponent beat you to it. [...] - if you are lacking a resource, don't place the robber on it. You want there to be lots of it in the game so people will trade it to you. Instead, place it on a resource that you have a lot of so you can increase your probability of trading for what you need.

Step 7: Commander [...] Using the robber well is crucial - on average, the robber will turn up once in every six rolls and it also gets moved when playing a knight.

- use it on the person in the strongest position (not necessarily the open points leader). Count unplayed development cards in someone's hand as points. Someone who gets Longest Road early is rarely a threat in the long term.

- use the robber exclusively on your strongest opponent. Avoid motivating more than one of your opponents to seek revenge!

Sort the resource cards into 5 stacks and place them face up beside the board.
Shuffle the development cards Y and place them face down beside the resource cards.
Place the 2 special cards and the dice beside the board.
Place the robber in the desert.
The set-up phase has 2 rounds. Each player builds 1 road and 1 settlement per round.
Round One Each player rolls both dice. The player who rolls highest is the starting player and begins. [...] K Knight Cards When you play a ‚ÄúKnight‚Äù development card during your turn, you must immediately move the robber Y. Place the knight card face up in front of you.
You must move the robber away from its current spot and onto the number token of any other terrain hex or on the desert.
You then steal 1 resource card from a player who has a settlement or a city adjacent to the robber. If there are 2 or more such players, you may choose your victim.

You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN. That means 10 victory points.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>
6. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively
7. Think about the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action

- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)================================== Ai Message ==================================

### Key Weaknesses Identified:

1. **Early Game Placement Strategy**:
   - The LLM player often places settlements on suboptimal resource tiles, leading to inefficient resource collection.
   - Road placement is not strategic, often leading to dead ends or blocked paths.

2. **Mid-Game Resource Management**:
   - The LLM player frequently trades resources at unfavorable rates, leading to a lack of critical resources.
   - There is a lack of focus on diversifying resource collection, leading to overproduction of certain resources and underproduction of others.

3. **Late-Game Victory Point Optimization**:
   - The LLM player does not prioritize victory point cards and often reveals them too early, making it easier for opponents to block.
   - Settlement placement in the late game is not optimized for victory points.

4. **Effective Trading and Negotiation**:
   - The LLM player often rejects trades that could be beneficial and does not leverage goodwill for future negotiations.
   - There is a lack of strategic use of the robber to control resource flow and disrupt opponents.

5. **Development Card Usage**:
   - The LLM player does not use development cards strategically to gain an advantage or disrupt opponents.
   - There is a lack of understanding of the probabilities and optimal times to use development cards.

6. **Robber Placement Strategy**:
   - The LLM player does not use the robber effectively to target high-value hexes or disrupt opponents' strategies.
   - The robber is often moved to hexes that do not significantly impact the game state.

### Targeted Improvements:

1. **Early Game Placement Strategy**:
   - **Improvement**: Focus on placing settlements on tiles with diverse and high-probability numbers (e.g., 5, 6, 8, 9). Ensure that the initial settlements provide access to all necessary resources.
   - **Prompt Update**: "In the early game, prioritize placing settlements on tiles with numbers like 5, 6, 8, and 9 to ensure diverse and frequent resource collection. Aim to have access to all necessary resources (wood, brick, wheat, ore, and sheep) within your first two settlements."

2. **Mid-Game Resource Management**:
   - **Improvement**: Diversify resource collection and avoid overproduction of any single resource. Use ports strategically to trade resources at favorable rates.
   - **Prompt Update**: "During the mid-game, focus on diversifying your resource collection. Use ports to trade resources at a 2:1 or 3:1 rate to ensure you have a balanced supply of all resources. Avoid overproducing any single resource."

3. **Late-Game Victory Point Optimization**:
   - **Improvement**: Prioritize victory point cards and keep them hidden until the late game. Place settlements strategically to maximize victory points, even if they do not produce resources.
   - **Prompt Update**: "In the late game, focus on optimizing victory points. Prioritize collecting and hiding victory point cards. Place settlements strategically to gain victory points, even if they do not produce resources."

4. **Effective Trading and Negotiation**:
   - **Improvement**: Be open to beneficial trades and use goodwill to build relationships for future negotiations. Use the robber strategically to control resource flow and disrupt opponents.
   - **Prompt Update**: "Engage in beneficial trades and use goodwill to build relationships for future negotiations. Use the robber strategically to control resource flow and disrupt opponents' plans."

5. **Development Card Usage**:
   - **Improvement**: Understand the probabilities and optimal times to use development cards. Use them strategically to gain an advantage or disrupt opponents.
   - **Prompt Update**: "Understand the probabilities and optimal times to use development cards. Use them strategically to gain an advantage, such as building a city unexpectedly or disrupting an opponent's plan."

6. **Robber Placement Strategy**:
   - **Improvement**: Use the robber to target high-value hexes or disrupt opponents' strategies. Avoid moving the robber to hexes that do not significantly impact the game state.
   - **Prompt Update**: "Use the robber strategically to target high-value hexes (e.g., ore, wheat) or disrupt opponents' plans. Avoid moving the robber to hexes that do not significantly impact the game state."

You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN. That means 10 victory points.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>
6. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively
7. Think about the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action

Board Understanding Guide:

- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- üîç marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)================================== Ai Message ==================================

Colonist Strategies: What are the Best Catan Starting Strategies?

Today we will be giving you pointers on the best starting placement strategies for Settlers of Catan that you can use in Colonist.

Colonist.io

1. Identify Your Goals

The first and most important Catan Strategy is knowing what you want to build. This will dictate which resources you should go after when you place your starting settlements. [...] Also you don‚Äôt want to overproduce resources which can‚Äôt be used and then lose them to a 7 roll.

A much more ideal setup would be an 8-5-10 placement, with a secondary placement of 6-9-4.

These are all good numbers, and you‚Äôve got a variety, meaning that you‚Äôre more likely to collect on any given roll.

It‚Äôs not always possible to get good number variety, and you will more often than not have a duplicate number, but it‚Äôs important to be as diverse as possible. [...] This is where the road placement comes in very handy. Placing your first roads is actually very important, as doing it wrong can set you back a few turns.

Just make sure that your road points to a spot on the map that you can move out to, even if the resource production isn‚Äôt high.

A common error to make is pointing the road to a goldmine of resources and numbers, only to have your neighbor place there next turn, making your road a dead end for you.

While the introductory game comes with a recommended board layout, later games are played on a randomized hex tile layout.¬† Take a close look at these random layouts at the start of the game. Are there two of the same resource next to one another?¬† Is at least one of the numbered chits on those tiles reasonably high? Consider placing a Settlement in the most advantageous intersection of those tiles, then build roads and additional Settlements around them to block your opponents from doing the [...] When looking for intersections to place your first Settlements, pay less attention to the type of resource and more attention to the number of dots on the hex tiles that make up the intersections.¬† The type of resource matters less than the frequency of obtaining them. After all, resources can be traded to the bank at 4:1 or at Ports for an even better return (see below).

Setup includes randomly placing large hexagonal tiles (each showing a resource or the desert) in a honeycomb shape and surrounding them with water tiles, some of which contain ports of exchange. Number disks, which will correspond to die rolls (two 6-sided dice are used), are placed on each resource tile. Each player is given two settlements (think: houses) and roads (sticks) which are, in turn, placed on intersections and borders of the resource tiles. Players collect a hand of resource cards [...] to you is to try to go second and i think the idea is that when you're picking fourth amongst really¬†

is ideal to get a really strong early pick but not end up with the very worst pick if you [...] In CATAN (formerly The Settlers of Catan), players try to be the dominant force on the island of Catan by building settlements, cities, and roads. On each turn dice are rolled to determine what resources the island produces. Players build by spending resources (sheep, wheat, wood, brick and ore) that are depicted by these resource cards; each land type, with the exception of the unproductive desert, produces a specific resource: hills produce brick, forests produce wood, mountains produce ore,

That being said, having access to all of the resources is not only important, it may also lead to your mid and end game phases becoming a trivial matter.

Between your two placements, try your best to have access to each needed resource.

For example, if you place on a Lumber-Brick-Wheat combination, your next placement should preferably have Ore and Wool together. This is where complementary placements come in. [...] In addition, this would also give you a pretty good idea on how you would want your game to progress.

There are three main strategies you can focus on:

Settlements and Longest Road - Your essential resources would be high amount of Lumber, Brick and some amount of Wool, and Wheat.

Hybrid Expansion ¬†- Occupying as much as you can of the map thereby acquiring more resources. For this strategy you will need to produce a balanced amount of all resources. [...] Say you‚Äôve found two potential spots that will give you all your resources, only this time, you notice that both the spots have the same numbers!

This means that you‚Äôll produce well if any of those numbers roll, but it also means that you would only collect resources from three different numbers.

I mentioned this earlier: Colonist is a resource management game. But there won‚Äôt be anything for you to manage if you‚Äôre not producing resources.

Different combinations of resources are required to build different things, meaning that the importance of certain resources shifts throughout the game. For example, bricks and lumber are important at the beginning because they are needed to build roads. Sheep and wheat gain importance when the time comes to build settlements, followed by ore when it‚Äôs time to build cities. Acquiring these resources depends on the game board, which is (for all purposes) a map of the mythical Catan. [...] The value of specific resources changes as players look to develop their settlements from roads into cities. It‚Äôs also important to use the resources that you have. If a seven is rolled and you have more than seven resource cards, you must give up half of them. Wise resource management becomes a key element to winning the game.
Standard 15: How physical systems affect human systems. [...] The goal of Settlers is to be the first person to earn 10 Victory Points. Victory Points are mostly earned by building settlements and cities. To build settlements and cities, one must first build roads. To build all of these things, one must earn resources: brick, lumber, wheat, ore, and sheep.

When Catan (or The Settlers of Catan, as it was originally named) was first published in 1995 it created something of a revelation in board game circles, undeniably changing the way people would look at board games and gaming in general.¬† Part of Catan‚Äôs success has been due to designer Klaus Teuber‚Äôs ability to combine different gaming mechanics (resource management, trading, route building, dice rolling) in a way that made the game easy to teach and learn, while maintaining enough depth to

Obvious leads make you a target. Longest Road in particular should be picked up as late as possible. Joining up two separate road segments with a big road-building push and unveiling 2 victory point cards can give you the win from 6 points. Largest Army on the other hand needs to be more openly competed for, because of the play-only-one-development-card-per-turn rule. Victory point cards are great to have because they create uncertainty in your opponents (is it a VP or a monopoly card?). [...] The strategies all kind of blend together in the late game when everyone has multiple cities/settlements/roads/cards, trading is mostly happening with the bank/ports for fear of letting someone else go out on their turn, battle will be fierce for the bonus cards, and development cards are disappearing at a furious rate.

I decided to do a note on this victory point issue because‚Ä¶ well it‚Äôs complicated.
Obtaining an additional victory point change the victory condition, and will either let a player decide which victory point it will replace or ends up changing a¬†victory from a 10 point victory to an 11 point victory. In this last case, it will not save you anything, since the additional victory point is not needed anyway to win. [...] Second, you calculate¬†the probability¬†of having picked (3¬†knights, no victory point¬†card and¬†one ‚Äúother‚Äù) for our first 4 cards, multiplied by the probability of picking the missing victory point card on the fifth card. In this scenario, there is 5 victory point card left in a deck of 21 cards.
 = 4.11%
In Full: [...] In Catan, victory is declared as soon as you reach 10 points, so an extra¬†victory point¬†means that you‚Äôll get one less victory point from another source. It changes the possible combinations of victory elements¬†you can achieve.
So what do we do when evaluating the probabilities of drawing cards for a particular victory?
Ignore the possibility to draw victory point cards?
Or ignore the impact of drawing those cards when evaluating victories that are not supposed to involve them?

When trading resources with other players, it can be easy for the negotiations to break down when you can‚Äôt find a suitable 1 for 1 exchange. However, you greatly increase your likelihood of reaching a deal if you can find things other than what initially brought you to the table over which to trade.

This makes the trade more of a win-win, but it [...] In Settlers of Catan ‚Äî and in life ‚Äî the most important negotiations aren‚Äôt truly one time events. You still have to interact with your counterpart long after any single negotiation ends, and the tenor of every negotiation influences the relationship that follows. To increase the likelihood of success in future negotiations, it is always a good idea to build goodwill in advance of need. Think of goodwill like a bank that you build up and depletes when you use it. If you build goodwill only when [...] Building goodwill can manifest through taking mercy on a struggling player with robber placement (and letting him or her know), making many trades early in the game, or even rationally explaining to someone you are robbing of resources exactly why you are doing it, so they don‚Äôt take it personally and seek retribution.

Reciprocity is among the most powerful ‚ÄúWeapons of Influence,‚Äùand you should use it to your advantage.

Experienced players often use hidden development cards to scare away other players from blocking and stealing from them, take away another player‚Äôs settlement spot, steal the longest road, shockingly build a city (or two), and even prevent another player from winning on their turn. Development cards offer an additional layer of strategy and players can leverage this favorable information asymmetry to drive the direction of their path to 10 Victory Points. [...] Newer players are very focused on the board in front of them and are always looking to build the next road, settlement, and city. They often overlook development cards since it is off the board.

- try to avoid trading down to just a few cards with the bank and being stuck unable to build. Chances are, you're doing so for a resource you're finding hard to get and therefore other players will know they can disproportionately hurt you with the robber if they steal it.

[...] - if you are lacking a resource, don't place the robber on it. You want there to be lots of it in the game so people will trade it to you.

Step 7: Commander [...] Using the robber well is crucial - on average, the robber will turn up once in every six rolls and it also gets moved when playing a knight.

- use it on the person in the strongest position (not necessarily the open points leader). Count unplayed development cards in someone's hand as points. Someone who gets Longest Road early is rarely a threat in the long term.

- use the robber exclusively on your strongest opponent. Avoid motivating more than one of your opponents to seek revenge!

- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- üîç marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

Early Game Placement Strategy:
- Identify Your Goals: Know what you want to build and go after the corresponding resources. Avoid overproducing resources that can't be used.
- Number Variety: Aim for an 8-5-10 placement with a secondary placement of 6-9-4. Diversify your numbers to increase the likelihood of collecting resources on any given roll.
- Road Placement: Ensure your first roads point to spots on the map that you can move out to, even if the resource production isn't high. Avoid pointing roads to resource-rich spots that opponents can easily block.

Mid-Game Resource Management:
- Complementary Placements: Between your two placements, try to have access to each needed resource. For example, if you place on a Lumber-Brick-Wheat combination, your next placement should preferably have Ore and Wool together.
- Resource Shifts: The importance of certain resources shifts throughout the game. Bricks and lumber are important at the beginning for roads, while sheep and wheat gain importance for settlements, and ore for cities.
- Wise Management: Use the resources you have. If a seven is rolled and you have more than seven resource cards, you must give up half of them. Wise resource management is key to winning the game.

Late-Game Victory Point Optimization:
- Settlement Positioning: In the late game, focus on placing settlements anywhere you can for victory points rather than production sources.
- Longest Road and Largest Army: Pick up the Longest Road as late as possible to avoid becoming a target. Joining up two separate road segments with a big road-building push and unveiling 2 victory point cards can give you the win from 6 points.

Effective Trading and Negotiation:
- Win-Win Trades: Include promises not to place the robber on each other the next time it moves to make trades more beneficial for both parties.
- Goodwill: Build goodwill in advance of need. Think of goodwill like a bank that you build up and depletes when you use it. Building goodwill can manifest through taking mercy on a struggling player with robber placement, making many trades early in the game, or rationally explaining to someone you are robbing of resources exactly why you are doing it.
- Reciprocity: Use reciprocity to your advantage. Losing hurts more than winning feels good, so be mindful of how your actions affect future negotiations.

Development Card Usage:
- Hidden Cards: Use hidden development cards to scare away other players from blocking and stealing from you. Leverage the information asymmetry to drive your path to 10 Victory Points.
- Probabilities: The more hidden development cards you own, the closer your perceived probability is to the actual probability. Use this information to calculate probabilities more accurately.

Robber Placement Strategy:
- Target High-Value Hexes: Place the robber on high-value hexes like ore or wheat to cripple opponents' strategies.
- Avoid Lacking Resources: If you are lacking a resource, don't place the robber on it. You want there to be lots of it in the game so people will trade it to you.
- Strongest Opponent: Use the robber on the person in the strongest position, not necessarily the open points leader. Count unplayed development cards in someone's hand as points.

SUMMARY:

### What the Agent Has Learned from the Game Results:
The agent has identified several key weaknesses in its current strategy based on the game results:
1. **Early Game Placement Strategy**: Suboptimal settlement and road placements leading to inefficient resource collection.
2. **Mid-Game Resource Management**: Ineffective trading and lack of resource diversification.
3. **Late-Game Victory Point Optimization**: Poor use of victory point cards and suboptimal settlement placements.
4. **Effective Trading and Negotiation**: Lack of strategic trading and negotiation, leading to missed opportunities.
5. **Development Card Usage**: Inefficient use of development cards, missing out on strategic advantages.
6. **Robber Placement Strategy**: Ineffective use of the robber to disrupt opponents' strategies.

### Strategies Implemented in the Prompt:
To address these weaknesses, the following strategies were implemented in the prompt:
1. **Early Game Placement Strategy**: Prioritize placing settlements on tiles with high-probability numbers (5, 6, 8, 9) to ensure diverse and frequent resource collection.
2. **Mid-Game Resource Management**: Diversify resource collection and use ports strategically to trade resources at favorable rates.
3. **Late-Game Victory Point Optimization**: Prioritize collecting and hiding victory point cards, and place settlements strategically to maximize victory points.
4. **Effective Trading and Negotiation**: Engage in beneficial trades, use goodwill for future negotiations, and use the robber strategically to control resource flow.
5. **Development Card Usage**: Understand the probabilities and optimal times to use development cards to gain an advantage.

Avoid overproducing resources that can't be used.\n- Number Variety: Aim for an 8-5-10 placement with a secondary placement of 6-9-4. Diversify your numbers to increase the likelihood of collecting resources on any given roll.\n- Road Placement: Ensure your first roads point to spots on the map that you can move out to, even if the resource production isn't high. Avoid pointing roads to resource-rich spots that opponents can easily block.\n\nMid-Game Resource Management:\n- Complementary Placements: Between your two placements, try to have access to each needed resource. For example, if you place on a Lumber-Brick-Wheat combination, your next placement should preferably have Ore and Wool together.\n- Resource Shifts: The importance of certain resources shifts throughout the game. Bricks and lumber are important at the beginning for roads, while sheep and wheat gain importance for settlements, and ore for cities.\n- Wise Management: Use the resources you have. If a seven is rolled and you have more than seven resource cards, you must give up half of them. Wise resource management is key to winning the game.\n\nLate-Game Victory Point Optimization:\n- Settlement Positioning: In the late game, focus on placing settlements anywhere you can for victory points rather than production sources.\n- Longest Road and Largest Army: Pick up the Longest Road as late as possible to avoid becoming a target. Joining up two separate road segments with a big road-building push and unveiling 2 victory point cards can give you the win from 6 points.\n\nEffective Trading and Negotiation:\n- Win-Win Trades: Include promises not to place the robber on each other the next time it moves to make trades more beneficial for both parties.\n- Goodwill: Build goodwill in advance of need. Think of goodwill like a bank that you build up and depletes when you use it. Building goodwill can manifest through taking mercy on a struggling player with robber placement, making many trades early in the game, or rationally explaining to someone you are robbing of resources exactly why you are doing it.\n- Reciprocity: Use reciprocity to your advantage. Losing hurts more than winning feels good, so be mindful of how your actions affect future negotiations.\n\nDevelopment Card Usage:\n- Hidden Cards: Use hidden development cards to scare away other players from blocking and stealing from you. Leverage the information asymmetry to drive your path to 10 Victory Points.\n- Probabilities: The more hidden development cards you own, the closer your perceived probability is to the actual probability. Use this information to calculate probabilities more accurately.\n\nRobber Placement Strategy:\n- Target High-Value Hexes: Place the robber on high-value hexes like ore or wheat to cripple opponents' strategies.\n- Avoid Lacking Resources: If you are lacking a resource, don't place the robber on it. You want there to be lots of it in the game so people will trade it to you.\n- Strongest Opponent: Use the robber on the person in the strongest position, not necessarily the open points leader. Count unplayed development cards in someone's hand as points.\n- Exclusive Targeting: Use the robber exclusively on your strongest opponent to avoid motivating more than one opponent to seek revenge.",

    new_text: You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN. That means 10 victory points.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>
6. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively
7. Think about the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- üîç marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

Early Game Placement Strategy:
- Identify Your Goals: Know what you want to build and go after the corresponding resources. Avoid overproducing resources that can't be used.
- Number Variety: Aim for an 8-5-10 placement with a secondary placement of 6-9-4. Diversify your numbers to increase the likelihood of collecting resources on any given roll.
- Road Placement: Ensure your first roads point to spots on the map that you can move out to, even if the resource production isn't high. Avoid pointing roads to resource-rich spots that opponents can easily block.

Mid-Game Resource Management:
- Complementary Placements: Between your two placements, try to have access to each needed resource. For example, if you place on a Lumber-Brick-Wheat combination, your next placement should preferably have Ore and Wool together.
- Resource Shifts: The importance of certain resources shifts throughout the game. Bricks and lumber are important at the beginning for roads, while sheep and wheat gain importance for settlements, and ore for cities.
- Wise Management: Use the resources you have. If a seven is rolled and you have more than seven resource cards, you must give up half of them. Wise resource management is key to winning the game.

Late-Game Victory Point Optimization:
- Settlement Positioning: In the late game, focus on placing settlements anywhere you can for victory points rather than production sources.
- Longest Road and Largest Army: Pick up the Longest Road as late as possible to avoid becoming a target. Joining up two separate road segments with a big road-building push and unveiling 2 victory point cards can give you the win from 6 points.

Effective Trading and Negotiation:
- Win-Win Trades: Include promises not to place the robber on each other the next time it moves to make trades more beneficial for both parties.
- Goodwill: Build goodwill in advance of need. Think of goodwill like a bank that you build up and depletes when you use it. Building goodwill can manifest through taking mercy on a struggling player with robber placement, making many trades early in the game, or rationally explaining to someone you are robbing of resources exactly why you are doing it.
- Reciprocity: Use reciprocity to your advantage. Losing hurts more than winning feels good, so be mindful of how your actions affect future negotiations.

Development Card Usage:
- Hidden Cards: Use hidden development cards to scare away other players from blocking and stealing from you. Leverage the information asymmetry to drive your path to 10 Victory Points.
- Probabilities: The more hidden development cards you own, the closer your perceived probability is to the actual probability. Use this information to calculate probabilities more accurately.

Robber Placement Strategy:
- Target High-Value Hexes: Place the robber on high-value hexes like ore or wheat to cripple opponents' strategies.
- Avoid Lacking Resources: If you are lacking a resource, don't place the robber on it. You want there to be lots of it in the game so people will trade it to you.
- Strongest Opponent: Use the robber on the person in the strongest position, not necessarily the open points leader. Count unplayed development cards in someone's hand as points.
- Exclusive Targeting: Use the robber exclusively on your strongest opponent to avoid motivating more than one opponent to seek revenge.

<plan>Focus on diversifying resource collection and strategic trading to maximize resource gain. Prioritize settlement placements that block opponents and secure high-probability numbers. Use development cards strategically to gain an advantage and disrupt opponents.</plan>================================= Tool Message =================================

    new_text: You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN. That means 10 victory points.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>
6. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively
7. Think about the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- üîç marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

Early Game Placement Strategy:
- Identify Your Goals: Know what you want to build and go after the corresponding resources. Avoid overproducing resources that can't be used.
- Number Variety: Aim for an 8-5-10 placement with a secondary placement of 6-9-4. Diversify your numbers to increase the likelihood of collecting resources on any given roll.
- Road Placement: Ensure your first roads point to spots on the map that you can move out to, even if the resource production isn't high. Avoid pointing roads to resource-rich spots that opponents can easily block.

Mid-Game Resource Management:
- Complementary Placements: Between your two placements, try to have access to each needed resource. For example, if you place on a Lumber-Brick-Wheat combination, your next placement should preferably have Ore and Wool together.
- Resource Shifts: The importance of certain resources shifts throughout the game. Bricks and lumber are important at the beginning for roads, while sheep and wheat gain importance for settlements, and ore for cities.
- Wise Management: Use the resources you have. If a seven is rolled and you have more than seven resource cards, you must give up half of them. Wise resource management is key to winning the game.

Late-Game Victory Point Optimization:
- Settlement Positioning: In the late game, focus on placing settlements anywhere you can for victory points rather than production sources.
- Longest Road and Largest Army: Pick up the Longest Road as late as possible to avoid becoming a target. Joining up two separate road segments with a big road-building push and unveiling 2 victory point cards can give you the win from 6 points.

Effective Trading and Negotiation:
- Win-Win Trades: Include promises not to place the robber on each other the next time it moves to make trades more beneficial for both parties.
- Goodwill: Build goodwill in advance of need. Think of goodwill like a bank that you build up and depletes when you use it. Building goodwill can manifest through taking mercy on a struggling player with robber placement, making many trades early in the game, or rationally explaining to someone you are robbing of resources exactly why you are doing it.
- Reciprocity: Use reciprocity to your advantage. Losing hurts more than winning feels good, so be mindful of how your actions affect future negotiations.

Development Card Usage:
- Hidden Cards: Use hidden development cards to scare away other players from blocking and stealing from you. Leverage the information asymmetry to drive your path to 10 Victory Points.
- Probabilities: The more hidden development cards you own, the closer your perceived probability is to the actual probability. Use this information to calculate probabilities more accurately.

Robber Placement Strategy:
- Target High-Value Hexes: Place the robber on high-value hexes like ore or wheat to cripple opponents' strategies.
- Avoid Lacking Resources: If you are lacking a resource, don't place the robber on it. You want there to be lots of it in the game so people will trade it to you.
- Strongest Opponent: Use the robber on the person in the strongest position, not necessarily the open points leader. Count unplayed development cards in someone's hand as points.
- Exclusive Targeting: Use the robber exclusively on your strongest opponent to avoid motivating more than one opponent to seek revenge.

<plan>Prioritize placing settlements on tiles with high-probability numbers (5, 6, 8, 9) to ensure diverse and frequent resource collection. Place roads strategically to expand toward valuable resources and ports. Focus on trading wisely to acquire needed resources and use development cards to gain an advantage. Use the robber to disrupt opponents' plans and protect your own resources.</plan>================================= Tool Message =================================

Colonist Strategies: What are the Best Catan Starting Strategies?

Today we will be giving you pointers on the best starting placement strategies for Settlers of Catan that you can use in Colonist.

Colonist.io

1. Identify Your Goals

The first and most important Catan Strategy is knowing what you want to build. This will dictate which resources you should go after when you place your starting settlements. [...] Also you don‚Äôt want to overproduce resources which can‚Äôt be used and then lose them to a 7 roll.

A much more ideal setup would be an 8-5-10 placement, with a secondary placement of 6-9-4.

These are all good numbers, and you‚Äôve got a variety, meaning that you‚Äôre more likely to collect on any given roll.

It‚Äôs not always possible to get good number variety, and you will more often than not have a duplicate number, but it‚Äôs important to be as diverse as possible. [...] This is where the road placement comes in very handy. Placing your first roads is actually very important, as doing it wrong can set you back a few turns.

Just make sure that your road points to a spot on the map that you can move out to, even if the resource production isn‚Äôt high.

A common error to make is pointing the road to a goldmine of resources and numbers, only to have your neighbor place there next turn, making your road a dead end for you.

While the introductory game comes with a recommended board layout, later games are played on a randomized hex tile layout.¬† Take a close look at these random layouts at the start of the game. Are there two of the same resource next to one another?¬† Is at least one of the numbered chits on those tiles reasonably high? Consider placing a Settlement in the most advantageous intersection of those tiles, then build roads and additional Settlements around them to block your opponents from doing the [...] When looking for intersections to place your first Settlements, pay less attention to the type of resource and more attention to the number of dots on the hex tiles that make up the intersections.¬† The type of resource matters less than the frequency of obtaining them. After all, resources can be traded to the bank at 4:1 or at Ports for an even better return (see below).

Setup includes randomly placing large hexagonal tiles (each showing a resource or the desert) in a honeycomb shape and surrounding them with water tiles, some of which contain ports of exchange. Number disks, which will correspond to die rolls (two 6-sided dice are used), are placed on each resource tile. Each player is given two settlements (think: houses) and roads (sticks) which are, in turn, placed on intersections and borders of the resource tiles. Players collect a hand of resource cards [...] to you is to try to go second and i think the idea is that when you're picking fourth amongst really¬†

On each turn dice are rolled to determine what resources the island produces. Players build by spending resources (sheep, wheat, wood, brick and ore) that are depicted by these resource cards; each land type, with the exception of the unproductive desert, produces a specific resource: hills produce brick, forests produce wood, mountains produce ore,

That being said, having access to all of the resources is not only important, it may also lead to your mid and end game phases becoming a trivial matter.

Between your two placements, try your best to have access to each needed resource.

For example, if you place on a Lumber-Brick-Wheat combination, your next placement should preferably have Ore and Wool together. This is where complementary placements come in. [...] In addition, this would also give you a pretty good idea on how you would want your game to progress.

There are three main strategies you can focus on:

Settlements and Longest Road - Your essential resources would be high amount of Lumber, Brick and some amount of Wool, and Wheat.

Hybrid Expansion ¬†- Occupying as much as you can of the map thereby acquiring more resources. For this strategy you will need to produce a balanced amount of all resources. [...] Say you‚Äôve found two potential spots that will give you all your resources, only this time, you notice that both the spots have the same numbers!

This means that you‚Äôll produce well if any of those numbers roll, but it also means that you would only collect resources from three different numbers.

I mentioned this earlier: Colonist is a resource management game. But there won‚Äôt be anything for you to manage if you‚Äôre not producing resources.

Different combinations of resources are required to build different things, meaning that the importance of certain resources shifts throughout the game. For example, bricks and lumber are important at the beginning because they are needed to build roads. Sheep and wheat gain importance when the time comes to build settlements, followed by ore when it‚Äôs time to build cities. Acquiring these resources depends on the game board, which is (for all purposes) a map of the mythical Catan. [...] The value of specific resources changes as players look to develop their settlements from roads into cities. It‚Äôs also important to use the resources that you have. If a seven is rolled and you have more than seven resource cards, you must give up half of them. Wise resource management becomes a key element to winning the game.
Standard 15: How physical systems affect human systems. [...] The goal of Settlers is to be the first person to earn 10 Victory Points. Victory Points are mostly earned by building settlements and cities. To build settlements and cities, one must first build roads. To build all of these things, one must earn resources: brick, lumber, wheat, ore, and sheep.

When Catan (or The Settlers of Catan, as it was originally named) was first published in 1995 it created something of a revelation in board game circles, undeniably changing the way people would look at board games and gaming in general.¬† Part of Catan‚Äôs success has been due to designer Klaus Teuber‚Äôs ability to combine different gaming mechanics (resource management, trading, route building, dice rolling) in a way that made the game easy to teach and learn, while maintaining enough depth to

Obvious leads make you a target. Longest Road in particular should be picked up as late as possible. Joining up two separate road segments with a big road-building push and unveiling 2 victory point cards can give you the win from 6 points. Largest Army on the other hand needs to be more openly competed for, because of the play-only-one-development-card-per-turn rule. Victory point cards are great to have because they create uncertainty in your opponents (is it a VP or a monopoly card?). [...] The strategies all kind of blend together in the late game when everyone has multiple cities/settlements/roads/cards, trading is mostly happening with the bank/ports for fear of letting someone else go out on their turn, battle will be fierce for the bonus cards, and development cards are disappearing at a furious rate. Don't stress over settlement positioning in the late game - put them anywhere you can, they're victory points rather than production sources.

When trading resources with other players, it can be easy for the negotiations to break down when you can‚Äôt find a suitable 1 for 1 exchange. However, you greatly increase your likelihood of reaching a deal if you can find things other than what initially brought you to the table over which to trade. A personal favorite of mine is including a promise for one (or both) of the sides not to place the robber on each other the next time they move it. This makes the trade more of a win-win, but it [...] In Settlers of Catan ‚Äî and in life ‚Äî the most important negotiations aren‚Äôt truly one time events. You still have to interact with your counterpart long after any single negotiation ends, and the tenor of every negotiation influences the relationship that follows. To increase the likelihood of success in future negotiations, it is always a good idea to build goodwill in advance of need. Think of goodwill like a bank that you build up and depletes when you use it. If you build goodwill only when [...] Building goodwill can manifest through taking mercy on a struggling player with robber placement (and letting him or her know), making many trades early in the game, or even rationally explaining to someone you are robbing of resources exactly why you are doing it, so they don‚Äôt take it personally and seek retribution.

Reciprocity is among the most powerful ‚ÄúWeapons of Influence,‚Äùand you should use it to your advantage.

Experienced players often use hidden development cards to scare away other players from blocking and stealing from them, take away another player‚Äôs settlement spot, steal the longest road, shockingly build a city (or two), and even prevent another player from winning on their turn. Development cards offer an additional layer of strategy and players can leverage this favorable information asymmetry to drive the direction of their path to 10 Victory Points. [...] Newer players are very focused on the board in front of them and are always looking to build the next road, settlement, and city. They often overlook development cards since it is off the board. This phenomenon exists in both the online and physical game but it is much more pronounced in the physical version because development cards are more out of sight, placed to the side of each player compared to the centrally located board that is some 30 to 40 times the size of a development card. This [...] While the perceived probability of drawing each development card will shift as the game progresses, it is important to remember that the more hidden development cards that you own relative to other players, the closer your perceived probability is to the actual probability. Therefore, by having more hidden development cards and using this information to calculate probabilities more accurately (technical skill), you have more knowledge about the remaining development card deck, minimizing your

Catan: Seafarers uses the base game development cards which function exactly the same except for the following exceptions:

In Cities and Knights

Catan: Cities & Knights does not use development cards but uses Progress cards. These are generated through a combination of city improvements and dice rolls but function much the same as regular development cards.

In Traders and Barbarians [...] There are a couple of scenarios in Catan: Traders & Barbarians that use their own sets of development cards with varying abilities.

- try to avoid trading down to just a few cards with the bank and being stuck unable to build. Chances are, you're doing so for a resource you're finding hard to get and therefore other players will know they can disproportionately hurt you with the robber if they steal it.

- preserve juicy settlement locations with judicious road placement. Lock up that port that's critical to your strategy early. Nothing more infuriating than having an opponent beat you to it. [...] - if you are lacking a resource, don't place the robber on it. You want there to be lots of it in the game so people will trade it to you. Instead, place it on a resource that you have a lot of so you can increase your probability of trading for what you need.

Step 7: Commander [...] Using the robber well is crucial - on average, the robber will turn up once in every six rolls and it also gets moved when playing a knight.

- use it on the person in the strongest position (not necessarily the open points leader). Count unplayed development cards in someone's hand as points. Someone who gets Longest Road early is rarely a threat in the long term.

- use the robber exclusively on your strongest opponent. Avoid motivating more than one of your opponents to seek revenge!

Shuffle the development cards Y and place them face down beside the resource cards.
Place the 2 special cards and the dice beside the board.
Place the robber in the desert.

Round One Each player rolls both dice. The player who rolls highest is the starting player and begins. [...] K Knight Cards When you play a ‚ÄúKnight‚Äù development card during your turn, you must immediately move the robber Y. Place the knight card face up in front of you.
You must move the robber away from its current spot and onto the number token of any other terrain hex or on the desert.
You then steal 1 resource card from a player who has a settlement or a city adjacent to the robber. If there are 2 or more such players, you may choose your victim.

    new_text: You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN. That means 10 victory points.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>
6. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively
7. Think about the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- üîç marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

Early Game Placement Strategy:
- Identify Your Goals: Know what you want to build and go after the corresponding resources. Avoid overproducing resources that can't be used.
- Number Variety: Aim for an 8-5-10 placement with a secondary placement of 6-9-4. Diversify your numbers to increase the likelihood of collecting resources on any given roll.
- Road Placement: Ensure your first roads point to spots on the map that you can move out to, even if the resource production isn't high. Avoid pointing roads to resource-rich spots that opponents can easily block.

Mid-Game Resource Management:
- Complementary Placements: Between your two placements, try to have access to each needed resource. For example, if you place on a Lumber-Brick-Wheat combination, your next placement should preferably have Ore and Wool together.
- Resource Shifts: The importance of certain resources shifts throughout the game. Bricks and lumber are important at the beginning for roads, while sheep and wheat gain importance for settlements, and ore for cities.
- Wise Management: Use the resources you have. If a seven is rolled and you have more than seven resource cards, you must give up half of them. Wise resource management is key to winning the game.

Late-Game Victory Point Optimization:
- Settlement Positioning: In the late game, focus on placing settlements anywhere you can for victory points rather than production sources.
- Longest Road and Largest Army: Pick up the Longest Road as late as possible to avoid becoming a target. Joining up two separate road segments with a big road-building push and unveiling 2 victory point cards can give you the win from 6 points.

Effective Trading and Negotiation:
- Win-Win Trades: Include promises not to place the robber on each other the next time it moves to make trades more beneficial for both parties.
- Goodwill: Build goodwill in advance of need. Think of goodwill like a bank that you build up and depletes when you use it. Building goodwill can manifest through taking mercy on a struggling player with robber placement, making many trades early in the game, or rationally explaining to someone you are robbing of resources exactly why you are doing it.
- Reciprocity: Use reciprocity to your advantage. Losing hurts more than winning feels good, so be mindful of how your actions affect future negotiations.

Development Card Usage:
- Hidden Cards: Use hidden development cards to scare away other players from blocking and stealing from you. Leverage the information asymmetry to drive your path to 10 Victory Points.
- Probabilities: The more hidden development cards you own, the closer your perceived probability is to the actual probability. Use this information to calculate probabilities more accurately.

Robber Placement Strategy:
- Target High-Value Hexes: Place the robber on high-value hexes like ore or wheat to cripple opponents' strategies.
- Avoid Lacking Resources: If you are lacking a resource, don't place the robber on it. You want there to be lots of it in the game so people will trade it to you.
- Strongest Opponent: Use the robber on the person in the strongest position, not necessarily the open points leader. Count unplayed development cards in someone's hand as points.
- Exclusive Targeting: Use the robber exclusively on your strongest opponent to avoid motivating more than one opponent to seek revenge.

<plan>Prioritize placing settlements on tiles with high-probability numbers (5, 6, 8, 9) to ensure diverse and frequent resource collection.

Think about the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action\n\nBoard Understanding Guide:\n- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers\n- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile\n- \ud83d\udd0d marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex\n- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section\n- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy\n- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)\n\nEarly Game Placement Strategy:\n- Identify Your Goals: Know what you want to build and go after the corresponding resources. Avoid overproducing resources that can't be used.\n- Number Variety: Aim for an 8-5-10 placement with a secondary placement of 6-9-4. Diversify your numbers to increase the likelihood of collecting resources on any given roll.\n- Road Placement: Ensure your first roads point to spots on the map that you can move out to, even if the resource production isn't high. Avoid pointing roads to resource-rich spots that opponents can easily block.\n\nMid-Game Resource Management:\n- Complementary Placements: Between your two placements, try to have access to each needed resource. For example, if you place on a Lumber-Brick-Wheat combination, your next placement should preferably have Ore and Wool together.\n- Resource Shifts: The importance of certain resources shifts throughout the game. Bricks and lumber are important at the beginning for roads, while sheep and wheat gain importance for settlements, and ore for cities.\n- Wise Management: Use the resources you have. If a seven is rolled and you have more than seven resource cards, you must give up half of them. Wise resource management is key to winning the game.\n\nLate-Game Victory Point Optimization:\n- Settlement Positioning: In the late game, focus on placing settlements anywhere you can for victory points rather than production sources.\n- Longest Road and Largest Army: Pick up the Longest Road as late as possible to avoid becoming a target. Joining up two separate road segments with a big road-building push and unveiling 2 victory point cards can give you the win from 6 points.\n\nEffective Trading and Negotiation:\n- Win-Win Trades: Include promises not to place the robber on each other the next time it moves to make trades more beneficial for both parties.\n- Goodwill: Build goodwill in advance of need. Think of goodwill like a bank that you build up and depletes when you use it. Building goodwill can manifest through taking mercy on a struggling player with robber placement, making many trades early in the game, or rationally explaining to someone you are robbing of resources exactly why you are doing it.\n- Reciprocity: Use reciprocity to your advantage. Losing hurts more than winning feels good, so be mindful of how your actions affect future negotiations.\n\nDevelopment Card Usage:\n- Hidden Cards: Use hidden development cards to scare away other players from blocking and stealing from you. Leverage the information asymmetry to drive your path to 10 Victory Points.\n- Probabilities: The more hidden development cards you own, the closer your perceived probability is to the actual probability. Use this information to calculate probabilities more accurately.\n\nRobber Placement Strategy:\n- Target High-Value Hexes: Place the robber on high-value hexes like ore or wheat to cripple opponents' strategies.\n- Avoid Lacking Resources: If you are lacking a resource, don't place the robber on it. You want there to be lots of it in the game so people will trade it to you.\n- Strongest Opponent: Use the robber on the person in the strongest position, not necessarily the open points leader. Count unplayed development cards in someone's hand as points.\n- Exclusive Targeting: Use the robber exclusively on your strongest opponent to avoid motivating more than one opponent to seek revenge.",

Colonist Strategies: What are the Best Catan Starting Strategies?

Today we will be giving you pointers on the best starting placement strategies for Settlers of Catan that you can use in Colonist.

Colonist.io

1. Identify Your Goals

The first and most important Catan Strategy is knowing what you want to build. This will dictate which resources you should go after when you place your starting settlements. [...] Also you don‚Äôt want to overproduce resources which can‚Äôt be used and then lose them to a 7 roll.

A much more ideal setup would be an 8-5-10 placement, with a secondary placement of 6-9-4.

These are all good numbers, and you‚Äôve got a variety, meaning that you‚Äôre more likely to collect on any given roll.

It‚Äôs not always possible to get good number variety, and you will more often than not have a duplicate number, but it‚Äôs important to be as diverse as possible. [...] This is where the road placement comes in very handy. Placing your first roads is actually very important, as doing it wrong can set you back a few turns.

Just make sure that your road points to a spot on the map that you can move out to, even if the resource production isn‚Äôt high.

A common error to make is pointing the road to a goldmine of resources and numbers, only to have your neighbor place there next turn, making your road a dead end for you.

While the introductory game comes with a recommended board layout, later games are played on a randomized hex tile layout.¬† Take a close look at these random layouts at the start of the game. Are there two of the same resource next to one another?¬† Is at least one of the numbered chits on those tiles reasonably high? Consider placing a Settlement in the most advantageous intersection of those tiles, then build roads and additional Settlements around them to block your opponents from doing the [...] When looking for intersections to place your first Settlements, pay less attention to the type of resource and more attention to the number of dots on the hex tiles that make up the intersections.¬† The type of resource matters less than the frequency of obtaining them. After all, resources can be traded to the bank at 4:1 or at Ports for an even better return (see below).

Setup includes randomly placing large hexagonal tiles (each showing a resource or the desert) in a honeycomb shape and surrounding them with water tiles, some of which contain ports of exchange. Number disks, which will correspond to die rolls (two 6-sided dice are used), are placed on each resource tile. Each player is given two settlements (think: houses) and roads (sticks) which are, in turn, placed on intersections and borders of the resource tiles. Players collect a hand of resource cards [...] to you is to try to go second and i think the idea is that when you're picking fourth amongst really¬†
great players like this who know where to choose there's going to be fewer options available to¬†

left by the time you get to the eighth pick unless it's a really rich board so going second¬†
is ideal to get a really strong early pick but not end up with the very worst pick if you [...] In CATAN (formerly The Settlers of Catan), players try to be the dominant force on the island of Catan by building settlements, cities, and roads. On each turn dice are rolled to determine what resources the island produces. Players build by spending resources (sheep, wheat, wood, brick and ore) that are depicted by these resource cards; each land type, with the exception of the unproductive desert, produces a specific resource: hills produce brick, forests produce wood, mountains produce ore,

That being said, having access to all of the resources is not only important, it may also lead to your mid and end game phases becoming a trivial matter.

Between your two placements, try your best to have access to each needed resource.

For example, if you place on a Lumber-Brick-Wheat combination, your next placement should preferably have Ore and Wool together. This is where complementary placements come in. [...] In addition, this would also give you a pretty good idea on how you would want your game to progress.

There are three main strategies you can focus on:

Settlements and Longest Road - Your essential resources would be high amount of Lumber, Brick and some amount of Wool, and Wheat.

Hybrid Expansion ¬†- Occupying as much as you can of the map thereby acquiring more resources. For this strategy you will need to produce a balanced amount of all resources. [...] Say you‚Äôve found two potential spots that will give you all your resources, only this time, you notice that both the spots have the same numbers!

This means that you‚Äôll produce well if any of those numbers roll, but it also means that you would only collect resources from three different numbers.

I mentioned this earlier: Colonist is a resource management game. But there won‚Äôt be anything for you to manage if you‚Äôre not producing resources.

Different combinations of resources are required to build different things, meaning that the importance of certain resources shifts throughout the game. For example, bricks and lumber are important at the beginning because they are needed to build roads. Sheep and wheat gain importance when the time comes to build settlements, followed by ore when it‚Äôs time to build cities. Acquiring these resources depends on the game board, which is (for all purposes) a map of the mythical Catan. [...] The value of specific resources changes as players look to develop their settlements from roads into cities. It‚Äôs also important to use the resources that you have. If a seven is rolled and you have more than seven resource cards, you must give up half of them. Wise resource management becomes a key element to winning the game.
Standard 15: How physical systems affect human systems. [...] The goal of Settlers is to be the first person to earn 10 Victory Points. Victory Points are mostly earned by building settlements and cities. To build settlements and cities, one must first build roads. To build all of these things, one must earn resources: brick, lumber, wheat, ore, and sheep.

When Catan (or The Settlers of Catan, as it was originally named) was first published in 1995 it created something of a revelation in board game circles, undeniably changing the way people would look at board games and gaming in general.¬† Part of Catan‚Äôs success has been due to designer Klaus Teuber‚Äôs ability to combine different gaming mechanics (resource management, trading, route building, dice rolling) in a way that made the game easy to teach and learn, while maintaining enough depth to

Obvious leads make you a target. Longest Road in particular should be picked up as late as possible. Joining up two separate road segments with a big road-building push and unveiling 2 victory point cards can give you the win from 6 points. Largest Army on the other hand needs to be more openly competed for, because of the play-only-one-development-card-per-turn rule. Victory point cards are great to have because they create uncertainty in your opponents (is it a VP or a monopoly card?). [...] The strategies all kind of blend together in the late game when everyone has multiple cities/settlements/roads/cards, trading is mostly happening with the bank/ports for fear of letting someone else go out on their turn, battle will be fierce for the bonus cards, and development cards are disappearing at a furious rate. Don't stress over settlement positioning in the late game - put them anywhere you can, they're victory points rather than production sources.

When trading resources with other players, it can be easy for the negotiations to break down when you can‚Äôt find a suitable 1 for 1 exchange. However, you greatly increase your likelihood of reaching a deal if you can find things other than what initially brought you to the table over which to trade. A personal favorite of mine is including a promise for one (or both) of the sides not to place the robber on each other the next time they move it. This makes the trade more of a win-win, but it [...] In Settlers of Catan ‚Äî and in life ‚Äî the most important negotiations aren‚Äôt truly one time events. You still have to interact with your counterpart long after any single negotiation ends, and the tenor of every negotiation influences the relationship that follows. To increase the likelihood of success in future negotiations, it is always a good idea to build goodwill in advance of need. Think of goodwill like a bank that you build up and depletes when you use it. If you build goodwill only when [...] Building goodwill can manifest through taking mercy on a struggling player with robber placement (and letting him or her know), making many trades early in the game, or even rationally explaining to someone you are robbing of resources exactly why you are doing it, so they don‚Äôt take it personally and seek retribution.

Reciprocity is among the most powerful ‚ÄúWeapons of Influence,‚Äùand you should use it to your advantage.

Experienced players often use hidden development cards to scare away other players from blocking and stealing from them, take away another player‚Äôs settlement spot, steal the longest road, shockingly build a city (or two), and even prevent another player from winning on their turn. Development cards offer an additional layer of strategy and players can leverage this favorable information asymmetry to drive the direction of their path to 10 Victory Points. [...] Newer players are very focused on the board in front of them and are always looking to build the next road, settlement, and city. They often overlook development cards since it is off the board. This phenomenon exists in both the online and physical game but it is much more pronounced in the physical version because development cards are more out of sight, placed to the side of each player compared to the centrally located board that is some 30 to 40 times the size of a development card. This [...] While the perceived probability of drawing each development card will shift as the game progresses, it is important to remember that the more hidden development cards that you own relative to other players, the closer your perceived probability is to the actual probability.

Catan: Seafarers uses the base game development cards which function exactly the same except for the following exceptions:

In Cities and Knights

Catan: Cities & Knights does not use development cards but uses Progress cards. These are generated through a combination of city improvements and dice rolls but function much the same as regular development cards.

In Traders and Barbarians [...] There are a couple of scenarios in Catan: Traders & Barbarians that use their own sets of development cards with varying abilities.

Barbarian Attack

Traders & Barbarians scenario

In Explorers and Pirates

- try to avoid trading down to just a few cards with the bank and being stuck unable to build. Chances are, you're doing so for a resource you're finding hard to get and therefore other players will know they can disproportionately hurt you with the robber if they steal it.

- preserve juicy settlement locations with judicious road placement. Lock up that port that's critical to your strategy early. Nothing more infuriating than having an opponent beat you to it. [...] - if you are lacking a resource, don't place the robber on it. You want there to be lots of it in the game so people will trade it to you. Instead, place it on a resource that you have a lot of so you can increase your probability of trading for what you need.

Step 7: Commander [...] Using the robber well is crucial - on average, the robber will turn up once in every six rolls and it also gets moved when playing a knight.

- use it on the person in the strongest position (not necessarily the open points leader). Count unplayed development cards in someone's hand as points. Someone who gets Longest Road early is rarely a threat in the long term.

- use the robber exclusively on your strongest opponent. Avoid motivating more than one of your opponents to seek revenge!

Sort the resource cards into 5 stacks and place them face up beside the board.
Shuffle the development cards Y and place them face down beside the resource cards.
Place the 2 special cards and the dice beside the board.
Place the robber in the desert.
The set-up phase has 2 rounds. Each player builds 1 road and 1 settlement per round.
Round One Each player rolls both dice. The player who rolls highest is the starting player and begins. [...] K Knight Cards When you play a ‚ÄúKnight‚Äù development card during your turn, you must immediately move the robber Y. Place the knight card face up in front of you.
You must move the robber away from its current spot and onto the number token of any other terrain hex or on the desert.
You then steal 1 resource card from a player who has a settlement or a city adjacent to the robber. If there are 2 or more such players, you may choose your victim.

- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

Early Game Placement Strategy:
- Identify Your Goals: Know what you want to build and go after the corresponding resources. Avoid overproducing resources that can't be used.
- Number Variety: Aim for an 8-5-10 placement with a secondary placement of 6-9-4. Diversify your numbers to increase the likelihood of collecting resources on any given roll.
- Road Placement: Ensure your first roads point to spots on the map that you can move out to, even if the resource production isn't high. Avoid pointing roads to resource-rich spots that opponents can easily block.

Mid-Game Resource Management:
- Complementary Placements: Between your two placements, try to have access to each needed resource. For example, if you place on a Lumber-Brick-Wheat combination, your next placement should preferably have Ore and Wool together.
- Resource Shifts: The importance of certain resources shifts throughout the game. Bricks and lumber are important at the beginning for roads, while sheep and wheat gain importance for settlements, and ore for cities.
- Wise Management: Use the resources you have. If a seven is rolled and you have more than seven resource cards, you must give up half of them. Wise resource management is key to winning the game.

Late-Game Victory Point Optimization:
- Settlement Positioning: In the late game, focus on placing settlements anywhere you can for victory points rather than production sources.
- Longest Road and Largest Army: Pick up the Longest Road as late as possible to avoid becoming a target. Joining up two separate road segments with a big road-building push and unveiling 2 victory point cards can give you the win from 6 points.

Effective Trading and Negotiation:
- Win-Win Trades: Include promises not to place the robber on each other the next time it moves to make trades more beneficial for both parties.
- Goodwill: Build goodwill in advance of need. Think of goodwill like a bank that you build up and depletes when you use it. Building goodwill can manifest through taking mercy on a struggling player with robber placement, making many trades early in the game, or rationally explaining to someone you are robbing of resources exactly why you are doing it.
- Reciprocity: Use reciprocity to your advantage. Losing hurts more than winning feels good, so be mindful of how your actions affect future negotiations.

Development Card Usage:
- Hidden Cards: Use hidden development cards to scare away other players from blocking and stealing from you. Leverage the information asymmetry to drive your path to 10 Victory Points.
- Probabilities: The more hidden development cards you own, the closer your perceived probability is to the actual probability. Use this information to calculate probabilities more accurately.

Robber Placement Strategy:
- Target High-Value Hexes: Place the robber on high-value hexes like ore or wheat to cripple opponents' strategies.
- Avoid Lacking Resources: If you are lacking a resource, don't place the robber on it. You want there to be lots of it in the game so people will trade it to you.
- Strongest Opponent: Use the robber on the person in the strongest position, not necessarily the open points leader. Count unplayed development cards in someone's hand as points.
- Exclusive Targeting: Use the robber exclusively on your strongest opponent to avoid motivating more than one opponent to seek revenge.================================= Tool Message =================================

Building goodwill can manifest through taking mercy on a struggling player with robber placement, making many trades early in the game, or rationally explaining to someone you are robbing of resources exactly why you are doing it.\n- Reciprocity: Use reciprocity to your advantage. Losing hurts more than winning feels good, so be mindful of how your actions affect future negotiations.\n\nDevelopment Card Usage:\n- Hidden Cards: Use hidden development cards to scare away other players from blocking and stealing from you. Leverage the information asymmetry to drive your path to 10 Victory Points.\n- Probabilities: The more hidden development cards you own, the closer your perceived probability is to the actual probability. Use this information to calculate probabilities more accurately.\n\nRobber Placement Strategy:\n- Target High-Value Hexes: Place the robber on high-value hexes like ore or wheat to cripple opponents' strategies.\n- Avoid Lacking Resources: If you are lacking a resource, don't place the robber on it. You want there to be lots of it in the game so people will trade it to you.\n- Strongest Opponent: Use the robber on the person in the strongest position, not necessarily the open points leader. Count unplayed development cards in someone's hand as points.\n- Exclusive Targeting: Use the robber exclusively on your strongest opponent to avoid motivating more than one opponent to seek revenge.",

    "prompt_used": "You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.\n\nRules:\n1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions\n2. Your aim is to WIN. That means 10 victory points.\n3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \\boxed{5}\n4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number\n5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:\n   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>\n6. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively\n7. Think about the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action\n\nBoard Understanding Guide:\n- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers\n- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile\n- \ud83d\udd0d marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex\n- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section\n- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy\n- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)\n\nEarly Game Placement Strategy:\n- Identify Your Goals: Know what you want to build and go after the corresponding resources. Avoid overproducing resources that can't be used.\n- Number Variety: Aim for an 8-5-10 placement with a secondary placement of 6-9-4. Diversify your numbers to increase the likelihood of collecting resources on any given roll.\n- Road Placement: Ensure your first roads point to spots on the map that you can move out to, even if the resource production isn't high. Avoid pointing roads to resource-rich spots that opponents can easily block.\n\nMid-Game Resource Management:\n- Complementary Placements: Between your two placements, try to have access to each needed resource. For example, if you place on a Lumber-Brick-Wheat combination, your next placement should preferably have Ore and Wool together.\n- Resource Shifts: The importance of certain resources shifts throughout the game. Bricks and lumber are important at the beginning for roads, while sheep and wheat gain importance for settlements, and ore for cities.\n- Wise Management: Use the resources you have. If a seven is rolled and you have more than seven resource cards, you must give up half of them. Wise resource management is key to winning the game.\n\nLate-Game Victory Point Optimization:\n- Settlement Positioning: In the late game, focus on placing settlements anywhere you can for victory points rather than production sources.\n- Longest Road and Largest Army: Pick up the Longest Road as late as possible to avoid becoming a target.

Colonist Strategies: What are the Best Catan Starting Strategies?

Today we will be giving you pointers on the best starting placement strategies for Settlers of Catan that you can use in Colonist.

Colonist.io

1. Identify Your Goals

The first and most important Catan Strategy is knowing what you want to build. This will dictate which resources you should go after when you place your starting settlements. [...] Also you don‚Äôt want to overproduce resources which can‚Äôt be used and then lose them to a 7 roll.

A much more ideal setup would be an 8-5-10 placement, with a secondary placement of 6-9-4.

These are all good numbers, and you‚Äôve got a variety, meaning that you‚Äôre more likely to collect on any given roll.

It‚Äôs not always possible to get good number variety, and you will more often than not have a duplicate number, but it‚Äôs important to be as diverse as possible. [...] This is where the road placement comes in very handy. Placing your first roads is actually very important, as doing it wrong can set you back a few turns.

Just make sure that your road points to a spot on the map that you can move out to, even if the resource production isn‚Äôt high.

A common error to make is pointing the road to a goldmine of resources and numbers, only to have your neighbor place there next turn, making your road a dead end for you.

While the introductory game comes with a recommended board layout, later games are played on a randomized hex tile layout.¬† Take a close look at these random layouts at the start of the game. Are there two of the same resource next to one another?¬† Is at least one of the numbered chits on those tiles reasonably high? Consider placing a Settlement in the most advantageous intersection of those tiles, then build roads and additional Settlements around them to block your opponents from doing the [...] When looking for intersections to place your first Settlements, pay less attention to the type of resource and more attention to the number of dots on the hex tiles that make up the intersections.¬† The type of resource matters less than the frequency of obtaining them. After all, resources can be traded to the bank at 4:1 or at Ports for an even better return (see below).

**Early Game Placement Strategy:**

1. **Identify Your Goals:**
   - Know what you want to build and go after the corresponding resources.
   - Avoid overproducing resources that can't be used.

2. **Number Variety:**
   - Aim for an 8-5-10 placement with a secondary placement of 6-9-4.
   - Diversify your numbers to increase the likelihood of collecting resources on any given roll.

3. **Road Placement:**
   - Ensure your first roads point to spots on the map that you can move out to, even if the resource production isn't high.
   - Avoid pointing roads to resource-rich spots that opponents can easily block.

4. **Resource Focus:**
   - Consider starting with a 2:1 port of a plentiful resource present on the board.
   - Pay more attention to the number of dots on the hex tiles (frequency of obtaining resources) rather than the type of resource.

5. **Blocking Opponents:**
   - Place settlements and roads to block opponents from accessing high-value intersections.

6. **Trading:**
   - Resources can be traded to the bank at 4:1 or at ports for a better return.Evolve Counter: 4
