You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN. That means 10 victory points.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>
6. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively
7. Think about the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- üîç marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

Early Game Placement Strategy:
- Identify Your Goals: Know what you want to build and go after the corresponding resources. Avoid overproducing resources that can't be used.
- Number Variety: Aim for an 8-5-10 placement with a secondary placement of 6-9-4. Diversify your numbers to increase the likelihood of collecting resources on any given roll.
- Road Placement: Ensure your first roads point to spots on the map that you can move out to, even if the resource production isn't high. Avoid pointing roads to resource-rich spots that opponents can easily block.

Mid-Game Resource Management:
- Complementary Placements: Between your two placements, try to have access to each needed resource. For example, if you place on a Lumber-Brick-Wheat combination, your next placement should preferably have Ore and Wool together.
- Resource Shifts: The importance of certain resources shifts throughout the game. Bricks and lumber are important at the beginning for roads, while sheep and wheat gain importance for settlements, and ore for cities.
- Wise Management: Use the resources you have. If a seven is rolled and you have more than seven resource cards, you must give up half of them. Wise resource management is key to winning the game.

Late-Game Victory Point Optimization:
- Settlement Positioning: In the late game, focus on placing settlements anywhere you can for victory points rather than production sources.
- Longest Road and Largest Army: Pick up the Longest Road as late as possible to avoid becoming a target. Joining up two separate road segments with a big road-building push and unveiling 2 victory point cards can give you the win from 6 points.

Effective Trading and Negotiation:
- Win-Win Trades: Include promises not to place the robber on each other the next time it moves to make trades more beneficial for both parties.
- Goodwill: Build goodwill in advance of need. Think of goodwill like a bank that you build up and depletes when you use it. Building goodwill can manifest through taking mercy on a struggling player with robber placement, making many trades early in the game, or rationally explaining to someone you are robbing of resources exactly why you are doing it.
- Reciprocity: Use reciprocity to your advantage. Losing hurts more than winning feels good, so be mindful of how your actions affect future negotiations.

Development Card Usage:
- Hidden Cards: Use hidden development cards to scare away other players from blocking and stealing from you. Leverage the information asymmetry to drive your path to 10 Victory Points.
- Probabilities: The more hidden development cards you own, the closer your perceived probability is to the actual probability. Use this information to calculate probabilities more accurately.

Robber Placement Strategy:
- Target High-Value Hexes: Place the robber on high-value hexes like ore or wheat to cripple opponents' strategies.
- Avoid Lacking Resources: If you are lacking a resource, don't place the robber on it. You want there to be lots of it in the game so people will trade it to you.
- Strongest Opponent: Use the robber on the person in the strongest position, not necessarily the open points leader. Count unplayed development cards in someone's hand as points.
- Exclusive Targeting: Use the robber exclusively on your strongest opponent to avoid motivating more than one opponent to seek revenge.
