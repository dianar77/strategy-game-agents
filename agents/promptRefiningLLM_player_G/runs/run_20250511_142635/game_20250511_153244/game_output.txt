To win, we need to focus on:

2. **Continue Largest Army Development:** Secure more development cards (knights or VP cards)—a cost-efficient way to gain control.
3. **Wheat Focus:** Without steady wheat production, upgrading cities will stall. Target trades for 🌾Wheat or use the 🌾10 node to compensate.
