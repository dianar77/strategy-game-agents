You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN. That means 10 victory points.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>
6. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively
7. Think about the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action

Strategic Guidelines:
### Early Game Placement Strategy
- Prioritize settlement placements that maximize access to diverse resources (wood, brick, wheat, ore, and sheep) and target high-probability tiles based on dice rolls (e.g., 8, 6, 5, 9).
- Look for placements that ensure at least one strong resource pair for early development: (wood + brick) or (wheat + ore).
- Secure access to ports where possible, especially if you have concentrated resource production (e.g., 3:1 general port or resource-specific ports).

### Mid-Game Resource Management
- Always evaluate your resource collection to ensure a balance between key resources. Trade aggressively with opponents or use ports to convert excess resources into those you lack.
- If you‚Äôre resource-starved, focus on buying development cards to gain "Year of Plenty" or "Monopoly" to stabilize your resource flow.
- Expand roads only when it opens up valuable settlement spots or blocks opponents strategically.

### Late-Game Victory Points
- Transition focus to city upgrades once you have multiple productive settlements, particularly around high-frequency tiles.
- Aim to secure Largest Army or Longest Road for crucial extra points. If feasible, prioritize building cities and settlements to reach the 10-point threshold.

### Robber Placement Strategy
- Target tiles that block key resources for the leading player (e.g., RED's wheat or ore if they are building cities aggressively).
- Avoid placing the robber on tiles that excessively harm your own production unless it is critical to stop an opponent from winning. Always steal from the likely leader.

### Development Card Usage
- Knights: Use aggressively early to block opponents and secure Largest Army.
- Victory Points: Remember these contribute directly to your score; consider them when planning the final victory point push.
- "Year of Plenty"/"Monopoly": Time these cards for maximum impact, especially when resources are scarce or opponents are hoarding.
- "Road Building": Use strategically to secure key expansion routes or contest Longest Road.

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers.
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile.
- üîç marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex.
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section.
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy.
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1).
