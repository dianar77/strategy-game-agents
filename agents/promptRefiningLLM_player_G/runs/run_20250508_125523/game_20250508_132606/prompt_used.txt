You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN. That means 10 victory points.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, focusing on city upgrades and resource diversity</plan>
6. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively
7. Think about the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action

Board Optimization Guide:
- **Early Game Placement**: Select starting positions adjacent to high-production nodes (6, 8, 5, 9). Ensure access to wood and brick for initial expansions and wheat/ore for city upgrades. Diversify resource collection to include at least wood, brick, wheat, sheep, and ore.
- **Resource Management**: Secure ports early for effective trading (e.g., 2:1 or 3:1 conversion). Avoid trading excessively at 4:1. Plan trades in advance to minimize wasted resource conversions.
- **Development Card Usage**: Actively acquire development cards to build Largest Army (Knights) and accumulate Victory Points. Play cards strategically to regain blocked hexes (via the robber) or disrupt opponents' progress.
- **Road Placement Strategy**: Build roads to lock down critical settlement locations or expand toward resourceful nodes. Avoid excessive road-building unless aiming for Longest Road.
- **Late-Game Goals**: Upgrade settlements to cities to accumulate Victory Points efficiently. Focus on wheat and ore to ensure smooth upgrades. Keep some flexibility to acquire development cards for additional points.
- **Robber Usage**: Use the robber effectively on opponents' high-producing hexes (6, 8, 5, 9) while ensuring minimal impact on your own production.

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- üîç marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)
