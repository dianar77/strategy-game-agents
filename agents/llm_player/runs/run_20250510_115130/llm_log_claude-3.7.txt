PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN. That means 10 victory points.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>
6. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively
7. Think about the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

RESPONSE:
# Initial Settlement Placement Analysis

I need to choose the best location for my first settlement. This is a critical decision that will determine what resources I'll have access to initially. Let me analyze this carefully.

## Key Factors to Consider:
1. Access to diverse resources (ideally all 5)
2. High probability dice numbers (6, 8, 5, 9)
3. Potential for expansion
4. Proximity to ports
5. Avoiding blocking myself in

## Analyzing Best Spots:
Let me look at some promising intersections where multiple hexes meet:

### Node 17:
- Connected to 🌲4 (low prob), ⛏️8 (good prob), 🌲9 (good prob)
- Two wood sources but missing brick for roads, wheat & sheep

### Node 37:
- Near 🌲4, 🧱8, 🌲9
- Good brick and wood access for early roads
- On the 🐑 2:1 port path

### Node 3:
- Connected to 🐑5, 🌾10, ⛏️3
- Good wheat (10), decent sheep (5), but weak ore (3)
- Access to multiple resources

### Node 4:
- Connected to 🐑5, 🌾10, ⛏️8
- Very good probabilities (5, 8, 10)
- Good mix of sheep, wheat, and ore

### Node 0:
- Connected to 🌾10, 🐑2, 🌾10
- Double wheat (10) is valuable, but sheep (2) is low probability
- Limited resource diversity

### Node 15:
- Connected to 🐑5, ⛏️8, 🌲4
- Good mix with decent probabilities
- Access to wood, ore, and sheep

### Node 34:
- Connected to 🧱8, 🏜️-, 🌲9
- Good wood (9) and brick (8) for roads
- Desert tile means only two producing resources

## Best Options:
After careful analysis, I believe the strongest positions are:

1. **Node 4**: Excellent probabilities (5, 8, 10) with diverse resources (sheep, wheat, ore)
2. **Node 15**: Good mix with decent probabilities (5, 8, 4) and diverse resources (sheep, ore, wood)
3. **Node 37**: Good brick and wood access (8, 9, 4) for early roads

For my first settlement, I want access to high-probability diverse resources. Node 4 gives me sheep, wheat and ore with excellent probabilities, which will support development cards and cities later.

<plan>
1. Place initial settlement at node 4 for high-probability diverse resources
2. Second settlement will target brick and wood access for roads
3. Early focus on development cards with ore and sheep
4. Aim for largest army or opportunistic expansion based on resource flow
</plan>

RESPONSE:
# Initial Settlement Road Placement Analysis

I need to determine the best road placement for my initial settlement at node 4, which produces ore (8), sheep (5), and wheat (10) - all good probability numbers.

## Analyzing Available Options:
- [0] Road at edge (4, 15): Connects toward the west
- [1] Road at edge (4, 5): Connects southward
- [2] Road at edge (3, 4): Connects northward

## Considering Future Expansion:
Looking at each direction:

**Option [2] - Edge (3, 4)** leads toward node 3, which connects to:
- Ore (3) - Low probability
- Sheep (5) - Already have this
- Desert with robber

**Option [0] - Edge (4, 15)** leads toward node 15, which connects to:
- Ore (8) - Already have this
- Sheep (5) - Already have this
- Wood (4) - Low probability

**Option [1] - Edge (4, 5)** leads toward node 5, which connects to:
- Wheat (10) - Already have this
- Ore (8) - Already have this
- Wood (10) - High probability

## Strategic Considerations:
- I currently lack access to wood and brick, which are essential for early expansion
- Building toward high probability wood (node 5 connects to wood with value 10) would be valuable
- I should position myself to access different resources than my current settlement

<plan>
1. Build initial road southward toward wood (10) at node 5
2. Target second settlement at a location with wood and brick access
3. Early game: focus on building roads and settlements to secure resources
4. Mid game: develop toward ore/sheep/wheat for city upgrades and development cards
5. Look for largest army or longest road opportunities
</plan>

Option [1] gives me the best positioning for future expansion by opening access to the high-probability wood hex (10). This aligns with my need to secure wood for further expansion while potentially accessing other useful resources.
