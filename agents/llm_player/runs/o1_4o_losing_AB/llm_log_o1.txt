You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN. That means 10 victory points.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>
6. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively
7. Think about the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action

❓ Select action by number (0-49):


Based on this information, which action number do you choose? Think step by step about your options, then put the final action number in a box like \boxed{1}.
RESPONSE:
<plan>Prioritize an ore–sheep–wheat start to generate development cards and city upgrades. Placing on node 22 gives high-frequency ore (6), high-frequency sheep (8), and at least some wheat (3). From there, aim to trade excess sheep/ore for brick and wood to expand.</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN. That means 10 victory points.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>
6. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively
7. Think about the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

❓ Select action by number (0-45):


Based on this information, which action number do you choose? Think step by step about your options, then put the final action number in a box like \boxed{1}.
RESPONSE:
<plan>Securing both Wood and Brick early is vital for road building. Node 14 offers Brick (11), Wood (10), and strong Wheat (9), complementing our existing Ore (6) and Sheep (8). This balanced spread supports faster expansion and city growth in the next few turns.</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN. That means 10 victory points.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>
6. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively
7. Think about the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN. That means 10 victory points.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>
6. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively
7. Think about the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN. That means 10 victory points.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>
6. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively
7. Think about the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

❓ Select action by number (0-17):


Based on this information, which action number do you choose? Think step by step about your options, then put the final action number in a box like \boxed{1}.
RESPONSE:
<plan>Placing the robber on tile (1, -2, 1) blocks two of Blue’s cities on a highly probable roll (6), denying them a large influx of Brick. This also lets us steal a card and slow their city-based resource engine. From here, focus on gathering resources for more development, possibly upgrading a settlement or building roads toward a port.</plan>

\boxed{8}
========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN. That means 10 victory points.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>
6. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively
7. Think about the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action

❓ Select action by number (0-17):


Based on this information, which action number do you choose? Think step by step about your options, then put the final action number in a box like \boxed{1}.
RESPONSE:
<plan>We want to slow Blue’s strongest production. Currently the robber is on the 6 brick tile, but Blue also heavily profits from the 8 ore tile at (2, -2, 0). Moving the robber there both blocks a high-probability resource and lets us steal from Blue.</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN. That means 10 victory points.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>
6. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively
7. Think about the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

❓ Select action by number (0-10):


Based on this information, which action number do you choose? Think step by step about your options, then put the final action number in a box like \boxed{1}.
RESPONSE:
<plan>Use the Road Building card to place two free roads toward key expansion spots (e.g., toward node 13 for a strong wheat location and toward node 36 for a potential wheat port). Then gather resources to build a settlement and ultimately convert strong wheat production into cities or further trades.</plan>

\boxed{0}
========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN. That means 10 victory points.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>
6. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively
7. Think about the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)
