PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN. That means 10 victory points.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>
6. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively
7. Think about the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Analyzing Initial Settlement Placement

This is the first turn of the game and I need to place my initial settlement. This is a critical decision that will determine my resource access throughout the game.

## Analyzing Key Node Considerations
1. Resource diversity - ideally touching 3 different resources
2. High probability numbers (6, 8, 9, 5, 4, 10)
3. Access to ports for future trading
4. Avoiding resource overlap with opponent (RED player at node 20)
5. Positioning for future expansion and road building

## Best Node Options Analysis:

### High-Value Intersections
- Node 8: Connects to 🌾6, 🌲6, and ⛏️10 (excellent diversity with high probabilities)
- Node 7: Connects to 🌾6, 🌲6, and 🌾10 (two wheat, one wood, high probabilities)
- Node 23: Connects to 🧱5, 🧱9, and 🌾10 (two brick, one wheat, good probabilities)
- Node 27: Connects to 🌾6 and ⛏️10 (only two resources but very high probabilities)

### Node 8 Analysis
- Resources: Wheat(6), Wood(6), Ore(10)
- Strong probability distribution (6-6-10)
- Three different critical resources
- Good position to expand toward sheep port
- Not too close to RED's settlement

### Node 7 Analysis
- Resources: Wheat(6), Wood(6), Wheat(10)  
- Duplicate on wheat (less diversity)
- High probabilities (6-6-10)
- Access to wheat, which is needed for settlements and cities

### Node 23 Analysis
- Resources: Brick(5), Brick(9), Wheat(10)
- Duplicate on brick
- Near brick port for 2:1 trading
- Good but less diverse than Node 8

## Strategic Decision
Node 8 offers the best balance of:
1. Three different critical resources
2. High probability numbers
3. Good expansion options
4. Not competing with RED player's resources

<plan>
1. Start with settlement at node 8 to secure diverse high-probability resources
2. Build second settlement near a port or complementary resources
3. Focus on road expansion toward sheep resources which I'm lacking from first settlement
4. Target city upgrades early due to good ore access
</plan>

The best choice for my initial settlement is node 8, which corresponds to action 7.

RESPONSE:
# Analyzing Game State for Initial Road Placement

I need to determine the best road placement for my initial settlement at node 8. This decision will influence my future expansion options and resource access.

## Current Resources and Production
- My settlement at node 8 produces:
  - 🌲 Wood on 6 (good probability)
  - 🌾 Wheat on 6 (good probability) 
  - ⛏️ Ore on 10 (lower probability)
- I currently have no resources (this is the initial setup phase)

## Road Placement Options
Let me analyze each option:

**[0] Build a road at edge (8, 9)**
- Direction: Toward node 9
- Connects me toward the ⛏️ Ore (10) and 🧱 Brick (9) hex
- Leads toward the 2:1 Sheep port (nodes 28, 29)

**[1] Build a road at edge (8, 27)**
- Direction: Toward node 27
- Connects me toward the 🌾 Wheat (6) hex
- Could eventually reach the 3:1 port at nodes 25, 26

**[2] Build a road at edge (7, 8)**
- Direction: Toward node 7
- Connects me toward the 🌾 Wheat (10) and 🌲 Wood (6) resources
- No immediate port access in this direction

## Strategic Considerations

Looking at my current plan and the board layout:
1. I need to expand toward sheep resources which I'm lacking
2. Option [0] gives me a path toward the sheep port
3. I already have good wood and wheat production
4. Expanding toward brick will help with future road building

Option [0] aligns best with my plan as it opens a path toward sheep resources and a sheep port, while also giving me access to brick which I'll need for expansion.

<plan>
1. Build initial road toward node 9, moving in the direction of the sheep port
2. Focus on acquiring sheep and brick resources early
3. Expand road network toward nodes 29/28 for the sheep port
4. Build settlements at high-probability resource locations
5. Leverage my ore and wheat access for city upgrades
</plan>

# Analyzing Initial Settlement Placement

I'm playing as WHITE and need to place my second initial settlement. This is a critical decision that will shape the entire game. Let me analyze the board and available options systematically.

## Current Situation
- I already have one settlement at node 8, which produces:
  - 🌲 Wood on a 6 (good probability)
  - 🌾 Wheat on a 6 (good probability)
  - ⛏️ Ore on a 10 (lower probability)
- RED has a settlement at node 20 with access to Wood(8), Brick(5), and Ore(5)

## Key Considerations for Second Settlement
1. Resource diversity - need access to 🐑 Sheep and 🧱 Brick
2. High probability numbers (6, 8, 5, 9)
3. Access to ports (especially sheep port since it's in my plan)
4. Not too close to opponent's settlement

## Analyzing Best Options

### Option for nodes with sheep:
- Node 1: Gives access to 🐑8, but already close to my other settlement
- Node 3: Provides 🐑8 and 🐑2 (low value)
- Node 4: Gives 🐑2 (low probability)
- Node 13: Gives 🐑4 and 🐑2, plus ⛏️ Ore port access
- Node 29: Gives access to 🧱9 and 🐑 Sheep port (great for my strategy)

### Option for nodes with brick:
- Node 10: Gives 🧱9, ⛏️10
- Node 29: Gives 🧱9, near sheep port
- Node 30: Gives 🧱9
- Node 52: Gives 🧱9 and 🧱 Brick port

### High probability combinations:
- Node 29: 🧱9 + access to sheep port
- Node 10: 🧱9 + ⛏️10
- Node 30: 🧱9 
- Node 52: 🧱9 + brick port

## Decision Making
The most strategic choice appears to be node 29, which:
1. Gives me access to 🧱 Brick (9) - high probability resource I currently lack
2. Is directly adjacent to the sheep port (matching my strategy)
3. Sets me up well to obtain sheep resources and trade efficiently
4. Provides good board position away from the opponent

This location helps fulfill my current plan by securing brick resources and positioning me to reach the sheep port.

<plan>
1. Build roads from settlement at node 29 to reach the sheep port
2. Collect brick from the 9 spot and trade for sheep when needed
3. Focus next on expanding toward node 11 for additional brick and ore access
4. Build settlements at high-probability locations
5. Leverage my brick, ore and wheat access for city upgrades
</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN. That means 10 victory points.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>
6. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively
7. Think about the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

Here is the current game state:

TURN 1 | Player: WHITE | Action: BUILD_INITIAL_ROAD

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Build roads from settlement at node 29 to reach the sheep port
2. Collect brick from the 9 spot and trade for sheep when needed
3. Focus next on expanding toward node 11 for additional brick and ore access
4. Build settlements at high-probability locations
5. Leverage my brick, ore and wheat access for city upgrades
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.

❓ Select action by number (0-2):


Based on this information, which action number do you choose? Think step by step about your options, then put the final action number in a box like \boxed{1}.
RESPONSE:
I'm analyzing the game state to choose which road segment to build for my initial road placement.

First, let me understand my current situation:
- I have 2 settlements: one at node 8 (produces wood, wheat, and ore) and one at node 29 (produces brick and ore)
- I already have 1 road at edge (8, 9)
- My current plan focuses on building toward the sheep port from node 29
- I have 1 brick and 1 ore in my inventory, but I'll need wood and brick to build roads

Let me examine the three road options:
1. [0] Build road at edge (28, 29): This would connect my settlement at node 29 toward the sheep port at node 28
2. [1] Build road at edge (10, 29): This extends inland from node 29 toward the brick (9) and desert hexes
3. [2] Build road at edge (29, 30): This extends toward nodes 30-32, potentially reaching the ore port at nodes 32-33

Since this is the initial road placement (I don't need resources for it), I should choose the most strategically advantageous road.

Looking at my current plan, I want to build toward the sheep port from my settlement at node 29. The sheep port is at nodes 28, 29, and edge (28, 29) connects directly to it. This aligns with my first strategic goal and gives me immediate access to the 2:1 sheep port.

This is the optimal choice as:
1. It gives me immediate port access (2:1 sheep)
2. It follows my current plan
3. It positions me well for future expansion

<plan>
1. Continue building roads from node 28 to reach good settlement locations like nodes 27, 26
2. Focus on utilizing my brick production (9 spot) and trade for needed resources
3. Next expand toward node 11 for additional brick access
4. Build settlements at high-probability locations
5. Leverage my brick, ore and wheat access for city upgrades
</plan>
