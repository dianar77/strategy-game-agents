PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN. That means 10 victory points.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>
6. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively
7. Think about the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action

❓ Select action by number (0-53):


Based on this information, which action number do you choose? Think step by step about your options, then put the final action number in a box like \boxed{1}.
RESPONSE:
To determine the best initial settlement location, we need to consider the following factors:
1. **Resource Distribution**: Aim for a variety of resources to ensure balanced production.
2. **Dice Numbers**: Higher probability numbers (5, 6, 8, 9) are preferable for consistent resource production.
3. **Port Access**: Proximity to ports can facilitate better trading opportunities.
4. **Future Expansion**: Consider nodes that allow for strategic expansion and road building.

Let's analyze a few promising nodes:

- **Node 11**: Access to ⛏️3, 🌲9, 🧱8, and 🌾10. This node offers a good mix of resources and high dice numbers.
- **Node 29**: Access to ⛏️3, ⛏️11, and 🐑8. This node has good ore production and a sheep port nearby.
- **Node 32**: Access to ⛏️3, 🌲9, and 🐑8. This node also has a 2:1 sheep port.
- **Node 34**: Access to 🌲9, 🌾5, and 🐑4. This node has a good mix of resources and access to an ore port.

Among these, **Node 11** stands out due to its diverse resource access and high probability dice numbers. It also allows for potential expansion towards the center of the board and access to multiple ports in the future.

<plan>Build the initial settlement at node 11, then focus on expanding towards nodes that offer a mix of resources and access to ports. Prioritize building roads towards high-probability dice numbers.</plan>

Therefore, the chosen action number is $\boxed{11}$.

❓ Select action by number (0-2):


Based on this information, which action number do you choose? Think step by step about your options, then put the final action number in a box like \boxed{1}.
RESPONSE:
To decide on the best action, let's analyze the current game state and the available options step by step:

1. **Current Plan**: The plan is to build the initial settlement at node 11, then focus on expanding towards nodes that offer a mix of resources and access to ports. Prioritize building roads towards high-probability dice numbers.

2. **Current Resources and Buildings**:
   - WHITE has a settlement at node 11, which produces 🧱8, ⛏️3, and 🌲9.
   - No roads have been built yet.

3. **Available Actions**:
   - [0] Build a road at edge (11, 12)
   - [1] Build a road at edge (10, 11)
   - [2] Build a road at edge (11, 32)

4. **Strategic Considerations**:
   - **Edge (11, 12)**: This road would lead towards the 🌲9 tile, which is a high-probability resource and already part of the settlement's production. It also connects to node 12, which is adjacent to the 🧱8 tile, another high-probability resource.
   - **Edge (10, 11)**: This road would lead towards the ⛏️3 tile, which is a lower-probability resource. It also connects to node 10, which is adjacent to the ⛏️11 tile, another ore resource.
   - **Edge (11, 32)**: This road would lead towards the 🐑8 tile and the 2:1 Sheep port. It connects to node 32, which is adjacent to the 🐑8 tile and the 🌲9 tile.

5. **Future Expansion**:
   - Building towards node 12 (action [0]) aligns well with the current plan of expanding towards high-probability dice numbers and maintaining access to a mix of resources.
   - Building towards node 10 (action [1]) focuses more on ore, which is less beneficial for early expansion.
   - Building towards node 32 (action [2]) provides access to sheep and the 2:1 Sheep port, which can be useful for trading but may not be as immediate a need.

6. **Resource Collection**:
   - The settlement at node 11 already produces 🧱8 and 🌲9, which are high-probability resources. Expanding towards node 12 reinforces this production.
   - The need for ore is less immediate, and the 2:1 Sheep port can be accessed later if needed.

Based on the analysis, the best action is to build a road at edge (11, 12) to reinforce the production of high-probability resources and maintain a balanced resource collection.

❓ Select action by number (0-42):


Based on this information, which action number do you choose? Think step by step about your options, then put the final action number in a box like \boxed{1}.
RESPONSE:
To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the current game state step by step:

### Step 1: Analyze Current Resources and Buildings
- **Current Settlements and Roads**:
  - You have a settlement at node 11, which produces 🧱BRICK (8), ⛏️ORE (3), and 🌲WOOD (9).
  - You have a road between nodes 11 and 12.

### Step 2: Evaluate the Initial Plan
- **Initial Plan**: Build the initial settlement at node 11, then focus on expanding towards nodes that offer a mix of resources and access to ports. Prioritize building roads towards high-probability dice numbers.
- **Current Status**: The settlement at node 11 is already built, so the next step is to expand towards nodes that offer a mix of resources and access to ports.

### Step 3: Identify Potential Expansion Nodes
- **Node 12**:
  - Produces: 🧱BRICK (8), 🌲WOOD (9)
  - Connects to node 11 (already connected by road)
  - Access to 2:1 🐑SHEEP Port (nodes 32, 33)

- **Node 13**:
  - Produces: 🌲WOOD (9), 🐑SHEEP (4)
  - Connects to node 11 (can be connected by road)
  - Access to 2:1 🌲WOOD Port (nodes 48, 49)

- **Node 9**:
  - Produces: 🧱BRICK (8), ⛏️ORE (11)
  - Connects to node 11 (can be connected by road)
  - Access to 2:1 🐑SHEEP Port (nodes 32, 33)

### Step 4: Evaluate Resource Production and Port Access
- **Node 12**: Offers BRICK and WOOD, both high-probability resources, and access to the SHEEP port.
- **Node 13**: Offers WOOD and SHEEP, with access to the WOOD port.
- **Node 9**: Offers BRICK and ORE, with access to the SHEEP port.

### Step 5: Consider Future Expansion and Resource Needs
- **Node 12**: Provides BRICK and WOOD, which are essential for building roads and settlements. Access to the SHEEP port can help balance resource needs.
- **Node 13**: Provides WOOD and SHEEP, which are useful but may not be as critical as BRICK and ORE for early expansion.
- **Node 9**: Provides BRICK and ORE, which are crucial for building settlements and cities. Access to the SHEEP port is beneficial.

### Step 6: Decision
- **Best Option**: Node 9 offers a mix of resources (BRICK and ORE) that are crucial for early expansion and city upgrades. Access to the SHEEP port can help balance resource needs.

### Final Action
- Build a settlement at node 9.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN. That means 10 victory points.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>
6. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively
7. Think about the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

Here is the current game state:

TURN 2 | Player: WHITE | Action: BUILD_INITIAL_ROAD

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:

❓ Select action by number (0-2):


Based on this information, which action number do you choose? Think step by step about your options, then put the final action number in a box like \boxed{1}.
RESPONSE:
Let's analyze the game state and the available options step by step:

1. **Current Plan**: The plan is to build the initial settlement at node 11, then focus on expanding towards nodes that offer a mix of resources and access to ports. Prioritize building roads towards high-probability dice numbers.

2. **Resource Analysis**:
   - You have 1 🌲WOOD, 1 🧱BRICK, and 1 ⛏️ORE.
   - Your settlements produce 🧱BRICK, ⛏️ORE, and 🌲WOOD from high-probability tiles.

3. **Available Actions**:
   - [0] Build a road at edge (9, 10)
   - [1] Build a road at edge (2, 9)
   - [2] Build a road at edge (8, 9)

4. **Strategic Considerations**:
   - **Action [0]**: Building a road at edge (9, 10) would connect to node 10, which is adjacent to a 🐑8 tile and a ⛏️3 tile. This move aligns with the plan to connect to high-probability dice numbers and diversify resources.
   - **Action [1]**: Building a road at edge (2, 9) would connect to node 2, which is adjacent to a 🧱8 tile and a 🌲12 tile. This move also aligns with the plan but doesn't diversify resources as much.
   - **Action [2]**: Building a road at edge (8, 9) would connect to node 8, which is adjacent to a 🧱8 tile and a 🐑8 tile. This move diversifies resources and connects to high-probability dice numbers.

5. **Future Turns**:
   - Building a road at edge (8, 9) would allow for future expansion towards nodes with access to ports and diversified resources.
   - This move also sets up potential future settlements at nodes 7 or 27, which have access to various resources and ports.

6. **New Plan**:
   <plan>Build a road at edge (8, 9), then focus on expanding towards nodes 7 or 27 for access to ports and diversified resources. Prioritize building settlements at these nodes and continue to build roads towards high-probability dice numbers.</plan>

Based on the analysis, the best action is to build a road at edge (8, 9).
