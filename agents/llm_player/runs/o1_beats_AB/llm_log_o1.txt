❓ Select action by number (0-49):


Based on this information, which action number do you choose? Think step by step about your options, then put the final action number in a box like \boxed{1}.
RESPONSE:
<plan>
Focus on getting strong production of wheat and sheep early (both on the 6 roll) plus some brick for road-building. Placing our first settlement at node 17 achieves this balance. In the next placement, aim to secure wood (possibly an 8 or 9) to pair with our brick for faster expansion.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN. That means 10 victory points.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>
6. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively
7. Think about the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

❓ Select action by number (0-46):


Based on this information, which action number do you choose? Think step by step about your options, then put the final action number in a box like \boxed{1}.
RESPONSE:
<plan>Placing on node 13 gives us wood (8), ore (4), and wheat (10), complementing our existing sheep/wheat/brick production. That way we cover all five resources early and can quickly progress toward cities and development cards.</plan>

\boxed{12}
========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN. That means 10 victory points.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>
6. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively
7. Think about the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

Based on this information, which action number do you choose? Think step by step about your options, then put the final action number in a box like \boxed{1}.
RESPONSE:
Building toward the sheep port at nodes 35/36 is a strong plan given your heavy sheep production from node 17. Placing the road on (13, 34) sets up an easy route to that port.

<plan>Continue road from node 13 to node 34, then build toward nodes 35 or 36 to secure the 2:1 sheep port.</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN. That means 10 victory points.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>
6. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively
7. Think about the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN. That means 10 victory points.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>
6. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively
7. Think about the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

❓ Select action by number (0-4):


Based on this information, which action number do you choose? Think step by step about your options, then put the final action number in a box like \boxed{1}.
RESPONSE:
<plan>We need to avoid discarding if a 7 is rolled (we currently have 8 cards). Trading 4 wood for 1 brick reduces our total cards to 5, which keeps us safe from discarding. Also, having a brick on hand sets us up to build a road or settlement sooner (once we acquire a sheep). Therefore, trading for a brick now is our best move.</plan>

\boxed{1}
========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN. That means 10 victory points.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>
6. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively
7. Think about the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

With our current resources, it’s a strong move while we wait for enough ore to upgrade another city.</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN. That means 10 victory points.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>
6. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively
7. Think about the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

❓ Select action by number (0-16):


Based on this information, which action number do you choose? Think step by step about your options, then put the final action number in a box like \boxed{1}.
RESPONSE:
<plan>  
1. It’s best to roll before using the Year of Plenty or Knight, because we might draw the sheep (or ore) we need from production.  
2. After rolling, if we still lack sheep, use Year of Plenty for (SHEEP, WOOD) (or (SHEEP, BRICK)) to settle on the 2:1 wheat port (node 40/44).  
3. With the wheat port, we can convert surplus wheat into ore more efficiently and push toward our next city.

You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN. That means 10 victory points.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>
6. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively
7. Think about the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action

❓ Select action by number (0-5):


Based on this information, which action number do you choose? Think step by step about your options, then put the final action number in a box like \boxed{1}.
RESPONSE:
<plan>Use the Knight to remove the robber from my tile, place it on one of Blue’s high-production tiles, and attempt to steal a helpful resource. Next turn, aim to gather enough resources (or trade) to upgrade a settlement to a city.</plan>

\boxed{0}
========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN. That means 10 victory points.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>
6. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively
7. Think about the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN. That means 10 victory points.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>
6. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively
7. Think about the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

RESPONSE:
<plan>
Focus on quickly increasing VP by aiming for another city and/or a lucky development card draw. Buying a dev card now can yield a knight (to control the robber or block opponents), a potential victory point, or another useful effect (road building, monopoly). In the next couple of turns, gather or trade for the extra wheat needed to upgrade a settlement to a city (cost 2 wheat, 3 ore). Meanwhile, keep an eye on opportunities to expand settlements if a good node opens up or to leverage the 2:1 wheat port more effectively.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN. That means 10 victory points.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>
6. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively
7. Think about the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

❓ Select action by number (0-17):


Based on this information, which action number do you choose? Think step by step about your options, then put the final action number in a box like \boxed{1}.
RESPONSE:
<plan>Block Blue’s most productive city tile without harming our own production. Then continue expanding and upgrading to catch up in points.</plan>

\boxed{4}
========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN. That means 10 victory points.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>
6. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively
7. Think about the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN. That means 10 victory points.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>
6. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively
7. Think about the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN. That means 10 victory points.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>
6. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively
7. Think about the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN. That means 10 victory points.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>
6. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively
7. Think about the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

❓ Select action by number (0-5):


Based on this information, which action number do you choose? Think step by step about your options, then put the final action number in a box like \boxed{1}.
RESPONSE:
<plan>Upgrading the settlement at node 40 to a city immediately raises our overall production and adds 1 more victory point, bringing us closer to 10. Afterward, we can leverage our wheat port to secure missing resources for further expansion (roads, settlements, or another city).</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN. That means 10 victory points.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>
6. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively
7. Think about the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN. That means 10 victory points.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>
6. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively
7. Think about the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

We need both wheat and wood to build a settlement for the winning point. It’s more likely we’ll roll an 8 soon (which would give us wood), so first we’ll trade bricks for wheat. If we don’t get the wood from a roll, we can trade again next turn.

❓ Select action by number (0-5):


Based on this information, which action number do you choose? Think step by step about your options, then put the final action number in a box like \boxed{1}.
RESPONSE:
<plan>Our best immediate chance is to buy a development card hoping it grants a victory point. We can’t build a settlement or city this turn with our current resources, and trading wouldn’t solve the shortages quickly. Therefore, we purchase the dev card and hope for the winning VP.</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN. That means 10 victory points.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>
6. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively
7. Think about the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

❓ Select action by number (0-17):


Based on this information, which action number do you choose? Think step by step about your options, then put the final action number in a box like \boxed{1}.
RESPONSE:
<plan>We want to free up our own sheep-6 tile and block Blue’s higher-yield city tile without hurting ourselves. Moving the robber to Blue’s wood-9 tile accomplishes this best.</plan>

\boxed{4}
========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN. That means 10 victory points.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>
6. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively
7. Think about the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

<plan>Our best immediate path to 10 VPs is to prepare a new settlement on the Brick Port. We already have enough Brick production to make a 2:1 Brick Port valuable for trading. By building toward node 47 from our existing settlement at 43, we can place a settlement there on a future turn (once we secure Sheep and Wheat). That settlement would earn the 10th Victory Point.</plan>

❓ Select action by number (0-14):


Based on this information, which action number do you choose? Think step by step about your options, then put the final action number in a box like \boxed{1}.
RESPONSE:
<plan>Continue expanding toward the brick port by connecting node 43 to node 21, then head toward 45 or 47 for a new settlement. That will allow 2:1 trades on brick and secure the final victory point.</plan>
\boxed{10}
========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN. That means 10 victory points.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>
6. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively
7. Think about the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)
