Updated plan: 1. Begin building toward the Largest Army (requires 2 more Knights for an additional 2 Victory Points).
2. Target settlement expansion by building roads first toward Node **13** (adjacent to 🐑3 and 🌾8), which gives good resource production synergy.
3. Upgrade settlements into cities, particularly at Node **3** (high-yield 🌾8 tile). 
4. Leverage the robber to disrupt RED’s critical resources (🌾8, ⛏️6) while avoiding retaliation from weaker tiles (🐑3, 🧱9).
