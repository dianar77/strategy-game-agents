<Document href="https://blog.colonist.io/guide-to-catan-starting-strategies/"/>
Overall, placing your starting settlements wisely will give you a huge advantage in Settlers of Catan. But this is just one of the many strategies that can be employed in the game.

It is very hard to employ all these tactics in every game though, as the board is arranged randomly by the system and your neighbors choices restrict yours.

However, having a good grasp of starting positions and initial placements will help greatly in winning you your next Colonist game. [...] Of course, this is highly contextual and will depend on each game session.

However, looking at your opponents’ spots might just open up opportunities that were not visible to you before.

For example, if all the Bricks on the board are on low-yield numbers like 2-3-4, then that’s a rare resource. Work on acquiring them early on.

5. Work on Expansion as Your Main Focus

Settlers of Catan is a game of conquest. Gaining as much territory as possible is one of the essentials in winning the game. [...] 6. Ports for High Concentration of the Same Resource

Waterfront properties are valuable. Both in real life and in Settlers of Catan.

Owning one makes the bank love you. To the point that they’ll be willing to trade for less resources.

This is why ports play an important role in The Settlers of Catan.

Having the ability to trade 2:1 can win your game, so looking at the available ports on the board during your first placement is critical.

<Document href="https://medium.com/@noahmiller400/ultimate-strategy-guide-to-starting-settlements-in-catan-2a55be1819be"/>
As a rule of thumb, during your first settlement placement, it’s usually best not to point your road toward the middle of the board. You will likely have no expansion spots since everyone will start toward the middle, rather than the coast.
Anytime your road is in a contestable direction, make sure you’re the one cutting someone off or are more likely to win the race — not the other way around.

Thing Two: Catan is won by having ten points.  Those first two Settlements you placed before the game really started?  They’re worth one point each. That means Catan is really only about scoring eight Victory Points. Eight.  Make each point you score — and each point you prevent your opponents from scoring — count.
Be adaptable in your game plan and smart about each one of those points and, like me, you should find your chances of winning improving with each game.

Upgrade to cities before building settlements IF your settlement locations are secure.- It's often easier for the Producer to steal the Longest Road from the Explorer than it is to steal the Largest Army from the Commander or Developer.- win those races to juicy intersections if you want to win the production battle.- secure a balanced lineup of resources, with fairly similar requirements for wood, brick, wheat and ore (and at least some sheep). Developer: buys 12 development cards to get Largest Army and 2 victory points, builds 1 settlement and 3 cities.Producer: builds 6 roads, 4 settlements and 4 cities.Explorer: builds 10 roads to get Longest Road, 4 settlements, and 2 cities.Queen of Sheep: replaces all ore needs with sheep, plays Commander, buys 6 development cards to get Largest Army and a victory point, builds 2 roads, 2 settlements and 3 cities.

Use one road to build a settlement, and spider one the other direction. It's an efficient way to build 2 settlements while only making two roads

According to computer simulation tests, the best strategy for winning Catan is the Development Card Strategy.

6. What’s the Development Card Strategy?

The Catan Development Card Strategy focuses on ignoring wood and brick during the initial placement of settlements and instead prioritizing ore, wheat, and sheep. While it may sound counter intuitive, as wood and brick are essential to expanding your civilization, focusing on these higher-valued resources can be very lucrative. [...] Back in 2008, a blogger going by the moniker Brain did a study using the Development Card Strategy. They found that by falling the Dev Card Strategy, they won 64% of all games. What was most interesting about their study, was that the order of turns affects the outcome of the game. The winning percentage was higher when Brain played as the third or fourth player instead of the first or second player. Why? Most likely because of initial placements. Playing as the third or fourth player means [...] Need replacement Development Cards?Find them on Amazon. | 


1. What are Development Cards?

Catan is a game offering various ways to spend resources and obtain victory points, providing players with multiple strategic options. In addition to building roads, settlements and cities, players may also purchase development cards which add an intriguing layer of complexity to the game.

You should also make sure that you only affect one player with the robber. Affecting two players doubles the revenge factor, as well as doubles the motivation to move it with a soldier card. If only one person is affected, then the robber will probably spend longer on that spot. As a rule of thumb, in the early/middle game, you should place the robber on the player to your right. The reason is that it will spend more time there. The player to your right can’t take the robber off for two or [...] Once in a while, one of the above strategies for the robber may be correct. If someone has nine victory points, and a handful of cards, putting the robber on them probably is the best idea. At the end of the game, placing the robber is pretty easy to figure out. But, what about in the beginning of the game? What about the middle? Placing the robber in the early/middle of the game will absolutely have one intended effect – someone will not like you for putting it on them. If you’ve hit someone [...] THE ROBBER:  
You’re always supposed to place the robber on the person with the most victory points, right? Or, wait, you’re supposed to place it on a 6 or 8 so that it takes out someone’s best number, correct? Or was it that you should try to put it so that it affects as many people as possible? And of course, you never want to put the robber on someone holding development cards because they probably have a soldier, and they’ll just put it right back on you won’t they?

- try to avoid trading down to just a few cards with the bank and being stuck unable to build. Chances are, you're doing so for a resource you're finding hard to get and therefore other players will know they can disproportionately hurt you with the robber if they steal it.

- preserve juicy settlement locations with judicious road placement. Lock up that port that's critical to your strategy early. Nothing more infuriating than having an opponent beat you to it. [...] - if you are lacking a resource, don't place the robber on it. You want there to be lots of it in the game so people will trade it to you. Instead, place it on a resource that you have a lot of so you can increase your probability of trading for what you need.

Step 7: Commander [...] - block what that opponent needs, rather than their highest producing tile. Their city on the 8 of ore just got hit twice - tempting target, right? Wrong. Block their 4 of wheat instead.

- if your opponents are all similarly positioned, hitting the person to your right (on a tile that they exclusively benefit from) will ensure the robber sits there for as long as possible without retaliation. If they try to get you back you may be able to respond immediately.

We experimented with Reinforcement Learning based approaches to achieve a reasonable playing ability in the Catan board game. We aim to improve upon the performance of the strongest strategy developed by Collazo, the Alpha Beta Pruning algorithm. We retrieve the final reward based on the win or loss outcome of the game. By simulating thousands of games against the Alpha Beta strategy, we learn the value of context dependent actions. Finally, we deploy trained models in an MCTS algorithm and [...] 4.6 Model Training Before we can use MCTS, we wanted to first establish a strong baseline, as written in the AlphaGo paper [8]. But, as we don’t have any human expert data to work with, we instead decided to use training data from execution of the Alpha Beta Pruning algorithm, the best performing player within the catanatron repository. Therefore, each of our models was trained by playing 10000 games against 6 the Alpha Beta player in an epsilon greedy training strategy. The first 1000 games

The last tool in the arsenal was to try and add “search” to the ValueFunctionPlayer. There was only one slight modification that I did to the standard Alpha-Beta Pruning algorithm, which was to take the expected value of the children when propagating values up the tree. This was to account the uncertainty in dice rolls, buying development cards, and stealing.

    new_text: You are playing Settlers of Catan as a strategic AI. Your objective is to win against AlphaBetaPlayer who uses a depth-2 alpha-beta search algorithm.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN. That means 10 victory points.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>
6. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively
7. Think about the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action

Initial Placement Strategy:
- Focus on accessing high-probability resource numbers (6, 8, 5, 9) with diverse resource types
- Prioritize wheat and ore access for the development card and city upgrade strategy
- Consider placing settlements near potential expansion points that others might not reach quickly
- Take into account port access, especially 2:1 ports for resources you expect to produce abundantly

Mid-Game Resource Management:
- Maintain a balanced resource portfolio, but favor wheat and ore for city upgrades and development cards
- Keep your hand size under 7 when possible to avoid losing half your resources to the robber
- Plan for scarcity - if a key resource seems hard to get, secure a trading port or plan trades accordingly
- When choosing between settlement or city, calculate the resource production ROI over the next 3-5 turns

Development Card Strategy:
- Purchase development cards when you have excess sheep, wheat, and ore
- Knights provide three benefits: moving the robber, building toward Largest Army (2 VPs), and surprising opponents
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn to maintain strategic advantage
- Use Road Building cards to make unexpected expansion moves that opponents can't anticipate

Robber Placement Strategy:
- In early game, place the robber on high-probability tiles (6, 8) that benefit the leading opponent
- When possible, target the player to your right with the robber to maximize its duration
- Block resources that opponents critically need, not just their highest-yielding tiles
- In late game, always target the player closest to winning (especially with 7-9 points)

Trading Strategy:
- Avoid revealing your strategy through your trade requests
- Make trades that advance your immediate goals while being fair enough that opponents accept
- When ahead, trade conservatively; when behind, take calculated risks with trades
- Use bank/port trades when regular trading would reveal too much about your plans

Victory Point Optimization:
- Track each player's victory points and visible resources to predict their next moves
- Balance visible points (settlements, cities, longest road) with hidden points (development cards)
- In late game, calculate the fastest path to 10 points considering all possible sources
- Consider stealing Longest Road or Largest Army as efficient ways to gain 2 points at once

AlphaBetaPlayer Counter-Strategy:
- AlphaBetaPlayer with depth-2 looks ahead only two moves, so plan beyond that horizon
- It likely prioritizes immediate point gains, so block its highest-yield expansion paths early
- It may not value development cards optimally, so this can be your strategic advantage
- Monitor its resource collection and block its best resources with the robber

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)================================= Tool Message =================================
