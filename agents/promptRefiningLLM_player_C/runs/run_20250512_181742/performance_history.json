Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions\n2. Your aim is to WIN. That means 10 victory points.\n3.

Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively\n7. Think about the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action\n\nInitial Placement Strategy:\n- Focus on accessing high-probability resource numbers (6, 8, 5, 9) with diverse resource types\n- Prioritize wheat and ore access for the development card and city upgrade strategy\n- Consider placing settlements near potential expansion points that others might not reach quickly\n- Take into account port access, especially 2:1 ports for resources you expect to produce abundantly\n\nMid-Game Resource Management:\n- Maintain a balanced resource portfolio, but favor wheat and ore for city upgrades and development cards\n- Keep your hand size under 7 when possible to avoid losing half your resources to the robber\n- Plan for scarcity - if a key resource seems hard to get, secure a trading port or plan trades accordingly\n- When choosing between settlement or city, calculate the resource production ROI over the next 3-5 turns\n\nDevelopment Card Strategy:\n- Purchase development cards when you have excess sheep, wheat, and ore\n- Knights provide three benefits: moving the robber, building toward Largest Army (2 VPs), and surprising opponents\n- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn to maintain strategic advantage\n- Use Road Building cards to make unexpected expansion moves that opponents can't anticipate\n\nRobber Placement Strategy:\n- In early game, place the robber on high-probability tiles (6, 8) that benefit the leading opponent\n- When possible, target the player to your right with the robber to maximize its duration\n- Block resources that opponents critically need, not just their highest-yielding tiles\n- In late game, always target the player closest to winning (especially with 7-9 points)\n\nTrading Strategy:\n- Avoid revealing your strategy through your trade requests\n- Make trades that advance your immediate goals while being fair enough that opponents accept\n- When ahead, trade conservatively; when behind, take calculated risks with trades\n- Use bank/port trades when regular trading would reveal too much about your plans\n\nVictory Point Optimization:\n- Track each player's victory points and visible resources to predict their next moves\n- Balance visible points (settlements, cities, longest road) with hidden points (development cards)\n- In late game, calculate the fastest path to 10 points considering all possible sources\n- Consider stealing Longest Road or Largest Army as efficient ways to gain 2 points at once\n\nAlphaBetaPlayer Counter-Strategy:\n- AlphaBetaPlayer with depth-2 looks ahead only two moves, so plan beyond that horizon\n- It likely prioritizes immediate point gains, so block its highest-yield expansion paths early\n- It may not value development cards optimally, so this can be your strategic advantage\n- Monitor its resource collection and block its best resources with the robber\n\nBoard Understanding Guide:\n- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers\n- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile\n- \ud83d\udd0d marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex\n- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section\n- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy\n- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)",
