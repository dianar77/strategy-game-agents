❓ Select action by number (0-2):


Based on this information, which action number do you choose? Think step by step about your options, then put the final action number in a box like \boxed{1}.
RESPONSE:
To make the best decision, let's analyze the game state and the available options:

1. **Current Game State:**
   - Your initial settlement is at node 3, which produces 🌾8, ⛏️6, and 🌲10.
   - You have no resources currently.
   - The robber is at (1, -1, 0), which is a desert tile and not affecting your resource production.

2. **Available Actions:**
   - [0] Build a road at edge (2, 3)
   - [1] Build a road at edge (3, 4)
   - [2] Build a road at edge (3, 12)

3. **Strategic Considerations:**
   - **Resource Production:** Your current settlement is well-placed to produce a variety of resources.
   - **Expansion Strategy:** To maximize resource production and diversity, you should aim to build roads that connect to high-probability tiles and potentially to ports.
   - **Future Turns:** Think about where you want to place your next settlement. Building roads now will set the foundation for future expansion.

4. **Analyzing Road Options:**
   - **Edge (2, 3):** Connects to the ⛏️6 tile. This is a good tile with high probability.
   - **Edge (3, 4):** Connects to the 🌲10 tile. This tile has a moderate probability and is a good option for future wood production.
   - **Edge (3, 12):** Connects to both the 🌲10 and 🌾8 tiles. This option provides access to two high-probability tiles and opens up more options for future expansion.

5. **Considering Future Turns:**
   - Building a road at edge (3, 12) allows you to potentially build your next settlement at node 4 or node 12, both of which have good resource production.
   - This road also keeps your options open for further expansion towards other high-probability tiles.

Based on this analysis, the best action is to build a road at edge (3, 12) to maximize future resource production and keep expansion options open.

<plan>Build a road at edge (3, 12), then focus on building the next settlement at node 4 or node 12 to maximize resource production and diversity. Continue expanding towards high-probability tiles and ports.</plan>

❓ Select action by number (0-12):


Based on this information, which action number do you choose? Think step by step about your options, then put the final action number in a box like \boxed{1}.
RESPONSE:
To determine the best action, let's analyze the current game state and our strategic plan step by step:

1. **Current Plan Analysis**:
   - The plan is to build a road at edge (3, 12), then focus on building the next settlement at node 4 or node 12 to maximize resource production and diversity.
   - Continue expanding towards high-probability tiles and ports.

2. **Resource and Node Analysis**:
   - Our current settlement at node 3 produces 🌾8[⭐⭐⭐], ⛏️6[⭐⭐⭐], 🌲10[⭐].
   - We need to diversify our resource production and ensure we have access to high-probability tiles.

3. **Available Settlement Options**:
   - Nodes 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 16, 18, 19, 21, 22, 23 are available for building a settlement.
   - We need to consider the connectivity and resource production of these nodes.

4. **Strategic Considerations**:
   - Node 6 is adjacent to 🌲10 and 🌾8, which are high-probability tiles.
   - Node 7 is adjacent to 🌾8 and 🌲10, which are also high-probability tiles.
   - Node 8 is adjacent to 🌾8 and 🌲10, which are high-probability tiles.
   - Node 13 is adjacent to 🌲10 and 🌾5, which are high-probability tiles.
   - Node 16 is adjacent to 🌾5 and 🌲10, which are high-probability tiles.
   - Node 18 is adjacent to 🌾5 and 🌲10, which are high-probability tiles.
   - Node 19 is adjacent to 🌾5 and 🌲10, which are high-probability tiles.
   - Node 21 is adjacent to 🌾5 and 🌲10, which are high-probability tiles.
   - Node 22 is adjacent to 🌾5 and 🌲10, which are high-probability tiles.
   - Node 23 is adjacent to 🌾5 and 🌲10, which are high-probability tiles.

5. **Best Option**:
   - Node 13 is a strong candidate because it is adjacent to two high-probability tiles (🌲10 and 🌾5) and it diversifies our resource production.
   - Building at node 13 also aligns with our plan to expand towards high-probability tiles and ports.

6. **Action Selection**:
   - The best action is to build a settlement at node 13.

Therefore, the chosen action number is:

$$\boxed{6}$$
