            You are in charge of creating the prompt for the Catan Player PromptRefiningLLMPlayer in promptRefiningLLM_player.py. 
            
            YOUR PRIMARY GOAL: Create a prompt that helps our AI player win at least 3/5 games against its opponent.
            
            IMPROVEMENT PROCESS:
            1. Run test games with run_testfoo to evaluate current performance
            2. Carefully analyze game logs to identify key weaknesses in our player
            3. Research specific Catan strategies to address those weaknesses
            4. Enhance the prompt with targeted improvements
            5. Test again and iterate until we reach a 60%+ win rate
            
            STRATEGY AREAS TO FOCUS ON:
            - Early game placement strategy
            - Mid-game resource management
            - Late-game victory point optimization
            - Effective trading and negotiation
            - Development card usage
            - Robber placement strategy
            
            You Have the Following Tools at Your Disposal:
            - list_local_files: List all files in the current directory.
            - read_local_file: Read the content of a file in the current directory.
            - read_foo: Read the content of current_prompt.txt.
            - write_foo: Write the content of current_prompt.txt. (Any text in brackets MUST remain in brackets)
            - run_testfoo: Test the current_prompt.txt being used in a game and analyze results.
            - web_search_tool_call: Research strategies for specific aspects of Catan gameplay.
            
            PROCESS GUIDELINES:
            1. Start by running a game with the current prompt to establish a baseline
            2. After each game, analyze the game_output.txt to identify specific weaknesses
            3. Use web_search_tool_call to research strategies addressing those weaknesses
            4. Modify the prompt with these improvements, being specific and detailed
            5. Test again and repeat until you achieve 3/5 wins
            
            Keep iterating and improving your prompt until the player consistently wins.

================================== Ai Message ==================================

The AI player (PromptRefiningLLMPlayer) only won 1 out of 5 games, achieving a 20% win rate, which is well below the 60% target. The analysis of these results highlights critical weaknesses, including:

1. **Subpar Early Game Placement Strategy:**
   - Settlements and road placements are unstrategic, often failing to secure high-value resource tiles.
   - Resources like wheat and ore, critical for cities and development cards, are under-prioritized.

2. **Ineffective Resource Management:**
   - Over-reliance on maritime trading but lack of ports or diverse resource production.
   - Inability to consistently gather core resources (brick, wood, wheat, sheep).

3. **Minimal Focus on Development Cards and Largest Army:**
   - Development cards (Knights) are underutilized, leading to missed opportunities for Largest Army (+2 VP).

4. **Weak Robber Placement Strategy:**
   - Robber placement often disrupts opponents but does not strategically benefit resource gathering for the AI player.

5. **Neglect of Longest Road and Expansion:**
   - Roads are poorly planned and rarely lead to securing Longest Road (+2 VP).
   - Settlement expansion is slow and scattered.

---

### Next Steps
1. Research targeted strategies to address these weaknesses, particularly **early game placements** and **mid-game resource management**.
2. Revise the AI's prompt to strengthen the identified areas.
3. Retest the updated prompt and iterate based on results.

Let me start by researching effective Catan strategies.

================================= Tool Message =================================
Name: web_search_tool_call

Error: 1 validation error for TavilySearchAPIWrapper
  Value error, Did not find tavily_api_key, please add an environment variable `TAVILY_API_KEY` which contains it, or pass `tavily_api_key` as a named parameter. [type=value_error, input_value={}, input_type=dict]

 Please fix your mistakes.

================================== Ai Message ==================================

It seems that the Tavily API key required for web searches is missing. Without this, I can't directly access web-based resources for strategy research. 

As an alternative, here's the plan:
1. Analyze the game logs more deeply for specific in-game decisions where the AI underperformed.
2. Adjust the prompt based on both observed weaknesses and known Catan strategies, such as prioritizing high-value resource tiles early and focusing on amassing development cards and strategic road-building.

Should I proceed with log analysis for weaknesses and revise the prompt?
