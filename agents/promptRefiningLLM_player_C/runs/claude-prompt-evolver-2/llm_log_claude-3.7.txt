The results of the recent 5-game test indicate that PromptRefiningLLMPlayer_C (BLUE) won three games but has notable weaknesses that need refinement to consistently defeat AlphaBetaPlayer. Here's the analysis of key areas for improvement and an action plan to refine the prompt:

---

### Weaknesses Identified:
1. **Early Game Placement Strategy:**
   - PromptRefiningLLMPlayer_C had fewer settlements than AlphaBetaPlayer on average (1.4 vs. 2.6), indicating inferior initial placement or failure to prioritize settlement building early on.
   
2. **Mid-Game Resource Management:**
   - The player overly relied on trading wheat, and its resource optimization during the mid-game appears inefficient (e.g., delay in building settlements and roads).

3. **Late Game Victory Point Optimization:**
   - While BLUE secured development point cards (avg 1.2 VP), slower settlement and city building limited overall VP accumulation.

4. **Effective Trading and Negotiation:**
   - Trading strategy needs reassessment for diversity and timing (e.g., wheat may not always be the best resource for frequent trades).

5. **Robber Placement Strategy:**
   - Robber placement was overly focused on blocking RED's wood production. Expanding this strategy to target crucial hexes based on the game board could improve disruption.

---

### Research Strategy
I will research the following specific areas to refine the prompt:
1. Strategies for optimal early-game settlement placement.
2. Resource management strategies to balance trading and building.
3. Effective use of robber placement to disrupt an opponent's progress.

You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN. That means 10 victory points.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>
6. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively
7. Think about the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)================================== Ai Message ==================================

I will modify the prompt to specifically address the weaknesses noted in our analysis. The changes will focus on strengthening early game settlement priorities, improving resource management, refining strategic trading, and optimizing overall late-game victory point efficiency.

Additional Strategies:
1. **Early Game Settlement Placement**:
   - Prioritize high-yield resource tiles (e.g., 6s and 8s) and diversify resources to ensure a balance of wheat, brick, wood, ore, and sheep.
   - Aim for settlements near ports to improve trading options later in the game.
   - Avoid clustering settlements in low-value areas.

2. **Mid-Game Resource Management**:
   - Regularly evaluate your resource inventory and determine which resources are abundant or scarce.
   - Focus on building settlements and cities where resource production can multiply your gains.
   - Trade effectively with other players or ports to address gaps in your resources. Take advantage of ports whenever possible.

3. **Development Cards**:
   - Invest in development cards strategically; prioritize knights to gain Largest Army and monopoly cards to disrupt opponent strategies.

4. **Trading**:
   - Proactively trade to gain resources you critically need, but avoid trades that disproportionately benefit opponents.
   - Use ports to avoid unfavorable trades with opponents.

5. **Robber Placement**:
   - Place the robber on tiles with high production (6 or 8) that benefit your main opponent(s), especially if it's their crucial resource.
   - Prioritize blocking critical resources like brick or wood if opponents are close to obtaining Longest Road.

The logs suggest some distinct weaknesses in PromptRefiningLLMPlayer_C’s gameplay compared to AlphaBetaPlayer. While our player managed to consistently put strategies into action (like trying to block RED or focus on Longest Road), there are glaring issues:

### Key Weaknesses Identified:
1. **Early Game Placement Strategy**: PromptRefiningLLMPlayer_C is frequently losing even during the early game stages as it struggles to establish sufficient settlements and resources. It only averages 1.4 settlements per game compared to RED's 2.4.
2. **Resource Management**: The player lacks a clear focus on acquiring the necessary resources (especially ore and wheat) to upgrade settlements to cities. With an average of only 0.6 cities per game, its progress is slow.
3. **Robber Placement**: The AI’s robber placement focuses only on RED’s high-value resources without strategic variation for maximum impact.
4. **Trading and Negotiation**: There’s no evidence of resource trading, which may severely slow progress when waiting for specific resources.
5. **Development Card Usage**: Despite a slightly higher focus on development cards, the impact is minimal (average dev VP of 1.8), suggesting improper or suboptimal prioritization.

### Immediate Areas to Enhance:
- **Early Placement and Balancing Resources**: Focus on strong initial placements that secure diverse resource access, with priority on ore, wheat, and brick.
- **Mid-Game Resource Conversion**: Build roads and settlements more efficiently and consider resource trades to accelerate development.
- **Long-Term Strategy Adjustments**: Optimize choices for achieving Longest Road and Monopoly/VP cards from development cards.
- **Smarter Robber Placement**: Evaluate blocking higher-probability tiles that RED depends on, especially those enabling victory such as wheat for cities or brick for road expansion.

### Next Steps:
1. Research strategies for **early-game settlement placement** that ensure balanced access to key resources.
2. Analyze effective techniques for **trading, robber placement, and development card priorities**.
3. Update the prompt to incorporate insights and adjustments that improve early-game settlement and mid-game resource acquisition.

To start, I will research settlement placement strategies to improve resource balance.

You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN. That means 10 victory points.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>
6. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively
7. Think about the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)================================== Ai Message ==================================

### Update Prompt Plan:

To address the weaknesses identified and improve game performance, I propose the following additions to the current prompt:
- Emphasize the importance of **early settlement placement** that provides a balanced resource pool (priority on ore, wheat, brick).
- Reinforce **trading strategies** to address delays in resource acquisition for settlements, cities, or roads.
- Enhance focus on **development cards**, including using Monopoly cards strategically to gather critical resources.
- Use **robber placement strategically** to target resources that RED is relying on to secure victory points.
- Highlight the importance of **victory point-focused actions**, including Longest Road, Largest Army, and building cities.

I will now refine the prompt incorporating these targeted strategies.

Key Strategic Priorities:
- **Early Placement**: Focus on placing initial settlements to ensure balanced access to key resources, prioritizing ore, wheat, and brick. These resources are critical for cities and roads.
- **Resource Trading**: Actively monitor resource surpluses and shortages; use ports or trade with opponents to acquire needed resources efficiently.
- **Development Cards**: Invest in development cards often, prioritizing cards that can provide Victory Points or strategic advantages like Monopoly.
- **Robber Placement**: Use the robber strategically to block high-value resources critical to RED's progress (e.g., wheat for cities or brick for roads).
- **Victory Point Objectives**: Focus on actions that directly contribute to victory points, such as building cities, securing Longest Road, or achieving Largest Army.

The results reveal several key weaknesses in the performance of PromptRefiningLLMPlayer_C (BLUE) when compared to AlphaBetaPlayer (RED):

### Identified Weaknesses:
1. **Early Game Placement Strategy (Settlements and Roads)**:
   - BLUE often struggles to secure critical early-game intersections for wheat and other critical resources, compromising long-term production.
   - RED took advantage of strategic placement while BLUE lagged in expanding effectively.

2. **Mid-Game Resource Management**:
   - BLUE seems to rely heavily on port trades rather than efficient resource generation through settlements and cities.
   - A lack of access to crucial resources (especially wood and brick) limits road-building and expansion opportunities.

3. **Late-Game Victory Point Optimization**:
   - BLUE fell short on critical victory point paths like Longest Road and Largest Army, both of which RED dominated.

4. **Robber Placement & Strategic Blocking**:
   - BLUE isn’t maximizing the impact of the robber, often failing to slow RED’s progress enough to gain an advantage.

5. **Development Card Usage**:
   - Limited use of development cards by BLUE, particularly knights to secure Largest Army or other special cards for extra victory points.

---

### Immediate Plan for Improvement:
To address these issues, I will:
1. Research strategies for **early game settlements**, particularly prioritizing wheat/wood interconnectivity.
2. Enhance mid-game resource management by investigating efficient trading strategies for resource diversity.
3. Boost focus on strategic robber placement and maximizing its disruption to RED.
4. Research methods to optimize victory point attainment via roads, armies, and development cards.

To kick off improvements, I'll first research "early game settlement placement strategies in Catan, focusing on wheat and wood access."

It seems there was an issue with accessing the web search tool to research settlement strategies. I'll rely on pre-existing knowledge of strategic Catan gameplay for now and incorporate insights into the prompt. Afterward, I'll move forward with improving other key areas step-by-step.

### Updated Prompt Strategy Based on Early Game Settlement Insights:
1. **Prioritize Settlements on High-Value Intersections**:
   - Focus on intersections with high probabilities (8s and 6s) actively producing wheat, wood, and brick. These resources are foundational for early-game road building and settlement expansion.

2. **Balance Multiple Resources**:
   - Avoid being overly reliant on ports for trades by ensuring settlements provide access to multiple resource types.

3. **Limit Opponent Expansion**:
   - Position settlements in ways that restrict RED's expansion potential, targeting intersections where RED may aim to establish a stronghold.
   
4. **First Roads**:
   - Secure roads toward high-value intersections immediately after initial placements.

I'll now update the prompt with these adjustments and proceed by addressing one of the other observed issues.

Issues with accessing the web search tool persist. I'll continue by incorporating known strategies for mid-game resource management and trading.

### Trading and Resource Management Insights:
1. **Prioritize Essential Resources**:
   - Exchange surplus resources for those lacking but critical for planned expansions or upgrades.
   - Maintain a balance of brick, wood, and wheat for settlements and cities.

2. **Port Utilization**:
   - Ensure timely access to ports for efficient trades, particularly if abundant in a single resource type.
   - Aim for ports matching your highest production resource.

3. **Active Negotiations**:
   - Trade actively with opponents, targeting either mutual benefit or trades that disrupt their progress.

4. **Strategic Resource Hoarding**:
   - Stockpile key resources when opponents are reliant on them, leveraging potential trades or delaying their expansions.

I'll integrate this guidance into the prompt for better resource handling and then move to refine one last critical issue before testing.

The web search tool remains unavailable, so I'll incorporate known strategies for effective development card usage into the prompt based on prior gameplay experience and knowledge.

### Insights for Development Card Usage:
1. **Knights for Largest Army**:
   - Actively use knights to secure Largest Army, a valuable two-point victory boost.
   - Deploy knights to displace the robber from critical resource tiles or to block opponents’ key production.

2. **Monopoly Card**:
   - Save the Monopoly card for strategic moments when opponents hold a surplus of a single resource crucial to your progress (e.g., cities or road-building materials).

3. **Victory Point Cards**:
   - These are passive points; maximize their collection when the development card stack is rich in possibilities.

4. **Year of Plenty and Road Building**:
   - Use Year of Plenty to secure missing resources for immediate high-impact moves like settlements or cities.
   - Road Building should be employed to edge closer to Longest Road or strategic expansions.

5. **Development Card Timing**:
   - Purchase cards consistently when resources allow and use them at optimal moments to shift game dynamics in your favor.

I'll now incorporate these development card guidelines into the current prompt.

   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>
6. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively
7. Think about the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

Early Game Strategy:
1. Prioritize placing settlements at high-value intersections with favorable resource probabilities, especially wheat, wood, and brick (focus on 6s, 8s, or well-balanced numbers).
2. Ensure a balanced resource spread to minimize trade reliance early on and maximize production.
3. Consider placing settlements to limit opponent expansion and secure strategic intersections like ports or chokepoints.
4. Plan your first roads to ensure quick access to critical resource tiles or expansions.

Mid to Late Game:
5. Focus on upgrading settlements to cities once you establish a steady resource flow.
6. Target victory points through Longest Road or Largest Army, ensuring you're collecting brick/wood for roads or knights from development cards as needed.
7. Use the robber strategically to hinder opponents' production, prioritizing high-value tiles for your closest competitor.
8. Aim to optimize resource trades and port access where possible to accelerate progress toward victory points.
9. Leverage resource trades efficiently: trade surplus resources for those critical to current plans.
10. Utilize ports to streamline trades based on dominant resource production.
11. Stockpile essential materials in preparation for high-value moves like settlements, cities, or long road segments.
12. Actively trade with opponents to secure needed resources or subtly disrupt their strategies by limiting their access.
13. Development Card Usage: Use knights actively to secure Largest Army and block opponents' production via the robber. Deploy special cards like Monopoly strategically to gain large amounts of critical resources. Prioritize Year of Plenty and Road Building for impactful expansions and upgrades. Collect and reveal Victory Point cards as needed to go unnoticed by opponents.================================= Tool Message =================================

The game logs indicate that PromptRefiningLLMPlayer_C struggles in several critical areas and has been consistently outperformed by AlphaBetaPlayer. Here's a summary of identified weaknesses and potential improvements:

### Key Weaknesses:
1. **Early Game Placement Strategy:**
   - RED consistently outpaces BLUE because BLUE's initial placements lack resource diversity and strategic prioritization of high-probability hexes.
2. **Mid-Game Resource Utilization:**
   - BLUE struggles with resource management, particularly for building roads and settlements. Low road and settlement counts are evident.
3. **Robber Placement Inefficiency:**
   - While the robber is used to block RED, it does not consistently target RED's most critical resources (e.g., wheat or ore at pivotal moments).
4. **Development Card Usage:**
   - Development cards are underutilized. BLUE has minimal "Largest Army" progress and uses development cards sparingly.
5. **Trading Strategy:**
   - There is no noticeable trading strategy to compensate for resource shortages.
6. **Road-Building:**
   - BLUE fails to effectively build roads to challenge RED for the "Longest Road" bonus.

### Immediate Improvements Needed for the Prompt:
- Prioritize weighted placement strategies that maximize good hex probabilities (e.g., 8s, 6s, and complementary resources like wheat, ore, and brick).
- Optimize mid-game resource focus (actively collect resources to maintain balance for roads, settlements, and cities).
- Make dynamic adjustments to robber placement by targeting resources RED depends on the most for their gameplay progression.
- Use development cards more aggressively for "Largest Army" or victory points.
- Introduce a systematic trading strategy that includes seeking trades for critical resources, comparing the net benefit to both players.
- Focus more on claiming "Longest Road."

Next, I'll update the prompt with actionable strategies. But first, I’ll conduct specific research to refine these areas.

Strategic Enhancements:
- **Early Game Placement:** Prioritize placement on hexes with high probability numbers (6, 8) and a mix of key resources (wood, brick, wheat, ore). Balance should enable roads and settlements efficiently.
- **Resource Optimization:** Maintain a balanced resource collection strategy. Prioritize resources required for key advancements (e.g., roads, settlements, cities).
- **Robber Targeting:** Use the robber strategically to block RED's critical resources (e.g., wheat or ore depending on their current needs), and steal effectively.
- **Development Card Usage:** Actively buy and use development cards to gain "Largest Army," defensive capabilities, or direct victory points.
- **Trading:** Seek advantageous trades to balance your resources. Be mindful of RED's needs and avoid giving resources critical to their progress.
- **Longest Road Focus:** Build roads systematically to claim "Longest Road" and deny RED its bonus points. Identify routes that connect optimal settlement-building opportunities.

Based on the game results, our player (PromptRefiningLLMPlayer_C: BLUE) showcased several weaknesses that need attention:

### Key Observations:
1. **Early Game Placement Strategy**: 
   - Lack of resource connectivity impacted mid- and late-game development.
   - Immediate emphasis should be placed on ensuring balanced resource access (wood, brick, wheat, ore, sheep).
   - Also, high-frequency hexes (5, 6, 8, 9) should be prioritized against AlphaBetaPlayer.

2. **Road & Longest Road Strategy**:
   - BLUE failed to claim Longest Road consistently. Building roads early and strategically expanding the road network to claim the extra 2 VP bonus should be emphasized.
   - BLUE’s inability to secure Longest Road made a significant impact on losing games.

3. **Development Cards Usage**:
   - Development card utilization is below optimum (e.g., knights for Largest Army, victory point cards usage, etc.).
   - Leveraging knights and Largest Army bonus should be given priority.

4. **Robber Placement Strategy**:
   - Suboptimal robber placement allowed RED’s consistent resource flow at high-frequency hexes (6 and 8 most likely).

5. **Trading & Negotiation**:
   - Ineffective trading strategy failed to compensate for resource gaps despite any port availability BLUE had.

### Next Steps:
To improve the existing prompt with targeted strategies, I'll research online specific strategies for:
1. Optimal early placement strategy (ensuring balanced resource access and frequency focus).
2. How to effectively expand the road network early in the game for Longest Road.
3. Development card prioritization, especially securing Largest Army and victory point cards.
4. Robber placement strategy during competitive play.
5. Strategic trading and negotiation tactics to counter AlphaBetaPlayer.

By incorporating these strategies into the prompt, we can refine our player’s decision-making.

I'll now perform specific web searches.

You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN. That means 10 victory points.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>
6. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively
7. Think about the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)================================== Ai Message ==================================

The current prompt provides a solid foundation for step-by-step decision-making but lacks specificity in several critical strategic areas. To improve performance against AlphaBetaPlayer, let me implement changes to address the observed weaknesses:

### Improvements to the Prompt:
1. **Early Game Placement Strategy**:
   - Add explicit directives to prioritize settlement placement aiming for balanced resource access and high-frequency hexes (5, 6, 8, 9).

2. **Road Strategy for Longest Road**:
   - Emphasize prioritizing early road extensions with a specific focus on claiming Longest Road.

3. **Development Cards Usage**:
   - Highlight the importance of knights to secure the Largest Army bonus.
   - Specify playing victory point cards only when approaching 10 VP.

4. **Robber Placement Strategy**:
   - Introduce targeted guidance for disrupting opponents, especially those with high-frequency hexes or resource monopolies.

5. **Trading and Negotiation**:
   - Encourage trades to compensate for resource gaps, emphasizing the use of ports.

7. Think about the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action

### Strategic Priorities:

**1. Early Game Placement Strategy:**
- Prioritize settlements that provide access to a balanced variety of resources (wood, brick, wheat, ore, and sheep).
- Target hexes with high dice frequency (5, 6, 8, 9) to maximize production.
- Ensure at least one early settlement near a port, especially if resource production is unbalanced.

**2. Road Building and Longest Road:**
- Build roads early and strategically to claim settlement spots and the Longest Road bonus (2 extra VP).
- Extend roads toward potential resourceful nodes and port locations.

**3. Development Cards:**
- Buy development cards early in anticipation of knights to secure the Largest Army bonus (2 extra VP).
- Play knights to block opponent's resource production on critical hexes (high dice frequency).
- Save and play victory point cards only when approaching 10 VP.

**4. Robber Placement:**
- Place the robber tactically to block high-frequency hexes (6, 8, 5) of your opponents.
- Target opponents with the strongest resource production or those near victory.

**5. Trading & Negotiation:**
- Actively trade to balance your resource portfolio and build needed structures.
- Leverage ports for better trading rates (2:1 or 3:1), especially for excess resources.
- Avoid trading to help an opponent secure a lead.

### Additional Guidelines:
- Evaluate progress toward Longest Road and Largest Army bonuses constantly.
- Prioritize building settlements and cities in high producing regions.

- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex

You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN. That means 10 victory points.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>
6. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively
7. Think about the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)================================== Ai Message ==================================

Analyzing the results, PromptRefiningLLMPlayer_C is consistently losing due to a few prominent issues highlighted from the games:  

1. **Weak Early Game Placement Strategy**: Focusing on nodes with insufficient diversity and missing out on critical resources like brick and ore.  
2. **Limited Mid-Game Expansion**: The player struggles to build roads or settlements due to poor resource generation and trading.  
3. **Ineffective Trading**: The use of 4:1 trades is suboptimal and signals trouble managing resources effectively.  
4. **Robber Mismanagement**: While robber placement was directed towards breaking the opponent’s progress, it did not demonstrate an ability to slow RED down meaningfully.  
5. **Insufficient Development Card Usage**: Rarely using knight cards or leveraging development cards for additional victory points.  

### Plan for Improvement  
To improve the prompt, we need updates in the following areas:  
- Better early game placement that prioritizes brick, wood, and ore-rich nodes, considering diversity.  
- Guidance on how to chain actions for mid-game settlement building more effectively.  
- Smarter trading strategies to maximize resource efficiency and avoid unnecessary 4:1 trades.  
- Clearer instructions on optimal robber placement, targeting RED's key resources as effectively as possible.  
- Specific suggestions for using development cards strategically to counter RED’s progress and boost victory points.

I will now research these specific areas to refine the prompt.

## Here a log of results as they are found:

- We were able to create a Python package that implements the Game's core logic.
  No fancy networkX or numpy models, just good old Python objects and readable
  algorithms. Fully tested!

- We build a UI to go along with it. Not only useful for debugging, but if robot
  comes to life, we may want to allow users to play against it!

- WeightedRandomPlayer consistently wins to RandomPlayer.

- ValueFunction exposed that copying game with `deepcopy` is slow. Potential
  road block for Tree-Search algorithms (e.g. mini-max). Played OK. Too slow
  to benchmark really. Computed features.

- Started playing with DRL approaches. Threw away useful features (like production)
  and used RAW representation (someone said automatic feature engineering).

- Started with Policy learning using "Cross Entropy Method" here: ...
  Noticed we face class-imbalance. Infra was still inmature.
  Wasn't getting a meaningful LOSS, so scrapped it.

- Started with Deep Q-Learning. Seemed we were able to achieve a reasonable LOSS
  (MAE=0.05) on a "Discounted Return" with `DISCOUNT_FACTOR=0.999`. Played
  terrible tho. Not better than random (maybe actually worst).

- Tried Deep Q-Learning only on top-examples. Nothing interesting.

- Tried Deep Learning ValueFunction, and doing greedy algorithm on it. Won 63%
  of the games against RandomPlayers. Single-epoch, 32-batch, 75,000 samples.
  RAW Features. Games take around 30s tho.

  WeightedRandomPlayer:Qux[WHITE] [33] █████████████████████████████████████▊
  ```

- Using hand-crafted production and expansion features, we achieved 0.15 MAE.

- Using AutoKeras on hand-crafted production and expansion features yielded
  something like 0.01 MSE. But in performance, still played just like Random
  tho. Did not perform better.

- Got very good performance using VICTORY_POINTS_RETURN with 30GB data set,
  batch size = 256, batchnormalization => dense(64) => dense(1) value func.
  MSE loss, adam with lr=0.001,clipnorm=1. 1 epoch. Achieved ~2.0 MAE.

- First BoardTensor model seems to overfit (places on same nodes). ~200,000 params
  with less than 1,000,000 samples. Still, after normalizing wins 44/100 games
  against random players. NEXT: Try simpler model and more data.

- Second BoardTensor model (adam(0.001,clipnorm=1),
  input1 = 21x11x16 => batchnorm => 1 filter-cnn kernel=3 linear => flatten
  input2 = num-features
  model = input1 + input2 => 64 relu => 32 relu => 1 linear.
  MSE loss on VP RETURN. Batch=256, epoch=1, 2M samples.
  Performed comparable to simple 2-layer on 1M samples.

- We prototyped the Playouts Theorem. It indeed gives a good value function to
  play out random games from a given state. Pretty stable at at least 50 games.
  25 games there was some flakyness... (could stable out given we do this)
  many times. Takes around 0.3 secs to play a random game to completion.

- MCTS (doing 25 playouts for each possible action) wins almost every
  game against randoms, but it takes a while. And it seems some high-branching
  factor situations make it take longer (e.g. monopoly play, late road building).
  Here some results:
  AVG Turns: 301.6
  AVG Duration: 1024.1514820575715
  RandomPlayer:Foo[RED] [0]
  RandomPlayer:Bar[BLUE] [0]
  RandomPlayer:Baz[ORANGE] [0]
  MCTSPlayer:Qux[WHITE] [5] ████████████████████████████████████████

- It seems learning the simple problem of whether a player produces OWS
  works well with 1 filter of size 3, linear, unit_norm, and l2-reg. =>
  flat => 1 dense sigmoid. Adding a 0.2 dropout before 1 dense sigmoid
  seemed to help a lot to not overfit. Next steps would like to separate
  edges and nodes from channels (it seems it confuses these two), and add
  max-pooling in an attempt to learn hierarchy (OWS-node, variaty-node, etc...).
  Does EPOCHS help? EPOCHS=2 overfits. Well we get TRAIN_ACC=90%+,TEST_ACC=60%.
- No class weight, simple 1 3x3 filter CNN seems to learn, just needs more data.
- No class weight, using autokerastuner arrives at 96 neurons 1-layer 0.0001 LR.
  Achieves 57% accuracy (using log-loss as objective).

- Practicing on simple problem of given a 2x2 array, trying to learn to count
  the number of 1s. it performs well. With num-samples=100,000, epoch=1,
  2-32-relu layers gets mae: 0.6571, val_mae: 0.0301. Default Adam, with loss=mse.
  With 1 more order of magnitude of data, we can get 1 order of magnitude less error. (val_mae: 0.0034)
  Next steps:

  - Use auto keras to see how much better can we get.
    This achieved val_mae: 0.0496. Not much significant improvement.
  - Use CNN to see how it affects counting.
    This improves model to 0.009 mae (with 100,000 samples). note params increased
    from 4k to 65k (from normal NN to 32-filter CNN). 1-filter got val_mae: 1.3479.
    PROBLEM SOLVED!
  - Next steps: complicated by adding planes of random data. Does it confuse NN?
    Adding 3 extra random data layers, did not confuse NN. Still achieves mae~0.004.
  - Next step: Can we learn AND'ed points across channels?
    Seems that CNN behaves better here (1 3x3 filter) as expected since problem
    is translation invariant. AutoKeras yields a very deep model. DNN get to ~80%
    val_accuracy. CNN gets to 90%+. They seem sensitive to initial values tho.
  - Next step: Does adding random layers disturb the AND learning?
    Yes. It seems CNN have trouble with noisy channels.
  - Next step: What if we add some 2s as well... (here we prove we could learn count-vp-problem)
    Yes. Can learn (without noise channels), to val_mae: 0.1147.

- We fixed a bug in the tensor board representation. Using only the first 13 planes
  allows a CNN to learn if a player has OWS successfully (88% val_accuracy). Results:

```

  - We achieve mae: 5.4591e-11, val_mae: 2.4891e-04 with a deep model on RepA,
    and DISCOUNTED_RETURN. But model doesnt perform well in games. 50 game
    epochs, aiming to use 1K games, but early stopping.
    loss: 1.2714e-20 - mae: 5.4591e-11 - val_loss: 3.2321e-07 - val_mae: 2.4807e-04
  - Similar results with Rep B. But it played terribly...

- Online MCTS is looking promising. Did a first run with a 1-neuron model (normalizing
  features), playouts=25, training everytime there are >1K samples in batches of 64.
  There was a bug in the data as well (was creating samples like root-node => mcts result
  for all branches, instead of branch-node => mcts result). It didn't win games,
  but there seemed to be VP improvement from 2 VP avg to 5 VP avg, in 100 games.

- A heuristic player plays better than WeightedRandom (but we have a memory leak).
  Memory leak was due to @functools.lru with copied boards.

- Simple MiniMax Algorithm takes too long... ~20segs per decision,
  which makes for 30 min games. Even if de-bugged the implementation seems pretty slow.
  As such, alpha-pruning doesnt seem wont help much (even if cuts time by half).

- Using PyPy (removing TF and other Python 3.9 features), speeds up playing random
  games by around 33%s. (1000s games w/CPython3.9 took 2m52s and 1000s games
  w/PyPy3.7 took 1m52s).

- Looked at RL Python Frameworks. keras-rl doesn't work with TF2.0, same with
  stable-baselines. Many undocumented or hard to use. Best one seems to be
  tensorforce. TF-Agents seems possible, but pretty raw API right now.
  Hard to use tensorforce because not clear how to specify Rep B mixed model.

- VictoryPoint player is better than Random (much better) and WeightedRandom (not so much).

- Where able to do a somewhat strong NN with clipnorm=1, 2 layers, 32 and 8 neurons
  batch norm of inputs and batches of 32. 7,000,000 samples divided in 10 epochs.
  Still this player doesnt beat hand-heuristic. (ValueFunctionPlayer). This used
  DISCOUNTED_RETURN. MSE as loss and LR=0.0001.
  `loss: 1.5084e-07 - mae: 2.1945e-04 - val_loss: 4.2677e-05 - val_mae: 5.0571e-04`

- Did a RandomForest, but data seems wrong. Played very poorly. Tried again with
  all Rep 1 features; no dice. Hard to analyze... Probably overfitted. Keeps ending turn.

- Scikit Regression player doesnt win, because just gets a lot of wheat production,
  builds roads to extend as much as they can (dont hold to build settlements),
  place robber on themselves, dont trade (same value); no hand-diversity features.

- Greedy (even when budgeted to run same num playouts as MCTS) does better than
  MCTS.

- ValueFunction 2.0 (using EFFECTIVE_PRODUCTION and REACHABILITY features) plays
  pretty strongly. Better than Greedy=25 and MCTS=100.

- AlphaBeta(depth=2) plays stronger than ValueFunction 2.0. Using VF2.0 as heuristic.

- Tried Bayesian Optimization to search better weights for hand-crafted heuristic,
  but seems too slow and inefective.

- Note: In a random game, 38.6% of actions are roll (action=0), 27% are end turn (action=5557).

## Future Work:

- Should probably try to do NN player with better tuning (more layers, different label).

- Interested in seeing MCTS play in real life. Should compare G10 to MCTS50

- Work on performance.

- Generate data as 1 Big CSV per representation. (samples + labels), (bt + labels)

- Idea: Make test-evaluation framework. Use gaussian optimization to find best weights.

- Attempt DQN Tutorial with TF2.0 Summary Module, to see progress. If works,
  adapt to Catan-DQN Tutorial.

- Paperspace: Dockerfile: Install catanatron, and Pipenv dependencies, so that we can
  experiment/play.py, have a Game in the Overview.ipyn and run a catan-dqn.py job faster
  (should only do when can confirm Data and DQN approach improves...).

- Simplify ROBBER_ACTIONS to "Play Knight" to player with most points.

- Learn from offline MCTS data, using Rep B. (Seems slow to generate MCTS labeled data).

- Use tensorforce (since TF2.0 compatible and DQN Agent will be bug-free).
  Seems hard because API is not too easy.

- Learn an offline DQN (using VPs) with Rep B. That is, use Reward as label (
  so that early moves don't get a 1)

- Consider implementing AlphaBetaPruning to speed up game. Although
  it seems speedup at best might be 1/2 the time, which still doesn't cut it.
  Unless we speed up game copying...

- Actually use MCTS result to improve network. Do online so that we can
  see progress.

  - Add epsilon-playing to ensure we are exploring space. (Well, I think the fact
    that we have random players fixed does this job for now, since we collect
    samples from their perspective as well).

- Play a game against Greedy player. Play against Greedy with look-ahead.

- Idea: Sum up "enemy features". Make it look like its 1 enemy.

- Try Online - DQN approach (using PythonProgramming Tutorial).
- Use Value-Estimator with a tree-lookahead alpha-beta pruning.
- Try CNN-action space. (i.e. BUILD_SETTLEMENT at 3 means plane-board-tensor)
- Try policy-learning and q-learning on simpler action space.
- Try Cross-Entropy approach (using only top X features and dropping END TURNs).
- Try AlphaZero single-neural network learning (state) => (value, action).

  - Use in tree-search (take N top actions to explore via RollOuts).

- Try putting in features back. Is this VPlayer better than Raw Features one?
- Can autokeras use tf.Dataset?
- Using autokeras with whole 1Gb dataset is better?
- Does playing against your V1 self, training on that, improve?
- Try Q-Learning but, iterate on playing, learning, playing, learning... e-greedy.

### Performance Improvements

- Separate immutable state from Board (Map?), so that copying is a lot faster, and
  can cache functions (say node-production) globally (across game copies).

### Toy problems

- Idea: hot-encode 5 layers per player (one per resource) to denote income and buildings.
  then use 3D convolution of size WxHx5 and stride=5 (to not overlap)
- An easier problem would be to count house/city VPs (only uses 1 plane). count-vp-problem.
- Next medium problem will be, guess wheat production (to see if combining the two planes).

## Catan State Space Analysis

- Each tile can be any resource = 19. So 19! resource-tile decisions.
- Each tile must be one of the numbers. So 18! (desert has no number)
- There are 9 ports so: 9! ways of ordering them.
  Finally, there are 19! \* 18! \* 9! boards in Catan. So like 10^38 boards.

Configurations states inside it are upper bounded by:

- Each player has at most 5 houses. 54 choose 5 are ways of putting all 5 houses.
  54 choose 4 are ways of putting 4 houses. Sum\_{i in [0, 5]} (54 choose i) = 3.5M.
  Actually, better ignore colors and consider all 20 houses. So:
  `sum([comb(54, i) for i in range(21)]) = 683689022885551`.
  Actually, including cities, then there are 9 pieces per player that can be in board.
  `sum([comb(54, i) for i in range(4*9 + 1)]) = 17932673125137243`
- There are 14 roads per player so 56 roads in total. 72 possible locations so:
  `sum([comb(72, i) for i in range(56)]) = 4722360822358286581300`

If we include number of cards that makes the state space much much bigger,
but in practice its a lot less (its rare for a player to have 20+ cards). So
just using the Board States we see there are:
10^38 boards. Each with 17932673125137243 \* 4722360822358286581300 configurations,
which is almost like 10^37, so we are talking around 10^68 just possible board-states.

In terms of cards-in-hand state. Assuming on average players have 5 cards in hand,
then out of the 19*5 resource cards we start with, we are talking about:
`comb(19*4, 20) = 1090013712241956540` (or 10^18).

Grand-ballpark estimate is ~**10^100** states in Catan. Chess is 10^123.
Go is 10^360. Number of atoms in the Universe is 10^78.

### Branching Factor

The following stats suggests the decision tree players navigate usually has
around ~5 branches, and very few times something huge like 279 branches
(trading options after a monopoly(?), late road-building card(?)).

```
Branching Factor Stats:
count    94010.000000
mean         4.643772
std          7.684072
min          1.000000
25%          1.000000
50%          1.000000
75%          5.000000
max        279.000000
```

### Average Num Turns and Num Decisions

1000 Random Games result in:

```
AVG Ticks: 959.049
AVG Turns: 275.261
AVG Duration: 0.18782643032073976
AVG VPS: RandomPlayer:Foo[RED] 5.851
AVG VPS: RandomPlayer:Bar[BLUE] 5.871
AVG VPS: RandomPlayer:Baz[ORANGE] 5.766
AVG VPS: RandomPlayer:Qux[WHITE] 6.086
```

So each player makes around 70 decisions per game. Averages around 5.9 VPs per game.

### Performance Bits

- Creating an array with `np.array` is much faster than `tf.convert_to_tensor` and
  `pd.DataFrame` or `pd.Series`.

```
In [1]: timeit.timeit("np.array(array)", setup="import numpy as np; array = list([i for i in range(1000)])", number=1000)
Out[1]: 0.055867002985905856
In [2]: timeit.timeit("tf.convert_to_tensor(array)", setup="import tensorflow as tf; array = list([i for i in range(1000)])", number=1000)
Out[2]: 0.20465714897727594
In [3]: timeit.timeit("pd.DataFrame(array)", setup="import pandas as pd; array = list([i for i in range(1000)])", number=1000)
Out[3]: 0.333771405974403
```

- Game.copy() took 45% of the time when using ValueFunctionPlayer (5.7s).
- 3/21/21 playable_actions is 50% of time when running random 1v1s.
  Accounts for 7s in a 14s 100-game run.

Time Estimates:

- AB2 takes 0.01 seconds per tick.

Settlers of Catan Bot and Bot Simulator. Test out bot strategies at scale (thousands of games per minutes). The goal of this project is to find the strongest Settlers of Catan bot possible.

See the motivation of the project here: [5 Ways NOT to Build a Catan AI](https://medium.com/@bcollazo2010/5-ways-not-to-build-a-catan-ai-e01bc491af17).

</p>

## Installation

Clone this repository and install dependencies. This will include the Catanatron bot implementation and the `catanatron-play` simulator.

```
git clone git@github.com:bcollazo/catanatron.git
cd catanatron/
```

Create a virtual environment with Python3.8 or higher. Then:

```
pip install -r all-requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Run simulations and generate datasets via the CLI:

```
catanatron-play --players=R,R,R,W --num=100
```

See more information with `catanatron-play --help`.

## Try Your Own Bots

Implement your own bots by creating a file (e.g. `myplayers.py`) with some `Player` implementations:

```python
from catanatron import Player
from catanatron_experimental.cli.cli_players import register_player

@register_player("FOO")
class FooPlayer(Player):
  def decide(self, game, playable_actions):
    """Should return one of the playable_actions.

    Args:
        game (Game): complete game state. read-only.
        playable_actions (Iterable[Action]): options to choose from
    Return:
        action (Action): Chosen element of playable_actions
    """
    # ===== YOUR CODE HERE =====
    # As an example we simply return the first action:
    return playable_actions[0]
    # ===== END YOUR CODE =====
```

Run it by passing the source code to `catanatron-play`:

```
catanatron-play --code=myplayers.py --players=R,R,R,FOO --num=10
```

## How to Make Catanatron Stronger?

The best bot right now is Alpha Beta Search with a hand-crafted value function. One of the most promising ways of improving Catanatron
is to have your custom player inhert from ([`AlphaBetaPlayer`](catanatron_experimental/catanatron_experimental/machine_learning/players/minimax.py)) and set a better set of weights for the value function. You can
also edit the value function and come up with your own innovative features!

For more sophisticated approaches, see example player implementations in [catanatron_core/catanatron/players](catanatron_core/catanatron/players)

If you find a bot that consistently beats the best bot right now, please submit a Pull Request! :)

## Advanced Usage

### Inspecting Games (Browser UI)

We provide a [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml) with everything needed to watch games (useful for debugging). It contains all the web-server infrastructure needed to render a game in a browser.

<p align="left">
 <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bcollazo/catanatron/master/docs/source/_static/CatanatronUI.png">
</p>

To use, ensure you have [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed, and run (from this repo's root):

```
docker-compose up
```

You can now use the `--db` flag to make the catanatron-play simulator save
the game in the database for inspection via the web server.

```
catanatron-play --players=W,W,W,W --db --num=1
```

NOTE: A great contribution would be to make the Web UI allow to step forwards and backwards in a game to inspect it (ala chess.com).

### Accumulators

The `Accumulator` class allows you to hook into important events during simulations.

For example, write a file like `mycode.py` and have:

```python
from catanatron import ActionType
from catanatron_experimental import SimulationAccumulator, register_accumulator

@register_accumulator
class PortTradeCounter(SimulationAccumulator):
  def before_all(self):
    self.num_trades = 0

  def step(self, game_before_action, action):
    if action.action_type == ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE:
      self.num_trades += 1

  def after_all(self):
    print(f'There were {self.num_trades} port trades!')
```

Then `catanatron-play --code=mycode.py` will count the number of trades in all simulations.

### As a Package / Library

You can also use `catanatron` package directly which provides a core
implementation of the Settlers of Catan game logic.

```python
from catanatron import Game, RandomPlayer, Color

# Play a simple 4v4 game
players = [
    RandomPlayer(Color.RED),
    RandomPlayer(Color.BLUE),
    RandomPlayer(Color.WHITE),
    RandomPlayer(Color.ORANGE),
]
game = Game(players)
print(game.play())  # returns winning color
```

You can use the `open_link` helper function to open up the game (useful for debugging):

```python
from catanatron_server.utils import open_link
open_link(game)  # opens game in browser
```

## Architecture

The code is divided in the following 5 components (folders):

- **catanatron**: A pure python implementation of the game logic. Uses `networkx` for fast graph operations. Is pip-installable (see `setup.py`) and can be used as a Python package. See the documentation for the package here: https://catanatron.readthedocs.io/.

- **catanatron_server**: Contains a Flask web server in order to serve
  game states from a database to a Web UI. The idea of using a database, is to ease watching games played in a different process. It defaults to using an ephemeral in-memory sqlite database. Also pip-installable (not publised in PyPi however).

- **catanatron_gym**: OpenAI Gym interface to Catan. Includes a 1v1 environment against a Random Bot and a vector-friendly representations of states and actions. This can be pip-installed independently with `pip install catanatron_gym`, for more information see [catanatron_gym/README.md](catanatron_gym/README.md).

- **catantron_experimental**: A collection of unorganized scripts with contain many failed attempts at finding the best possible bot. Its ok to break these scripts. Its pip-installable. Exposes a `catanatron-play` command-line script that can be used to play games in bulk, create machine learning datasets of games, and more!

- **ui**: A React web UI to render games. This is helpful for debugging the core implementation. We decided to use the browser as a randering engine (as opposed to the terminal or a desktop GUI) because of HTML/CSS's ubiquitousness and the ability to use modern animation libraries in the future (https://www.framer.com/motion/ or https://www.react-spring.io/).

## AI Bots Leaderboard

Catanatron will always be the best bot in this leaderboard.

The best bot right now is `AlphaBetaPlayer` with n = 2. Here a list of bots strength. Experiments
done by running 1000 (when possible) 1v1 games against previous in list.

| Player               | % of wins in 1v1 games      | num games used for result |
| -------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| AlphaBeta(n=2)       | 80% vs ValueFunction        | 25                        |
| ValueFunction        | 90% vs GreedyPlayouts(n=25) | 25                        |
| GreedyPlayouts(n=25) | 100% vs MCTS(n=100)         | 25                        |
| MCTS(n=100)          | 60% vs WeightedRandom       | 15                        |
| WeightedRandom       | 53% vs WeightedRandom       | 1000                      |
| VictoryPoint         | 60% vs Random               | 1000                      |
| Random               | -                           | -                         |

## Developing for Catanatron

To develop for Catanatron core logic you can use the following test suite:

```
coverage run --source=catanatron -m pytest tests/ && coverage report
```

Or you can run the suite in watch-mode with:

```
ptw --ignore=tests/integration_tests/ --nobeep
```

## Machine Learning

Generate JSON files with complete information about games and decisions by running:

```
catanatron-play --num=100 --output=my-data-path/ --json
```

Similarly (with Tensorflow installed) you can generate several GZIP CSVs of a basic set of features:

```
catanatron-play --num=100 --output=my-data-path/ --csv
```

You can then use this data to build a machine learning model, and then
implement a `Player` subclass that implements the corresponding "predict"
step of your model. There are some attempts of these type of
players in [reinforcement.py](catanatron_experimental/catanatron_experimental/machine_learning/players/reinforcement.py).

# Appendix

## Running Components Individually

As an alternative to running the project with Docker, you can run the following 3 components: a React UI, a Flask Web Server, and a PostgreSQL database in three separate Terminal tabs.

### React UI

```
cd ui/
npm install
npm start
```

This can also be run via Docker independetly like (after building):

```
docker build -t bcollazo/catanatron-react-ui:latest ui/
docker run -it -p 3000:3000 bcollazo/catanatron-react-ui
```

### Flask Web Server

Ensure you are inside a virtual environment with all dependencies installed and
use `flask run`.

```
python3.8 -m venv venv
source ./venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

cd catanatron_server/catanatron_server
flask run
```

This can also be run via Docker independetly like (after building):

```
docker build -t bcollazo/catanatron-server:latest . -f Dockerfile.web
docker run -it -p 5000:5000 bcollazo/catanatron-server
```

### PostgreSQL Database

Make sure you have `docker-compose` installed (https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

```
docker-compose up
```

Or run any other database deployment (locally or in the cloud).

## Other Useful Commands

### TensorBoard

For watching training progress, use `keras.callbacks.TensorBoard` and open TensorBoard:

```
tensorboard --logdir logs
```

### Docker GPU TensorFlow

```
docker run -it tensorflow/tensorflow:latest-gpu-jupyter bash
docker run -it --rm -v $(realpath ./notebooks):/tf/notebooks -p 8888:8888 tensorflow/tensorflow:latest-gpu-jupyter
```

### Testing Performance

```
python -m cProfile -o profile.pstats catanatron_experimental/catanatron_experimental/play.py --num=5
snakeviz profile.pstats
```

```
pytest --benchmark-compare=0001 --benchmark-compare-fail=mean:10% --benchmark-columns=min,max,mean,stddev
```

### Head Large Datasets with Pandas

```
In [1]: import pandas as pd
In [2]: x = pd.read_csv("data/mcts-playouts-labeling-2/labels.csv.gzip", compression="gzip", iterator=True)
In [3]: x.get_chunk(10)
```

### Publishing to PyPi

catanatron Package

# Contributing

I am new to Open Source Development, so open to suggestions on this section. The best contributions would be to make the core bot stronger.

Other than that here is also a list of ideas:

- Improve `catanatron` package running time performance.

  - Continue refactoring the State to be more and more like a primitive `dict` or `array`.
    (Copies are much faster if State is just a native python object).
  - Move RESOURCE to be ints. Python `enums` turned out to be slow for hashing and using.
  - Move .actions to a Game concept. (to avoid copying when copying State)
  - Remove .current_prompt. It seems its redundant with (is_moving_knight, etc...) and not needed.

- Improve AlphaBetaPlayer:

  - Explore and improve prunning
  - Use Bayesian Methods or SPSA to tune weights and find better ones.

- Experiment ideas:

  - DQN Render Method. Use models/mbs=64\_\_1619973412.model. Try to understand it.
  - DQN Two Layer Algo. With Simple Action Space.
  - Simple Alpha Go
  - Try Tensorforce with simple action space.
  - Try simple flat CSV approach but with AlphaBeta-generated games.
  - Visualize tree with graphviz. With colors per maximizing/minimizing.
  - Create simple entry-point notebook for this project. Runnable via Paperspace. (might be hard because catanatron requires Python 3.8 and I haven't seen a GPU-enabled tensorflow+jupyter+pyhon3.8 Docker Image out there).

- Bugs:

  - Shouldn't be able to use dev card just bought.

- Features:

  - Continue implementing actions from the UI (not all implemented).
  - Chess.com-like UI for watching game replays (with Play/Pause and Back/Forward).
  - A terminal UI? (for ease of debugging)
================================== Ai Message ==================================

Based on the lack of external strategy material through the Tavily API and the information from the local files, I'll focus on directly refining the prompt using some of the strategies for improving AI bots from the insights provided by the game's existing documentation and experiments, as well as general Catan knowledge.

The weaknesses of PromptRefiningLLM_Player_C include weak early-game placement, poor trading strategies, ineffective robber usage, and failure to adapt to mid/late game resource needs. I will now refine the prompt to address these issues systematically.
Tool Calls:
  write_prompt (call_xpeVRTzgNbksZ47kBrfLl6jJ)
 Call ID: call_xpeVRTzgNbksZ47kBrfLl6jJ
  Args:
    new_text: You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options. Use advanced thinking to dominate the game against experienced players like the AlphaBetaPlayer.

### Key Objectives:
1. **Early Game Priorities:**
   - Optimize settlement placement. Start by prioritizing nodes with high resource diversity (covering wood, brick, wheat, ore, and sheep).
   - Use expected resource output (sum of dice probabilities) to maximize production.
   - Secure access to brick and wood for early roads, and aim for ore and wheat for future cities.

2. **Road and Settlement Expansion:**
   - Build roads strategically toward high-quality nodes or ports for trades.
   - Expand to locations that increase your production diversity and trading potential.

3. **Resource Management:**
   - Regularly review your resource pool. Prioritize actions that use excess resources effectively.
   - Avoid unnecessary 4:1 trades—leverage ports or negotiation trades with rivals whenever possible.

4. **Robber Placement:**
   - Use the robber to cripple opponents who are leading or nearing key milestones such as cities or longest road.
   - Target high-production hexes of opponents, especially those producing brick, ore, or wheat.

5. **Development Cards:**
   - Purchase development cards when you have sufficient resource generation. Use them for knights (largest army), victory points, and situational strategies (e.g., year of plenty or monopoly).
   - Play knights strategically to regain blocked production or disrupt opponents.

6. **Mid/Late Game Transitions:**
   - Transition focus from settlements to cities once you have stable resource generation.
   - Identify opponents' weaknesses (e.g., missing resources) and exploit them through trades or blocking.

7. **Trading Strategy:**
   - Offer trades that benefit you asymmetrically more than your opponent. Use trades to get resources you lack.
   - Use ports as optimal alternatives to unfavorable trades.

### Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions.
2. Your aim is to WIN. That means reaching 10 victory points.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number.
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>
6. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively.
7. Think about the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action.

### Advanced Insights:
- Use probability to predict opponents' resource availability.
- Block winning players whenever possible, even if they are not immediate threats.

### Example Scenarios to Guide Decision-Making:
1. **Setup Phase:** If you have a choice, aim for [8,5,10] nodes over [3,4,11] for maximized long-term production.
2. **Limited Resources:** If you lack brick, prioritize trades or settlement placements to fix that gap, as it halts expansion.
3. **Opponent Targeting:** If RED is close to taking longest road, build to cut them off preemptively.
4. **Port Utilization:** If you dominate a port, build around resources you can trade at a 2:1 rate (e.g., focus on wood if you control the wood port).

I have refined the prompt to focus on improving early-game node placement, optimizing resource management, and targeting better strategies for mid-game expansion and trading. The advanced insights provided should better equip PromptRefiningLLMPlayer_C to counter weaknesses and adapt to opponents' strategies. Let's test this updated prompt by simulating new games to evaluate its effectiveness.Evolve Counter: -1
