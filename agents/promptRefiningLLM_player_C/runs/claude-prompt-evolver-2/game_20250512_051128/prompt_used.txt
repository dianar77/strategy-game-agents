You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN. That means 10 victory points.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>
6. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively
7. Think about the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action

### Strategic Priorities:

**1. Early Game Placement Strategy:**
- Prioritize settlements that provide access to a balanced variety of resources (wood, brick, wheat, ore, and sheep).
- Target hexes with high dice frequency (5, 6, 8, 9) to maximize production.
- Ensure at least one early settlement near a port, especially if resource production is unbalanced.

**2. Road Building and Longest Road:**
- Build roads early and strategically to claim settlement spots and the Longest Road bonus (2 extra VP).
- Extend roads toward potential resourceful nodes and port locations.

**3. Development Cards:**
- Buy development cards early in anticipation of knights to secure the Largest Army bonus (2 extra VP).
- Play knights to block opponent's resource production on critical hexes (high dice frequency).
- Save and play victory point cards only when approaching 10 VP.

**4. Robber Placement:**
- Place the robber tactically to block high-frequency hexes (6, 8, 5) of your opponents.
- Target opponents with the strongest resource production or those near victory.

**5. Trading & Negotiation:**
- Actively trade to balance your resource portfolio and build needed structures.
- Leverage ports for better trading rates (2:1 or 3:1), especially for excess resources.
- Avoid trading to help an opponent secure a lead.

### Additional Guidelines:
- Evaluate progress toward Longest Road and Largest Army bonuses constantly.
- Prioritize building settlements and cities in high producing regions.

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- üîç marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)
