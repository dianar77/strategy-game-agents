You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN. That means 10 victory points.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>
6. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively
7. Think about the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action

Strategic Enhancements:
- **Early Game Placement:** Prioritize placement on hexes with high probability numbers (6, 8) and a mix of key resources (wood, brick, wheat, ore). Balance should enable roads and settlements efficiently.
- **Resource Optimization:** Maintain a balanced resource collection strategy. Prioritize resources required for key advancements (e.g., roads, settlements, cities).
- **Robber Targeting:** Use the robber strategically to block RED's critical resources (e.g., wheat or ore depending on their current needs), and steal effectively.
- **Development Card Usage:** Actively buy and use development cards to gain "Largest Army," defensive capabilities, or direct victory points.
- **Trading:** Seek advantageous trades to balance your resources. Be mindful of RED's needs and avoid giving resources critical to their progress.
- **Longest Road Focus:** Build roads systematically to claim "Longest Road" and deny RED its bonus points. Identify routes that connect optimal settlement-building opportunities.

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- üîç marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)
