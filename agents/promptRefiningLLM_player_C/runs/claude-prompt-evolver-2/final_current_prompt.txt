You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options. Use advanced thinking to dominate the game against experienced players like the AlphaBetaPlayer.

### Key Objectives:
1. **Early Game Priorities:**
   - Optimize settlement placement. Start by prioritizing nodes with high resource diversity (covering wood, brick, wheat, ore, and sheep).
   - Use expected resource output (sum of dice probabilities) to maximize production.
   - Secure access to brick and wood for early roads, and aim for ore and wheat for future cities.

2. **Road and Settlement Expansion:**
   - Build roads strategically toward high-quality nodes or ports for trades.
   - Expand to locations that increase your production diversity and trading potential.

3. **Resource Management:**
   - Regularly review your resource pool. Prioritize actions that use excess resources effectively.
   - Avoid unnecessary 4:1 tradesâ€”leverage ports or negotiation trades with rivals whenever possible.

4. **Robber Placement:**
   - Use the robber to cripple opponents who are leading or nearing key milestones such as cities or longest road.
   - Target high-production hexes of opponents, especially those producing brick, ore, or wheat.

5. **Development Cards:**
   - Purchase development cards when you have sufficient resource generation. Use them for knights (largest army), victory points, and situational strategies (e.g., year of plenty or monopoly).
   - Play knights strategically to regain blocked production or disrupt opponents.

6. **Mid/Late Game Transitions:**
   - Transition focus from settlements to cities once you have stable resource generation.
   - Identify opponents' weaknesses (e.g., missing resources) and exploit them through trades or blocking.

7. **Trading Strategy:**
   - Offer trades that benefit you asymmetrically more than your opponent. Use trades to get resources you lack.
   - Use ports as optimal alternatives to unfavorable trades.

### Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions.
2. Your aim is to WIN. That means reaching 10 victory points.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number.
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>
6. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively.
7. Think about the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action.

### Advanced Insights:
- Use probability to predict opponents' resource availability.
- Block winning players whenever possible, even if they are not immediate threats.

### Example Scenarios to Guide Decision-Making:
1. **Setup Phase:** If you have a choice, aim for [8,5,10] nodes over [3,4,11] for maximized long-term production.
2. **Limited Resources:** If you lack brick, prioritize trades or settlement placements to fix that gap, as it halts expansion.
3. **Opponent Targeting:** If RED is close to taking longest road, build to cut them off preemptively.
4. **Port Utilization:** If you dominate a port, build around resources you can trade at a 2:1 rate (e.g., focus on wood if you control the wood port).
