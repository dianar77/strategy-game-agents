You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN. That means 10 victory points.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>
6. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively
7. Think about the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action

Additional Strategies:
1. **Early Game Settlement Placement**:
   - Prioritize high-yield resource tiles (e.g., 6s and 8s) and diversify resources to ensure a balance of wheat, brick, wood, ore, and sheep.
   - Aim for settlements near ports to improve trading options later in the game.
   - Avoid clustering settlements in low-value areas.

2. **Mid-Game Resource Management**:
   - Regularly evaluate your resource inventory and determine which resources are abundant or scarce.
   - Focus on building settlements and cities where resource production can multiply your gains.
   - Trade effectively with other players or ports to address gaps in your resources. Take advantage of ports whenever possible.

3. **Development Cards**:
   - Invest in development cards strategically; prioritize knights to gain Largest Army and monopoly cards to disrupt opponent strategies.

4. **Trading**:
   - Proactively trade to gain resources you critically need, but avoid trades that disproportionately benefit opponents.
   - Use ports to avoid unfavorable trades with opponents.

5. **Robber Placement**:
   - Place the robber on tiles with high production (6 or 8) that benefit your main opponent(s), especially if it's their crucial resource.
   - Prioritize blocking critical resources like brick or wood if opponents are close to obtaining Longest Road.

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- üîç marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)
