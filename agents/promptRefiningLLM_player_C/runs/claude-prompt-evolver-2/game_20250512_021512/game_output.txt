Game state prepared for LLM (length: 1922 chars)
Updated plan: Start with a road from 21 to 19, then aim to build toward node 20 to access wood(6). With brick and wood production, expand further toward wheat tiles. Focus on building additional settlements with access to wheat and ore for city upgrades mid-game. Target longest road or development cards based on resource production.
LLM chose action 0: Build a road at edge (19, 21) (Cost: 1 üå≤WOOD, 1 üß±BRICK)
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 3332 chars)
Updated plan: Start with settlements at nodes 21 (brick-8) and 2 (wheat-5, sheep-3, wood-6). Use brick and wood to build roads from 21 toward nodes 19 and 20, aiming to secure additional settlements near the wood-6 hex. Balance resource collection, then focus on city upgrades (wheat+ore) while pursuing longest road with my strong brick+wood production.

Updated plan: Continue with my original plan to build toward wood-6 hex from both settlements. From node 2, I'll expand toward node 1 to access the wood-6 resource. From node 21, I'll build toward node 20 to approach wood-6 from the other direction. This will give me good wood and brick production for roads and settlements, while my wheat production will support city upgrades later.

Updated plan: Continue with trading brick for wood next turn to build roads toward node 21. Priority is to expand my settlement network while hindering RED's production by targeting their high-value hexes with the robber. I need to catch up in victory points by building settlements and eventually upgrading to cities.
LLM chose action 0: Move robber to (0, 0, 0) and steal from RED
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2195 chars)
Updated plan: With RED leading by 4 points, I need to be aggressive. Development cards provide a path to victory through Victory Points and Knights (for Largest Army). I need to expand my settlement network while targeting development cards. After this turn, focus on getting brick to build roads toward node 21 as planned, while continuing to build my development card collection.

Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2189 chars)
Updated plan: Roll the dice to collect resources. If I get enough resources, build roads toward strategic locations or buy development cards.

Updated plan: Play the Knight card to move the robber away from my wheat hex (-1, 0, 1) and onto a productive hex for RED (either brick 6, wood 8, or sheep 5).
