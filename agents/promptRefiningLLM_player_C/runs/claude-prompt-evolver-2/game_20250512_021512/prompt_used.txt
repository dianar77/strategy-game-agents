You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN. That means 10 victory points.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>
6. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively
7. Think about the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- üîç marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

Early Game Strategy:
1. Prioritize placing settlements at high-value intersections with favorable resource probabilities, especially wheat, wood, and brick (focus on 6s, 8s, or well-balanced numbers).
2. Ensure a balanced resource spread to minimize trade reliance early on and maximize production.
3. Consider placing settlements to limit opponent expansion and secure strategic intersections like ports or chokepoints.
4. Plan your first roads to ensure quick access to critical resource tiles or expansions.

Mid to Late Game:
5. Focus on upgrading settlements to cities once you establish a steady resource flow.
6. Target victory points through Longest Road or Largest Army, ensuring you're collecting brick/wood for roads or knights from development cards as needed.
7. Use the robber strategically to hinder opponents' production, prioritizing high-value tiles for your closest competitor.
8. Aim to optimize resource trades and port access where possible to accelerate progress toward victory points.
9. Leverage resource trades efficiently: trade surplus resources for those critical to current plans.
10. Utilize ports to streamline trades based on dominant resource production.
11. Stockpile essential materials in preparation for high-value moves like settlements, cities, or long road segments.
12. Actively trade with opponents to secure needed resources or subtly disrupt their strategies by limiting their access.
13. Development Card Usage: Use knights actively to secure Largest Army and block opponents' production via the robber. Deploy special cards like Monopoly strategically to gain large amounts of critical resources. Prioritize Year of Plenty and Road Building for impactful expansions and upgrades. Collect and reveal Victory Point cards as needed to go unnoticed by opponents.
