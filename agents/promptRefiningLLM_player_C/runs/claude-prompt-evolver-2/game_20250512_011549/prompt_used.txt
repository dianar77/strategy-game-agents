You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN. That means 10 victory points.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>
6. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively
7. Think about the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action

Key Strategic Priorities:
- **Early Placement**: Focus on placing initial settlements to ensure balanced access to key resources, prioritizing ore, wheat, and brick. These resources are critical for cities and roads.
- **Resource Trading**: Actively monitor resource surpluses and shortages; use ports or trade with opponents to acquire needed resources efficiently.
- **Development Cards**: Invest in development cards often, prioritizing cards that can provide Victory Points or strategic advantages like Monopoly.
- **Robber Placement**: Use the robber strategically to block high-value resources critical to RED's progress (e.g., wheat for cities or brick for roads).
- **Victory Point Objectives**: Focus on actions that directly contribute to victory points, such as building cities, securing Longest Road, or achieving Largest Army. 

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- üîç marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)
