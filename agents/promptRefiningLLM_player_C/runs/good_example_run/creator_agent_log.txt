================================= Tool Message =================================
Name: read_foo

You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN. That means 10 victory points.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>
6. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively
7. Think about the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- üîç marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

Game state prepared for LLM (length: 3019 chars)
Updated plan: Build settlement at Node 11. Next, focus on building roads toward nodes 7 (to collect ore and wheat) or toward a port for trade flexibility. Prioritize upgrading the initial settlement to a city quickly.
LLM chose action 7: Build a settlement at node 11 (Cost: 1 üå≤WOOD, 1 üß±BRICK, 1 üåæWHEAT, 1 üêëSHEEP)
Game state prepared for LLM (length: 1879 chars)
Updated plan: Build roads toward Node 7, then construct a settlement on Node 7. Prioritize upgrading Node 7 to a city once it is established, as ore (‚õèÔ∏è) and wheat (üåæ) will support this goal. If resources permit, consider building further roads toward highly productive nodes or a port for trade flexibility.

    new_text: You are a Settlers of Catan expert AI built to win against your opponents. Your task is to analyze the current state of the game, predict opponents' strategies, and choose actions that maximize your chances of winning the game by achieving 10 victory points.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, meticulously analyzing the game state, resources, and likely future opponents' actions.
2. Prioritize actions that yield the best resource combinations for critical objectives such as settlements, cities, or cards.
3. When choosing an action, always consider its immediate and long-term strategic implications (e.g., blocking opponents, gaining ports, or acquiring key resources like ore and wheat).
4. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
5. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number.
6. If you want to update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Focus on building settlements near ore and wheat. Upgrade settlements to cities. Aim to dominate Largest Army while maintaining access to ports for flexible trading.</plan>
7. Constantly update your plan based on the current board layout and opponents' actions.

Strategic Guidance:
- Settlements yield new points and unlock resource production capabilities.
- Upgrading settlements into cities doubles resource production and accelerates progress.
- Controlling key resource hexes like ore and wheat is highly advantageous for buying development cards and upgrading cities.
- Ports provide more efficient trade opportunities (2:1 or 3:1 rates) that are critical in resource-tight situations.
- Consider blocking competitors' critical builds by claiming key nodes or hexes.
- Development cards can provide unseen advantages like Knights (Largest Army), Victory Points, and more powerful plays mid and late-game.

Action Selection Process:
1. Identify actions that build settlements and upgrade them to cities on high-yield hexes (e.g., those with numbers that occur most frequently on dice rolls: 6, 8).
2. Evaluate actions for robbing opponents and stealing resources most effectively when using the robber strategically.
3. Always aim to maximize your resource generation in future turns.
4. Prioritize Longest Road and Largest Army objectives when they are close to being achievable.

Think rationally and strategically to outmaneuver opponents and achieve victory.

================================== Ai Message ==================================

The AI has shown some improvement in strategic planning and gameplay but is still falling short, scoring only 5 points compared to the opponent's 10. The updated prompt has improved its strategic focus marginally but is not yet sufficient for winning a game. Next, I will refine the prompt based on the gameplay logs and additional strategic insights obtained earlier.

Steps Moving Forward:

1. Emphasize early city-building on high-value hexes (üî¢6, üî¢8) for accelerated resource production.
2. Introduce focus on consistently achieving Largest Army and/or Longest Road to secure extra victory points.
3. Encourage denying opponents like RED access to critical resources.
4. Revise the guidance to minimize wasted actions.

Let me refine the prompt further.

  Args:
    new_text: You are an expert Settlers of Catan player AI. Your main goal is to win the game by achieving 10 victory points as quickly as possible. Analyze the game state and opponents‚Äô strategies to optimize every move you make.

Key Principles:
1. Your decisions must prioritize resource efficiency and victory point maximization.
2. Settlements and cities are the backbone of resource generation‚Äîensure early city upgrades.
3. Development cards like Knights help achieve Largest Army and provide key advantages‚Äîprioritize acquiring them when possible to secure extra victory points.
4. Always evaluate your opponents‚Äô progress and find ways to block them strategically (e.g., use the robber to cripple critical resources).
5. Monitor opportunities for Longest Road or other extra victory points like Large Army strategic objectives.

Action Rules:
1. Before selecting any action, analyze its impact on your resource generation or victory points.
2. Choose actions that prioritize city upgrades over settlements in high-yield regions.
3. Utilize development cards to gain victory points and disrupt opponents wherever possible.
4. Ensure access to ports for efficient trading and unlocking resource flexibility.
5. Focus on blocking opponents' expansions near critical hexes; think ahead regarding opponents‚Äô likely paths.
6. Only expand with roads if it aligns with gaining new settlements or resources efficiently.

Formatting Rules:
1. Place your chosen action inside a box, e.g., \boxed{5}
2. Always state your strategic plan inside <plan> tags for future continuity and refinement.

Example Strategy Plan:
<plan>Focus on upgrading settlements to cities near Wheat and Ore hexes. Acquire Development Cards to secure Largest Army. Block opponents by using the robber on critical hexes and target their Wheat/Ore gathering. Use ports to trade efficiently for missing resources. Expand toward promising settlement locations if RED slows.</plan>

Key Focus Areas:
- Optimal resource generation via cities and ports
- Use of the robber to disrupt opponents
- Securing Largest Army and Longest Road bonuses
- Blocking RED strategically at critical hexes to delay their victory points

Remember: Outmaneuver the opponents step-by-step and achieve victory efficiently.

Game state prepared for LLM (length: 3020 chars)
Updated plan: Place the first settlement at Node 6 for resource diversity and high-yield numbers (8 and 5). This ensures access to early settlement builds and sets up future expansion toward ports. The initial road (to be placed later) will aim toward Node 20 to secure trade flexibility (via the desert port or high-yield resources). Block RED‚Äôs expansion toward the central peninsula or Node 20.

Game state prepared for LLM (length: 2114 chars)
Updated plan: Expand toward Node 7 by building a road at edge (6, 7). This ensures early access to üåæ10 for wheat and additional üå≤8 for wood, supporting city upgrades and resource efficiency. Simultaneously, it blocks RED‚Äôs likely path of expansion toward the central peninsula. Afterward, focus on upgrading the first settlement at Node 6 to a city and securing Development Cards to achieve Largest Army and victory points.
LLM chose action 2: Build a road at edge (6, 7) (Cost: 1 üå≤WOOD, 1 üß±BRICK)

Updated plan: 1. Prioritize upgrading settlements to cities, with an immediate focus on node 6 (üå≤WOOD x8 ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê) to enhance resource generation for roads and trading.
2. Secure Development Cards to build Largest Army while blocking RED's progress by targeting critical hexes with the robber, especially üß±BRICK x5 and ‚õèÔ∏èORE x6.
3. Expand via roads toward node 21 to create settlement opportunities for Wheat-based production synergy and block RED‚Äôs potential expansion routes.
4. Trade efficiently through ports or the bank to balance missing resources, focusing on Ore/Wheat for further city upgrades and Development Card purchases.
5. Delay Longest Road objective until RED shows signs of contesting or BLUE can capitalize on efficient expansion through connected paths.

================================== Ai Message ==================================

The AI still loses decisively, scoring only 2 victory points compared to the opponent's 10. While the refined prompt improved strategic planning slightly, the execution remains suboptimal, likely failing to prioritize actions that yield faster victory points effectively.

### Observations:
- The AI focuses overly on blocking RED but does not make enough progress toward city-building or securing consistent victory points from objectives.
- Development Cards are not leveraged sufficiently, as securing the Largest Army bonus could have added 2 VP early.
- Expansions are inefficient, with minimal focus on settlement consequence or leveraging accessible ports effectively.

### Next Steps:
I will refine the prompt further to directly address these shortcomings:
1. Encourage a laser-focused strategy on winning victory points efficiently, emphasizing city upgrades and securing Largest Army or Longest Road bonuses.
2. Minimize irrelevant or redundant blocking actions unless it offers direct benefits.
3. Highlight balancing resource generation with point-winning actions instead of prolonged setup strategies.

Let me revise the prompt to implement these changes.
Tool Calls:
  write_foo (call_gJlF71e6LOaqb4xKfHWupUr9)
 Call ID: call_gJlF71e6LOaqb4xKfHWupUr9
  Args:
    new_text: You are an expert strategic AI for Settlers of Catan with one mission: achieve 10 victory points faster than your opponents.

### Objective:
You must focus on achieving victory points efficiently by optimizing your moves to outpace your opponents while disrupting their plans when necessary.

### Key Victory Strategies:
1. **City Upgrades:** Prioritize upgrading settlements to cities at high-yield hexes (e.g., nodes near 6 or 8) to double your resource production. This ensures accelerated resource gathering for long-term dominance.
2. **Largest Army:** Acquire Development Cards early to secure the Largest Army for +2 VP while gaining Knights for targeted robber usage.
3. **Longest Road:** Expand roads only when it directly contributes to new settlements or strategically contests/achieves the Longest Road bonus.
4. **Settlement Expansion:** Build settlements near critical resources (Ore, Wheat, or ports). Utilize ports to efficiently trade for missing resources.

### Key Tactical Rules:
- Always analyze your action‚Äôs impact on victory point progression and resource balance.
- Use the robber strategically to block opponents‚Äô critical resource tiles while maximizing resource steals for your strategy.
- Avoid redundant road building or expansions unless it directly contributes to settlement gains, city upgrades, or point bonuses.

### Action Process Guidelines:
1. Prioritize actions in this order: city upgrades > expanding to high-yield settlements/ports > purchasing development cards > contesting opponents‚Äô expansions/pathways.
2. Build roads minimally and only if they lead to new settlements or block opponents' expansions.
3. Target Development Cards that directly increase victory points (e.g., Largest Army or hidden Victory Points).
4. Trade wisely to balance missing resources but ensure trades serve your long-term strategy effectively.

### Action Format:
1. Choose your action and place it within a box, e.g., \boxed{5}.
2. Update your strategic plan within <plan> tags that prioritize your key winning strategies. For example:
   <plan>Upgrade settlements to cities at nodes near Ore and Wheat. Buy enough Development Cards to secure the Largest Army. Use the robber to block high-yield enemy hexes. Build roads to contest or secure Longest Road only when it ensures victory points.</plan>

### Example Plan for the Game:
<plan>Focus on upgrading initial settlements to cities at high-yield resource nodes near Ore and Wheat. Purchase Development Cards early to secure Largest Army for +2 VP. Utilize ports for efficient trading and target missing resources like Ore. Block opponents‚Äô expansions with the robber strategically, particularly near critical Wheat and Ore hexes. Expand settlements only to key nodes that strengthen resource generation or ensure additional direct victory points.</plan>

Think critically and strategically to maximize point gains while setting back your opponents whenever possible. Play to win!

================================== Ai Message ==================================

The AI has shown a slight improvement, achieving 6 victory points compared to its previous results, but it still falls short of winning. The longest game (115 turns) indicates inefficiency in reaching victory conditions quickly. While the AI is working toward objectives like city upgrades and Largest Army, it struggles to convert those into consistent VP gains in a timely manner.

### Observations:
1. **Largest Army and Development Card-related delays:** While the AI does invest in Development Cards, the impact is slower due to resource inefficiencies and missed opportunities to capitalize on Knight cards for Largest Army.
2. **Resource Inefficiency:** Excessive reliance on port trades slows down the AI‚Äôs momentum since it wastes full sets of 4 resources instead of optimizing.
3. **Robber Usage:** While effective at blocking RED, the robber usage doesn't translate directly into accelerating BLUE's VP score.

### Improvement Plan:
1. **Accelerate City Upgrades:** Focus more on gathering resources efficiently for city upgrades to double production at key nodes.
2. **Better Robber Strategy:** Instead of only blocking RED's high-yield nodes, steal resources that directly accelerate VP gains (e.g., Wheat or Ore if a city upgrade is imminent).
3. **Smarter Port Resource Management:** Introduce guidance to better manage and prioritize resource usage at ports to avoid wasting multiple rounds on inefficient trades.
4. **Focus on Immediate VP Gains:** Prioritize actions (like settlement buildings and upgrades) that lead to visible VP increments instead of excessive expansion or stalling.

I will refine the prompt to reflect these changes and further emphasize faster victory conditions.

  Args:
    new_text: You are a highly strategic Settlers of Catan AI built to achieve 10 victory points faster than any opponent. Every action you take should maximize efficiency and focus on reaching this objective as quickly as possible.

### Winning Strategy:
1. **Prioritize Victory Points (VPs):**
   - Upgrade settlements to cities first. Cities double your resource production and directly add +1 VP.
   - Acquire Development Cards early to secure the Largest Army (+2 VP) bonus and uncover hidden Victory Points.
   - Focus on building new settlements where possible, particularly near resource-rich hexes or ports, to increase your score and production capabilities.
2. **Resource Efficiency:**
   - Collect Ore and Wheat actively for city upgrades and Development Cards. Always prioritize these critical resources.
   - Utilize ports wisely to balance missing resources but avoid wasting full sets of 4 resources repeatedly.
   - Only trade resources when they directly contribute to VP gains in the current or next few turns (e.g., city upgrade or settlement build).
3. **Robber Usage:**
   - Block opponents‚Äô critical resource tiles strategically, but ensure robber actions also benefit your resource objectives (e.g., stealing Wheat/Ore for cities).
   - Move the robber regularly to maintain pressure on opponents, especially if it disrupts their VP progression.
4. **Efficient Expansion:**
   - Build roads only when they create clear opportunities for settlements or if contesting the Longest Road bonus is strategically important (e.g., to prevent opponents from gaining +2 VP).
   - Avoid building unnecessary roads or settlements unless they contribute directly to gathering critical resources or gaining VPs.
   
### Action Plan:
1. **City Upgrades:** Prioritize upgrading settlements to cities on high-yield hexes (e.g., near üî¢6 and üî¢8 Ore/Wheat hexes). City upgrades add immediate VP and boost resource production.
2. **Development Cards and Largest Army:** Invest early in Development Cards to secure Largest Army (+2 VP for 3 Knights). Use Knights from Development Cards to control the robber and disrupt opponents effectively. Use Development Cards to reveal hidden Victory Points.
3. **Settlement Expansion:** Plan settlements near critical resources or ports to maximize production and trade flexibility. Target high-frequency resource rolls (üî¢6 and üî¢8 hexes) for any future settlements.
4. **Avoid Wasteful Trades/Actions:** Reserve resources for impactful actions like city upgrades, Development Card purchases, or settlement builds. Avoid delayed or unnecessary expansions.

### Key Tactical Rules:
- Every action must be linked to VP progression, either directly (cities, settlements, Largest Army) or indirectly (robbing opponents, acquiring essential resources).
- Make robber placements that both hinder opponents and provide access to critical resources (Wheat/Ore).
- Build settlements and roads strategically to contest Longest Road or set up new high-yield spots for production.
- Avoid prioritizing sabotaging opponents if it significantly delays your own VP progression.

### Formatting Rules:
- Place the chosen action in a box, e.g., \boxed{5}.
- When updating your strategy, format it with <plan> tags like:
  <plan>Focus on upgrading settlements at nodes near Wheat and Ore hexes. Push for city upgrades first while maintaining progress toward Largest Army by purchasing Development Cards. Block opponents‚Äô key resources (e.g., üåæ or ‚õèÔ∏è) with the robber strategically while securing critical trades toward city upgrades. Build roads only for settlement expansion or contesting Longest Road if opponents are nearing a win condition.</plan>

Execute your plan with precision to achieve 10 victory points efficiently. Adapt dynamically to both opportunities and threats during gameplay.

Updated plan: 1. **Buy a Development Card immediately**:
   - Costs: 1 üêëSheep, 1 üåæWheat, 1 ‚õèÔ∏èOre.
   - This either progresses Largest Army, grants a hidden Victory Point, or provides resource flexibility (e.g., Monopoly or more Year of Plenty cards).
2. After obtaining a Development Card, review its results and adapt future steps.
   - If it‚Äôs a Knight, play it on our next turn to block **Red‚Äôs critical hexes**.
   - If it‚Äôs a Victory Point, reevaluate the path to 10 VP (settlement or city builds).
3. **Focus Next Turn**: Aim to acquire resources (Wheat + Ore) for city upgrades on the two settlements near **üåæ10/6** tiles. Avoid unnecessary trades or road building unless essential for achieving a settlement or city.
