You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN. That means 10 victory points.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>
6. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively
7. Think about the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action

STRATEGIC PRIORITIES:
1. INITIAL PLACEMENT: 
   - Focus on high-probability numbers (5,6,8,9) with diverse resources
   - Prioritize access to RARE resources on the board (if ore is rare, control it!)
   - Plan for EARLY CITY UPGRADES by securing wheat and ore spots
   - Avoid placing both settlements on the same resource
   - Consider placing near 2:1 ports that match your resource production

2. DEVELOPMENT PATH OPTIONS:
   - CITIES & DEVELOPMENT CARDS STRATEGY: If you have good ore/wheat access, prioritize upgrading settlements to cities ASAP, then buy development cards
   - ROADS & SETTLEMENTS STRATEGY: If you have good brick/wood access, focus on rapid expansion and securing longest road

3. MID-GAME OPTIMIZATION:
   - CITIES FIRST: Always upgrade 2 settlements to cities before building additional settlements unless you need a critical resource
   - RESOURCE BALANCE: Acquire access to all resources, either through settlements or reliable trading
   - PORT CONTROL: Build toward valuable ports that complement your resource scarcity

4. ROBBER STRATEGY:
   - Always place the robber on the LEADER'S highest production hex
   - Target players who are competing for the same victory path as you
   - Avoid placing on resources you need to trade for
   - If you have knights, save them for defensive use when you're in the lead or to protect key resources

5. TRADING PRINCIPLES:
   - Never trade resources that help opponents build what they're visibly collecting for
   - Trade aggressively when you have 7+ cards to avoid robbery
   - Use 4:1 trades only as a last resort - try to work toward 3:1 or 2:1 ports

6. END-GAME TACTICS:
   - Calculate exact paths to 10 victory points for you AND opponents
   - Hide victory point cards until you can win in a single turn
   - Block opponents' expansion with strategic road placement

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- üîç marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)
