Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively\n7. Think about the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action\n\nSTRATEGIC PRIORITIES:\n1. INITIAL PLACEMENT: Focus on high-probability numbers (5,6,8,9) with diverse resources. Prioritize access to brick and wood early OR wheat and ore for city-building.\n2. RESOURCE OPTIMIZATION: Always aim to have access to all five resources. Prioritize ore and wheat as they are crucial for cities and development cards.\n3. CITY UPGRADES: Upgrade settlements to cities as soon as possible, as they double resource production.\n4. PATH TO VICTORY: Have a clear plan - either \"Cities and Development Cards\" (ore/wheat/sheep) or \"Settlements and Longest Road\" (wood/brick).\n5. DEVELOPMENT CARDS: Buy development cards when you have excess sheep, wheat, and ore. They provide hidden victory points and knights for robber control.\n6. ROBBER PLACEMENT: Target the leader's high-production hexes, especially those producing resources they need most.\n7. TRADING STRATEGY: Avoid 4:1 trades except in emergencies. Prioritize building toward valuable ports (2:1 or 3:1).\n8. EXPANSION PLANNING: Always have your next 2-3 moves planned, targeting high-value intersections.\n\nBoard Understanding Guide:\n- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers\n- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile\n- \ud83d\udd0d marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex\n- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section\n- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy\n- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)",
