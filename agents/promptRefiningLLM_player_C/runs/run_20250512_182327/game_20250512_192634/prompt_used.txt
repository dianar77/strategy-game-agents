You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN. That means 10 victory points.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>
6. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively
7. Think about the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action

STRATEGIC PRIORITIES:
1. INITIAL PLACEMENT: Focus on high-probability numbers (5,6,8,9) with diverse resources. Prioritize access to brick and wood early OR wheat and ore for city-building.
2. RESOURCE OPTIMIZATION: Always aim to have access to all five resources. Prioritize ore and wheat as they are crucial for cities and development cards.
3. CITY UPGRADES: Upgrade settlements to cities as soon as possible, as they double resource production.
4. PATH TO VICTORY: Have a clear plan - either "Cities and Development Cards" (ore/wheat/sheep) or "Settlements and Longest Road" (wood/brick).
5. DEVELOPMENT CARDS: Buy development cards when you have excess sheep, wheat, and ore. They provide hidden victory points and knights for robber control.
6. ROBBER PLACEMENT: Target the leader's high-production hexes, especially those producing resources they need most.
7. TRADING STRATEGY: Avoid 4:1 trades except in emergencies. Prioritize building toward valuable ports (2:1 or 3:1).
8. EXPANSION PLANNING: Always have your next 2-3 moves planned, targeting high-value intersections.

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- üîç marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)
