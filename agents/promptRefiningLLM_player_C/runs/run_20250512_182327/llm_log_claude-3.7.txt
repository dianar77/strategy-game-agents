You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN. That means 10 victory points.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>
6. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively
7. Think about the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- üîç marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)================================== Ai Message ==================================

Colonist Strategies: What are the Best Catan Starting Strategies?

Today we will be giving you pointers on the best starting placement strategies for Settlers of Catan that you can use in Colonist.

Colonist.io

1. Identify Your Goals

The first and most important Catan Strategy is knowing what you want to build. This will dictate which resources you should go after when you place your starting settlements. [...] Also you don‚Äôt want to overproduce resources which can‚Äôt be used and then lose them to a 7 roll.

A much more ideal setup would be an 8-5-10 placement, with a secondary placement of 6-9-4.

These are all good numbers, and you‚Äôve got a variety, meaning that you‚Äôre more likely to collect on any given roll.

It‚Äôs not always possible to get good number variety, and you will more often than not have a duplicate number, but it‚Äôs important to be as diverse as possible. [...] Overall, placing your starting settlements wisely will give you a huge advantage in Settlers of Catan. But this is just one of the many strategies that can be employed in the game.

It is very hard to employ all these tactics in every game though, as the board is arranged randomly by the system and your neighbors choices restrict yours.

However, having a good grasp of starting positions and initial placements will help greatly in winning you your next Colonist game.

works the best, when there is a title adjacent to a resource of its type along with another one of those tiles holding a "desirable" number. Other than that I would say a solid placement regardless of strategy would be to place adjacent to as many desirable numbers (worst case scenario, you have allot of goods you don't need) and if needed using your second placement to gain resources you deem "hard to get".

Given there is a limit of 7 cards before you are at risk of losing half your cards, it can be advantageous to have a steady stream of resources coming into your hand throughout the game. The best way to do this is to place your two first settlements on intersections with six different numbers total with ideally, the highest probability. If you can manage it, the best numbers to be on from the beginning would be 4,5,6,8,9,10 or some combination as close to that as possible. Ideally you would [...] Sarah Smith

What is the most efficient starting strategy for Settlers of Catan?
There are a number of strategies to pursue. I'm going to outline a few ideas to consider when forming your starting strategy (not taking into account which placement order you get):
Number diversity strategy [...] Cities first strategy
Since cities double your earning power, an effective strategy can be to optimize for as much wheat and rock as you can get early in the game, upgrade to two cities as quickly as possible, and then trade out some of your abundant wheat and rock for wood and brick later to build roads and expand. If you can get access to sheep with this strategy, you can also quickly and easily pursue a strategy of buying a lot of development cards before building more settlements.

Cities and Development Cards - For this strategy, your main resources would be Wool, Wheat, and Ore

Trade 2 of a Kind - You will need a 2:1 port and a high concentration of that resource.

With these in mind, and the map layout, identify which strategy will be easier to execute.

2. Resources and Numbers

Colonist is one of those online games that not only requires a keen eye in strategy, but also good sense in resource management. [...] In addition, this would also give you a pretty good idea on how you would want your game to progress.

There are three main strategies you can focus on:

Settlements and Longest Road - Your essential resources would be high amount of Lumber, Brick and some amount of Wool, and Wheat.

Hybrid Expansion ¬†- Occupying as much as you can of the map thereby acquiring more resources. For this strategy you will need to produce a balanced amount of all resources. [...] Colonist Strategies: What are the Best Catan Starting Strategies?

This strategy focuses on development cards, building other things only as an aside when development and resource cards dictate it. They'll usually end up with the Largest Army card and the lion's share of the victory point cards, and generally make a fabulous nuisance of themselves. This is a great strategy if you have good ore/wheat/sheep balance, but is always fun to play, especially because you'll be dropping the robber all over the place but your board position will appear sufficiently weak [...] Using the robber well is crucial - on average, the robber will turn up once in every six rolls and it also gets moved when playing a knight.

- use it on the person in the strongest position (not necessarily the open points leader). Count unplayed development cards in someone's hand as points. Someone who gets Longest Road early is rarely a threat in the long term.

- use the robber exclusively on your strongest opponent. Avoid motivating more than one of your opponents to seek revenge! [...] In a small sample size deviations like these are typical. Your job is to mitigate luck as much as possible, and you can do this by playing the odds (maximizing pips and getting a good distribution of numbers) as best you can when you're placing your settlements.

Step 5: Development Cards

Consider the cost of development cards (one ore, one wheat, and one sheep) against potential benefits. Early in the game, expanding your presence on the board might take precedence, but as the game progresses, development cards can offer significant strategic advantages.

The Art Of Handling The Robber [...] The robber is a unique element in Catan that can dramatically influence the game's flow. Effectively managing the robber involves both defensive and offensive strategies to protect your interests while potentially hindering your opponents.

Defensive Strategies

Offensive Strategies

Trading: The Key to Resource Management [...] Consider the potential for future expansion when placing your initial settlements. Positioning yourself in a way that blocks competitors from prime locations or resources can be as valuable as securing those spots for yourself.

Settlers uses what is called a switch-back start: each player, in turn order, places their first settlement, and then in reverse turn order they place their second. This second settlement immediately produces the resources it is placed on. This is a significant advantage to the last player, who places both settlements at the same time.

Based on my analysis of the game logs and strategic research, I've made significant improvements to the prompt for the PromptRefiningLLMPlayer_C. Here's a summary of the key changes:

1. **Added Strategic Priorities**: I've added a completely new "STRATEGIC PRIORITIES" section that provides clear guidance on the most important aspects of Catan strategy:

   - **Initial Placement**: Now emphasizes focusing on high-probability numbers (5,6,8,9) and resource diversity, with clear pathways toward either brick/wood or wheat/ore strategies.
   
   - **Resource Optimization**: Highlighted the importance of ore and wheat for the mid to late game, which was clearly lacking in the previous games.
   
   - **City Upgrades**: Emphasized prioritizing city upgrades, as they double resource production - this was a major weakness in previous games where the player built many settlements but few cities.
   
   - **Path to Victory**: Defined two clear strategic paths - "Cities and Development Cards" or "Settlements and Longest Road" to provide direction.
   
   - **Development Card Strategy**: Added guidance on when to buy development cards and how to use them strategically.
   
   - **Robber Placement**: Provided tactical advice for using the robber effectively against the leading player.
   
   - **Trading Strategy**: Advised against 4:1 trades (which were overused in previous games) and stressed building toward valuable ports.
   
   - **Expansion Planning**: Emphasized the importance of forward planning for settlement placement.

2. **Maintained Original Formatting**: I kept the original formatting of rules and board understanding guides that worked well in the previous version.

These improvements directly address the weaknesses observed in the game logs, where our player:
- Made inefficient resource trades (many 4:1 trades)
- Built too many settlements without upgrading to cities
- Lacked a coherent long-term strategy
- Didn't optimize initial placements for high-probability numbers

This enhanced prompt should help our player make more strategic decisions, optimize resource management, and establish a clearer path to victory against the AlphaBetaPlayer.Evolve Counter: 4

EXPANSION PLANNING: Always have your next 2-3 moves planned, targeting high-value intersections.\n\nBoard Understanding Guide:\n- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers\n- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile\n- \ud83d\udd0d marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex\n- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section\n- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy\n- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)",

Cities first strategy
Since cities double your earning power, an effective strategy can be to optimize for as much wheat and rock as you can get early in the game, upgrade to two cities as quickly as possible, and then trade out some of your abundant wheat and rock for wood and brick later to build roads and expand. If you can get access to sheep with this strategy, you can also quickly and easily pursue a strategy of buying a lot of development cards before building more settlements. [...] - When I talk about gaining and losing dots, I'm talking about placing a settlement on a vertex and gaining access to the production of 3 tiles. Or, turning that settlement into a city and doubling production.
Here are some simple heuristics to help placement:
- On the first placement, just maximize your number of dots. You should never sacrifice more than 1 dot for any "Other factors". This placement will probably be 10-12 dots [...] What to build: I actually don't like giving specific advise here. I'd take what your board and opponents give you on rolls and trades respectively. Generally, settlements and cities are more important early game as they provide resource income.

Think of a Catan map as having 3 areas ‚Äî the center, inner, and coastal rings. The ‚Äúcenter‚Äù is all the spots around the middle hex, ‚Äúinner‚Äù is the next one outward, and so on.
For starters, the coast never makes sense for your first placement as it will only have 2 hexes of production (3 for you to build more central) and it will inhibit your optionality to expand. [...] As a rule of thumb, during your first settlement placement, it‚Äôs usually best not to point your road toward the middle of the board. You will likely have no expansion spots since everyone will start toward the middle, rather than the coast.
Anytime your road is in a contestable direction, make sure you‚Äôre the one cutting someone off or are more likely to win the race ‚Äî not the other way around. [...] In theory, you should aim to have equal ‚Äúbips‚Äù of brick and lumber, as well as, 3:2 bips for ore and grain (notice ‚Äî this equates to a city).

While the introductory game comes with a recommended board layout, later games are played on a randomized hex tile layout.¬† Take a close look at these random layouts at the start of the game. Are there two of the same resource next to one another?¬† Is at least one of the numbered chits on those tiles reasonably high? Consider placing a Settlement in the most advantageous intersection of those tiles, then build roads and additional Settlements around them to block your opponents from doing the

Looks Inferior: Think about it, other players are expanding like crazy, having 4‚Äì5 settlements and there you are with a bunch of dev cards and unable to build roads. This makes you less of a target for the untrained especially in the end game when everyone combines to stop the player in the lead. [...] High Ore/Food Board: If there is Ore/Wheat sheep enough for 2‚Äì3 players, then perhaps look at getting the advantage by acquiring road material and not competing for the longest army. Basically cities and settlements/longest road instead of cities and dev cards/largest army. [...] Easiest Win condition :(3 cities, 2 VP, largest army)/(1 settlement, 3 cities, 1 VP, largest army).
Knights Army: With an abundance of development cards, you won‚Äôt remain blocked for long but your direct competitors will be.
No Roads : Can win easily even with zero production of wood & brick. You only need one road and one settlement the whole game if you have insane development card buying power. Having all 5 resources is great but definitely not necessary.

Once in a while, one of the above strategies for the robber may be correct. If someone has nine victory points, and a handful of cards, putting the robber on them probably is the best idea. At the end of the game, placing the robber is pretty easy to figure out. But, what about in the beginning of the game? What about the middle? Placing the robber in the early/middle of the game will absolutely have one intended effect ‚Äì someone will not like you for putting it on them. If you‚Äôve hit someone [...] You should also make sure that you only affect one player with the robber. Affecting two players doubles the revenge factor, as well as doubles the motivation to move it with a soldier card. If only one person is affected, then the robber will probably spend longer on that spot. As a rule of thumb, in the early/middle game, you should place the robber on the player to your right. The reason is that it will spend more time there. The player to your right can‚Äôt take the robber off for two or [...] THE ROBBER:  
You‚Äôre always supposed to place the robber on the person with the most victory points, right? Or, wait, you‚Äôre supposed to place it on a 6 or 8 so that it takes out someone‚Äôs best number, correct? Or was it that you should try to put it so that it affects as many people as possible? And of course, you never want to put the robber on someone holding development cards because they probably have a soldier, and they‚Äôll just put it right back on you won‚Äôt they?

- try to avoid trading down to just a few cards with the bank and being stuck unable to build. Chances are, you're doing so for a resource you're finding hard to get and therefore other players will know they can disproportionately hurt you with the robber if they steal it.

- preserve juicy settlement locations with judicious road placement. Lock up that port that's critical to your strategy early. Nothing more infuriating than having an opponent beat you to it. [...] - if you are lacking a resource, don't place the robber on it. You want there to be lots of it in the game so people will trade it to you. Instead, place it on a resource that you have a lot of so you can increase your probability of trading for what you need.

Step 7: Commander [...] This strategy focuses on development cards, building other things only as an aside when development and resource cards dictate it. They'll usually end up with the Largest Army card and the lion's share of the victory point cards, and generally make a fabulous nuisance of themselves. This is a great strategy if you have good ore/wheat/sheep balance, but is always fun to play, especially because you'll be dropping the robber all over the place but your board position will appear sufficiently weak

As a result, you will start with a road which gives you a great first mover advantage if you are in a race with anyone. This can help you secure a contested spot with your first settlement or deliberately cut someone off placing two roads from your second placement.
#13. Consider which spots will always be knighted.

In a development card heavy game (lots of ore, grain, and wool), knights can play a major role in directing where the robber is placed. [...] It‚Äôs typically best to control the rare resource since the rest of the table will offer you generous trades for it. If you don‚Äôt budge, their games may stall while yours could still be progressing. Also, even if it makes you a target of the robber, you can leverage your rare resource as a bartering tool to keep the robber elsewhere.

#3. Relative production of complementary resources.

7. Think about the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action

STRATEGIC PRIORITIES:
1. INITIAL PLACEMENT: 
   - Focus on high-probability numbers (5,6,8,9) with diverse resources
   - Prioritize access to RARE resources on the board (if ore is rare, control it!)
   - Plan for EARLY CITY UPGRADES by securing wheat and ore spots
   - Avoid placing both settlements on the same resource
   - Consider placing near 2:1 ports that match your resource production

2. DEVELOPMENT PATH OPTIONS:
   - CITIES & DEVELOPMENT CARDS STRATEGY: If you have good ore/wheat access, prioritize upgrading settlements to cities ASAP, then buy development cards
   - ROADS & SETTLEMENTS STRATEGY: If you have good brick/wood access, focus on rapid expansion and securing longest road

3. MID-GAME OPTIMIZATION:
   - CITIES FIRST: Always upgrade 2 settlements to cities before building additional settlements unless you need a critical resource
   - RESOURCE BALANCE: Acquire access to all resources, either through settlements or reliable trading
   - PORT CONTROL: Build toward valuable ports that complement your resource scarcity

4. ROBBER STRATEGY:
   - Always place the robber on the LEADER'S highest production hex
   - Target players who are competing for the same victory path as you
   - Avoid placing on resources you need to trade for
   - If you have knights, save them for defensive use when you're in the lead or to protect key resources

5. TRADING PRINCIPLES:
   - Never trade resources that help opponents build what they're visibly collecting for
   - Trade aggressively when you have 7+ cards to avoid robbery
   - Use 4:1 trades only as a last resort - try to work toward 3:1 or 2:1 ports

6. END-GAME TACTICS:
   - Calculate exact paths to 10 victory points for you AND opponents
   - Hide victory point cards until you can win in a single turn
   - Block opponents' expansion with strategic road placement

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- üîç marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)================================= Tool Message =================================

Based on my analysis of the game logs and research, I've made significant improvements to the prompt for promptRefiningLLM_player_C. Here's a summary of the key changes:

1. **Enhanced Initial Placement Strategy**:
   - Added guidance to focus on rare resources, which can create leverage for trading
   - Emphasized early city upgrade capability by securing wheat and ore spots
   - Added advice to diversify resource access across both starting settlements
   - Included port placement considerations for the early game

2. **Clearly Defined Development Path Options**:
   - Provided two distinct strategic paths (Cities & Development Cards vs. Roads & Settlements)
   - Made the strategy selection criteria clearer based on starting resource access

3. **Strengthened Mid-Game Optimization**:
   - Added "Cities First" principle, which was missing in our current play
   - The logs showed we're building too many settlements (3.4) and not enough cities (0.4)
   - AlphaBeta is winning with fewer settlements (3.6) but more cities (2.0)

4. **Improved Robber Strategy**:
   - Made robber placement more strategic by targeting the leader's best production
   - Added guidance on using knights defensively when in the lead
   - Included advice to avoid placing the robber on resources you need to trade for

5. **Added Trading Principles**:
   - Included specific rules for when to trade and when to avoid trading
   - Added risk mitigation for having 7+ cards to avoid robbery

6. **Added End-Game Tactics**:
   - Guidance on calculating exact victory paths
   - Strategy for hiding victory point cards until they can be used for the win
   - Defensive road placement to block opponents

These improvements directly address the key weaknesses I identified in the logs:
- Our player is building too many settlements and not enough cities
- We're not efficiently targeting robber placement against leading opponents
- We're not optimizing for the right resources early in the game
- We lack clear defensive strategies against other players

The new prompt should help our player make better strategic decisions, particularly regarding city upgrades, which appears to be a major differentiator between our performance and the AlphaBetaPlayer's success.Evolve Counter: 3
