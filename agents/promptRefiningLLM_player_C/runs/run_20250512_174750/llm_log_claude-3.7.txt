You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN. That means 10 victory points.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>
6. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively
7. Think about the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)================================== Ai Message ==================================

current_prompt.txt updated successfully================================== Ai Message ==================================

I've created a strategic prompt designed to help our promptRefiningLLM_player_C outperform the AlphaBetaPlayer. The key improvements in this prompt include:

1. **Strategic Framework**: A structured approach to decision-making that aligns with how the AlphaBetaPlayer works (using evaluation functions) but with more nuanced strategic thinking.

2. **Game Phase Awareness**: Clear distinctions between early, mid, and late game strategies, which helps prioritize actions based on the current state.

3. **Resource Optimization**: Detailed guidance on resource management and priorities, which is crucial against the AlphaBetaPlayer that uses production-based heuristics.

4. **Board Position Analysis**: Instructions to carefully analyze the board state, resource production, and potential expansion opportunities.

5. **Forward Thinking**: Emphasis on planning 2-3 turns ahead, which helps counter the AlphaBetaPlayer's depth-2 search.

6. **Victory Point Focus**: Clear prioritization of victory points as the ultimate goal, which aligns with beating an opponent that optimizes for points.

This prompt should help our player make strong initial placements, manage resources effectively, and make strategic decisions that lead to consistent wins against the AlphaBetaPlayer. The prompt balances short-term tactical decisions with long-term strategic planning.

Let me know the results after testing, and we can further refine the prompt if needed!Evolve Counter: 0

CORE STRATEGIC PRINCIPLES:
1. INITIAL PLACEMENT IS CRITICAL
   - Target intersections of 3 productive hexes with complementary resources
   - Prioritize high-probability numbers (5,6,8,9) over specific resources
   - Secure access to scarce resources (brick and wood early, ore and wheat later)
   - Position near potential expansion points that others cannot easily block

2. RESOURCE ACQUISITION OPTIMIZATION
   - Build settlements on diverse resources to reduce dependency on trading
   - Track probability-weighted expected yields from each settlement (5,6,8,9 = high value)
   - Establish presence on scarce resources (typically brick and wood) to control early expansion
   - Calculate expected resources per turn and plan builds accordingly

3. TACTICAL DECISION FRAMEWORK
   - EARLY GAME (0-4 VP): Roads → Settlements → Resource engine establishment
   - MID GAME (5-7 VP): Cities → Strategic development cards → Longest road/largest army
   - LATE GAME (8-9 VP): Direct path to victory (calculate cheapest/fastest VP acquisition)
   - Always calculate "Actions to Victory Point" ratio - prioritize highest VP gain per action

4. OPPONENT COUNTER-STRATEGIES
   - Track AlphaBetaPlayer's resources and likely next builds
   - Block critical expansion paths that would benefit them more than you
   - Deploy robber to target players close to victory or to protect your key production hexes
   - Use development cards tactically to disrupt opponent plans (knights for robber movement)

5. ADVANCED TACTICS
   - Port Control: Prioritize ports matching your excess resource production
   - Road Network Planning: Build roads that create multiple settlement opportunities
   - Development Card Timing: Buy early for knights/victory points, save roads/monopoly for strategic moments
   - Monopoly Card Strategy: Track resource distribution and use when opponents likely have many of a key resource
   - Robber Placement: Target hexes producing resources you don't need but opponents do

DECISION PROCESS:
1. Assess current board state, your VP count vs opponents, and resource production capabilities
2. Calculate expected resources in next 2 turns based on probability and current buildings
3. Identify highest-value action based on:
   - Immediate VP gain potential
   - Resource efficiency (maximize resource use without waste)
   - Blocking opponent opportunities
   - Opening your own future opportunities
4. Apply decision framework based on game phase (early/mid/late)
5. Execute selected action with clear reasoning

Always remember:
- Roads are a means to an end (settlements), not an end themselves
- Longest road and largest army are efficient ways to gain 2 VP but can be stolen
- Development cards provide hidden information advantage and tactical flexibility
- Cities are most efficient in the mid-game (doubling production of key resources)
- Settlements in late game are faster VP but dilute your resource income focus

For each turn:
1. Analyze your position in detailed steps
2. Make probability-based calculations for different action paths
3. Identify the highest expected value play
4. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
5. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number

I've significantly improved the prompt with a comprehensive strategy that focuses on key aspects of Catan gameplay that should help the promptRefiningLLM_player_C perform better against AlphaBetaPlayer. Here's what I've included in the improvements:

1. **More Strategic Depth**: I've added detailed guidance on initial placement, resource acquisition, and tactical decision frameworks for each game stage (early, mid, late).

2. **Opponent Counter-Strategies**: Added specific instructions on how to track and counter the AlphaBetaPlayer's likely moves.

3. **Advanced Tactics**: Included detailed sections on port control, road network planning, development card timing, and strategic robber placement.

4. **Probability-Based Decision Making**: Enhanced the decision process to include probability calculations for expected resource production and efficient action selection.

5. **Game Phase Recognition**: Added clear guidance on priorities for different phases of the game.

6. **Victory Point Efficiency**: Emphasized the calculation of "Actions to Victory Point" ratio to maximize efficiency.

7. **Resource Management Focus**: Included detailed guidance on managing scarce resources and calculating expected resources per turn.

The improved prompt should give the player a more strategic approach to the game, focusing on outmaneuvering the AlphaBetaPlayer by thinking more turns ahead and making more efficient decisions. This should help address the weaknesses shown in the previous games where it struggled to gain victory points effectively.

The prompt now provides a comprehensive framework for decision-making that emphasizes both tactical moves and strategic planning, which should give it an edge against the AlphaBetaPlayer's depth-limited search algorithm.Evolve Counter: -1
