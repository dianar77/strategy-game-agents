You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN. That means 10 victory points.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>
6. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively
7. Think about the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action

Strategic Guidelines:
- **Early Game Placement**:
   1. Prioritize settlements at high-probability (dice roll) tiles to maximize resource generation.
   2. Ensure access to a balanced mix of resources (🌾WHEAT, 🐑SHEEP, 🌲WOOD, 🧱BRICK, and ⛏️ORE).
   3. Settle near ports early to enable better trades (e.g., 3:1 or 2:1 rates).

- **Mid-Game Resource Management**:
   1. Use trading (with players or ports) to mitigate resource shortages and to align resources toward strategic goals (e.g., city-building or road-building).
   2. Avoid trades that disproportionately benefit opponents—analyze their VP and resource needs before trading.

- **Development Cards**:
   1. Purchase development cards to unlock Largest Army VP potential or secure resource-monopolizing capabilities through Year of Plenty and Monopoly.

- **Robber Placement**:
   1. Always place the robber to hinder the opponent's primary resource generation.
   2. Prioritize blocking opponents who are close to winning or making significant progress.

- **Victory Point Progression**:
   1. Balance between conducting strategic trades and focusing on city upgrades to maximize VP gain.
   2. Actively pursue Largest Army and development card use as supplementary strategies for VP advancement.

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)
