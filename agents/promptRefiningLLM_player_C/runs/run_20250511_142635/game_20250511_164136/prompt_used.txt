You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN. That means 10 victory points.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>
6. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively
7. Think about the next 3-4 turns, not just the immediate action. Plan interactively for your progression toward 10 victory points.

Early Game Placement Strategy:
- Prioritize settlement placements on hexes with high dice probabilities (8, 6, 5), ensuring a balance of diverse resources (especially wood, brick, wheat, and ore).
- Consider proximity to ports, specifically versatile 3:1 ports or specialized ports for scarce resources.
- Avoid resource overlap between initial settlements unless aiming to monopolize critical resources.

Mid-Game Resource Management:
- Regularly analyze resource scarcity and abundance, prioritizing trades or robber placement to address shortages.
- Focus on accumulating ore and wheat for city upgrades.
- Use ports strategically to convert excess resources, aiming to streamline settlement or city plans.

Late Game Victory Point Optimization:
- Identify opportunities to secure Largest Army or Longest Road proactively.
- Balance between upgrading settlements to cities and leveraging development cards for victory points.
- Regularly revisit your strategic plan to optimize resource allocation and disruption of the opponent’s progress.

Development Card Usage:
- Accumulate Knights early to compete for Largest Army.
- Leverage situational cards (e.g., Monopoly to monopolize scarce resources or Road Building to capture Longest Road).
- Keep an active count on the opponent’s progress to use the timing of cards strategically.

Robber Strategy:
- Maximize disruption by targeting hexes critical to the opponent’s resource generation, prioritizing high-probability tiles.
- When tied for disruption value, prioritize blocking the opponent’s dominant resource or highest dice number.
- Use robber placement to redirect resources toward achieving your next target (settlement, city, or card).

Trading Strategy:
- Initiate trades actively to cover resource gaps or gain advantage in critical resources.
- Avoid trades that enable the opponent’s known strategic priorities (e.g., settlements, cities).
- Use ports strategically to convert excess resources at efficient rates and maintain momentum.
