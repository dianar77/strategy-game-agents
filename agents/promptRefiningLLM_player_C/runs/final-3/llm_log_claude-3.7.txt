Name: read_prompt

You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist with expert development card planning. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Focus heavily on ore and wheat hexes for your initial settlements
- Place settlements on intersections of complementary resources (ore/wheat or wood/brick)
- Between your two settlements, secure at least one good source of each critical resource: ore, wheat, and sheep
- If you must sacrifice a resource, make it brick (unless a brick-port is available)
- Place initial roads toward valuable future expansion areas or resource-rich areas
- Consider ports that match resources you expect to produce in abundance (especially sheep)
- Avoid placing settlements that will be trapped with no expansion opportunities

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY (PRIMARY PATH TO VICTORY):
- Buy development cards whenever you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Development cards provide hidden victory points and tactical advantages
- Use knights strategically to protect your high-producing hexes from the robber
- Save knight cards for when your high-production hexes are blocked by the robber
- Time monopoly cards for when opponents likely have accumulated resources you need
- Use Year of Plenty cards to complete crucial builds when you're short specific resources
- Aggressively pursue largest army (2 VP) if you've already played 2 or more knights
- Aim to secure 3-4 victory point cards throughout the game for a surprise win
- Keep your victory points hidden until you can win in a single turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Early-game: Secure minimal expansion to reach critical resource spots or ports
- Mid-game: Focus heavily on ore and wheat to upgrade settlements to cities
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each potential build (cities give best return)
- Target 2-3 cities before extensive road building, unless going for longest road
- Avoid accumulating 7+ resources before dice rolls
- Never make trades that directly help opponents score immediate points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Avoid placing the robber where it equally hurts all players - be strategic
- Don't place the robber on resources you're deficient in - this reduces trading options
- Consider the timing of knight cards - save them for critical moments

PATH TO VICTORY PLANNING:
- Primary Win Path: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 10 VP
- Alternative Win Path: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + victory point cards (4 VP) = 10 VP
- Always track your potential hidden victory points vs. visible points
- If you have development cards giving you hidden points, focus on resource gathering
- When you're close to 10 points, calculate whether to reveal victory points immediately
- Keep track of your opponent's visible points AND potential hidden points
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads only when they lead to valuable settlement locations
- Prioritize settlements that increase your resource diversity or production probability
- Secure key ports that complement your resource production
- Block opponents' critical expansion paths
- Calculate whether longest road (2 VP) is worth the resource investment
- For each settlement expansion, evaluate whether the resources gained justify the cost

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Is there a faster path to 10 victory points?
2. Are development cards a more efficient way to get victory points right now?
3. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
4. Will this action help or hinder your opponent's strategy?
5. Do you have enough resources to execute your plan for the next few turns?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)================================== Ai Message ==================================

As a rule of thumb, during your first settlement placement, it’s usually best not to point your road toward the middle of the board. You will likely have no expansion spots since everyone will start toward the middle, rather than the coast.
Anytime your road is in a contestable direction, make sure you’re the one cutting someone off or are more likely to win the race — not the other way around. [...] As a result, you will start with a road which gives you a great first mover advantage if you are in a race with anyone. This can help you secure a contested spot with your first settlement or deliberately cut someone off placing two roads from your second placement.
#13. Consider which spots will always be knighted.

In a development card heavy game (lots of ore, grain, and wool), knights can play a major role in directing where the robber is placed. [...] Think of a Catan map as having 3 areas — the center, inner, and coastal rings. The “center” is all the spots around the middle hex, “inner” is the next one outward, and so on.
For starters, the coast never makes sense for your first placement as it will only have 2 hexes of production (3 for you to build more central) and it will inhibit your optionality to expand.

Overall, placing your starting settlements wisely will give you a huge advantage in Settlers of Catan. But this is just one of the many strategies that can be employed in the game.

It is very hard to employ all these tactics in every game though, as the board is arranged randomly by the system and your neighbors choices restrict yours.

However, having a good grasp of starting positions and initial placements will help greatly in winning you your next Colonist game. [...] Of course, this is highly contextual and will depend on each game session.

However, looking at your opponents’ spots might just open up opportunities that were not visible to you before.

For example, if all the Bricks on the board are on low-yield numbers like 2-3-4, then that’s a rare resource. Work on acquiring them early on.

5. Work on Expansion as Your Main Focus

Settlers of Catan is a game of conquest. Gaining as much territory as possible is one of the essentials in winning the game. [...] 6. Ports for High Concentration of the Same Resource

Waterfront properties are valuable. Both in real life and in Settlers of Catan.

Owning one makes the bank love you. To the point that they’ll be willing to trade for less resources.

This is why ports play an important role in The Settlers of Catan.

Having the ability to trade 2:1 can win your game, so looking at the available ports on the board during your first placement is critical.

Thing Two: Catan is won by having ten points.  Those first two Settlements you placed before the game really started?  They’re worth one point each. That means Catan is really only about scoring eight Victory Points. Eight.  Make each point you score — and each point you prevent your opponents from scoring — count.
Be adaptable in your game plan and smart about each one of those points and, like me, you should find your chances of winning improving with each game.
TagsBoard Game Strategy Guides [...] When looking for intersections to place your first Settlements, pay less attention to the type of resource and more attention to the number of dots on the hex tiles that make up the intersections.  The type of resource matters less than the frequency of obtaining them. After all, resources can be traded to the bank at 4:1 or at Ports for an even better return (see below). [...] While the introductory game comes with a recommended board layout, later games are played on a randomized hex tile layout.  Take a close look at these random layouts at the start of the game. Are there two of the same resource next to one another?  Is at least one of the numbered chits on those tiles reasonably high? Consider placing a Settlement in the most advantageous intersection of those tiles, then build roads and additional Settlements around them to block your opponents from doing the

The concept for the Development Card Strategy is to ignore wood and brick completely when you are placing your initial settlements. Instead, you want, in order, Ore, Wheat, and Sheep. Cities and Development Cards are your friends.  
To achieve 10 victory points, most of the time you'll want to: [...] 4th Player. Initial placement 4 ore, 8 ore, 6 wheat, 11 wheat, 3 sheep x2. Won. I got perfect resource distribution, and won easily with largest army, 6 points for my cities, and 2 bonus points.
4th Player. Initial placement 6 ore, 6 wheat, 11 wheat, 3 sheep, 5 sheep, 9 sheep. Won. I was heavily invested in 6's, and that number came up a lot early. The win was easy with longest road, 6 points from cities, and 2 bonus points. [...] 1st Player. Initial placement 6 ore x2, 11 ore, 5 wheat, 11 sheep, 12 wood. Lost. I struggled for resources in this one. Getting ore was dependent on a single 6, which drew the robber often, and only the single 5 gave me wheat.
3rd Player. Initial placement 4 ore, 9 ore, 6 wheat, 5 sheep, 11 sheep x2. Won. I had plenty of ore, wheat, and sheep, which led to an easy victory with largest army, 5 points for 2 cities and a settlement, longest road, and 2 bonus points.

This strategy aims first to build two cities before attempting to build roads or settlements. Players who like this strategy look for rich placements on ore and wheat and don't worry much about brick and wood. They collect lots of development cards and a typical winning combination will involve 3 cities, 2 victory point cards and largest army. Road building is most often done with the appropriate development card. It's quite possible to win this way without producing a single brick or wood in [...] This strategy focuses on development cards, building other things only as an aside when development and resource cards dictate it. They'll usually end up with the Largest Army card and the lion's share of the victory point cards, and generally make a fabulous nuisance of themselves. This is a great strategy if you have good ore/wheat/sheep balance, but is always fun to play, especially because you'll be dropping the robber all over the place but your board position will appear sufficiently weak

5.4 MCTS To test MCST + DQN, we played directly with other players using the Catanatron Simulation. This was setup by having the fully trained model running along with MCTS with ϵ = 0, meaning no 7 random moves would be made for exploration purposes. This was ran against three types of players of greatly varying strength: Weighted Random, Greedy Player, and Alpha Beta. Our results for MCTS-DQN greatly surpassed any RL approach taken by the previous author who was unable to beat the performance [...] 4.6 Model Training Before we can use MCTS, we wanted to first establish a strong baseline, as written in the AlphaGo paper [8]. But, as we don’t have any human expert data to work with, we instead decided to use training data from execution of the Alpha Beta Pruning algorithm, the best performing player within the catanatron repository. Therefore, each of our models was trained by playing 10000 games against 6 the Alpha Beta player in an epsilon greedy training strategy. The first 1000 games [...] of weighted random. For 25 games, our algorithm won 23 and only lost 2. This likely would be a flawless win if Victory Points was set to 10 however. With the other ones, it was much less successful though. Versus Value Function, our algorithm won 4/25 times, and 0 times versus Alpha Beta. Another indicator of how well an algorithm is performing is the average number of moves it takes to lose. As a strong baseline, AlphaBeta takes around 75 moves on average to win a 1v1 game. Our algorithm takes

7 Conclusions In this paper we described an agent that learns to play Settlers of Catan.

In this paper we apply MCTS to the multi-player, non-deterministic board game Settlers of Catan. We imple-mented an agent that is able to play against computer-controlled and human players. We show that MCTS can be adapted successfully to multi-agent environments, and present two approaches of providing the agent with a [...] Several computer implementations of Settlers of Catan exist, which typically feature a hand-designed, rule-based AI. The strength of these AIs varies, but an experienced player can defeat them easily.

To my surprise, it showed some improvement! After around 8 hours of training, the bot was beating the RandomPlayer 80% of the time. But then it would face a dip in the learning graph, and in general, this was still pretty far from the ValueFunctionPlayer.

Maybe I am just inpatient and this just need to be run for a longer time.

Attempt #5: Alpha Beta Search [...] It showed some improvement. This AlphaBetaPlayer, with depth=2, increased the performance of ValueFunctionPlayer but only slightly. Here are the results:

Curiously, increasing the search to 3-layers deep made the bot play worse than when searching 2-layers deep. I think its either a bug in the implementation or maybe looking too much ahead makes the bot go frequently towards high-risk-high-reward plays that don’t pan out. [...] The last tool in the arsenal was to try and add “search” to the ValueFunctionPlayer. There was only one slight modification that I did to the standard Alpha-Beta Pruning algorithm, which was to take the expected value of the children when propagating values up the tree. This was to account the uncertainty in dice rolls, buying development cards, and stealing.

    new_text: You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist whose primary goal is to defeat the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (HIGHEST PRIORITY):
- Target 6 & 8 numbered hexes at all costs - these are the most productive numbers
- Prioritize ore and wheat hexes for your settlements - they enable cities and development cards
- Position yourself on at least one good brick and wood hex to enable early expansion
- Aim to cover ALL five resources with your two settlements combined
- Try to place on intersections with 3 productive hexes rather than 2
- Evaluate probability dots (not just numbers) - more dots mean more frequent production
- Place settlements with clear expansion paths that won't be easily blocked
- Avoid placing where you'll be immediately cut off by the opponent
- Position roads toward your next planned settlement location
- Consider distance to valuable ports (especially 2:1 ports matching your abundant resources)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-8):
- Build at least one new road and one new settlement ASAP
- Focus on securing access to any missing resources through expansion
- Establish access to a port if you're lacking a key resource
- Prevent the opponent from cutting off your expansion path
- Only purchase development cards if excess resources available or for immediate victory
- Expand toward high-value hexes the opponent doesn't yet control

MID-GAME RESOURCE MANAGEMENT (TURNS 9-20):
- Target 3 cities minimum (worth 6 VP) - upgrade most productive settlements first
- Maintain 1 road per every 2 settlements for flexible expansion
- Always build a settlement when you have the resources (more production points)
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each build (cities give best long-term return)
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1 or better) to maintain resource balance
- Keep at least one viable road-building path open at all times
- If blocked from expansion, shift to city upgrades and development cards

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Development cards should supplement your expansion, not replace it
- Prioritize using Knight cards to protect your best hexes from the robber
- Save Knights when you're ahead to counter the opponent's robber placements
- Only buy development cards when you:
  1. Have excess sheep/wheat/ore but lack wood/brick for expansion
  2. Are close to securing largest army
  3. Need a specific card type (Road Building to break through a blockade)
- Use Road Building cards to save brick/wood and create surprise expansion paths
- Time Monopoly cards to capture opponent's stockpile after high-producing rolls
- Use Year of Plenty to complete crucial builds when short on specific resources

ROBBER PLACEMENT:
- Always target the opponent's highest-producing hex (high number + settlement/city)
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat hexes to slow city development
- If opponent relies heavily on one resource, target that resource's hexes
- Never place the robber on your own high-production hexes
- When stealing, target resources you immediately need for your next build

VICTORY PATH PLANNING:
- Target resource independence with at least one settlement/city on each resource
- Minimum viable infrastructure: 3-4 settlements total, with 2-3 upgraded to cities
- Calculate multiple paths to 10 VP and pursue the fastest:
  Path 1: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP)
  Path 2: 4 cities (8 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP)
  Path 3: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 victory point card
- Always track your direct path to 10 VP and focus on those builds
- Prioritize visible points (settlements/cities) over speculative development cards
- Switch paths if the opponent blocks your primary victory path
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Accept trades only when they enable an immediate, crucial build
- Never make trades that allow opponent to build a settlement or city immediately
- Trade away excess resources when at risk for robber (7+ cards)
- Calculate the production value of each settlement location before deciding to build
- When trading with ports, plan sequences that convert unwanted resources into needed ones

DETAILED DECISION FRAMEWORK:
1. Does this move bring me closer to 10 victory points?
2. Does this move increase my production capacity more than alternative builds?
3. Does this move protect me from being blocked or cut off?
4. Does this move position me for strongest expansion in next 2-3 turns?
5. Is this the most efficient use of my current resources?

Based on my analysis of the game logs and research on Catan strategies, I've made several key improvements to the prompt:

### Key Improvements:

1. **Initial Settlement Strategy** (Critical weakness found!)
   - Added stronger emphasis on targeting 6 & 8 number hexes as highest priority
   - Ensured covering ALL five resources between the two settlements
   - Added focus on probability dots rather than just numbers
   - Added consideration for expansion paths that won't be easily blocked

2. **Early Game Expansion** (New section)
   - Added explicit instructions to build at least one road and settlement ASAP
   - Emphasized securing missing resources through early expansion
   - Added strategy to prevent being cut off by opponent

3. **Mid-Game Resource Management** (Enhanced)
   - Set a target of 3 cities minimum (6 VP) rather than the ambiguous "2-3" from before
   - Added "always build a settlement when you have resources" to increase production
   - Added port trading strategies for resource balance

4. **Development Card Strategy** (Rebalanced)
   - Repositioned development cards as a supplement to expansion, not the primary strategy
   - Added specific conditions when development cards should be purchased
   - Improved Knight card usage strategy

5. **Victory Path Planning** (More precise)
   - Added multiple specific paths to 10 VP with exact calculations
   - Emphasized calculating the fastest path to victory
   - Added emphasis on visible points over speculative development cards

6. **Trading Strategy** (New section)
   - Added specific guidelines on when to accept trades
   - Added port trading sequence planning

These changes address the core weaknesses seen in the game logs where the player was:
- Not expanding enough (only 1.6 settlements vs opponent's 3.8)
- Not building enough cities (0.6 vs opponent's 2.0)
- Over-relying on development cards without balanced expansion
- Not focusing on optimal initial placements
- Not maintaining clear paths to victory

The prompt now specifically guides the player toward defeating the AlphaBeta algorithm opponent by adopting a more balanced, expansion-focused approach while still utilizing development cards strategically when appropriate.Evolve Counter: 2

You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist with expert development card planning. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Focus heavily on ore and wheat hexes for your initial settlements
- Place settlements on intersections of complementary resources (ore/wheat or wood/brick)
- Between your two settlements, secure at least one good source of each critical resource: ore, wheat, and sheep
- If you must sacrifice a resource, make it brick (unless a brick-port is available)
- Place initial roads toward valuable future expansion areas or resource-rich areas
- Consider ports that match resources you expect to produce in abundance (especially sheep)
- Avoid placing settlements that will be trapped with no expansion opportunities

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY (PRIMARY PATH TO VICTORY):
- Buy development cards whenever you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Development cards provide hidden victory points and tactical advantages
- Use knights strategically to protect your high-producing hexes from the robber
- Save knight cards for when your high-production hexes are blocked by the robber
- Time monopoly cards for when opponents likely have accumulated resources you need
- Use Year of Plenty cards to complete crucial builds when you're short specific resources
- Aggressively pursue largest army (2 VP) if you've already played 2 or more knights
- Aim to secure 3-4 victory point cards throughout the game for a surprise win
- Keep your victory points hidden until you can win in a single turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Early-game: Secure minimal expansion to reach critical resource spots or ports
- Mid-game: Focus heavily on ore and wheat to upgrade settlements to cities
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each potential build (cities give best return)
- Target 2-3 cities before extensive road building, unless going for longest road
- Avoid accumulating 7+ resources before dice rolls
- Never make trades that directly help opponents score immediate points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Avoid placing the robber where it equally hurts all players - be strategic
- Don't place the robber on resources you're deficient in - this reduces trading options
- Consider the timing of knight cards - save them for critical moments

PATH TO VICTORY PLANNING:
- Primary Win Path: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 10 VP
- Alternative Win Path: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + victory point cards (4 VP) = 10 VP
- Always track your potential hidden victory points vs. visible points
- If you have development cards giving you hidden points, focus on resource gathering
- When you're close to 10 points, calculate whether to reveal victory points immediately
- Keep track of your opponent's visible points AND potential hidden points
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads only when they lead to valuable settlement locations
- Prioritize settlements that increase your resource diversity or production probability
- Secure key ports that complement your resource production
- Block opponents' critical expansion paths
- Calculate whether longest road (2 VP) is worth the resource investment
- For each settlement expansion, evaluate whether the resources gained justify the cost

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Is there a faster path to 10 victory points?
2. Are development cards a more efficient way to get victory points right now?
3. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
4. Will this action help or hinder your opponent's strategy?
5. Do you have enough resources to execute your plan for the next few turns?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)================================== Ai Message ==================================

- try to avoid trading down to just a few cards with the bank and being stuck unable to build. Chances are, you're doing so for a resource you're finding hard to get and therefore other players will know they can disproportionately hurt you with the robber if they steal it.

- preserve juicy settlement locations with judicious road placement. Lock up that port that's critical to your strategy early. Nothing more infuriating than having an opponent beat you to it. [...] Do:- everything you can to get your first city. Liberally trade away sheep/brick/wood to do so. - encourage other players to compete for longest road.- make sure you leave at least one spot open for building a settlement. It is possible to win with 2 cities, largest army and 4 victory point cards, but you'd have to play well and get very lucky.- not get distracted by all that road- and settlement-building. Get those cities out.- hog the ore. Your strategy relies on you having the cities, and [...] This strategy guide does NOT tell you how to play the game. The rules are described very clearly in the game itself and are freely available online. This guide is to help those who know how to play already but want to be more competitive, whether in person, online, or even against those pesky 'bots. It's broken into parts: initial setup of settlements and roads, probabilities, development cards, the robber, five strategies to try (Commander, Developer, Producer, Explorer, and Queen of Sheep),

Additionally, since some of these tactics are a bit cold-blooded (doing whatever it takes to win), don’t expect everything included herein to keep your competition happy — user discretion is advised. Even though Catan is just a game and you should be able to do what’s best to win, people do take moves personally. Sometimes keeping people happy at the expense of short-term wins builds goodwill that could pay off down the line.

Anyways, let’s get started…

1. Know your competition

2. Bluffing [...] Here are some examples:

3. Cut people off, but don’t let it happen to you

Cut people off

Don’t get cut off

4. Avoid being the clear leader

5. Diversify your resources and number production

6. How to play your development cards

7. Robbers can decide games

Here are some pointers:

8. Always speak up

9. Think about win-scenarios

10. The person with the most points isn’t always winning

11. Yes, 11’s and 3’s roll

12. Table presence

13. Card tracking [...] 14. Involve yourself in others’ initial placements

15. Keep a low profile

16. Picking up development cards

If they…

17. Directing trades

Conclusion

Kudos to you for making it to the end. If you’re not an avid player and think a lot of this guide is excessive and was written by a crazy person overly obsessed with a board game..you’re probably right.

As a rule of thumb, during your first settlement placement, it’s usually best not to point your road toward the middle of the board. You will likely have no expansion spots since everyone will start toward the middle, rather than the coast.
Anytime your road is in a contestable direction, make sure you’re the one cutting someone off or are more likely to win the race — not the other way around. [...] Think of a Catan map as having 3 areas — the center, inner, and coastal rings. The “center” is all the spots around the middle hex, “inner” is the next one outward, and so on.
For starters, the coast never makes sense for your first placement as it will only have 2 hexes of production (3 for you to build more central) and it will inhibit your optionality to expand. [...] Even if it means choosing a slightly worse initial placement, it could be much better being two roads away from the coast if it will gain you access to two hexes with your next settlement.

Especially if the intersection of the two hexes has a port, this is even better.
However, this tactic does come with additional risk that you will be cut off and should only be done if you’re confident that the expansion will be unobstructed.
#10. Will your placement be offensive?

Colonist Strategies: What are the Best Catan Starting Strategies?

Today we will be giving you pointers on the best starting placement strategies for Settlers of Catan that you can use in Colonist.

Colonist.io

1. Identify Your Goals

The first and most important Catan Strategy is knowing what you want to build. This will dictate which resources you should go after when you place your starting settlements. [...] Overall, placing your starting settlements wisely will give you a huge advantage in Settlers of Catan. But this is just one of the many strategies that can be employed in the game.

It is very hard to employ all these tactics in every game though, as the board is arranged randomly by the system and your neighbors choices restrict yours.

However, having a good grasp of starting positions and initial placements will help greatly in winning you your next Colonist game. [...] Also you don’t want to overproduce resources which can’t be used and then lose them to a 7 roll.

A much more ideal setup would be an 8-5-10 placement, with a secondary placement of 6-9-4.

These are all good numbers, and you’ve got a variety, meaning that you’re more likely to collect on any given roll.

It’s not always possible to get good number variety, and you will more often than not have a duplicate number, but it’s important to be as diverse as possible.

The best way to do this is to place your two first settlements on intersections with six different numbers total with ideally, the highest probability.

player for Settlers of Catan. Speciﬁcally, we develop a move pruning heuris-tic for this game and introduce the ability to trade with the other players using the UCT algorithm. We empirically compare our new player with a baseline agent for Settlers of Catan as well as the state of the art and show that our algorithm generates superior strategies while taking fewer samples of the game. [...] 5 CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK We developed two domain-dependent heuristics, the move prun-ing, that uses domain knowledge to prune the game tree, and the trade-optimistic search that utilizes the UCT algorithm in order to trade in Catan. These heuristics provide substantial improvements to MCTS-based methods for the Settlers of Catan Game without rule changes. [...] 4.3 Experiments and results We tested various different agent conﬁgurations in games where our agent plays against three JSettlers agents. We carried experiments on the following agent conﬁgurations: • PlainUCT: Default UCT algorithm without any heuristic.
• VW-UCT: UCT algorithm with virtual wins, like described by [13].
• MP-UCT: UCT using our move pruning heuristic.

While the jsettlers agent’s decisions about initial placement are dependent only on which locations on the board generate the most resources (so that the sum of the estimated time to build each of the 4 types of pieces – road, settlement, city, development card – is minimised [14, pp. 87–93]), our new algorithm uses a comprehensive weighting function that: 1) Disfavours hexes that have the same number (because occupying hexes with different numbers enables the player to receive resources with a [...] B. Ranking build plans A particular weakness of the planning algorithm that com-putes the BBP used in the jsettlers and benchmark agents is that they use a nested sequence of heuristics that, by design, incorporates a global default preference for certain types of build plans over others: City ≻Settlement ≻Largest Army ≻ Longest Road ≻Development Card. The algorithm selects the highest build plan in this list that has an ETB lower than the next build plan in the list.

4.2 Constructing the Q-Learning Algorithm The second major step in creating the Catan simulator was split up in to two key parts: constructing and implementing a working reinforcement learning algorithm that, on each turn, could pick an action based on 2 the maximum reward that the player could achieve given the current state space of the board, rather than picking a random action to take. For this particular project, we decided that the Q-Learning algorithm would be the best algorithm to use, [...] column with the reward generated from the simulated game turn. The entry in the matrix was updated with the following Q-Learning formula: Q(s, a) ←Q(s, a)+α∗(r+γ∗maxa(Q(s′, a′))−Q(s, a)), where s is the old state space, a is the action, s’ is the current state space, a’ is the new action selected, α is the learning rate, and γ is the discount factor. This process encapsulated a bulk of the Q-Learning algorithm.

The last tool in the arsenal was to try and add “search” to the ValueFunctionPlayer. There was only one slight modification that I did to the standard Alpha-Beta Pruning algorithm, which was to take the expected value of the children when propagating values up the tree. This was to account the uncertainty in dice rolls, buying development cards, and stealing.

5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRITICAL FOR SUCCESS):
- Above all else, target the highest probability numbers (6 & 8) - these produce resources 5/36 times each
- Strictly prioritize access to all five resources between your two settlements
- Aim for numerical diversity - try to cover 5-6 different dice numbers across your settlements
- Never place initial settlements without analyzing future expansion opportunities
- Prioritize placement on hexes with complementary resources: ore/wheat and brick/wood
- Position roads toward high-value unoccupied areas the opponent cannot easily block
- Choose second settlement to complement your first settlement's resource weaknesses
- Consider 3:1 ports if you can't access a specific resource through settlements
- Analyze opponent placement to avoid contested expansion paths
- ALWAYS calculate production value using probability dots (5-6-8-9 are top priority numbers)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-10):
- Build at least one new settlement by turn 10 - expansion is your TOP priority
- Calculate and build along the fastest path to your next settlement location
- Secure missing resources through strategic settlement placement
- Build roads that secure critical expansion paths before the opponent blocks them
- Avoid development cards completely until you have at least 3 total settlements
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1) to complete critical builds
- Target resource diversity through your expansion locations
- Create a minimum 2-turn expansion plan and stick to it

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT AND PRODUCTION (CORE STRATEGY):
- Early game: Focus on wood/brick to expand with roads and settlements
- Mid game: Transition to ore/wheat focus for cities and development cards
- Calculate the resource production value of every potential build
- Only make 4:1 trades when they enable an immediate important build
- Cycle through "build phases" - expansion phase, then city upgrade phase
- Plan resource collection 2 turns ahead to minimize wasteful trades
- Never accumulate 7+ cards before dice rolls
- Diversify production to minimize dependency on any single resource
- Target a minimum of 4 total settlements before prioritizing city upgrades

COUNTERING ALPHABETA ALGORITHM:
- AlphaBeta looks ahead only 2 steps, so plan your moves 3-4 steps ahead
- Create deceptive game states that appear less threatening than they are
- Block the opponent's highest-probability expansion paths immediately
- Play defensively during early game, then aggressively in mid-game
- When opponent has 7+ points, disrupt their highest-producing hex with the robber
- Track opponent's resources and block their most likely next build
- Secure resources that the opponent depends on heavily
- Place roads to cut off opponent from accessing high-value settlement locations
- Position settlements to deny opponent access to key resource hex intersections

ROBBER PLACEMENT AND KNIGHT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-producing hex of your opponent
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat in mid-game when cities are being built
- Target the specific resource the opponent needs for their next likely build
- Use knight cards reactively when the robber blocks your best production
- Save knight cards for the late game if pursuing largest army
- When stealing, select resources that complete your immediate build needs
- Keep track of opponent cards and target resources they've been collecting
- Balance robber placement between disruption and resource acquisition

DEVELOPMENT CARDS VS. BUILDING:
- Only buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and cannot build
- Buy development cards when you're 1-2 knights away from largest army
- Use knight cards immediately when advantageous (don't save unless close to largest army)
- Victory point cards should only supplement your main strategy, not replace it
- Road Building cards are most valuable when you're cut off or racing to a key location
- Monopoly is best used after high-probability dice rolls to collect opponent's stockpile
- Year of Plenty is ideal to complete a high-value build (settlement or city)
- NEVER delay settlement/city building to purchase development cards unless 1 VP from winning

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY FOCUS):
- Aim for 5 total settlements (2 upgraded to cities) = 9 VP
- Then secure largest army OR longest road for the final point
- Always calculate the fastest path to 10 VP in terms of resource costs
- For each potential build, calculate how many turns closer it gets you to victory
- Determine which victory paths are still viable based on board state
- Switch strategies when your primary path is blocked
- Plan for the end-game by turn 10 (know exactly how you will reach 10 points)
- Track opponent's path to victory and actively disrupt with roads or robber

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Trade at ports even at 4:1 ratio if it enables immediate critical build
- NEVER trade with opponent unless it enables an immediate settlement/city build
- Avoid trades that allow opponent to build immediately after you
- Calculate the net VP gain of each potential trade
- Use trades to dispose of resources when at risk from robber
- Combine multiple port trades to convert unwanted resources into needed ones
- Be willing to overpay through port trades to secure critical positional advantage

DECISION FRAMEWORK (APPLY TO EVERY TURN):
1. What is my immediate build priority? (settlement > city > longest road/largest army)
2. What resource do I need to complete my highest priority build?
3. What is the fastest way to acquire that resource? (production, trading, development cards)
4. How will this action position me for the next 3 turns?
5. Will this action disrupt my opponent's path to victory?
6. Is there a way to combine multiple actions this turn for greater efficiency?

Board Understanding Guide:

Based on my analysis of the game logs and research, I've made several significant improvements to the prompt for the Catan Player. Here's a summary of the key changes:

1. **Enhanced Initial Placement Strategy:**
   - Emphasized numerical diversity on dice rolls to maximize consistent production
   - Added clear guidance on covering all five resources between the two settlements
   - Included specific consideration of production probability values (5-6-8-9 priority)
   - Added instruction to analyze opponent placement to avoid competition

2. **Early Game Expansion Focus:**
   - Set a specific goal of building at least one new settlement by turn 10
   - Directed the player to avoid development cards until reaching 3 total settlements
   - Emphasized securing missing resources through strategic settlement placement
   - Added guidance for creating a minimum 2-turn expansion plan

3. **Improved Resource Management:**
   - Created clearer phase-based strategy: wood/brick early, then ore/wheat mid-game
   - Added instructions to calculate resource production value for every potential build
   - Emphasized diversifying production to reduce dependency on single resources
   - Set a minimum goal of 4 total settlements before prioritizing city upgrades

4. **AlphaBeta Algorithm Counter-Strategy:**
   - Added specific tactics to counter the AlphaBeta algorithm, noting its 2-step look-ahead
   - Emphasized planning 3-4 moves ahead to outthink the algorithm
   - Included defensive early-game approach, then aggressive mid-game transitions
   - Added instructions for tracking opponent resources and blocking their likely builds

5. **More Effective Robber and Knight Usage:**
   - Added specific targeting guidance for robber placement based on opponent's needs
   - Provided clearer instruction on when to use knights reactively vs. saving them
   - Added guidance to track opponent cards and target resources they're collecting

6. **Revised Development Card Strategy:**
   - Limited development card purchases to only when excess resources are available
   - Emphasized using knight cards immediately when advantageous
   - Clarified that victory points should supplement the main strategy, not replace it
   - Added specific guidance for each development card type's optimal usage

7. **Clearer Victory Path:**
   - Set a specific goal: 5 settlements (2 upgraded to cities) = 9 VP + largest army/longest road
   - Added instruction to calculate the fastest path to 10 VP in terms of resource costs
   - Emphasized planning for the end-game by turn 10
   - Added guidance to track and disrupt opponent's victory path

8. **Structured Decision Framework:**
   - Added a 6-point checklist to apply on every turn
   - Established clear build priorities: settlement > city > longest road/largest army
   - Added consideration for positioning 3 turns ahead
   - Emphasized disrupting opponent's path to victory

These changes address the specific weaknesses identified in the game logs, where our player lacked early expansion, had inefficient resource management, and was not effectively countering the AlphaBeta algorithm's strategy.Evolve Counter: 1
