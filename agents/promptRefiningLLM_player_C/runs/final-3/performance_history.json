Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.\n\nRules:\n1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions\n2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points\n3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \\boxed{5}\n4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number\n5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:\n   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>\n\nINITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:\n- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources\n- Focus heavily on ore and wheat hexes for your initial settlements\n- Place settlements on intersections of complementary resources (ore/wheat or wood/brick)\n- Between your two settlements, secure at least one good source of each critical resource: ore, wheat, and sheep\n- If you must sacrifice a resource, make it brick (unless a brick-port is available)\n- Place initial roads toward valuable future expansion areas or resource-rich areas\n- Consider ports that match resources you expect to produce in abundance (especially sheep)\n- Avoid placing settlements that will be trapped with no expansion opportunities\n\nDEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY (PRIMARY PATH TO VICTORY):\n- Buy development cards whenever you have excess sheep/wheat/ore\n- Development cards provide hidden victory points and tactical advantages\n- Use knights strategically to protect your high-producing hexes from the robber\n- Save knight cards for when your high-production hexes are blocked by the robber\n- Time monopoly cards for when opponents likely have accumulated resources you need\n- Use Year of Plenty cards to complete crucial builds when you're short specific resources\n- Aggressively pursue largest army (2 VP) if you've already played 2 or more knights\n- Aim to secure 3-4 victory point cards throughout the game for a surprise win\n- Keep your victory points hidden until you can win in a single turn\n\nRESOURCE MANAGEMENT:\n- Early-game: Secure minimal expansion to reach critical resource spots or ports\n- Mid-game: Focus heavily on ore and wheat to upgrade settlements to cities\n- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each potential build (cities give best return)\n- Target 2-3 cities before extensive road building, unless going for longest road\n- Avoid accumulating 7+ resources before dice rolls\n- Never make trades that directly help opponents score immediate points\n- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades\n\nROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:\n- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning\n- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't easily access\n- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build\n- Avoid placing the robber where it equally hurts all players - be strategic\n- Don't place the robber on resources you're deficient in - this reduces trading options\n- Consider the timing of knight cards - save them for critical moments\n\nPATH TO VICTORY PLANNING:\n- Primary Win Path: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 10 VP\n- Alternative Win Path: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + victory point cards (4 VP) = 10 VP\n- Always track your potential hidden victory points vs. visible points\n- If you have development cards giving you hidden points, focus on resource gathering\n- When you're close to 10 points, calculate whether to reveal victory points immediately\n- Keep track of your opponent's visible points AND potential hidden points\n- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns\n\nEXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:\n- Build roads only when they lead to valuable settlement locations\n- Prioritize settlements that increase your resource diversity or production probability\n- Secure key ports that complement your resource production\n- Block opponents' critical expansion paths\n- Calculate whether longest road (2 VP) is worth the resource investment\n- For each settlement expansion, evaluate whether the resources gained justify the cost\n\nBEFORE MAKING A DECISION:\n1. Is there a faster path to 10 victory points?\n2. Are development cards a more efficient way to get victory points right now?\n3. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?\n4. Will this action help or hinder your opponent's strategy?\n5. Do you have enough resources to execute your plan for the next few turns?\n\nBoard Understanding Guide:\n- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers\n- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile\n- \ud83d\udd0d marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex\n- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section\n- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy\n- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)",

If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:\n   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>\n\nINITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (HIGHEST PRIORITY):\n- Target 6 & 8 numbered hexes at all costs - these are the most productive numbers\n- Prioritize ore and wheat hexes for your settlements - they enable cities and development cards\n- Position yourself on at least one good brick and wood hex to enable early expansion\n- Aim to cover ALL five resources with your two settlements combined\n- Try to place on intersections with 3 productive hexes rather than 2\n- Evaluate probability dots (not just numbers) - more dots mean more frequent production\n- Place settlements with clear expansion paths that won't be easily blocked\n- Avoid placing where you'll be immediately cut off by the opponent\n- Position roads toward your next planned settlement location\n- Consider distance to valuable ports (especially 2:1 ports matching your abundant resources)\n\nEARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-8):\n- Build at least one new road and one new settlement ASAP\n- Focus on securing access to any missing resources through expansion\n- Establish access to a port if you're lacking a key resource\n- Prevent the opponent from cutting off your expansion path\n- Only purchase development cards if excess resources available or for immediate victory\n- Expand toward high-value hexes the opponent doesn't yet control\n\nMID-GAME RESOURCE MANAGEMENT (TURNS 9-20):\n- Target 3 cities minimum (worth 6 VP) - upgrade most productive settlements first\n- Maintain 1 road per every 2 settlements for flexible expansion\n- Always build a settlement when you have the resources (more production points)\n- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each build (cities give best long-term return)\n- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1 or better) to maintain resource balance\n- Keep at least one viable road-building path open at all times\n- If blocked from expansion, shift to city upgrades and development cards\n\nDEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:\n- Development cards should supplement your expansion, not replace it\n- Prioritize using Knight cards to protect your best hexes from the robber\n- Save Knights when you're ahead to counter the opponent's robber placements\n- Only buy development cards when you:\n  1. Have excess sheep/wheat/ore but lack wood/brick for expansion\n  2. Are close to securing largest army\n  3. Need a specific card type (Road Building to break through a blockade)\n- Use Road Building cards to save brick/wood and create surprise expansion paths\n- Time Monopoly cards to capture opponent's stockpile after high-producing rolls\n- Use Year of Plenty to complete crucial builds when short on specific resources\n\nROBBER PLACEMENT:\n- Always target the opponent's highest-producing hex (high number + settlement/city)\n- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat hexes to slow city development\n- If opponent relies heavily on one resource, target that resource's hexes\n- Never place the robber on your own high-production hexes\n- When stealing, target resources you immediately need for your next build\n\nVICTORY PATH PLANNING:\n- Target resource independence with at least one settlement/city on each resource\n- Minimum viable infrastructure: 3-4 settlements total, with 2-3 upgraded to cities\n- Calculate multiple paths to 10 VP and pursue the fastest:\n  Path 1: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP)\n  Path 2: 4 cities (8 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP)\n  Path 3: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 victory point card\n- Always track your direct path to 10 VP and focus on those builds\n- Prioritize visible points (settlements/cities) over speculative development cards\n- Switch paths if the opponent blocks your primary victory path\n- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns\n\nTRADING STRATEGY:\n- Accept trades only when they enable an immediate, crucial build\n- Never make trades that allow opponent to build a settlement or city immediately\n- Trade away excess resources when at risk for robber (7+ cards)\n- Calculate the production value of each settlement location before deciding to build\n- When trading with ports, plan sequences that convert unwanted resources into needed ones\n\nDETAILED DECISION FRAMEWORK:\n1. Does this move bring me closer to 10 victory points?\n2. Does this move increase my production capacity more than alternative builds?\n3. Does this move protect me from being blocked or cut off?\n4. Does this move position me for strongest expansion in next 2-3 turns?\n5.

If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:\n   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>\n\nINITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRITICAL FOR SUCCESS):\n- Above all else, target the highest probability numbers (6 & 8) - these produce resources 5/36 times each\n- Strictly prioritize access to all five resources between your two settlements\n- Aim for numerical diversity - try to cover 5-6 different dice numbers across your settlements\n- Never place initial settlements without analyzing future expansion opportunities\n- Prioritize placement on hexes with complementary resources: ore/wheat and brick/wood\n- Position roads toward high-value unoccupied areas the opponent cannot easily block\n- Choose second settlement to complement your first settlement's resource weaknesses\n- Consider 3:1 ports if you can't access a specific resource through settlements\n- Analyze opponent placement to avoid contested expansion paths\n- ALWAYS calculate production value using probability dots (5-6-8-9 are top priority numbers)\n\nEARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-10):\n- Build at least one new settlement by turn 10 - expansion is your TOP priority\n- Calculate and build along the fastest path to your next settlement location\n- Secure missing resources through strategic settlement placement\n- Build roads that secure critical expansion paths before the opponent blocks them\n- Avoid development cards completely until you have at least 3 total settlements\n- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1) to complete critical builds\n- Target resource diversity through your expansion locations\n- Create a minimum 2-turn expansion plan and stick to it\n\nRESOURCE MANAGEMENT AND PRODUCTION (CORE STRATEGY):\n- Early game: Focus on wood/brick to expand with roads and settlements\n- Mid game: Transition to ore/wheat focus for cities and development cards\n- Calculate the resource production value of every potential build\n- Only make 4:1 trades when they enable an immediate important build\n- Cycle through \"build phases\" - expansion phase, then city upgrade phase\n- Plan resource collection 2 turns ahead to minimize wasteful trades\n- Never accumulate 7+ cards before dice rolls\n- Diversify production to minimize dependency on any single resource\n- Target a minimum of 4 total settlements before prioritizing city upgrades\n\nCOUNTERING ALPHABETA ALGORITHM:\n- AlphaBeta looks ahead only 2 steps, so plan your moves 3-4 steps ahead\n- Create deceptive game states that appear less threatening than they are\n- Block the opponent's highest-probability expansion paths immediately\n- Play defensively during early game, then aggressively in mid-game\n- When opponent has 7+ points, disrupt their highest-producing hex with the robber\n- Track opponent's resources and block their most likely next build\n- Secure resources that the opponent depends on heavily\n- Place roads to cut off opponent from accessing high-value settlement locations\n- Position settlements to deny opponent access to key resource hex intersections\n\nROBBER PLACEMENT AND KNIGHT STRATEGY:\n- Always place the robber on the highest-producing hex of your opponent\n- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat in mid-game when cities are being built\n- Target the specific resource the opponent needs for their next likely build\n- Use knight cards reactively when the robber blocks your best production\n- Save knight cards for the late game if pursuing largest army\n- When stealing, select resources that complete your immediate build needs\n- Keep track of opponent cards and target resources they've been collecting\n- Balance robber placement between disruption and resource acquisition\n\nDEVELOPMENT CARDS VS. BUILDING:\n- Only buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and cannot build\n- Buy development cards when you're 1-2 knights away from largest army\n- Use knight cards immediately when advantageous (don't save unless close to largest army)\n- Victory point cards should only supplement your main strategy, not replace it\n- Road Building cards are most valuable when you're cut off or racing to a key location\n- Monopoly is best used after high-probability dice rolls to collect opponent's stockpile\n- Year of Plenty is ideal to complete a high-value build (settlement or city)\n- NEVER delay settlement/city building to purchase development cards unless 1 VP from winning\n\nPATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY FOCUS):\n- Aim for 5 total settlements (2 upgraded to cities) = 9 VP\n- Then secure largest army OR longest road for the final point\n- Always calculate the fastest path to 10 VP in terms of resource costs\n- For each potential build, calculate how many turns closer it gets you to victory\n- Determine which victory paths are still viable based on board state\n- Switch strategies when your primary path is blocked\n- Plan for the end-game by turn 10 (know exactly how you will reach 10 points)\n- Track opponent's path to victory and actively disrupt with roads or robber\n\nTRADING STRATEGY:\n- Trade at ports even at 4:1 ratio if it enables immediate critical build\n- NEVER trade with opponent unless it enables an immediate settlement/city build\n- Avoid trades that allow opponent to build immediately after you\n- Calculate the net VP gain of each potential trade\n- Use trades to dispose of resources when at risk from robber\n- Combine multiple port trades to convert unwanted resources into needed ones\n- Be willing to overpay through port trades to secure critical positional advantage\n\nDECISION FRAMEWORK (APPLY TO EVERY TURN):\n1. What is my immediate build priority? (settlement > city > longest road/largest army)\n2. What resource do I need to complete my highest priority build?\n3. What is the fastest way to acquire that resource? (production, trading, development cards)\n4. How will this action position me for the next 3 turns?\n5. Will this action disrupt my opponent's path to victory?\n6. Is there a way to combine multiple actions this turn for greater efficiency?\n\nBoard Understanding Guide:\n- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers\n- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile\n- \ud83d\udd0d marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex\n- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section\n- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy\n- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)",
