PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist whose primary goal is to defeat the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (HIGHEST PRIORITY):
- Target 6 & 8 numbered hexes at all costs - these are the most productive numbers
- Prioritize ore and wheat hexes for your settlements - they enable cities and development cards
- Position yourself on at least one good brick and wood hex to enable early expansion
- Aim to cover ALL five resources with your two settlements combined
- Try to place on intersections with 3 productive hexes rather than 2
- Evaluate probability dots (not just numbers) - more dots mean more frequent production
- Place settlements with clear expansion paths that won't be easily blocked
- Avoid placing where you'll be immediately cut off by the opponent
- Position roads toward your next planned settlement location
- Consider distance to valuable ports (especially 2:1 ports matching your abundant resources)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-8):
- Build at least one new road and one new settlement ASAP
- Focus on securing access to any missing resources through expansion
- Establish access to a port if you're lacking a key resource
- Prevent the opponent from cutting off your expansion path
- Only purchase development cards if excess resources available or for immediate victory
- Expand toward high-value hexes the opponent doesn't yet control

MID-GAME RESOURCE MANAGEMENT (TURNS 9-20):
- Target 3 cities minimum (worth 6 VP) - upgrade most productive settlements first
- Maintain 1 road per every 2 settlements for flexible expansion
- Always build a settlement when you have the resources (more production points)
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each build (cities give best long-term return)
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1 or better) to maintain resource balance
- Keep at least one viable road-building path open at all times
- If blocked from expansion, shift to city upgrades and development cards

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Development cards should supplement your expansion, not replace it
- Prioritize using Knight cards to protect your best hexes from the robber
- Save Knights when you're ahead to counter the opponent's robber placements
- Only buy development cards when you:
  1. Have excess sheep/wheat/ore but lack wood/brick for expansion
  2. Are close to securing largest army
  3. Need a specific card type (Road Building to break through a blockade)
- Use Road Building cards to save brick/wood and create surprise expansion paths
- Time Monopoly cards to capture opponent's stockpile after high-producing rolls
- Use Year of Plenty to complete crucial builds when short on specific resources

ROBBER PLACEMENT:
- Always target the opponent's highest-producing hex (high number + settlement/city)
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat hexes to slow city development
- If opponent relies heavily on one resource, target that resource's hexes
- Never place the robber on your own high-production hexes
- When stealing, target resources you immediately need for your next build

VICTORY PATH PLANNING:
- Target resource independence with at least one settlement/city on each resource
- Minimum viable infrastructure: 3-4 settlements total, with 2-3 upgraded to cities
- Calculate multiple paths to 10 VP and pursue the fastest:
  Path 1: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP)
  Path 2: 4 cities (8 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP)
  Path 3: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 victory point card
- Always track your direct path to 10 VP and focus on those builds
- Prioritize visible points (settlements/cities) over speculative development cards
- Switch paths if the opponent blocks your primary victory path
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Accept trades only when they enable an immediate, crucial build
- Never make trades that allow opponent to build a settlement or city immediately
- Trade away excess resources when at risk for robber (7+ cards)
- Calculate the production value of each settlement location before deciding to build
- When trading with ports, plan sequences that convert unwanted resources into needed ones

DETAILED DECISION FRAMEWORK:
1. Does this move bring me closer to 10 victory points?
2. Does this move increase my production capacity more than alternative builds?
3. Does this move protect me from being blocked or cut off?
4. Does this move position me for strongest expansion in next 2-3 turns?
5. Is this the most efficient use of my current resources?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

RESPONSE:
# Initial Settlement Placement Analysis

This is my first settlement placement, which is crucial for establishing a strong position in the game. I'll analyze the options carefully since this will determine my resource production foundation.

## Node Analysis:

First, let's identify which resources and numbers each node connects to:

- Node 3: Connects to 🏜️(Desert with robber), ⛏️8[⭐⭐⭐], 🌾10[⭐⭐⭐] - Two productive tiles
- Node 4: Connects to ⛏️8[⭐⭐⭐], 🌾10[⭐⭐⭐], 🌾4[⭐] - Ore, wheat x2, but 4 is low production
- Node 9: Connects to 🏜️(Desert), 🧱6[⭐⭐⭐], 🌾10[⭐⭐⭐] - Brick and wheat
- Node 12: Connects to 🏜️(Desert), ⛏️8[⭐⭐⭐], 🏜️ - Only one productive hex (ore)
- Node 13: Connects to ⛏️8[⭐⭐⭐], ??, ?? - Limited visible options
- Node 15: Connects to ⛏️8[⭐⭐⭐], 🌾4[⭐], ?? - Ore and wheat

Most promising nodes based on productivity:
- Node 3: ⛏️8 + 🌾10 (excellent combo for city development)
- Node 4: ⛏️8 + 🌾10 + 🌾4 (access to both key resources for cities)
- Node 9: 🧱6 + 🌾10 (brick for early expansion plus wheat)

## Strategic Considerations:

1. Node 3 gives access to crucial ore (8) and wheat (10) - perfect for city strategy
2. Opponent already controls Node 1 with 🌾10, 🧱6, 🌲9 - they have wood, brick and wheat covered
3. Ore is typically the most valuable resource for mid-game city upgrades
4. Node 3 puts me adjacent to the current robber location, but it will move soon

<plan>
1. Place first settlement at Node 3 to secure ore and wheat (8 and 10)
2. For second settlement, aim to secure wood and sheep resources
3. Focus early expansion toward promising areas with production value
4. Target city upgrades by leveraging ore production from first settlement
</plan>

Node 3 gives me the best combination of high-producing numbers (8 and 10) on critical resources (ore and wheat) that I'll need for city upgrades. The 8-ore hex is especially valuable as it's one of the most productive number tiles and ore is often scarce but crucial for development.

# Initial Road Placement Analysis

I need to carefully consider where to place my first road as part of my initial setup. This is a critical decision that will determine my early expansion paths.

## Current Game State Analysis
- I have my first settlement at node 3, which produces:
  - Ore (8) - very valuable production with 3 dots
  - Wheat (10) - good production with 2 dots
- I'm missing: wood, brick, and sheep resources in my current settlement

## Road Options Analysis
- Option [0]: Build road at edge (2, 3)
  - Direction: Toward node 2 which connects to desert (no production) and brick (6)
  - Expansion potential: Could eventually reach node 9 (brick) or node 1 (wheat/wood/brick)
  
- Option [1]: Build road at edge (3, 4)
  - Direction: Toward node 4 which connects to ore (8) and wheat (4)
  - Expansion potential: Could reach node 5 or node 15 for a sheep connection
  
- Option [2]: Build road at edge (3, 12)
  - Direction: Toward node 12 which connects to desert and ore (8)
  - Expansion potential: Limited as it heads toward desert with only ore as a resource

## Strategic Considerations
1. I need access to missing resources (wood, brick, sheep)
2. My expansion paths should avoid being blocked by opponent
3. I should head toward promising settlement locations
4. I should prioritize high-production value nodes

Option [0] appears most strategic because:
- It heads toward brick (6) which I need for further expansion
- It opens a path toward node 1 where RED already has a settlement (with wood, wheat, brick)
- It could be part of a path that eventually reaches wood resources

<plan>
1. Place first road toward node 2 to begin path toward brick resources
2. For second settlement, aim to secure wood and sheep resources
3. Look to expand toward node 6-7-8 area to secure brick and potentially wood
4. Continue leveraging ore production from first settlement to upgrade to cities mid-game
</plan>

Based on this analysis, I'll choose option [0] to build a road at edge (2, 3).

# Analyzing the Initial Settlement Placement

I need to analyze the available nodes for my second initial settlement. This is a critical decision that will shape my entire game strategy, as I need to secure access to all five resources and position myself for strong production.

Let me first assess what resources I already have:
- My current settlement at node 3 gives me access to:
  - Wheat (10 - medium probability)
  - Ore (8 - high probability)

What I'm missing:
- Wood
- Brick
- Sheep

Let me evaluate each potential node by the resources they provide:

## Node Analysis:
- Node 5: Connected to Wheat(4) and Sheep(5) - Both low probability
- Node 7: Connected to Brick(6) - High probability
- Node 8: Connected to Brick(6) - High probability
- Node 9: Connected to Brick(6) - High probability
- Node 13: Connected to Ore(8) - High probability
- Node 14: Connected to Ore(8) - High probability
- Node 15: Connected to Ore(8) and Wheat(4) - Mixed probability
- Node 16: Connected to Wheat(4) and Sheep(5) - Both low probability
- Node 20: Connected to Sheep(5) and Wood(9) - Medium/low probability
- Node 22: Connected to Wood(9) - Medium probability
- Node 23: Connected to Wood(9) - Medium probability

The best nodes appear to be:
- Node 20: Gives me Sheep(5) + Wood(9) - covering two missing resources
- Node 7/8/9: Would give me Brick(6) - high probability on a missing resource
- Node 22/23: Would give me Wood(9) - medium probability on a missing resource

Since I already have Wheat(10) and Ore(8), I want to optimize for the missing resources. Looking at Node 20, it would give me both Wood and Sheep, leaving me only missing Brick. This would be the most efficient choice to cover most resource types.

<plan>
1. Place second initial settlement at Node 20 to secure access to both Wood and Sheep
2. In early game, trade for brick or expand toward brick resources
3. Use my strong ore production from first settlement to pursue city upgrades
4. Target expansion toward brick resources as soon as possible
5. Aim to build 3 cities and 2+ settlements for victory path
</plan>

Looking at the board connectivity, Node 20 connects to both Wood(9) and Sheep(5), giving me access to 4 out of 5 resources. This is the best strategic choice.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist whose primary goal is to defeat the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (HIGHEST PRIORITY):
- Target 6 & 8 numbered hexes at all costs - these are the most productive numbers
- Prioritize ore and wheat hexes for your settlements - they enable cities and development cards
- Position yourself on at least one good brick and wood hex to enable early expansion
- Aim to cover ALL five resources with your two settlements combined
- Try to place on intersections with 3 productive hexes rather than 2
- Evaluate probability dots (not just numbers) - more dots mean more frequent production
- Place settlements with clear expansion paths that won't be easily blocked
- Avoid placing where you'll be immediately cut off by the opponent
- Position roads toward your next planned settlement location
- Consider distance to valuable ports (especially 2:1 ports matching your abundant resources)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-8):
- Build at least one new road and one new settlement ASAP
- Focus on securing access to any missing resources through expansion
- Establish access to a port if you're lacking a key resource
- Prevent the opponent from cutting off your expansion path
- Only purchase development cards if excess resources available or for immediate victory
- Expand toward high-value hexes the opponent doesn't yet control

MID-GAME RESOURCE MANAGEMENT (TURNS 9-20):
- Target 3 cities minimum (worth 6 VP) - upgrade most productive settlements first
- Maintain 1 road per every 2 settlements for flexible expansion
- Always build a settlement when you have the resources (more production points)
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each build (cities give best long-term return)
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1 or better) to maintain resource balance
- Keep at least one viable road-building path open at all times
- If blocked from expansion, shift to city upgrades and development cards

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Development cards should supplement your expansion, not replace it
- Prioritize using Knight cards to protect your best hexes from the robber
- Save Knights when you're ahead to counter the opponent's robber placements
- Only buy development cards when you:
  1. Have excess sheep/wheat/ore but lack wood/brick for expansion
  2. Are close to securing largest army
  3. Need a specific card type (Road Building to break through a blockade)
- Use Road Building cards to save brick/wood and create surprise expansion paths
- Time Monopoly cards to capture opponent's stockpile after high-producing rolls
- Use Year of Plenty to complete crucial builds when short on specific resources

ROBBER PLACEMENT:
- Always target the opponent's highest-producing hex (high number + settlement/city)
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat hexes to slow city development
- If opponent relies heavily on one resource, target that resource's hexes
- Never place the robber on your own high-production hexes
- When stealing, target resources you immediately need for your next build

VICTORY PATH PLANNING:
- Target resource independence with at least one settlement/city on each resource
- Minimum viable infrastructure: 3-4 settlements total, with 2-3 upgraded to cities
- Calculate multiple paths to 10 VP and pursue the fastest:
  Path 1: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP)
  Path 2: 4 cities (8 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP)
  Path 3: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 victory point card
- Always track your direct path to 10 VP and focus on those builds
- Prioritize visible points (settlements/cities) over speculative development cards
- Switch paths if the opponent blocks your primary victory path
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Accept trades only when they enable an immediate, crucial build
- Never make trades that allow opponent to build a settlement or city immediately
- Trade away excess resources when at risk for robber (7+ cards)
- Calculate the production value of each settlement location before deciding to build
- When trading with ports, plan sequences that convert unwanted resources into needed ones

DETAILED DECISION FRAMEWORK:
1. Does this move bring me closer to 10 victory points?
2. Does this move increase my production capacity more than alternative builds?
3. Does this move protect me from being blocked or cut off?
4. Does this move position me for strongest expansion in next 2-3 turns?
5. Is this the most efficient use of my current resources?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Analyzing Initial Road Placement Options

I need to carefully plan my road placement from my second settlement at Node 20, as this will set my expansion path. Let me evaluate each option:

## Option [0]: Build road at edge (0, 20)
- This connects my settlement at Node 20 toward Node 0
- Node 0 sits on three resources: 🌾Wheat(10), 🌲Wood(9), and 🐑Sheep(5)
- This would create redundancy with my resources, as I already have access to Wood and Sheep at Node 20
- However, it would give me access to Wheat, which I already have at my first settlement
- This direction doesn't improve my resource diversity

## Option [1]: Build road at edge (19, 20)
- This connects toward Node 19
- Looking at the grid, Node 19 appears to connect to the 🐑Sheep(5) hex
- This doesn't provide new resource access and moves into a less productive area

## Option [2]: Build road at edge (20, 22)
- This connects toward Node 22
- Node 22 appears to be on the 🌲Wood(9) hex
- Like option 1, this doesn't introduce new resources to my portfolio

## Strategic Considerations:
1. I still lack brick resource access in both my settlements
2. My original plan mentioned expanding toward brick resources
3. Looking at the board, I see brick is at hex (1, -1, 0) with value 6 (productive)
4. The board shows RED has a settlement at node 1, which produces brick
5. I need to determine which road option positions me best for future expansion toward brick

Based on the node connections visible on the board, edge (0, 20) seems to put me in a better position to potentially reach a brick hex in future moves. This road extends toward the center of the board where more expansion options will exist, whereas the other options lead toward the edges.

<plan>
1. Build road from settlement at Node 20 toward Node 0 to open expansion paths
2. Target my next settlement near brick production (hex 6) to complete my resource diversity
3. Use my strong ore production from first settlement to pursue city upgrades
4. Continue to leverage wood and sheep from second settlement for development cards
5. Aim for 3 cities and 2+ settlements for victory path
</plan>

Therefore, my choice is:

# Moving the Robber - Strategic Analysis

I need to carefully analyze where to place the robber to maximize my advantage while hindering my opponent's production.

## Step 1: Evaluate all robber placement options

Let me analyze each hex by examining:
- What resource it produces
- The probability of that resource being rolled (dots)
- Who has settlements/cities there

[0] Move to (0, 0, 0) - wheat hex with value 10 (⭐)
- Both RED and BLUE have settlements here
- This would block my own wheat production at node 3
- Not ideal as it hurts my production too

[1] Move to (1, -1, 0) - brick hex with value 6 (⭐⭐⭐)
- RED has a settlement here
- This is a high-probability hex (6 = 3 dots)
- Brick is critical for early expansion
- Excellent option to block RED's brick production

[2] Move to (-1, 0, 1) - ore hex with value 8 (⭐⭐⭐)
- This is my ore production at node 3
- Would be self-sabotage to place here
- Never an option

[3] Move to (-1, 1, 0) - wheat hex with value 4 (⭐)
- RED has a settlement here
- Low probability production (4 = 1 dot)
- Not an efficient block

[4] Move to (0, 1, -1) - sheep hex with value 5 (⭐⭐)
- Both RED and BLUE have settlements here
- Would block my own sheep production
- Not ideal as it hurts me too

[5] Move to (1, 0, -1) - wood hex with value 9 (⭐⭐)
- Both RED and BLUE have settlements here
- Would block my own wood production
- Not ideal as it hurts me too

## Step 2: Consider my current resources and immediate needs

I currently have:
- 1 Wood, 3 Sheep
- I'm lacking brick, wheat and ore

## Step 3: Consider my opponent's position

RED has:
- Settlements producing brick (6), wheat (10, 4), sheep (5), and wood (9)
- 5 hidden resource cards
- Brick access is crucial for expansion and RED has a settlement on the only brick hex

## Decision Making

The optimal choice is clearly [1] - placing the robber on the brick hex (1, -1, 0) with value 6:

1. This blocks RED's exclusive brick production (highest dots, ⭐⭐⭐)
2. Brick is crucial for early expansion and will significantly slow RED's ability to build roads
3. I don't have any brick production myself, so this doesn't harm me
4. I'll get to steal a resource from RED, potentially gaining the brick I need
5. RED has 5 cards, increasing my chances of stealing something valuable

<plan>
1. Place robber on brick hex to slow RED's expansion
2. Focus on building my next road from settlement at Node 20 to Node 19
3. Aim for my next settlement near brick production or a brick port
4. Continue leveraging my strong ore production for city upgrades later
5. Use development cards strategically if expansion is blocked
6. Target 3 cities and 2+ settlements path to victory
</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist whose primary goal is to defeat the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (HIGHEST PRIORITY):
- Target 6 & 8 numbered hexes at all costs - these are the most productive numbers
- Prioritize ore and wheat hexes for your settlements - they enable cities and development cards
- Position yourself on at least one good brick and wood hex to enable early expansion
- Aim to cover ALL five resources with your two settlements combined
- Try to place on intersections with 3 productive hexes rather than 2
- Evaluate probability dots (not just numbers) - more dots mean more frequent production
- Place settlements with clear expansion paths that won't be easily blocked
- Avoid placing where you'll be immediately cut off by the opponent
- Position roads toward your next planned settlement location
- Consider distance to valuable ports (especially 2:1 ports matching your abundant resources)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-8):
- Build at least one new road and one new settlement ASAP
- Focus on securing access to any missing resources through expansion
- Establish access to a port if you're lacking a key resource
- Prevent the opponent from cutting off your expansion path
- Only purchase development cards if excess resources available or for immediate victory
- Expand toward high-value hexes the opponent doesn't yet control

MID-GAME RESOURCE MANAGEMENT (TURNS 9-20):
- Target 3 cities minimum (worth 6 VP) - upgrade most productive settlements first
- Maintain 1 road per every 2 settlements for flexible expansion
- Always build a settlement when you have the resources (more production points)
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each build (cities give best long-term return)
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1 or better) to maintain resource balance
- Keep at least one viable road-building path open at all times
- If blocked from expansion, shift to city upgrades and development cards

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Development cards should supplement your expansion, not replace it
- Prioritize using Knight cards to protect your best hexes from the robber
- Save Knights when you're ahead to counter the opponent's robber placements
- Only buy development cards when you:
  1. Have excess sheep/wheat/ore but lack wood/brick for expansion
  2. Are close to securing largest army
  3. Need a specific card type (Road Building to break through a blockade)
- Use Road Building cards to save brick/wood and create surprise expansion paths
- Time Monopoly cards to capture opponent's stockpile after high-producing rolls
- Use Year of Plenty to complete crucial builds when short on specific resources

ROBBER PLACEMENT:
- Always target the opponent's highest-producing hex (high number + settlement/city)
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat hexes to slow city development
- If opponent relies heavily on one resource, target that resource's hexes
- Never place the robber on your own high-production hexes
- When stealing, target resources you immediately need for your next build

VICTORY PATH PLANNING:
- Target resource independence with at least one settlement/city on each resource
- Minimum viable infrastructure: 3-4 settlements total, with 2-3 upgraded to cities
- Calculate multiple paths to 10 VP and pursue the fastest:
  Path 1: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP)
  Path 2: 4 cities (8 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP)
  Path 3: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 victory point card
- Always track your direct path to 10 VP and focus on those builds
- Prioritize visible points (settlements/cities) over speculative development cards
- Switch paths if the opponent blocks your primary victory path
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Accept trades only when they enable an immediate, crucial build
- Never make trades that allow opponent to build a settlement or city immediately
- Trade away excess resources when at risk for robber (7+ cards)
- Calculate the production value of each settlement location before deciding to build
- When trading with ports, plan sequences that convert unwanted resources into needed ones

DETAILED DECISION FRAMEWORK:
1. Does this move bring me closer to 10 victory points?
2. Does this move increase my production capacity more than alternative builds?
3. Does this move protect me from being blocked or cut off?
4. Does this move position me for strongest expansion in next 2-3 turns?
5. Is this the most efficient use of my current resources?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 11 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Place robber on brick hex to slow RED's expansion
2. Focus on building my next road from settlement at Node 20 to Node 19
3. Aim for my next settlement near brick production or a brick port
4. Continue leveraging my strong ore production for city upgrades later
5. Use development cards strategically if expansion is blocked

# Game State Analysis

Let me analyze my current position and available options:

## Current Resources
- 4 🌲WOOD
- 3 🐑SHEEP
- 1 🌾WHEAT
- 0 🧱BRICK
- 0 ⛏️ORE

## Victory Points Status
- I have 2 VPs (2 settlements)
- RED also has 2 VPs (2 settlements)
- We're tied, still early in the game

## Production Analysis
My settlements produce:
- Node 3: 🌾10[⭐], ⛏️8[⭐⭐⭐] (wheat and high-value ore)
- Node 20: 🐑5[⭐⭐], 🌲9[⭐⭐] (sheep and wood)

I have good production of wood and sheep, and decent wheat and ore production, but I'm completely lacking brick production.

## Expansion Opportunities
Looking at the current board, I need brick to build roads and settlements. My planned expansion from Node 20 to Node 19 requires brick, which I don't have. I can't build anything with my current resources.

## Action Assessment
1. End turn: This preserves my resources but doesn't advance my position.
2. Trade options: I could trade 4 wood for 1 brick to enable expansion.

<plan>
1. Trade 4 wood for 1 brick using the port
2. Build a road from Node 20 to Node 19 when I have enough brick
3. Continue expanding toward more brick production
4. Focus on city upgrades at my ore-producing settlement later
5. Target the standard 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) path
</plan>

Since I have 4 wood and need brick for expansion, the most strategic option is to trade for brick to advance my plan. Without brick, I can't build roads or settlements to expand. So I'll trade 4 wood for 1 brick.

# Move Robber Decision Analysis

First, I need to carefully analyze the game state and identify the best move for the robber.

## Current Game State Assessment:
- RED has 2 VP, same as me
- RED has 5 hidden resources
- I have 1 🧱BRICK, 3 🐑SHEEP, 2 🌾WHEAT
- My plan includes building a road from Node 20 to 19 (which requires brick)
- The robber is currently on (1, -1, 0) which is a brick hex with number 6 (high probability)

## Robber Placement Options:
Let me analyze each option:

[0] Move robber to (0, 0, 0) and steal from RED
- This is a wheat hex with number 10 (medium probability)
- This would block RED's wheat production from both settlements
- Reduces wheat availability overall

[1] Move robber to (0, -1, 1) 
- This is a desert hex which produces nothing
- Moving here serves no strategic purpose
- No theft opportunity

[2] Move robber to (-1, 0, 1)
- This is an ore hex with number 8 (high probability)
- This blocks my own ore production at node 3
- No theft opportunity
- Would hurt my city upgrade capabilities

[3] Move robber to (-1, 1, 0) and steal from RED
- This is a wheat hex with number 4 (low probability)
- Blocks RED's wheat production at node 5
- Stealing opportunity

[4] Move robber to (0, 1, -1) and steal from RED
- This is a sheep hex with number 5 (medium probability)
- Blocks both RED's sheep production at node 5 and my own at node 20
- Stealing opportunity but hurts my production too

[5] Move robber to (1, 0, -1) and steal from RED
- This is a wood hex with number 9 (medium probability)
- Blocks RED's wood production at node 1 and my own at node 20
- Stealing opportunity but hurts my production too

## Strategic Considerations:

1. I need to block RED's most productive hexes
2. I should avoid blocking my own production
3. I need to target resources that RED is likely to have
4. I should avoid hurting my own development path

RED's most productive settlement is at node 1 producing 🌾10, 🧱6, 🌲9. 
The 6-brick hex is already blocked by the robber.

Given our current plan needs brick, and RED is producing brick at a high rate (number 6), I should try to steal brick from them if possible.

Option [0] is strongest strategically because:
- It blocks RED's wheat production from both settlements (10 is mid-probability)
- It allows me to steal from RED, potentially getting the brick I need
- It doesn't block any of my own production
- Wheat is critical for RED's development (cities and development cards)

<plan>
1. Move robber to wheat hex (0,0,0) and steal from RED, hoping to get brick
2. Trade for brick using port if needed
3. Build road from Node 20 to Node 19 when I have enough brick
4. Continue expanding toward more brick production
5. Focus on city upgrades at my ore-producing settlement later
6. Target the standard 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) path
</plan>

Based on this analysis, I will:

- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each build (cities give best long-term return)
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1 or better) to maintain resource balance
- Keep at least one viable road-building path open at all times
- If blocked from expansion, shift to city upgrades and development cards

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Development cards should supplement your expansion, not replace it
- Prioritize using Knight cards to protect your best hexes from the robber
- Save Knights when you're ahead to counter the opponent's robber placements
- Only buy development cards when you:
  1. Have excess sheep/wheat/ore but lack wood/brick for expansion
  2. Are close to securing largest army
  3. Need a specific card type (Road Building to break through a blockade)
- Use Road Building cards to save brick/wood and create surprise expansion paths
- Time Monopoly cards to capture opponent's stockpile after high-producing rolls
- Use Year of Plenty to complete crucial builds when short on specific resources

ROBBER PLACEMENT:
- Always target the opponent's highest-producing hex (high number + settlement/city)
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat hexes to slow city development
- If opponent relies heavily on one resource, target that resource's hexes
- Never place the robber on your own high-production hexes
- When stealing, target resources you immediately need for your next build

VICTORY PATH PLANNING:
- Target resource independence with at least one settlement/city on each resource
- Minimum viable infrastructure: 3-4 settlements total, with 2-3 upgraded to cities
- Calculate multiple paths to 10 VP and pursue the fastest:
  Path 1: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP)
  Path 2: 4 cities (8 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP)
  Path 3: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 victory point card
- Always track your direct path to 10 VP and focus on those builds
- Prioritize visible points (settlements/cities) over speculative development cards
- Switch paths if the opponent blocks your primary victory path
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Accept trades only when they enable an immediate, crucial build
- Never make trades that allow opponent to build a settlement or city immediately
- Trade away excess resources when at risk for robber (7+ cards)
- Calculate the production value of each settlement location before deciding to build
- When trading with ports, plan sequences that convert unwanted resources into needed ones

DETAILED DECISION FRAMEWORK:
1. Does this move bring me closer to 10 victory points?
2. Does this move increase my production capacity more than alternative builds?
3. Does this move protect me from being blocked or cut off?
4. Does this move position me for strongest expansion in next 2-3 turns?
5. Is this the most efficient use of my current resources?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 15 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Move robber to wheat hex (0,0,0) and steal from RED, hoping to get brick
2. Trade for brick using port if needed
3. Build road from Node 20 to Node 19 when I have enough brick
4. Continue expanding toward more brick production
5. Focus on city upgrades at my ore-producing settlement later
6. Target the standard 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) path

# Game Analysis

Let me carefully evaluate the current game state and my options:

## Current Resources
- 1 🧱BRICK
- 4 🐑SHEEP
- 2 🌾WHEAT
- Missing: 🌲WOOD and ⛏️ORE

## Victory Points Status
- I have 2 VP (2 settlements)
- RED also has 2 VP (2 settlements)

## Production Assessment
- My settlement at node 3 produces wheat (10) and ore (8) - this is excellent
- My settlement at node 20 produces sheep (5) and wood (9) - good production
- I'm missing reliable brick production, which is limiting my expansion

## Available Actions
- End turn [0]
- Trade 4 sheep for various resources [1-4]

## Strategic Reasoning

I have 4 sheep which I can trade for another resource. Looking at my current production:
- I get wheat from my settlement at node 3
- I get wood from my settlement at node 20
- I get ore from my settlement at node 3
- I get sheep from my settlement at node 20
- I'm missing reliable brick production

My current brick (1) is not enough to build a road (requires 1 wood + 1 brick). Since my current plan involves building a road from Node 20 to Node 19, I need to acquire more brick.

Trading 4 sheep for 1 brick [4] would give me 2 brick total, allowing me to build a road when I also get wood from my settlement at node 20.

<plan>
1. Trade 4 sheep for 1 brick now
2. Wait to collect wood from node 20 (9 production)
3. Build road from Node 20 to Node 19 as soon as I have the wood
4. Continue expanding toward the east side of the board for better resource diversity
5. Target settlement placement near brick production
6. Focus on city upgrades at my ore-producing settlement (node 3) when possible
7. Maintain the standard 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) victory path
</plan>

Given my current situation and strategic plan, I'll trade 4 sheep for 1 brick to enable future road construction.

PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist whose primary goal is to defeat the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (HIGHEST PRIORITY):
- Target 6 & 8 numbered hexes at all costs - these are the most productive numbers
- Prioritize ore and wheat hexes for your settlements - they enable cities and development cards
- Position yourself on at least one good brick and wood hex to enable early expansion
- Aim to cover ALL five resources with your two settlements combined
- Try to place on intersections with 3 productive hexes rather than 2
- Evaluate probability dots (not just numbers) - more dots mean more frequent production
- Place settlements with clear expansion paths that won't be easily blocked
- Avoid placing where you'll be immediately cut off by the opponent
- Position roads toward your next planned settlement location
- Consider distance to valuable ports (especially 2:1 ports matching your abundant resources)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-8):
- Build at least one new road and one new settlement ASAP
- Focus on securing access to any missing resources through expansion
- Establish access to a port if you're lacking a key resource
- Prevent the opponent from cutting off your expansion path
- Only purchase development cards if excess resources available or for immediate victory
- Expand toward high-value hexes the opponent doesn't yet control

MID-GAME RESOURCE MANAGEMENT (TURNS 9-20):
- Target 3 cities minimum (worth 6 VP) - upgrade most productive settlements first
- Maintain 1 road per every 2 settlements for flexible expansion
- Always build a settlement when you have the resources (more production points)
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each build (cities give best long-term return)
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1 or better) to maintain resource balance
- Keep at least one viable road-building path open at all times
- If blocked from expansion, shift to city upgrades and development cards

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Development cards should supplement your expansion, not replace it

  2. Are close to securing largest army
  3. Need a specific card type (Road Building to break through a blockade)
- Use Road Building cards to save brick/wood and create surprise expansion paths

# Analyzing Robber Placement Options

I need to strategically place the robber to disrupt my opponent's production while maximizing my own chances of getting a useful resource. Let me examine each option carefully:

## Option Analysis
- [0] Move robber to (0, 0, 0) - This is a wheat hex with value 10 (high production). RED has two settlements on this hex, so it's very productive for them.
- [1] Move robber to (1, -1, 0) - This is a brick hex with value 6 (good production). RED has a settlement here, and brick is a valuable resource.
- [2] Move robber to (-1, 0, 1) - This is an ore hex with value 8 (excellent production). RED has a settlement here, and ore is crucial for city upgrades.
- [3] Move robber to (-1, 1, 0) - This is a wheat hex with value 4 (low production). RED has two settlements here, but the productivity is lower.
- [4] Move robber to (0, 1, -1) - This is a sheep hex with value 5 (medium production). RED has a settlement here.
- [5] Move robber to (1, 0, -1) - This is a wood hex with value 9 (good production). RED has a settlement here, and I also have a settlement on this hex.

## Strategic Considerations
1. I should avoid option [5] since it would block my own wood production, which I need for my planned road.
2. Options [0] and [2] target the highest-producing hexes for RED (10 and 8).
3. Looking at RED's settlements, they're focused on wheat, brick, and ore - all crucial resources.
4. I already have 2 brick, so stealing more brick would be less valuable than other resources.

## Optimal Decision
Option [0] is the strongest choice because:
- It targets a high-value wheat hex (10)
- RED has TWO settlements producing from this hex, making it a major production center
- Blocking wheat will significantly hamper RED's ability to build settlements and development cards
- When stealing, I could get wheat (useful for my expansion) or another resource RED has

<plan>
1. Place robber on the wheat 10 hex to block RED's major wheat production
2. Continue working toward a road from Node 20 to Node 19 with my current brick and future wood
3. Target settlement at Node 19 next to access the 5 sheep hex for better resource diversity
4. Focus on upgrading my settlement at Node 3 to a city once I accumulate ore and wheat
5. Work toward largest army by buying development cards when I have excess sheep/wheat/ore

# Analyzing Game State

I need to select the best hex to place the robber and potentially steal a resource from RED.

## Current Game Status
- I (BLUE) have 2 VP, RED has 3 VP
- Resources: 1 brick, 1 sheep, 2 wheat
- I need to continue my plan of building toward node 19 and upgrading settlements to cities

## Robber Placement Options Analysis

### Option [0] - Wheat Hex (0,0,0) with value 10
- This hex produces wheat for both RED and myself
- RED has a settlement at node 1 connected to this hex (produces wheat)
- RED has a settlement at node 5 connected to this hex (produces wheat)
- I have a settlement at node 3 connected to this hex (produces wheat)
- This is RED's major wheat producer (2 settlements) but also MY wheat producer

### Option [1] - Brick Hex (1,-1,0) with value 6
- This hex produces brick for RED only
- RED has a settlement at node 1 connected to this hex
- Brick has high dot count (⭐⭐⭐) meaning it produces frequently
- Blocking brick would slow RED's expansion considerably

### Option [2] - Desert Hex (0,-1,1)
- This is a desert with no production
- Placing the robber here wastes the opportunity

### Option [3] - Wheat Hex (-1,1,0) with value 4
- This hex produces wheat for RED only
- RED has settlements at node 5 and node 15 connected to this hex
- However, this is a low production hex (value 4, ⭐)

### Option [4] - Sheep Hex (0,1,-1) with value 5
- This hex produces sheep for both RED and myself
- RED has a settlement at node 5 connected to this hex
- I have a settlement at node 20 connected to this hex
- Moderate production (value 5, ⭐⭐)

### Option [5] - Wood Hex (1,0,-1) with value 9
- This hex produces wood for both RED and myself
- RED has a settlement at node 1 connected to this hex
- I have a settlement at node 20 connected to this hex
- Good production (value 9, ⭐⭐)

## Strategic Considerations
1. I should avoid placing the robber on hexes that also produce for me (options 0, 4, 5)
2. The brick hex is very valuable for RED's expansion (⭐⭐⭐ production)
3. RED has 6 hidden cards, which means they likely have resources to build
4. I need to prevent RED from building more while I work toward my plan

<plan>
1. Place robber on the brick hex (1,-1,0) to block RED's high-production brick source
2. Use my brick and future resources to build road from Node 20 to Node 19
3. Target settlement at Node 19 next to access the sheep hex
4. Focus on upgrading my settlement at Node 3 to a city once I accumulate ore and wheat
5. Work toward largest army by buying development cards when I have excess sheep/wheat/ore
</plan>

The best move is to place the robber on the brick hex with value 6. This will block RED's only source of brick (with high production ⭐⭐⭐) and potentially steal a resource from them. This directly interferes with their ability to build roads and settlements, slowing their expansion while I work toward mine.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist whose primary goal is to defeat the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (HIGHEST PRIORITY):
- Target 6 & 8 numbered hexes at all costs - these are the most productive numbers
- Prioritize ore and wheat hexes for your settlements - they enable cities and development cards
- Position yourself on at least one good brick and wood hex to enable early expansion
- Aim to cover ALL five resources with your two settlements combined
- Try to place on intersections with 3 productive hexes rather than 2
- Evaluate probability dots (not just numbers) - more dots mean more frequent production
- Place settlements with clear expansion paths that won't be easily blocked
- Avoid placing where you'll be immediately cut off by the opponent
- Position roads toward your next planned settlement location
- Consider distance to valuable ports (especially 2:1 ports matching your abundant resources)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-8):
- Build at least one new road and one new settlement ASAP
- Focus on securing access to any missing resources through expansion
- Establish access to a port if you're lacking a key resource
- Prevent the opponent from cutting off your expansion path
- Only purchase development cards if excess resources available or for immediate victory
- Expand toward high-value hexes the opponent doesn't yet control

MID-GAME RESOURCE MANAGEMENT (TURNS 9-20):
- Target 3 cities minimum (worth 6 VP) - upgrade most productive settlements first
- Maintain 1 road per every 2 settlements for flexible expansion
- Always build a settlement when you have the resources (more production points)
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each build (cities give best long-term return)
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1 or better) to maintain resource balance
- Keep at least one viable road-building path open at all times
- If blocked from expansion, shift to city upgrades and development cards

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Development cards should supplement your expansion, not replace it
- Prioritize using Knight cards to protect your best hexes from the robber
- Save Knights when you're ahead to counter the opponent's robber placements
- Only buy development cards when you:
  1. Have excess sheep/wheat/ore but lack wood/brick for expansion
  2. Are close to securing largest army
  3. Need a specific card type (Road Building to break through a blockade)
- Use Road Building cards to save brick/wood and create surprise expansion paths
- Time Monopoly cards to capture opponent's stockpile after high-producing rolls
- Use Year of Plenty to complete crucial builds when short on specific resources

ROBBER PLACEMENT:
- Always target the opponent's highest-producing hex (high number + settlement/city)
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat hexes to slow city development
- If opponent relies heavily on one resource, target that resource's hexes
- Never place the robber on your own high-production hexes
- When stealing, target resources you immediately need for your next build

VICTORY PATH PLANNING:
- Target resource independence with at least one settlement/city on each resource
- Minimum viable infrastructure: 3-4 settlements total, with 2-3 upgraded to cities
- Calculate multiple paths to 10 VP and pursue the fastest:
  Path 1: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP)
  Path 2: 4 cities (8 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP)
  Path 3: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 victory point card
- Always track your direct path to 10 VP and focus on those builds
- Prioritize visible points (settlements/cities) over speculative development cards
- Switch paths if the opponent blocks your primary victory path
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Accept trades only when they enable an immediate, crucial build
- Never make trades that allow opponent to build a settlement or city immediately
- Trade away excess resources when at risk for robber (7+ cards)
- Calculate the production value of each settlement location before deciding to build
- When trading with ports, plan sequences that convert unwanted resources into needed ones

DETAILED DECISION FRAMEWORK:
1. Does this move bring me closer to 10 victory points?
2. Does this move increase my production capacity more than alternative builds?
3. Does this move protect me from being blocked or cut off?
4. Does this move position me for strongest expansion in next 2-3 turns?
5. Is this the most efficient use of my current resources?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 31 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Place robber on the brick hex (1,-1,0) to block RED's high-production brick source
2. Use my brick and future resources to build road from Node 20 to Node 19
3. Target settlement at Node 19 next to access the sheep hex
4. Focus on upgrading my settlement at Node 3 to a city once I accumulate ore and wheat
5. Work toward largest army by buying development cards when I have excess sheep/wheat/ore

# Game Analysis for Turn 31

I need to analyze my current position and available actions to determine the optimal move.

## Current Game State Assessment
- I have 2 VP (2 settlements)
- RED has 4 VP (4 settlements)
- Resources: 2 Wood, 1 Sheep, 3 Wheat, 1 Ore
- Available actions: End turn or Buy development card

## Resource Analysis
I have exactly enough resources to buy a development card (1 Sheep, 1 Wheat, 1 Ore). After purchase, I'd have 2 Wood, 2 Wheat remaining.

## Development Card Benefits
1. **Knight (most common)**: Would let me move the robber and steal a resource
2. **Victory Point**: Immediate hidden VP
3. **Road Building**: Free 2 roads (valuable for expansion)
4. **Year of Plenty**: 2 resources of my choice
5. **Monopoly**: Potential for large resource gain

## Strategic Considerations
- I'm behind RED by 2 VP, so need to accelerate my progress
- My current settlement at Node 3 produces on valuable numbers (8, 10)
- I need more brick to continue with road building plans
- Knights help toward largest army (2 VP)
- Development cards remain hidden until played, giving me strategic advantage

## Current Plan Review
My plan involves building a road to Node 19 and placing a settlement there, but I lack brick. I also want to work toward largest army and upgrade my settlement at Node 3.

<plan>
1. Buy a development card now - hoping for a Knight or Victory Point
2. Continue targeting settlement at Node 19 by building road from Node 20 once I get brick
3. Focus on upgrading settlement at Node 3 to a city (need 2 more ore, 2 more wheat)
4. Work toward largest army by buying more development cards when possible
5. Place robber on RED's key production hexes when playing Knights
</plan>

Buying a development card is optimal because:
- It uses resources I have right now
- It advances me toward largest army if I get a Knight
- If I get a Victory Point card, I immediately close the gap with RED
- It provides tactical flexibility for future turns
- I can't build roads or settlements without brick anyway

The decision is clear - I should buy a development card now.

# Game Analysis for Settlers of Catan Turn 33

Let me analyze the current game state and my available options to make the optimal decision.

## Current Game State Assessment
- I have 2 VP from my 2 settlements (Node 3 produces 8-ore and 10-wheat, Node 20 produces 5-sheep and 9-wood)
- My resources: 2 wood, 1 sheep, 2 wheat (no brick or ore)
- I have 1 Monopoly development card available to play
- RED has 4 VP from 4 settlements and has 4 hidden resource cards
- The robber is on the desert hex, so not blocking any production

## Action Options Analysis
I can either:
1. Play my Monopoly card targeting one resource type (options 0-4)
2. Roll the dice (option 5)

### Monopoly Card Analysis
The Monopoly card would let me take all of one resource type from my opponent. RED has 4 hidden cards.

Looking at RED's production:
- Strong brick production (two 6-brick hexes with settlements)
- Good wood production (one 9-wood hex)
- Good wheat production (multiple wheat hexes)
- Some sheep and ore production

If I target brick, I might get multiple bricks which would help me build roads toward my planned settlement at Node 19. Brick seems most valuable since it's the resource I completely lack and RED likely has at least one.

Alternatively, I could target ore which I also lack but need for upgrading my settlement to a city.

### Roll Option Analysis
If I roll, I could potentially gain more resources before playing my Monopoly card. However, if I roll a 7, I'll have to move the robber and won't be able to play the Monopoly card this turn, losing a strategic opportunity.

## Strategic Decision
I don't see an immediate need to play the Monopoly card now. The ideal timing would be after RED collects several resources, especially bricks.

Rolling first gives me a chance to gain more resources and potentially puts me in a better position to make an impactful build after playing Monopoly in a subsequent turn.

<plan>
1. Roll the dice first to collect more resources
2. Save Monopoly card for when RED accumulates more resources (ideally bricks)
3. Continue targeting settlement at Node 19 by building road from Node 20 once I get brick
4. Focus on upgrading settlement at Node 3 to a city (need ore and wheat)
5. Consider development cards if excess resources become available
</plan>

The optimal action is to roll the dice:

5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (HIGHEST PRIORITY):
- Target 6 & 8 numbered hexes at all costs - these are the most productive numbers
- Prioritize ore and wheat hexes for your settlements - they enable cities and development cards
- Position yourself on at least one good brick and wood hex to enable early expansion
- Aim to cover ALL five resources with your two settlements combined
- Try to place on intersections with 3 productive hexes rather than 2
- Evaluate probability dots (not just numbers) - more dots mean more frequent production
- Place settlements with clear expansion paths that won't be easily blocked
- Avoid placing where you'll be immediately cut off by the opponent
- Position roads toward your next planned settlement location
- Consider distance to valuable ports (especially 2:1 ports matching your abundant resources)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-8):
- Build at least one new road and one new settlement ASAP
- Focus on securing access to any missing resources through expansion
- Establish access to a port if you're lacking a key resource
- Prevent the opponent from cutting off your expansion path
- Only purchase development cards if excess resources available or for immediate victory
- Expand toward high-value hexes the opponent doesn't yet control

MID-GAME RESOURCE MANAGEMENT (TURNS 9-20):
- Target 3 cities minimum (worth 6 VP) - upgrade most productive settlements first
- Maintain 1 road per every 2 settlements for flexible expansion
- Always build a settlement when you have the resources (more production points)
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each build (cities give best long-term return)
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1 or better) to maintain resource balance
- Keep at least one viable road-building path open at all times
- If blocked from expansion, shift to city upgrades and development cards

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Development cards should supplement your expansion, not replace it
- Prioritize using Knight cards to protect your best hexes from the robber
- Save Knights when you're ahead to counter the opponent's robber placements
- Only buy development cards when you:
  1. Have excess sheep/wheat/ore but lack wood/brick for expansion
  2. Are close to securing largest army
  3. Need a specific card type (Road Building to break through a blockade)
- Use Road Building cards to save brick/wood and create surprise expansion paths
- Time Monopoly cards to capture opponent's stockpile after high-producing rolls
- Use Year of Plenty to complete crucial builds when short on specific resources

ROBBER PLACEMENT:
- Always target the opponent's highest-producing hex (high number + settlement/city)
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat hexes to slow city development
- If opponent relies heavily on one resource, target that resource's hexes
- Never place the robber on your own high-production hexes
- When stealing, target resources you immediately need for your next build

VICTORY PATH PLANNING:
- Target resource independence with at least one settlement/city on each resource
- Minimum viable infrastructure: 3-4 settlements total, with 2-3 upgraded to cities
- Calculate multiple paths to 10 VP and pursue the fastest:
  Path 1: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP)
  Path 2: 4 cities (8 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP)
  Path 3: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 victory point card
- Always track your direct path to 10 VP and focus on those builds
- Prioritize visible points (settlements/cities) over speculative development cards
- Switch paths if the opponent blocks your primary victory path
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Accept trades only when they enable an immediate, crucial build
- Never make trades that allow opponent to build a settlement or city immediately
- Trade away excess resources when at risk for robber (7+ cards)
- Calculate the production value of each settlement location before deciding to build
- When trading with ports, plan sequences that convert unwanted resources into needed ones

DETAILED DECISION FRAMEWORK:
1. Does this move bring me closer to 10 victory points?
2. Does this move increase my production capacity more than alternative builds?
3. Does this move protect me from being blocked or cut off?
4. Does this move position me for strongest expansion in next 2-3 turns?
5. Is this the most efficient use of my current resources?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 33 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Roll the dice first to collect more resources
2. Save Monopoly card for when RED accumulates more resources (ideally bricks)
3. Continue targeting settlement at Node 19 by building road from Node 20 once I get brick
4. Focus on upgrading settlement at Node 3 to a city (need ore and wheat)
5. Consider development cards if excess resources become available
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.

# Game Analysis: Settlers of Catan Turn 33

Let me analyze the current game state and my available options:

## Current Resources
- I have: 2 Wood, 1 Sheep, 2 Wheat, 1 Ore
- I also have 1 Monopoly development card

## Victory Points Status
- RED: 4 VP (from 4 settlements)
- BLUE (me): 2 VP (from 2 settlements)

## Building Options Analysis
With my current resources, I cannot:
- Build a settlement (need 1 wood, 1 brick, 1 wheat, 1 sheep)
- Build a road (need 1 wood, 1 brick)
- Upgrade to a city (need 2 wheat, 3 ore)

## Action Options
1. **Play Monopoly** on one resource type:
   - Wood: RED may have some, but I already have 2
   - Brick: RED might have stockpiled since it's a key resource (RED has brick production)
   - Sheep: Not as valuable for immediate builds
   - Wheat: RED has good wheat production, could be useful
   - Ore: RED has ore production at node 15, could help me toward a city

2. **End turn**: Roll dice next turn and collect more resources

3. **Buy a Development Card**: Costs 1 sheep, 1 wheat, 1 ore (I have these)
   - Could get a Knight (useful for robber control)
   - Could get a Victory Point card (immediate hidden VP)
   - Could get another Monopoly/Year of Plenty/Road Building

## Strategic Considerations
- RED is ahead with 4 VP vs my 2 VP
- I need brick to expand toward node 19 (my expansion path)
- I am well-positioned on resources overall (except brick)
- Getting brick through Monopoly could enable immediate expansion

## Decision
Since I lack brick and it's crucial for my expansion plan, playing Monopoly targeting brick makes the most sense. RED has 5 cards and with brick production at a valuable 6, they likely have at least 1 brick. This would enable me to build a road toward node 19 on my next turn.

<plan>
1. Use Monopoly card to target bricks
2. Use acquired bricks to build road from Node 20 toward Node 19
3. Continue working toward settlement at Node 19
4. Save resources for city upgrade at Node 3
5. Consider development cards if excess resources become available
</plan>

# Game Analysis and Decision

I'll carefully analyze the current game state, available resources, and strategic options.

## Current Position
- I have 2 VP from my two settlements
- I have 2 wood, 1 sheep, 2 wheat, and 1 ore
- I have 1 played MONOPOLY card
- RED has 4 VP from 4 settlements and a much stronger road network

## Resource Analysis
- My settlements produce ore (node 3: 8), wheat (node 3: 10), sheep (node 20: 5), and wood (node 20: 9)
- I'm missing reliable brick production
- I own 2 wood, 1 sheep, 2 wheat, 1 ore currently

## Available Actions
1. Buy a dev card (costs 1 sheep, 1 wheat, 1 ore)
2. End my turn

## Strategic Considerations
1. I need to catch up to RED who has double my VP
2. The robber is on a desert hex, so not affecting production
3. My current plan involves using Monopoly for bricks, but I've already played that card
4. I need to adjust my strategy since my Monopoly card has been used

## Decision Analysis
If I buy a development card (option 1):
- Benefits: Could get Victory Point, Knight, Road Building, Year of Plenty, or another Monopoly
- Cost: 1 sheep, 1 wheat, 1 ore (most of my current resources)
- After purchase: Left with 2 wood only
- Knights could protect my settlements and work toward largest army
- Road Building would help me expand without needing brick
- Victory Point brings me 10% closer to winning

If I end my turn (option 0):
- Benefits: Save resources for future builds
- Drawbacks: No immediate progress toward victory, RED continues to pull ahead
- I'll still be unable to build roads or settlements without acquiring brick

## Strategy Adjustment
<plan>
1. Acquire development cards to compensate for brick shortage
2. Use Knight cards strategically to move robber to brick hexes
3. Save for city upgrade at Node 3 (high-producing settlement)
4. Look for Road Building card to expand without brick
5. Work toward Largest Army (2 VP) as alternate victory path
</plan>

## Final Decision
Since I'm significantly behind RED and lack the brick necessary for expansion, purchasing a development card is the best strategic option. It gives me a chance to obtain a Victory Point card, Road Building (to solve my brick problem), or Knights to begin building toward Largest Army.

# Game Analysis for Turn 39

Let me analyze the current game state and determine the optimal action.

## Current Game Status
- I am BLUE player with 2 VP (2 settlements)
- RED player has 5 VP (3 settlements + 1 city + 0 special VPs)
- RED leads by 3 VP, so I need to catch up quickly
- I have 1 hidden victory point card already

## Resource Analysis
- Current resources: 2 WOOD, 1 SHEEP, 3 WHEAT, 1 ORE
- No BRICK in hand
- RED has 9 cards (high risk of robbery)

## Available Actions
- [0] End Turn
- [1] Buy Development Card (costs 1 SHEEP, 1 WHEAT, 1 ORE)

## Strategic Considerations
My current plan focuses on development cards due to brick shortage. A new development card could be:
1. Victory Point (immediate +1 VP, hidden from opponent)
2. Knight (move robber, potentially targeting brick hex to hinder RED)
3. Road Building (solves my brick shortage problem)
4. Year of Plenty (could get 2 brick or other needed resources)
5. Monopoly (could be saved for strategic use later)

If I end my turn, I'll just be waiting for more resources while RED extends their lead.

My settlement at node 3 produces on 8 (ore) and 10 (wheat), which are excellent numbers. My settlement at node 20 produces on 5 (sheep) and 9 (wood). I have good production potential but need to accelerate my development.

## Decision
Buying a development card aligns with my current plan and helps advance toward victory. It could be a victory point card (putting me at 3 VP total with my hidden VP), a knight (helping work toward largest army), or a utility card to help with my brick shortage.

<plan>
1. Continue acquiring development cards to compensate for brick shortage
2. Work toward largest army (2 VP) as alternate victory path
3. If I get Road Building card, use it to expand without brick
4. Save resources for city upgrade at Node 3 (high-producing settlement)
5. Move robber to brick hexes when possible to slow RED's expansion
</plan>

Given the current game state and my resources, I choose to buy a development card.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist whose primary goal is to defeat the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (HIGHEST PRIORITY):
- Target 6 & 8 numbered hexes at all costs - these are the most productive numbers
- Prioritize ore and wheat hexes for your settlements - they enable cities and development cards
- Position yourself on at least one good brick and wood hex to enable early expansion
- Aim to cover ALL five resources with your two settlements combined
- Try to place on intersections with 3 productive hexes rather than 2
- Evaluate probability dots (not just numbers) - more dots mean more frequent production
- Place settlements with clear expansion paths that won't be easily blocked
- Avoid placing where you'll be immediately cut off by the opponent
- Position roads toward your next planned settlement location
- Consider distance to valuable ports (especially 2:1 ports matching your abundant resources)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-8):
- Build at least one new road and one new settlement ASAP
- Focus on securing access to any missing resources through expansion
- Establish access to a port if you're lacking a key resource
- Prevent the opponent from cutting off your expansion path
- Only purchase development cards if excess resources available or for immediate victory
- Expand toward high-value hexes the opponent doesn't yet control

MID-GAME RESOURCE MANAGEMENT (TURNS 9-20):
- Target 3 cities minimum (worth 6 VP) - upgrade most productive settlements first
- Maintain 1 road per every 2 settlements for flexible expansion
- Always build a settlement when you have the resources (more production points)
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each build (cities give best long-term return)
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1 or better) to maintain resource balance
- Keep at least one viable road-building path open at all times
- If blocked from expansion, shift to city upgrades and development cards

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Development cards should supplement your expansion, not replace it
- Prioritize using Knight cards to protect your best hexes from the robber
- Save Knights when you're ahead to counter the opponent's robber placements
- Only buy development cards when you:
  1. Have excess sheep/wheat/ore but lack wood/brick for expansion
  2. Are close to securing largest army
  3. Need a specific card type (Road Building to break through a blockade)
- Use Road Building cards to save brick/wood and create surprise expansion paths
- Time Monopoly cards to capture opponent's stockpile after high-producing rolls
- Use Year of Plenty to complete crucial builds when short on specific resources

ROBBER PLACEMENT:
- Always target the opponent's highest-producing hex (high number + settlement/city)
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat hexes to slow city development
- If opponent relies heavily on one resource, target that resource's hexes
- Never place the robber on your own high-production hexes
- When stealing, target resources you immediately need for your next build

VICTORY PATH PLANNING:
- Target resource independence with at least one settlement/city on each resource
- Minimum viable infrastructure: 3-4 settlements total, with 2-3 upgraded to cities
- Calculate multiple paths to 10 VP and pursue the fastest:
  Path 1: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP)
  Path 2: 4 cities (8 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP)
  Path 3: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 victory point card
- Always track your direct path to 10 VP and focus on those builds
- Prioritize visible points (settlements/cities) over speculative development cards
- Switch paths if the opponent blocks your primary victory path
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Accept trades only when they enable an immediate, crucial build
- Never make trades that allow opponent to build a settlement or city immediately
- Trade away excess resources when at risk for robber (7+ cards)
- Calculate the production value of each settlement location before deciding to build
- When trading with ports, plan sequences that convert unwanted resources into needed ones

DETAILED DECISION FRAMEWORK:
1. Does this move bring me closer to 10 victory points?
2. Does this move increase my production capacity more than alternative builds?
3. Does this move protect me from being blocked or cut off?
4. Does this move position me for strongest expansion in next 2-3 turns?
5. Is this the most efficient use of my current resources?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 41 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Continue acquiring development cards to compensate for brick shortage
2. Work toward largest army (2 VP) as alternate victory path
3. If I get Road Building card, use it to expand without brick
4. Save resources for city upgrade at Node 3 (high-producing settlement)
5. Move robber to brick hexes when possible to slow RED's expansion

# Game Analysis: Settlers of Catan - Turn 41

I'll analyze the current game state and determine the optimal action between playing a Knight card or rolling the dice.

## Current Situation Assessment
- I (BLUE) have 2 VP (2 settlements) plus 1 hidden VP from a development card = 3 VP total
- RED has 5 VP (3 settlements + 1 city) and is halfway to winning
- I have 3 resources: 2 wood, 1 wheat
- I have 1 Knight card available to play
- The robber is currently on my ore hex (⛏️8), which is one of my high-value production hexes
- The dice haven't been rolled yet for this turn

## Option Analysis

### Option 0: Play Knight Card
**Advantages:**
- Remove the robber from my valuable ore hex (8), restoring my ore production
- Place the robber on one of RED's productive hexes, hindering their resource collection
- Steal a resource from RED (who has 6 cards)
- Progress toward Largest Army (2 VP) by playing 1 Knight (need 3 total)

**Disadvantages:**
- I won't have the Knight card for future defensive purposes
- If I roll a 7 after playing the Knight, I won't be able to move the robber again

### Option 1: Roll the Dice
**Advantages:**
- Could gain more resources first before deciding whether to play the Knight
- Preserve Knight card for a potentially more strategic moment

**Disadvantages:**
- The robber remains on my valuable ore hex (8), continuing to block my production
- If I roll a 7, I'd move the robber anyway, making the Knight card redundant for now
- RED might benefit more from the roll since they have more settlements/cities

## Strategic Decision

Playing the Knight card now is clearly optimal because:
1. The robber is currently blocking my critical ore production hex (8) which I need for city upgrades
2. Moving the robber to one of RED's productive hexes will slow them down
3. I'll steal a resource from RED, who has 6 cards (good chance of getting something useful)
4. This advances my plan toward largest army (2 VP)

In terms of robber placement, I would target RED's brick hex (🧱6) which produces for both their city at node 1 and settlement at node 7. Blocking brick will significantly slow RED's expansion.

<plan>
1. Play Knight to remove robber from my ore hex and place it on RED's brick hex
2. Continue acquiring development cards, especially Knights for largest army
3. Upgrade settlement at Node 3 once I have resources (need ore from newly unblocked hex)
4. Build roads to expand when possible, but focus on city upgrades first
5. Keep monitoring RED's expansion and use robber strategically to block their key resources
</plan>

# Analyzing Move Robber Options

I need to decide where to place the robber to maximize my advantage while minimizing RED's production. Let me analyze each option systematically:

## Option Analysis

**[0] Move robber to (0, 0, 0) and steal from RED**
- This is a wheat hex with value 10
- RED has a city here (high production - 2 wheat when rolled)
- I have a settlement here too (would block my own production)
- Impact on RED: Blocks a key high-value wheat hex
- Impact on ME: Would block my own wheat production

**[1] Move robber to (1, -1, 0) and steal from RED**
- This is a brick hex with value 6 (high production)
- RED has a city and a settlement here
- I have no buildings here
- Impact on RED: Blocks a crucial brick resource (3 dots - very frequent)
- Impact on ME: No negative impact

**[2] Move robber to (0, -1, 1)**
- This is a desert hex
- No production here anyway
- Waste of a robber placement

**[3] Move robber to (-1, 1, 0) and steal from RED**
- This is a wheat hex with value 4
- RED has settlements here
- Impact on RED: Blocks wheat, but lower value (1 dot)
- Impact on ME: No negative impact

**[4] Move robber to (0, 1, -1) and steal from RED**
- This is a sheep hex with value 5
- RED has a settlement here
- I have a settlement here too
- Impact on RED: Blocks sheep
- Impact on ME: Would block my own sheep production

**[5] Move robber to (1, 0, -1) and steal from RED**
- This is a wood hex with value 9
- RED has a city here
- I have a settlement here too
- Impact on RED: Blocks wood (high value)
- Impact on ME: Would block my own wood production

## Strategic Decision

Option [1] is clearly the strongest choice:
1. It targets RED's valuable brick hex with the high probability number 6

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist whose primary goal is to defeat the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (HIGHEST PRIORITY):
- Target 6 & 8 numbered hexes at all costs - these are the most productive numbers
- Prioritize ore and wheat hexes for your settlements - they enable cities and development cards
- Position yourself on at least one good brick and wood hex to enable early expansion
- Aim to cover ALL five resources with your two settlements combined
- Try to place on intersections with 3 productive hexes rather than 2
- Evaluate probability dots (not just numbers) - more dots mean more frequent production
- Place settlements with clear expansion paths that won't be easily blocked
- Avoid placing where you'll be immediately cut off by the opponent
- Position roads toward your next planned settlement location
- Consider distance to valuable ports (especially 2:1 ports matching your abundant resources)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-8):
- Build at least one new road and one new settlement ASAP
- Focus on securing access to any missing resources through expansion
- Establish access to a port if you're lacking a key resource
- Prevent the opponent from cutting off your expansion path
- Only purchase development cards if excess resources available or for immediate victory
- Expand toward high-value hexes the opponent doesn't yet control

MID-GAME RESOURCE MANAGEMENT (TURNS 9-20):
- Target 3 cities minimum (worth 6 VP) - upgrade most productive settlements first
- Maintain 1 road per every 2 settlements for flexible expansion
- Always build a settlement when you have the resources (more production points)
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each build (cities give best long-term return)
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1 or better) to maintain resource balance
- Keep at least one viable road-building path open at all times
- If blocked from expansion, shift to city upgrades and development cards

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Development cards should supplement your expansion, not replace it
- Prioritize using Knight cards to protect your best hexes from the robber
- Save Knights when you're ahead to counter the opponent's robber placements
- Only buy development cards when you:
  1. Have excess sheep/wheat/ore but lack wood/brick for expansion
  2. Are close to securing largest army
  3. Need a specific card type (Road Building to break through a blockade)
- Use Road Building cards to save brick/wood and create surprise expansion paths
- Time Monopoly cards to capture opponent's stockpile after high-producing rolls
- Use Year of Plenty to complete crucial builds when short on specific resources

ROBBER PLACEMENT:
- Always target the opponent's highest-producing hex (high number + settlement/city)
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat hexes to slow city development
- If opponent relies heavily on one resource, target that resource's hexes
- Never place the robber on your own high-production hexes
- When stealing, target resources you immediately need for your next build

VICTORY PATH PLANNING:
- Target resource independence with at least one settlement/city on each resource
- Minimum viable infrastructure: 3-4 settlements total, with 2-3 upgraded to cities
- Calculate multiple paths to 10 VP and pursue the fastest:
  Path 1: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP)
  Path 2: 4 cities (8 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP)
  Path 3: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 victory point card
- Always track your direct path to 10 VP and focus on those builds
- Prioritize visible points (settlements/cities) over speculative development cards
- Switch paths if the opponent blocks your primary victory path
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Accept trades only when they enable an immediate, crucial build
- Never make trades that allow opponent to build a settlement or city immediately
- Trade away excess resources when at risk for robber (7+ cards)
- Calculate the production value of each settlement location before deciding to build
- When trading with ports, plan sequences that convert unwanted resources into needed ones

DETAILED DECISION FRAMEWORK:
1. Does this move bring me closer to 10 victory points?
2. Does this move increase my production capacity more than alternative builds?
3. Does this move protect me from being blocked or cut off?
4. Does this move position me for strongest expansion in next 2-3 turns?
5. Is this the most efficient use of my current resources?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game Analysis for Turn 41

Let me analyze my current position and options carefully:

## Current Status
- I have 2/10 victory points (2 settlements + 1 hidden VP card = 3 VP total)
- Resources: 2 🌲WOOD, 1 🧱BRICK, 1 🌾WHEAT
- RED is ahead with 5/10 victory points (3 settlements, 1 city)
- The robber is already on RED's brick hex (1, -1, 0)

## Resource Production Analysis
My settlements are at:
- Node 3: Produces 🌾10[⭐], ⛏️8[⭐⭐⭐] (wheat and ore)
- Node 20: Produces 🐑5[⭐⭐], 🌲9[⭐⭐] (sheep and wood)

I'm lacking consistent brick production, which limits my road-building capabilities. My opponent has strong production across all resources.

## Available Actions
I can either end my turn or build a road. With 2 wood, 1 brick, and 1 wheat, I have exactly enough resources to build 1 road.

## Strategic Road Analysis
Let me evaluate each road option based on expansion potential:

1. Edge (0, 1): Connects towards RED's city at node 1, but likely a dead end
2. Edge (1, 2): Extends towards the central area, potentially useful
3. Edge (3, 4): Extends from my settlement at node 3 towards node 4, allowing future expansion
4. Edge (19, 20): Extends from my settlement at node 20 backwards
5. Edge (20, 22): Extends from my settlement at node 20 towards node 22
6. Edge (2, 9): Creates path connecting central areas
7. Edge (0, 5): Extends towards RED's settlement at node 5, likely blocked
8. Edge (3, 12): Extends from my settlement at node 3 towards node 12, potentially accessing the desert

The most promising options appear to be:
- Option 3 (3, 4): Opens expansion path from my settlement toward wheat/sheep
- Option 5 (20, 22): Opens expansion path from my other settlement
- Option 8 (3, 12): Opens path to potentially build near desert/ore 8

## Decision Process
Based on production value and expansion potential:
- Option 3 moves me toward a wheat/sheep area and could allow future settlement near productive hexes
- Option 5 extends from my wood/sheep settlement but the future expansion path isn't as clear from the data
- Option 8 gives me access to the ore 8 hex which is critical for city upgrades

Given my lack of brick production, strategic road placement is crucial. I should prioritize the road that gives me the most expansion options. Building toward node 4 (option 3) opens access to productive wheat and sheep hexes while creating a path for future expansion.

<plan>
1. Build road at edge (3, 4) to open expansion path toward wheat/sheep
2. Save resources for new settlement when possible
3. Continue targeting RED's key resource hexes with robber
4. When possible, upgrade settlement at node 3 to a city due to the valuable ore 8
5. Continue acquiring development cards when ore becomes available
</plan>

I'll build a road at edge (3, 4) to enable expansion toward productive hexes.

❓ Select action by number (0-5):


Based on this information, which action number do you choose? Think step by step about your options, then put the final action number in a box like \boxed{1}.
RESPONSE:
I'll analyze the robber placement options carefully to make the optimal move.

First, let me understand what resources each hex produces:
- (0, 0, 0) = Wheat 10
- (1, -1, 0) = Brick 6
- (-1, 0, 1) = Ore 8
- (-1, 1, 0) = Wheat 4
- (0, 1, -1) = Sheep 5
- (1, 0, -1) = Wood 9

Now, let me evaluate each option by examining how it impacts RED's production:

Option 0 - Move to (0, 0, 0) Wheat 10:
- Blocks RED's city at node 1 (high production ⭐)
- Blocks RED's settlement at node 5 (medium production ⭐)
- This is a key wheat hex for RED with two buildings

Option 1 - Move to (1, -1, 0) Brick 6:
- Blocks RED's city at node 1 (high production ⭐⭐⭐)
- Blocks RED's settlement at node 7 (high production ⭐⭐⭐)
- This is RED's primary brick source with 6 probability dots (very productive)

Option 2 - Move to (-1, 0, 1) Ore 8:
- Blocks RED's settlement at node 15 (high production ⭐⭐⭐)
- BUT this would also block my own settlement at node 3 (one of my only two settlements)
- Would hurt me significantly as I need ore for cities and development cards

Option 3 - Move to (-1, 1, 0) Wheat 4:
- Blocks RED's settlement at node 5 (low production ⭐)
- Blocks RED's settlement at node 15 (low production ⭐)
- Lower-value wheat hex (4 is less frequent than 10)

Option 4 - Move to (0, 1, -1) Sheep 5:
- Blocks RED's settlement at node 5 (medium production ⭐⭐)
- BUT also blocks my settlement at node 20 (hurts my sheep production)

Option 5 - Move to (1, 0, -1) Wood 9:
- Blocks RED's city at node 1 (medium production ⭐⭐)
- But would also block my settlement at node 20 (hurts my wood production)

Based on this analysis:

Option 1 (Brick 6) is clearly the strongest choice because:
1. It blocks RED's most productive resource (6 production dots across two buildings)
2. Brick is critical for road building and settlements
3. It targets RED's city, maximizing the impact
4. It doesn't hurt any of my own production
5. I can steal a resource from RED after placement

<plan>
1. Move robber to Brick 6 hex (1, -1, 0) to block RED's most productive resource
2. Continue saving for road at edge (4, 15) to expand toward better resource diversity
3. Aim to build settlement at node 14 or 4 next to access ore/wheat
4. Upgrade settlement at node 3 to city when resources allow
5. Continue targeting RED's key hexes with robber, prioritizing ore, brick and wheat
</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist whose primary goal is to defeat the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (HIGHEST PRIORITY):
- Target 6 & 8 numbered hexes at all costs - these are the most productive numbers
- Prioritize ore and wheat hexes for your settlements - they enable cities and development cards
- Position yourself on at least one good brick and wood hex to enable early expansion
- Aim to cover ALL five resources with your two settlements combined
- Try to place on intersections with 3 productive hexes rather than 2
- Evaluate probability dots (not just numbers) - more dots mean more frequent production
- Place settlements with clear expansion paths that won't be easily blocked
- Avoid placing where you'll be immediately cut off by the opponent
- Position roads toward your next planned settlement location
- Consider distance to valuable ports (especially 2:1 ports matching your abundant resources)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-8):
- Build at least one new road and one new settlement ASAP
- Focus on securing access to any missing resources through expansion
- Establish access to a port if you're lacking a key resource
- Prevent the opponent from cutting off your expansion path
- Only purchase development cards if excess resources available or for immediate victory
- Expand toward high-value hexes the opponent doesn't yet control

MID-GAME RESOURCE MANAGEMENT (TURNS 9-20):
- Target 3 cities minimum (worth 6 VP) - upgrade most productive settlements first
- Maintain 1 road per every 2 settlements for flexible expansion
- Always build a settlement when you have the resources (more production points)
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each build (cities give best long-term return)
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1 or better) to maintain resource balance
- Keep at least one viable road-building path open at all times
- If blocked from expansion, shift to city upgrades and development cards

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Development cards should supplement your expansion, not replace it
- Prioritize using Knight cards to protect your best hexes from the robber
- Save Knights when you're ahead to counter the opponent's robber placements
- Only buy development cards when you:
  1. Have excess sheep/wheat/ore but lack wood/brick for expansion
  2. Are close to securing largest army
  3. Need a specific card type (Road Building to break through a blockade)
- Use Road Building cards to save brick/wood and create surprise expansion paths
- Time Monopoly cards to capture opponent's stockpile after high-producing rolls
- Use Year of Plenty to complete crucial builds when short on specific resources

ROBBER PLACEMENT:
- Always target the opponent's highest-producing hex (high number + settlement/city)
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat hexes to slow city development
- If opponent relies heavily on one resource, target that resource's hexes
- Never place the robber on your own high-production hexes
- When stealing, target resources you immediately need for your next build

VICTORY PATH PLANNING:
- Target resource independence with at least one settlement/city on each resource
- Minimum viable infrastructure: 3-4 settlements total, with 2-3 upgraded to cities
- Calculate multiple paths to 10 VP and pursue the fastest:
  Path 1: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP)
  Path 2: 4 cities (8 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP)
  Path 3: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 victory point card
- Always track your direct path to 10 VP and focus on those builds
- Prioritize visible points (settlements/cities) over speculative development cards
- Switch paths if the opponent blocks your primary victory path
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Accept trades only when they enable an immediate, crucial build
- Never make trades that allow opponent to build a settlement or city immediately
- Trade away excess resources when at risk for robber (7+ cards)
- Calculate the production value of each settlement location before deciding to build
- When trading with ports, plan sequences that convert unwanted resources into needed ones

DETAILED DECISION FRAMEWORK:
1. Does this move bring me closer to 10 victory points?
2. Does this move increase my production capacity more than alternative builds?
3. Does this move protect me from being blocked or cut off?
4. Does this move position me for strongest expansion in next 2-3 turns?
5. Is this the most efficient use of my current resources?

# Game State Analysis

I need to move the robber to disrupt RED's production while maximizing my own chances of winning.

Let's analyze each hexagon location:
- (0, 0, 0): Wheat 10 [⭐] - Connected to RED's city at node 1 and settlement at node 5
- (0, -1, 1): Desert - No production
- (-1, 0, 1): Ore 8 [⭐⭐⭐] - Connected to RED's settlement at node 15 AND my own settlement at node 3
- (-1, 1, 0): Wheat 4 [⭐] - Connected to RED's settlements at nodes 5 and 15
- (0, 1, -1): Sheep 5 [⭐⭐] - Connected to RED's settlement at node 5 AND my settlement at node 20
- (1, 0, -1): Wood 9 [⭐⭐] - Connected to RED's city at node 1 AND my settlement at node 20
- (1, -1, 0): Brick 6 [⭐⭐⭐] - Currently has robber, connected to RED's city at node 1 and settlement at node 7

## Key considerations:
1. RED has 5 VP to my 2 VP, so they're ahead and I need to slow them down
2. RED has 7 cards, so they might be planning a major build
3. I should prioritize blocking RED's most productive hexes (high probability + settlement/city)

## Evaluating options:

[0] Move to Wheat 10 - Blocks RED's city and settlement, ⭐ production but also blocks my settlement at node 3
[1] Move to Desert (0, -1, 1) - Pointless as desert produces nothing
[2] Move to Ore 8 - Blocks RED's settlement but also blocks my own settlement at node 3 (bad move)
[3] Move to Wheat 4 - Blocks RED's two settlements but only ⭐ production
[4] Move to Sheep 5 - Blocks RED's settlement but also blocks my settlement at node 20
[5] Move to Wood 9 - Blocks RED's city but also blocks my settlement at node 20

The most devastating option for RED would be to target their resource with highest production value that I don't rely on. RED has strong production of Brick (6) with both a city and settlement on it. This is especially important since brick is crucial for road building and expansion.

<plan>
1. Move robber to Wheat 10 (0, 0, 0) to block RED's city and settlement while stealing a resource
2. Save resources for road building toward node 4 or 14 to access better resources
3. Aim to build settlement at node 14 to get ore production that I currently lack
4. Work toward upgrading settlement at node 3 to a city
5. Target RED's key resources with robber to slow their progress
</plan>

Option [0] is optimal as it:
1. Blocks Wheat 10 which is connected to RED's city and settlement
2. Allows me to steal a resource from RED
3. While it does block my settlement at node 3, I already have 3 wheat cards, so temporarily losing wheat production is acceptable
4. RED's city at node 1 makes this hex particularly productive for them

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist whose primary goal is to defeat the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (HIGHEST PRIORITY):
- Target 6 & 8 numbered hexes at all costs - these are the most productive numbers
- Prioritize ore and wheat hexes for your settlements - they enable cities and development cards
- Position yourself on at least one good brick and wood hex to enable early expansion
- Aim to cover ALL five resources with your two settlements combined
- Try to place on intersections with 3 productive hexes rather than 2
- Evaluate probability dots (not just numbers) - more dots mean more frequent production
- Place settlements with clear expansion paths that won't be easily blocked
- Avoid placing where you'll be immediately cut off by the opponent
- Position roads toward your next planned settlement location
- Consider distance to valuable ports (especially 2:1 ports matching your abundant resources)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-8):
- Build at least one new road and one new settlement ASAP
- Focus on securing access to any missing resources through expansion
- Establish access to a port if you're lacking a key resource
- Prevent the opponent from cutting off your expansion path
- Only purchase development cards if excess resources available or for immediate victory
- Expand toward high-value hexes the opponent doesn't yet control

MID-GAME RESOURCE MANAGEMENT (TURNS 9-20):
- Target 3 cities minimum (worth 6 VP) - upgrade most productive settlements first
- Maintain 1 road per every 2 settlements for flexible expansion
- Always build a settlement when you have the resources (more production points)
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each build (cities give best long-term return)
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1 or better) to maintain resource balance
- Keep at least one viable road-building path open at all times
- If blocked from expansion, shift to city upgrades and development cards

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Development cards should supplement your expansion, not replace it
- Prioritize using Knight cards to protect your best hexes from the robber
- Save Knights when you're ahead to counter the opponent's robber placements
- Only buy development cards when you:
  1. Have excess sheep/wheat/ore but lack wood/brick for expansion
  2. Are close to securing largest army
  3. Need a specific card type (Road Building to break through a blockade)
- Use Road Building cards to save brick/wood and create surprise expansion paths
- Time Monopoly cards to capture opponent's stockpile after high-producing rolls
- Use Year of Plenty to complete crucial builds when short on specific resources

ROBBER PLACEMENT:
- Always target the opponent's highest-producing hex (high number + settlement/city)
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat hexes to slow city development
- If opponent relies heavily on one resource, target that resource's hexes
- Never place the robber on your own high-production hexes

  Path 2: 4 cities (8 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP)
  Path 3: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 victory point card
- Always track your direct path to 10 VP and focus on those builds
- Prioritize visible points (settlements/cities) over speculative development cards
- Switch paths if the opponent blocks your primary victory path
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

# Game Analysis for Settlers of Catan

Let me analyze the current game state and determine the optimal move for BLUE.

## Current Situation Assessment
- I (BLUE) have 2 victory points from my 2 settlements
- I have 1 hidden victory point card, bringing my actual total to 3/10
- RED has 5 victory points (3 settlements + 1 city)
- My resources: 1 WOOD, 3 SHEEP, 4 WHEAT
- Robber is currently on Wheat 10 (0,0,0), already blocking a key hex
- I currently lack ORE and BRICK for building settlements or upgrading to cities

## Resource Analysis
I have a surplus of WHEAT (4) but lack ORE and BRICK. My production is:
- From node 3: Wheat 10 (blocked by robber) and Ore 8
- From node 20: Sheep 5 and Wood 9

## Action Options Analysis
1. End Turn [0]: This wastes my current resources and opportunity to progress
2. Trade 4 WHEAT for 1 ORE [1]: This would give me ore, which I need for upgrading settlements and buying development cards
3. Trade 4 WHEAT for 1 BRICK [2]: This would give me brick, needed for roads/settlements
4. Trade 4 WHEAT for 1 SHEEP [3]: Inefficient as I already have 3 sheep
5. Trade 4 WHEAT for 1 WOOD [4]: Inefficient as I already have wood

## Strategic Plan Evaluation
My current plan includes:
- Aiming to build roads toward node 4 or 14 to access better resources
- Building settlement at node 14 to get ore production
- Upgrading my settlement at node 3 to a city

For the next settlement, I need WOOD+BRICK+WHEAT+SHEEP, and I'm missing BRICK.
For upgrading to a city, I need ORE+ORE+ORE+WHEAT+WHEAT, and I'm missing ORE.

## Decision Making
Given my resources and needs:
- I currently can't build a settlement (need brick)
- I can't upgrade to a city (need 3 ore)
- Development cards require ore which I don't have

The most productive move is to trade for resources I'm missing. Since my plan includes both settlement building (needing brick) and city upgrading (needing ore), which is more important?

- City upgrade gives +1 VP and doubles resource production at a critical node
- New settlement gives +1 VP and new production points, but requires finding good location and roads

Since I already have a settlement at node 3 with Ore 8 production (very valuable), upgrading this to a city would be highly efficient once I get ore. This would double my ore production and help me progress faster.

<plan>
1. Trade WHEAT for ORE now to start accumulating resources for city upgrade
2. Focus on upgrading settlement at node 3 to a city first (need 3 ORE, 2 WHEAT total)
3. After city upgrade, use increased ore production to build roads toward node 14
4. Aim for settlement at node 14 to increase ore production further
5. Continue targeting RED's key resources with robber to slow their progress
</plan>

I need to start accumulating ore, and the 4:1 trade is the only option available. While expensive, it's necessary for progress.

# Game State Analysis

Let me carefully analyze the current game state and determine my best action:

**Current Resources:**
- 2 WOOD, 4 SHEEP, 3 ORE
- 1 hidden VICTORY_POINT card (1 VP)

**Current VP Status:**
- Me (BLUE): 2 VP from settlements + 1 VP card = 3 VP total
- RED: 5 VP total (3 settlements, 1 city)

## Resource Analysis
I have a good amount of ORE (3), which is crucial for city upgrades. I need 2 more ORE and 2 WHEAT to upgrade my settlement at node 3 to a city. Currently, I have no WHEAT at all, which is a significant problem.

## Production Analysis
My key production:
- Node 3: WHEAT (10) and ORE (8) - great production spot
- Node 20: SHEEP (5) and WOOD (9) - decent production

RED's production is excellent, with multiple BRICK sources and a city already. They're ahead by 2 visible points.

## Available Actions Assessment
1. End Turn (0): Not optimal when I can trade
2. Trade 4 SHEEP for 1 WOOD (1): I already have 2 WOOD, so not a priority
3. Trade 4 SHEEP for 1 ORE (2): I already have 3 ORE, getting 1 more wouldn't immediately complete a build
4. Trade 4 SHEEP for 1 WHEAT (3): I have 0 WHEAT, and need 2 for a city - this gets me halfway there
5. Trade 4 SHEEP for 1 BRICK (4): I don't immediately need BRICK

## Decision Logic
My current plan focuses on upgrading node 3 to a city (needs 3 ORE, 2 WHEAT). I already have 3 ORE but 0 WHEAT. Getting 1 WHEAT is a step toward this crucial upgrade. The settlement at node 3 produces WHEAT on a 10, so upgrading it will boost my WHEAT production.

I have 4 SHEEP which I can trade for 1 WHEAT, making progress toward my city upgrade. While trading at 4:1 is inefficient, WHEAT is my most critical immediate need, and I can't build anything with my current resources.

I need to adjust my plan slightly:

<plan>
1. Trade 4 SHEEP for 1 WHEAT now to start accumulating resources for city upgrade
2. Focus on upgrading settlement at node 3 to a city (need 3 ORE, 1 more WHEAT)
3. After city upgrade, use increased ore/wheat production to build roads toward node 14
4. Aim for settlement at node 14 to increase ore production further
5. Continue targeting RED's key resources with robber to slow their progress
</plan>

Based on this analysis, trading my sheep for wheat is my best move:

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist whose primary goal is to defeat the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (HIGHEST PRIORITY):
- Target 6 & 8 numbered hexes at all costs - these are the most productive numbers
- Prioritize ore and wheat hexes for your settlements - they enable cities and development cards
- Position yourself on at least one good brick and wood hex to enable early expansion
- Aim to cover ALL five resources with your two settlements combined
- Try to place on intersections with 3 productive hexes rather than 2
- Evaluate probability dots (not just numbers) - more dots mean more frequent production
- Place settlements with clear expansion paths that won't be easily blocked
- Avoid placing where you'll be immediately cut off by the opponent
- Position roads toward your next planned settlement location
- Consider distance to valuable ports (especially 2:1 ports matching your abundant resources)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-8):
- Build at least one new road and one new settlement ASAP
- Focus on securing access to any missing resources through expansion
- Establish access to a port if you're lacking a key resource
- Prevent the opponent from cutting off your expansion path
- Only purchase development cards if excess resources available or for immediate victory
- Expand toward high-value hexes the opponent doesn't yet control

MID-GAME RESOURCE MANAGEMENT (TURNS 9-20):
- Target 3 cities minimum (worth 6 VP) - upgrade most productive settlements first
- Maintain 1 road per every 2 settlements for flexible expansion
- Always build a settlement when you have the resources (more production points)
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each build (cities give best long-term return)
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1 or better) to maintain resource balance
- Keep at least one viable road-building path open at all times
- If blocked from expansion, shift to city upgrades and development cards

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Development cards should supplement your expansion, not replace it
- Prioritize using Knight cards to protect your best hexes from the robber
- Save Knights when you're ahead to counter the opponent's robber placements
- Only buy development cards when you:
  1. Have excess sheep/wheat/ore but lack wood/brick for expansion
  2. Are close to securing largest army
  3. Need a specific card type (Road Building to break through a blockade)
- Use Road Building cards to save brick/wood and create surprise expansion paths
- Time Monopoly cards to capture opponent's stockpile after high-producing rolls
- Use Year of Plenty to complete crucial builds when short on specific resources

ROBBER PLACEMENT:
- Always target the opponent's highest-producing hex (high number + settlement/city)
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat hexes to slow city development
- If opponent relies heavily on one resource, target that resource's hexes
- Never place the robber on your own high-production hexes
- When stealing, target resources you immediately need for your next build

VICTORY PATH PLANNING:
- Target resource independence with at least one settlement/city on each resource
- Minimum viable infrastructure: 3-4 settlements total, with 2-3 upgraded to cities
- Calculate multiple paths to 10 VP and pursue the fastest:
  Path 1: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP)
  Path 2: 4 cities (8 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP)
  Path 3: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 victory point card
- Always track your direct path to 10 VP and focus on those builds
- Prioritize visible points (settlements/cities) over speculative development cards
- Switch paths if the opponent blocks your primary victory path
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Accept trades only when they enable an immediate, crucial build
- Never make trades that allow opponent to build a settlement or city immediately
- Trade away excess resources when at risk for robber (7+ cards)
- Calculate the production value of each settlement location before deciding to build
- When trading with ports, plan sequences that convert unwanted resources into needed ones

DETAILED DECISION FRAMEWORK:
1. Does this move bring me closer to 10 victory points?
2. Does this move increase my production capacity more than alternative builds?
3. Does this move protect me from being blocked or cut off?
4. Does this move position me for strongest expansion in next 2-3 turns?
5. Is this the most efficient use of my current resources?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

❓ Select action by number (0-5):


Based on this information, which action number do you choose? Think step by step about your options, then put the final action number in a box like \boxed{1}.
RESPONSE:
I'll analyze the game state and determine the optimal robber placement strategy.

## Current Game Analysis
- RED has 7 VP (3 settlements, 1 city, longest road bonus)
- I (BLUE) have 2 VP (2 settlements), plus 1 hidden VP from a development card
- My resources: 2 wood, 1 sheep, 1 wheat
- I need to accumulate resources for a city upgrade at node 3

## Robber Placement Options
I need to analyze each option to determine which hex would hurt RED the most while protecting my interests:

**[0] Move robber to (1, -1, 0) and steal from RED**
- This is a brick hex with value 6 (⭐⭐⭐ probability)
- Affects RED's city at node 1 and settlement at node 7
- RED gets significant brick production from this hex

**[1] Move robber to (0, -1, 1)**
- This is a desert hex with no production value
- Placing robber here would be wasteful as it blocks no resources

**[2] Move robber to (-1, 0, 1) and steal from RED**
- This is an ore hex with value 8 (⭐⭐⭐ probability)
- Affects RED's settlement at node 15
- Also affects my settlement at node 3, so would hurt my own ore production

**[3] Move robber to (-1, 1, 0) and steal from RED**
- This is a wheat hex with value 4 (⭐ probability)
- Affects RED's settlements at nodes 5 and 15
- Low productivity hex (only 1 dot)

**[4] Move robber to (0, 1, -1) and steal from RED**
- This is a sheep hex with value 5 (⭐⭐ probability)
- Affects RED's settlement at node 5 and my settlement at node 20
- Would hurt my own sheep production

**[5] Move robber to (1, 0, -1) and steal from RED**
- This is a wood hex with value 9 (⭐⭐ probability)
- Affects RED's city at node 1
- Moderate productivity hex (2 dots)

## Decision Logic
For optimal robber placement, I should:
1. Target RED's high production hexes
2. Avoid hurting my own production
3. Prioritize resources RED needs for expansion

The best choices are:
- Option [0]: Blocks RED's brick production (value 6, 3 dots)
- Option [5]: Blocks RED's wood production (value 9, 2 dots)

Since RED already has longest road (needing brick and wood), they likely have less immediate need for those resources. What RED needs most is ore and wheat for city upgrades.

Looking at the board, RED has a settlement at node 15 that produces ore from the 8-value hex. Ore is critical for cities, and an 8 is high-probability. However, placing the robber there would also hurt my own ore production at node 3, which I need for my city upgrade.

The brick hex (option 0) is RED's most productive hex (⭐⭐⭐) and affects both a city and settlement. This would significantly impact RED's future building potential without hurting my production.

<plan>
1. Block RED's brick production to slow their expansion
2. Continue accumulating resources for city upgrade at node 3
3. After city upgrade, build roads toward node 14 for additional ore production
4. Target RED's ore and wheat production with future robber placements
</plan>

Based on this analysis, I'll choose option [0] to move the robber to the brick hex and steal from RED.

# Analyzing Robber Placement Options

I need to carefully consider where to place the robber to maximize my strategic advantage while hindering RED's progress.

## Evaluating Each Hex Option:

**[0] Move robber to (0, 0, 0) and steal from RED:**
- This is a wheat hex with a 10 (⭐ productivity)
- RED has a city at node 1 and a settlement at node 5 on this hex
- This would block RED's wheat production which is critical for cities and development cards

**[1] Move robber to (0, -1, 1):**
- This is a desert hex
- No resource production to block
- Wasting my robber placement opportunity

**[2] Move robber to (-1, 0, 1) and steal from RED:**
- This is an ore hex with an 8 (⭐⭐⭐ high productivity)
- RED has a settlement at node 15 on this hex
- I also have a settlement at node 3 on this hex
- Placing here would block my own high-value ore production as well as RED's

**[3] Move robber to (-1, 1, 0) and steal from RED:**
- This is a wheat hex with a 4 (⭐ low productivity)
- RED has settlements at nodes 5 and 15 on this hex
- Low impact as the number 4 is less productive

**[4] Move robber to (0, 1, -1) and steal from RED:**
- This is a sheep hex with a 5 (⭐⭐ medium productivity)
- RED has a settlement at node 5
- I also have a settlement at node 20
- Placing here would block my own sheep production as well

**[5] Move robber to (1, 0, -1) and steal from RED:**
- This is a wood hex with a 9 (⭐⭐ medium productivity)
- RED has a city at node 1
- I also have a settlement at node 20
- Placing here would block my own wood production as well

## Strategic Analysis:

RED is leading with 7/10 VP and has the longest road. I need to slow them down significantly.

My current plan involves:
1. Blocking RED's brick production
2. Accumulating resources for a city upgrade at node 3
3. Building toward node 14 for more ore production
4. Targeting RED's ore and wheat

I already have 4 wood, 1 sheep, and 1 wheat. For a city upgrade, I need 3 ore and 2 wheat, so I'm still missing critical resources.

Looking at RED's buildings:
- They have high production on brick (6 with ⭐⭐⭐) via a city and settlement
- They have good wheat production via two settlements and a city
- They have good ore production at node 15 with the valuable 8 number (⭐⭐⭐)

## Decision Logic:

1. Option [0] (wheat 10) impacts RED's high wheat production via city without affecting my own production
2. Option [2] (ore 8) would hurt RED but also block my own essential ore production
3. Option [7] (brick 6) is not listed but would be ideal to continue my plan of blocking RED's brick

Since option [7] isn't available, and I need ore for my city upgrade, I should NOT place the robber on ore.

The best choice is option [0] - placing the robber on the wheat hex (0,0,0):
- Blocks RED's wheat production from both city and settlement
- Allows me to steal a resource from RED
- Doesn't impact my own production
- Wheat is critical for RED's development cards and city upgrades

<plan>
1. Block RED's wheat production to slow their development and city upgrades
2. Continue accumulating ore for city upgrade at node 3
3. After city upgrade, build roads toward node 14 for additional ore production
4. Target RED's brick production with future robber placements when possible
</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist whose primary goal is to defeat the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (HIGHEST PRIORITY):
- Target 6 & 8 numbered hexes at all costs - these are the most productive numbers
- Prioritize ore and wheat hexes for your settlements - they enable cities and development cards
- Position yourself on at least one good brick and wood hex to enable early expansion
- Aim to cover ALL five resources with your two settlements combined
- Try to place on intersections with 3 productive hexes rather than 2
- Evaluate probability dots (not just numbers) - more dots mean more frequent production
- Place settlements with clear expansion paths that won't be easily blocked
- Avoid placing where you'll be immediately cut off by the opponent
- Position roads toward your next planned settlement location
- Consider distance to valuable ports (especially 2:1 ports matching your abundant resources)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-8):
- Build at least one new road and one new settlement ASAP
- Focus on securing access to any missing resources through expansion
- Establish access to a port if you're lacking a key resource
- Prevent the opponent from cutting off your expansion path
- Only purchase development cards if excess resources available or for immediate victory
- Expand toward high-value hexes the opponent doesn't yet control

MID-GAME RESOURCE MANAGEMENT (TURNS 9-20):
- Target 3 cities minimum (worth 6 VP) - upgrade most productive settlements first
- Maintain 1 road per every 2 settlements for flexible expansion
- Always build a settlement when you have the resources (more production points)
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each build (cities give best long-term return)
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1 or better) to maintain resource balance
- Keep at least one viable road-building path open at all times
- If blocked from expansion, shift to city upgrades and development cards

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Development cards should supplement your expansion, not replace it
- Prioritize using Knight cards to protect your best hexes from the robber
- Save Knights when you're ahead to counter the opponent's robber placements
- Only buy development cards when you:
  1. Have excess sheep/wheat/ore but lack wood/brick for expansion
  2. Are close to securing largest army
  3. Need a specific card type (Road Building to break through a blockade)
- Use Road Building cards to save brick/wood and create surprise expansion paths
- Time Monopoly cards to capture opponent's stockpile after high-producing rolls
- Use Year of Plenty to complete crucial builds when short on specific resources

ROBBER PLACEMENT:
- Always target the opponent's highest-producing hex (high number + settlement/city)
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat hexes to slow city development
- If opponent relies heavily on one resource, target that resource's hexes
- Never place the robber on your own high-production hexes
- When stealing, target resources you immediately need for your next build

VICTORY PATH PLANNING:
- Target resource independence with at least one settlement/city on each resource
- Minimum viable infrastructure: 3-4 settlements total, with 2-3 upgraded to cities
- Calculate multiple paths to 10 VP and pursue the fastest:
  Path 1: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP)
  Path 2: 4 cities (8 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP)
  Path 3: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 victory point card
- Always track your direct path to 10 VP and focus on those builds
- Prioritize visible points (settlements/cities) over speculative development cards
- Switch paths if the opponent blocks your primary victory path
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Accept trades only when they enable an immediate, crucial build
- Never make trades that allow opponent to build a settlement or city immediately
- Trade away excess resources when at risk for robber (7+ cards)
- Calculate the production value of each settlement location before deciding to build
- When trading with ports, plan sequences that convert unwanted resources into needed ones

DETAILED DECISION FRAMEWORK:
1. Does this move bring me closer to 10 victory points?
2. Does this move increase my production capacity more than alternative builds?
3. Does this move protect me from being blocked or cut off?
4. Does this move position me for strongest expansion in next 2-3 turns?
5. Is this the most efficient use of my current resources?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 69 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Block RED's wheat production to slow their development and city upgrades
2. Continue accumulating ore for city upgrade at node 3

Based on this information, which action number do you choose? Think step by step about your options, then put the final action number in a box like \boxed{1}.
RESPONSE:
I need to analyze the current game state and available actions to determine my optimal move.

## Game State Analysis

1. **Victory Points**: I have 2/10 VP, while RED has 7/10 VP (including the Longest Road bonus)
2. **Resources**: I have 4 🌲WOOD, 1 🐑SHEEP, 1 🌾WHEAT, 1 ⛏️ORE
3. **Development Cards**: I already have 1 VICTORY_POINT card (worth 1 VP when revealed)
4. **Buildings**: I have 2 settlements, 0 cities, and 3 roads
5. **Robber**: Currently on the wheat hex (0,0,0), blocking a productive wheat tile

## Action Assessment

Let me evaluate each available action:

**[0] End Turn** - This would waste my resources and opportunity to progress.

**[1] Buy Development Card (1 🐑SHEEP, 1 🌾WHEAT, 1 ⛏️ORE)**
- Pros: Could get a Knight (to move robber), Victory Point, Road Building, Year of Plenty, or Monopoly
- Cons: Uses all my sheep, wheat, and ore, leaving me only with wood

**[2-5] Maritime Trade (4 🌲WOOD for another resource)**
- Trading 4 wood for 1 of another resource is highly inefficient
- I would still not have enough resources to build anything significant after the trade

## Strategic Considerations

1. RED is at 7 VP, meaning they could be 1-3 turns away from winning
2. I'm far behind at 2 VP (plus 1 hidden VP from my VP card)
3. I need to focus on building settlements and upgrading to cities to catch up
4. My current resources don't allow me to build roads (need brick), settlements (need brick), or cities (need more ore)
5. Dev cards could potentially help me disrupt RED or provide immediate value

Given that RED is far ahead and I can't make any direct builds, buying a development card is my best option. If I get:
- Knight: I can move the robber to disrupt RED's production
- Victory Point: Gets me closer to winning
- Road Building: Helps me expand (though I still need brick)
- Year of Plenty/Monopoly: Helps me acquire needed resources

<plan>
1. Buy a development card this turn to potentially slow RED or gain advantage
2. Focus on acquiring brick next to build roads toward node 14 for expansion
3. Continue building toward city upgrade at node 3 by gathering more ore
4. If I get a Knight card, use it to block RED's brick production at hex (1,-1,0)
</plan>

# Game Analysis for Settlers of Catan

I need to analyze the current game state and make the optimal decision to improve my position against RED, who is significantly ahead with 7/10 victory points.

## Current Situation Assessment:
- I have 2 VP from settlements + 2 hidden VP from development cards = 4 VP total
- RED has 7 VP (3 settlements + 1 city + longest road)
- I have only 4 wood resources and no other resources
- RED appears to be dominating the board with more settlements and the longest road bonus

## Resource Analysis:
- I have 4 wood but lack other resources needed for buildings
- My settlements produce wheat (10), ore (8), sheep (5), and wood (9)
- I'm completely lacking brick production, which is crucial for expansion

## Available Actions:
0. End turn without doing anything
1-4. Trade 4 wood for 1 of another resource (wheat, brick, sheep, or ore)

## Strategic Considerations:

Trading options:
- Trading for brick (#2) would help with road building for expansion
- Trading for ore (#4) would help toward city upgrades
- Trading for wheat (#1) is less valuable right now as I already produce it
- Trading for sheep (#3) is least valuable as I produce it and have no immediate use

My current plan mentions buying a development card, but I don't have the resources for it (need 1 ore, 1 wheat, 1 sheep). I need to adjust my plan.

Since RED is at 7 VP and racing toward victory, I need to make significant progress. With only wood resources, trading is my only option to take action this turn.

<plan>
1. Trade wood for brick to build a road toward node 14
2. On future turns, focus on establishing a third settlement at node 14 to increase production
3. After securing a third settlement, focus on city upgrades at node 3 (good ore/wheat spot)
4. Work toward breaking RED's longest road if possible
</plan>

Looking at my options, trading wood for brick is the most strategic choice. It aligns with my updated plan of expanding toward node 14, which would give me access to ore production from the 8-value hex.

## Decision:
I will trade wood for brick to continue road expansion toward node 14.

- If blocked from expansion, shift to city upgrades and development cards

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Development cards should supplement your expansion, not replace it
- Prioritize using Knight cards to protect your best hexes from the robber
- Save Knights when you're ahead to counter the opponent's robber placements
- Only buy development cards when you:
  1. Have excess sheep/wheat/ore but lack wood/brick for expansion
  2. Are close to securing largest army
  3. Need a specific card type (Road Building to break through a blockade)
- Use Road Building cards to save brick/wood and create surprise expansion paths
- Time Monopoly cards to capture opponent's stockpile after high-producing rolls
- Use Year of Plenty to complete crucial builds when short on specific resources

ROBBER PLACEMENT:
- Always target the opponent's highest-producing hex (high number + settlement/city)
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat hexes to slow city development
- If opponent relies heavily on one resource, target that resource's hexes
- Never place the robber on your own high-production hexes
- When stealing, target resources you immediately need for your next build

VICTORY PATH PLANNING:
- Target resource independence with at least one settlement/city on each resource
- Minimum viable infrastructure: 3-4 settlements total, with 2-3 upgraded to cities
- Calculate multiple paths to 10 VP and pursue the fastest:
  Path 1: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP)
  Path 2: 4 cities (8 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP)
  Path 3: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 victory point card
- Always track your direct path to 10 VP and focus on those builds
- Prioritize visible points (settlements/cities) over speculative development cards
- Switch paths if the opponent blocks your primary victory path
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Accept trades only when they enable an immediate, crucial build
- Never make trades that allow opponent to build a settlement or city immediately
- Trade away excess resources when at risk for robber (7+ cards)
- Calculate the production value of each settlement location before deciding to build
- When trading with ports, plan sequences that convert unwanted resources into needed ones

DETAILED DECISION FRAMEWORK:
1. Does this move bring me closer to 10 victory points?
2. Does this move increase my production capacity more than alternative builds?
3. Does this move protect me from being blocked or cut off?
4. Does this move position me for strongest expansion in next 2-3 turns?
5. Is this the most efficient use of my current resources?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 71 | Player: BLUE | Action: MOVE_ROBBER

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Trade wood for brick to build a road toward node 14
2. On future turns, focus on establishing a third settlement at node 14 to increase production
3. After securing a third settlement, focus on city upgrades at node 3 (good ore/wheat spot)
4. Work toward breaking RED's longest road if possible

# Analyzing Robber Placement Options

I need to make an optimal decision for placing the robber. Let me analyze each hex and what it would accomplish:

## Option Analysis:

[0] Move robber to (1, -1, 0) and steal from RED
- This is a brick hex with value 6 (⭐⭐⭐)
- Blocks production from RED's city at node 1 and settlement at node 7
- RED has two buildings producing from this hex - very impactful

[1] Move robber to (0, -1, 1)
- This is a desert hex, already non-productive
- No strategic value placing the robber here

[2] Move robber to (-1, 0, 1) and steal from RED
- This is an ore hex with value 8 (⭐⭐⭐)
- Blocks production from RED's settlement at node 15
- Blocks my own settlement at node 3 - would hurt me too

[3] Move robber to (-1, 1, 0) and steal from RED
- This is a wheat hex with value 4 (⭐)
- Blocks production from RED's settlements at nodes 5 and 15
- Low production value (only 1 dot)

[4] Move robber to (0, 1, -1) and steal from RED
- This is a sheep hex with value 5 (⭐⭐)
- Blocks production from RED's settlement at node 5
- Medium production value

[5] Move robber to (1, 0, -1) and steal from RED
- This is a wood hex with value 9 (⭐⭐)
- Blocks production from RED's city at node 1
- Would also hurt my own settlement at node 20

## Strategic Reasoning:
- Option [0] blocks RED's highly productive brick (6) hex which supplies both a city and settlement
- RED is ahead at 7 VP to my 2 VP - I need to slow them down
- Brick is crucial for RED's continued expansion with roads and settlements
- By stealing a resource, I might gain something useful
- This option doesn't block any of my own production

<plan>
1. Block RED's brick production by placing robber on the 6-brick hex
2. Continue working toward building a road to node 14 for my next settlement
3. Focus on upgrading settlement at node 3 to a city (good ore/wheat location)
4. Work on breaking RED's longest road if possible
5. Use my 2 victory point cards at the right time to surprise RED when close to 10 points
</plan>

The optimal choice is option [0] - to place the robber on the brick hex (1, -1, 0) and steal from RED. This disrupts their most productive resource hex and doesn't hurt my own production.

\boxed{0}

PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist whose primary goal is to defeat the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (HIGHEST PRIORITY):
- Target 6 & 8 numbered hexes at all costs - these are the most productive numbers
- Prioritize ore and wheat hexes for your settlements - they enable cities and development cards
- Position yourself on at least one good brick and wood hex to enable early expansion
- Aim to cover ALL five resources with your two settlements combined
- Try to place on intersections with 3 productive hexes rather than 2
- Evaluate probability dots (not just numbers) - more dots mean more frequent production
- Place settlements with clear expansion paths that won't be easily blocked
- Avoid placing where you'll be immediately cut off by the opponent
- Position roads toward your next planned settlement location
- Consider distance to valuable ports (especially 2:1 ports matching your abundant resources)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-8):
- Build at least one new road and one new settlement ASAP
- Focus on securing access to any missing resources through expansion
- Establish access to a port if you're lacking a key resource
- Prevent the opponent from cutting off your expansion path
- Only purchase development cards if excess resources available or for immediate victory
- Expand toward high-value hexes the opponent doesn't yet control

MID-GAME RESOURCE MANAGEMENT (TURNS 9-20):
- Target 3 cities minimum (worth 6 VP) - upgrade most productive settlements first
- Maintain 1 road per every 2 settlements for flexible expansion
- Always build a settlement when you have the resources (more production points)
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each build (cities give best long-term return)
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1 or better) to maintain resource balance
- Keep at least one viable road-building path open at all times
- If blocked from expansion, shift to city upgrades and development cards

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Development cards should supplement your expansion, not replace it

# Game Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state and available actions to make the optimal decision.

## Game State Assessment
- I have 2 VP from my 2 settlements and 2 hidden VP from my development cards, so **4 VP total**
- RED has 7 VP (5 from buildings + 2 from longest road)
- Resources: I have 1 wood, 1 brick, 2 ore
- My settlement at node 3 produces ore (8) and wheat (10)
- My settlement at node 20 produces sheep (5) and wood (9)
- I need to continue expansion to catch up with RED

## Available Actions
1. End turn - not optimal when I can build
2. Build roads in various directions - I have exactly the resources needed (1 wood, 1 brick)

## Strategic Considerations

The key decision is where to build my road. My current roads are at:
- (2, 3), (3, 2) - near my settlement at node 3
- (0, 20), (20, 0) - near my settlement at node 20
- (3, 4), (4, 3) - expansion from node 3

Looking at the available road options:
- [1] edge (0, 1) - connects toward the center
- [2] edge (1, 2) - connects toward my settlement at node 3
- [3] edge (19, 20) - extends from my settlement at node 20
- [4] edge (20, 22) - extends from my settlement at node 20
- [5] edge (2, 9) - extends from my settlement at node 3
- [6] edge (0, 5) - connects toward RED's settlement
- [7] edge (3, 12) - extends from my settlement at node 3 toward desert

Looking at node 14, which my plan mentions: It's connected to the ore (8) hex. Building toward this resource-rich area would be valuable.

<plan>
1. Continue expansion toward node 14 to build a settlement there (good ore hex)
2. Work toward upgrading settlement at node 3 to a city
3. Continue trying to break RED's longest road when possible
4. Use my VP cards when I can reach 10 points in one move
5. Consider trading for wheat which I need for both settlements and cities
</plan>

Based on the board configuration, I need to determine which road gets me closest to viable settlement locations, especially toward node 14 which connects to the productive ore hex.

After analyzing the available road options and connectivity, road [7] at edge (3, 12) appears to be the best choice as it extends from my settlement at node 3 and opens a path toward node 14, which is on the valuable ore hex with an 8 (high probability).

This road also positions me to potentially claim more territory and work toward breaking RED's longest road in the future.

# Game State Analysis

Let me analyze my current position and the available options:

## Current Game State
- I have 2 VP from settlements + 2 hidden VP cards = 4 VP total
- RED has 8 VP (with longest road bonus)
- RED is already ahead by 4 VPs and only needs 2 more to win
- I have limited resources: 1 🐑SHEEP, 1 🌾WHEAT, 1 ⛏️ORE

## Available Actions
- [0] End turn
- [1] Buy a development card (costs exactly what I have: 1 🐑SHEEP, 1 🌾WHEAT, 1 ⛏️ORE)

## Strategic Considerations:
1. **Development Card Value**: 
   - I already have 2 VP development cards (not played yet)
   - A new development card could be:
     - Knight (most common) - helps claim largest army eventually & move robber
     - VP card - immediate hidden point
     - Year of Plenty - gain 2 resources
     - Monopoly - steal resources (already played one)
     - Road Building - free road expansion

2. **Resource Scarcity**:
   - If I end my turn, I preserve resources for potential future builds
   - But I'd need multiple high rolls to get anything substantial built

3. **RED's Position**:
   - RED is 2 points away from winning
   - RED has 7 cards - potential for significant development next turn

4. **My Production**:
   - I have two settlements on good numbers (8, 9, 5, 10)
   - But my development is significantly behind RED

<plan>
1. Buy the development card now - potential immediate value and keeps RED from getting it
2. If it's a Knight, use it to move the robber to RED's high-producing hex
3. If it's a VP card, that puts me at 5 VP total (secretly)
4. Work toward city at node 3 to increase production
5. Target expansion toward node 14 for ore production when possible
6. Continue trying to block RED's expansion and break their longest road
7. Save VP cards until I can win in a single move
</plan>

The development card is the only real productive use of my current resources. Ending my turn without spending would waste an opportunity to gain potential advantage. Since I have exactly the resources needed for a development card, and there's no other build option available, buying the card is optimal.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist whose primary goal is to defeat the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (HIGHEST PRIORITY):
- Target 6 & 8 numbered hexes at all costs - these are the most productive numbers
- Prioritize ore and wheat hexes for your settlements - they enable cities and development cards
- Position yourself on at least one good brick and wood hex to enable early expansion
- Aim to cover ALL five resources with your two settlements combined
- Try to place on intersections with 3 productive hexes rather than 2
- Evaluate probability dots (not just numbers) - more dots mean more frequent production
- Place settlements with clear expansion paths that won't be easily blocked
- Avoid placing where you'll be immediately cut off by the opponent
- Position roads toward your next planned settlement location
- Consider distance to valuable ports (especially 2:1 ports matching your abundant resources)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-8):
- Build at least one new road and one new settlement ASAP
- Focus on securing access to any missing resources through expansion
- Establish access to a port if you're lacking a key resource
- Prevent the opponent from cutting off your expansion path
- Only purchase development cards if excess resources available or for immediate victory
- Expand toward high-value hexes the opponent doesn't yet control

MID-GAME RESOURCE MANAGEMENT (TURNS 9-20):
- Target 3 cities minimum (worth 6 VP) - upgrade most productive settlements first
- Maintain 1 road per every 2 settlements for flexible expansion
- Always build a settlement when you have the resources (more production points)
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each build (cities give best long-term return)
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1 or better) to maintain resource balance
- Keep at least one viable road-building path open at all times
- If blocked from expansion, shift to city upgrades and development cards

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Development cards should supplement your expansion, not replace it
- Prioritize using Knight cards to protect your best hexes from the robber
- Save Knights when you're ahead to counter the opponent's robber placements
- Only buy development cards when you:
  1. Have excess sheep/wheat/ore but lack wood/brick for expansion
  2. Are close to securing largest army
  3. Need a specific card type (Road Building to break through a blockade)
- Use Road Building cards to save brick/wood and create surprise expansion paths
- Time Monopoly cards to capture opponent's stockpile after high-producing rolls
- Use Year of Plenty to complete crucial builds when short on specific resources

ROBBER PLACEMENT:
- Always target the opponent's highest-producing hex (high number + settlement/city)
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat hexes to slow city development
- If opponent relies heavily on one resource, target that resource's hexes
- Never place the robber on your own high-production hexes
- When stealing, target resources you immediately need for your next build

VICTORY PATH PLANNING:
- Target resource independence with at least one settlement/city on each resource
- Minimum viable infrastructure: 3-4 settlements total, with 2-3 upgraded to cities
- Calculate multiple paths to 10 VP and pursue the fastest:
  Path 1: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP)
  Path 2: 4 cities (8 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP)
  Path 3: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 victory point card
- Always track your direct path to 10 VP and focus on those builds
- Prioritize visible points (settlements/cities) over speculative development cards
- Switch paths if the opponent blocks your primary victory path
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Accept trades only when they enable an immediate, crucial build
- Never make trades that allow opponent to build a settlement or city immediately
- Trade away excess resources when at risk for robber (7+ cards)
- Calculate the production value of each settlement location before deciding to build
- When trading with ports, plan sequences that convert unwanted resources into needed ones

DETAILED DECISION FRAMEWORK:
1. Does this move bring me closer to 10 victory points?
2. Does this move increase my production capacity more than alternative builds?
3. Does this move protect me from being blocked or cut off?
4. Does this move position me for strongest expansion in next 2-3 turns?
5. Is this the most efficient use of my current resources?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 81 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Buy the development card now - potential immediate value and keeps RED from getting it
2. If it's a Knight, use it to move the robber to RED's high-producing hex
3. If it's a VP card, that puts me at 5 VP total (secretly)
4. Work toward city at node 3 to increase production
5. Target expansion toward node 14 for ore production when possible
6. Continue trying to block RED's expansion and break their longest road
7. Save VP cards until I can win in a single move

Based on this information, which action number do you choose? Think step by step about your options, then put the final action number in a box like \boxed{1}.
RESPONSE:
I'll analyze the current game state to determine my optimal move.

## Game State Assessment

- I have 2 visible VP (2 settlements)
- I have 2 hidden VP (2 VP cards)
- I have 1 Knight card available to play
- RED has 9 VP and is one point away from winning
- I only have 1 ore resource
- The robber is currently on a desert hex (0, -1, 1), which isn't blocking any production

## Options Analysis

Option 0: Play Knight card
- Advantages:
  - I can move the robber to one of RED's productive hexes, slowing their production
  - I can steal a resource from RED
  - Playing Knights helps toward Largest Army (2 VP)
- Disadvantages:
  - I already have 1 Knight played, so this would only give me 2 Knights total, still short of the 3 needed for Largest Army

Option 1: Roll the dice
- Advantages:
  - Could gain more resources to build with
  - Saves the Knight card for when it might be more critical
- Disadvantages:
  - RED is one point from winning, so they could win on their next turn
  - If I roll a 7, I can move the robber anyway

## Strategic Considerations

RED is at 9 VP and likely to win on their next turn. My best chance is to slow them down as much as possible by disrupting their resource production.

Looking at RED's settlements/cities:
- 🏙️ at node 1 (produces: 🌾10[⭐], 🧱6[⭐⭐⭐], 🌲9[⭐⭐])
- 🏙️ at node 5 (produces: 🌾10[⭐], 🌾4[⭐], 🐑5[⭐⭐])
- 🏠 at node 15 (produces: ⛏️8[⭐⭐⭐], 🌾4[⭐])
- 🏠 at node 7 (produces: 🧱6[⭐⭐⭐])
- 🏠 at node 13 (produces: ⛏️8[⭐⭐⭐])

Their highest production is from the 8 ore hex and the 6 brick hex, both with [⭐⭐⭐] probability. Blocking one of these would be most impactful.

<plan>
1. Play Knight card now to move robber to either the 8 ore hex or 6 brick hex
2. Aim to steal a useful resource from RED
3. On future turns, work toward building cities to increase my VP
4. Continue developing toward largest army (need 1 more Knight)
5. Keep VP cards hidden until I can win in a single turn
6. Focus on disrupting RED's production to prevent them from reaching 10 VP
</plan>

Given that RED is so close to winning, the most aggressive and defensive move is to play the Knight card now. This will allow me to block one of RED's high-producing hexes and potentially steal a useful resource.

RESPONSE:
I need to analyze where to move the robber to maximize my strategic advantage against RED, who is at 9/10 victory points and very close to winning.

First, let me understand what each hex contains:
- (0, 0, 0): 🌾10 Wheat [⭐]
- (1, -1, 0): 🧱6 Brick [⭐⭐⭐]
- (-1, 0, 1): ⛏️8 Ore [⭐⭐⭐]
- (-1, 1, 0): 🌾4 Wheat [⭐]
- (0, 1, -1): 🐑5 Sheep [⭐⭐]
- (1, 0, -1): 🌲9 Wood [⭐⭐]

Looking at RED's settlements and cities:
- RED has a city at node 1 producing Wheat 10, Brick 6, and Wood 9
- RED has a city at node 5 producing Wheat 10, Wheat 4, and Sheep 5
- RED has settlements at nodes 15, 7, and 13 producing Ore 8, Wheat 4, Brick 6, and more Ore 8

Since RED is at 9 VP, my primary goal must be to disrupt their ability to reach 10 VP this turn.

Critical analysis of options:
1. The hex (1, -1, 0) contains Brick 6, which is rated [⭐⭐⭐] high productivity. RED has both a city at node 1 and a settlement at node 7 connected to this hex, making it their main source of brick.
2. The hex (-1, 0, 1) contains Ore 8, rated [⭐⭐⭐]. RED has two settlements (nodes 13 and 15) connected to this hex, but this would also block my own settlement at node 3.
3. The hex (1, 0, -1) contains Wood 9 [⭐⭐], which RED gets from their city at node 1.

Since RED has 9 VP and needs just 1 more, they would likely be trying to:
- Build another settlement (+1 VP)
- Upgrade a settlement to city (+1 VP)
- Buy development cards hoping for a VP card

For a settlement, RED needs brick and wood. For a city, RED needs ore and wheat. For development cards, RED needs ore, wheat, and sheep.

<plan>
1. Move the robber to the Brick 6 hex (1, -1, 0) to block RED's primary brick source
2. Try to steal a useful resource from RED
3. Continue working toward cities on future turns to increase my VP
4. Play more Knight cards to secure largest army (need 1 more Knight)
5. Keep VP cards hidden until I can win in a single turn
6. Focus on disrupting RED's production while building toward victory
</plan>

The Brick 6 hex is the most critical target since:
- It has high productivity [⭐⭐⭐]
- RED has both a city and settlement there (maximum impact)
- Brick is essential for RED to build settlements or roads
- This disrupts their most likely path to 10 VP

Therefore, I choose to move the robber to (1, -1, 0) and steal from RED.

PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist whose primary goal is to defeat the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (HIGHEST PRIORITY):
- Target 6 & 8 numbered hexes at all costs - these are the most productive numbers
- Prioritize ore and wheat hexes for your settlements - they enable cities and development cards
- Position yourself on at least one good brick and wood hex to enable early expansion
- Aim to cover ALL five resources with your two settlements combined
- Try to place on intersections with 3 productive hexes rather than 2
- Evaluate probability dots (not just numbers) - more dots mean more frequent production
- Place settlements with clear expansion paths that won't be easily blocked
- Avoid placing where you'll be immediately cut off by the opponent
- Position roads toward your next planned settlement location
- Consider distance to valuable ports (especially 2:1 ports matching your abundant resources)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-8):
- Build at least one new road and one new settlement ASAP
- Focus on securing access to any missing resources through expansion
- Establish access to a port if you're lacking a key resource
- Prevent the opponent from cutting off your expansion path
- Only purchase development cards if excess resources available or for immediate victory
- Expand toward high-value hexes the opponent doesn't yet control

MID-GAME RESOURCE MANAGEMENT (TURNS 9-20):
- Target 3 cities minimum (worth 6 VP) - upgrade most productive settlements first
- Maintain 1 road per every 2 settlements for flexible expansion
- Always build a settlement when you have the resources (more production points)
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each build (cities give best long-term return)
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1 or better) to maintain resource balance
- Keep at least one viable road-building path open at all times
- If blocked from expansion, shift to city upgrades and development cards

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Development cards should supplement your expansion, not replace it
- Prioritize using Knight cards to protect your best hexes from the robber
- Save Knights when you're ahead to counter the opponent's robber placements
- Only buy development cards when you:
  1. Have excess sheep/wheat/ore but lack wood/brick for expansion
  2. Are close to securing largest army
  3. Need a specific card type (Road Building to break through a blockade)
- Use Road Building cards to save brick/wood and create surprise expansion paths
- Time Monopoly cards to capture opponent's stockpile after high-producing rolls
- Use Year of Plenty to complete crucial builds when short on specific resources

ROBBER PLACEMENT:
- Always target the opponent's highest-producing hex (high number + settlement/city)
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat hexes to slow city development
- If opponent relies heavily on one resource, target that resource's hexes
- Never place the robber on your own high-production hexes
- When stealing, target resources you immediately need for your next build

VICTORY PATH PLANNING:
- Target resource independence with at least one settlement/city on each resource
- Minimum viable infrastructure: 3-4 settlements total, with 2-3 upgraded to cities
- Calculate multiple paths to 10 VP and pursue the fastest:
  Path 1: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP)
  Path 2: 4 cities (8 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP)
  Path 3: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 victory point card
- Always track your direct path to 10 VP and focus on those builds
- Prioritize visible points (settlements/cities) over speculative development cards
- Switch paths if the opponent blocks your primary victory path
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Accept trades only when they enable an immediate, crucial build
- Never make trades that allow opponent to build a settlement or city immediately
- Trade away excess resources when at risk for robber (7+ cards)
- Calculate the production value of each settlement location before deciding to build
- When trading with ports, plan sequences that convert unwanted resources into needed ones

DETAILED DECISION FRAMEWORK:
1. Does this move bring me closer to 10 victory points?
2. Does this move increase my production capacity more than alternative builds?
3. Does this move protect me from being blocked or cut off?
4. Does this move position me for strongest expansion in next 2-3 turns?
5. Is this the most efficient use of my current resources?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Initial Settlement Analysis

I'm playing as the BLUE player and need to place my first settlement. This is a critical decision that will affect my entire game trajectory. Let me analyze the options carefully:

## Resource Priorities
- Need access to all 5 resources between my two settlements
- 6 & 8 are the best-producing numbers
- Ore + Wheat are critical for city development
- Need brick + wood access for early expansion
- Must have multiple expansion routes

## Node Analysis:

Let's look at the resource nodes and their probabilities:
- 🌾4 (Wheat): Low probability (3 dots)
- 🏜️ (Desert): No production
- 🐑8 (Sheep): High probability (5 dots)
- 🌲10 (Wood): Medium probability (3 dots)
- 🧱3 (Brick): Low probability (2 dots)
- 🌾9 (Wheat): Medium probability (4 dots)
- ⛏️5 (Ore): Low-medium probability (4 dots)

The highest value node appears to be the sheep 8 hex, which has 5 probability dots. The RED player has already secured this with a settlement at node 4.

Looking at intersections:
- Node 9 borders wheat 4 and desert (with robber)
- Node 6 borders wheat 4 and brick 3
- Node 1 borders wood 10 and brick 3
- Node 12 borders sheep 8 and desert (with robber)
- Node 16 borders wheat 9 and ore 5

## Strategic Evaluation:
Node 16 looks most promising as it gives me:
1. Access to both wheat (9) and ore (5) - critical for city development
2. Decent probability (8 dots total)
3. Clear expansion path
4. Resource diversity (can get the other resources with my second placement)

Node 6 would give me wheat (4) and brick (3), but both have relatively low probability.
Node 1 would give me wood (10) and brick (3), good for early expansion.
Node 12 is less favorable with sheep and desert.

<plan>
1. Place first settlement at node 16 to secure wheat and ore access
2. Plan to place second settlement at a location with wood and possibly brick/sheep
3. Focus on early expansion toward productive hexes
4. Target city development as soon as possible
5. Work toward longest road or largest army based on resource availability
</plan>

Node 16 gives me the best foundation for my strategy with wheat and ore access, which will be crucial for city development later on. It has a good total probability and leaves me with multiple expansion paths.

# Initial Settlement Road Placement Analysis

I need to place my first road in a direction that will support my overall strategy. I've already placed my first settlement at node 16, which gives me wheat (9) and ore (5) production.

## Analyzing Available Road Options:
- [0] Road at edge (5, 16) - heading northwest toward forest hex
- [1] Road at edge (16, 21) - heading northeast
- [2] Road at edge (16, 18) - heading east

## Strategic Analysis:
Looking at the board layout, I need to consider my best expansion path:

1. Option [0] (5, 16): This leads toward node 5, which connects to the ore hex (5), offering no new resources beyond what I already have.

2. Option [1] (16, 21): This leads toward node 21, which connects to the ore hex (5), again not providing new resource diversity.

3. Option [2] (16, 18): This leads toward node 18, which connects to the wheat hex (9). Going further could lead me toward potentially unexplored territory where I might find wood or brick.

Since I've secured wheat and ore with my first settlement, my primary goal should be to secure wood and brick for roads and future settlements. The board shown is incomplete, but option [2] gives me the most flexibility to explore eastward where there might be wood or brick hexes not yet visible.

<plan>
1. Place first settlement at node 16 to secure wheat and ore access (already done)
2. Build initial road eastward toward node 18 to explore potential wood/brick hexes in that direction
3. Place second settlement at a location with wood and brick/sheep access
4. Focus on early expansion toward productive hexes
5. Target city development as soon as possible with my strong ore/wheat position
</plan>

Option [2] gives me the best path to potentially discover essential resources I'm missing, particularly wood and brick.

- Only buy development cards when you:
  1. Have excess sheep/wheat/ore but lack wood/brick for expansion
  2. Are close to securing largest army
  3. Need a specific card type (Road Building to break through a blockade)
- Use Road Building cards to save brick/wood and create surprise expansion paths
- Time Monopoly cards to capture opponent's stockpile after high-producing rolls
- Use Year of Plenty to complete crucial builds when short on specific resources

ROBBER PLACEMENT:
- Always target the opponent's highest-producing hex (high number + settlement/city)
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat hexes to slow city development
- If opponent relies heavily on one resource, target that resource's hexes
- Never place the robber on your own high-production hexes
- When stealing, target resources you immediately need for your next build

VICTORY PATH PLANNING:
- Target resource independence with at least one settlement/city on each resource
- Minimum viable infrastructure: 3-4 settlements total, with 2-3 upgraded to cities
- Calculate multiple paths to 10 VP and pursue the fastest:
  Path 1: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP)
  Path 2: 4 cities (8 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP)
  Path 3: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 victory point card
- Always track your direct path to 10 VP and focus on those builds
- Prioritize visible points (settlements/cities) over speculative development cards
- Switch paths if the opponent blocks your primary victory path
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Accept trades only when they enable an immediate, crucial build
- Never make trades that allow opponent to build a settlement or city immediately
- Trade away excess resources when at risk for robber (7+ cards)
- Calculate the production value of each settlement location before deciding to build
- When trading with ports, plan sequences that convert unwanted resources into needed ones

DETAILED DECISION FRAMEWORK:
1. Does this move bring me closer to 10 victory points?
2. Does this move increase my production capacity more than alternative builds?
3. Does this move protect me from being blocked or cut off?
4. Does this move position me for strongest expansion in next 2-3 turns?
5. Is this the most efficient use of my current resources?

# Analysis of Initial Settlement Placement

I'm evaluating where to place my second initial settlement, which is a critical decision that will shape my entire game strategy. Let me analyze the options systematically.

## Current Situation
- My first settlement is at node 16, producing wheat (9) and ore (5)
- The opponent (RED) has placed at node 4, producing wood (10), sheep (8), and wheat (9)
- I need to diversify my resources and secure wood and brick for early expansion
- The robber is currently on the desert hex (0,-1,1)

## Priority Resources to Acquire
Since I already have wheat and ore from my first settlement, I need:
1. Wood (🌲) - Essential for early roads and settlements
2. Brick (🧱) - Needed for roads and settlements
3. Sheep (🐑) - Useful for settlements and development cards

## Node Analysis
Let me evaluate the most promising node options:

Node 0: Connects to wood (10), ore (5), and brick (3) - Very strong option with all productive numbers and crucial resources
Node 1: Connects to wood (10), wheat (4), and brick (3) - Good option but wheat is redundant
Node 3: Connects to wood (10), sheep (8), and desert - Has wood and sheep but includes a non-productive desert
Node 13: Connects to sheep (8) only - Inadequate resource diversity
Node 20: Connects to ore (5) and brick (3) - Ore redundancy and only two resources

Node 0 stands out as the clear winner - it provides access to wood (10) and brick (3) which I desperately need, plus additional ore (5) which will accelerate my city development strategy. The 3-5-10 number spread gives excellent probability coverage.

## Strategic Considerations
Placing at node 0 would:
1. Give me access to all five resources between my two settlements
2. Provide excellent number diversity (5, 9 from first settlement; 3, 5, 10 from second)
3. Position me well for expansion with access to wood and brick
4. Allow me to pursue my city development strategy with strong ore production
5. Avoid placing me too close to the opponent's settlement

<plan>
1. Place second settlement at node 0 to secure wood (10), ore (5), and brick (3)
2. Focus on early expansion using my wood and brick access
3. Prioritize upgrading settlements to cities with my strong ore/wheat position
4. Target expansion toward the 4-wheat hex for even more production
5. Monitor for development card opportunities with my balanced resource access
</plan>

Based on this analysis, I will select node 0 for my second settlement placement.

PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist whose primary goal is to defeat the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (HIGHEST PRIORITY):
- Target 6 & 8 numbered hexes at all costs - these are the most productive numbers
- Prioritize ore and wheat hexes for your settlements - they enable cities and development cards
- Position yourself on at least one good brick and wood hex to enable early expansion
- Aim to cover ALL five resources with your two settlements combined
- Try to place on intersections with 3 productive hexes rather than 2
- Evaluate probability dots (not just numbers) - more dots mean more frequent production
- Place settlements with clear expansion paths that won't be easily blocked
- Avoid placing where you'll be immediately cut off by the opponent
- Position roads toward your next planned settlement location
- Consider distance to valuable ports (especially 2:1 ports matching your abundant resources)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-8):
- Build at least one new road and one new settlement ASAP
- Focus on securing access to any missing resources through expansion
- Establish access to a port if you're lacking a key resource
- Prevent the opponent from cutting off your expansion path
- Only purchase development cards if excess resources available or for immediate victory
- Expand toward high-value hexes the opponent doesn't yet control

MID-GAME RESOURCE MANAGEMENT (TURNS 9-20):
- Target 3 cities minimum (worth 6 VP) - upgrade most productive settlements first
- Maintain 1 road per every 2 settlements for flexible expansion
- Always build a settlement when you have the resources (more production points)
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each build (cities give best long-term return)
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1 or better) to maintain resource balance
- Keep at least one viable road-building path open at all times
- If blocked from expansion, shift to city upgrades and development cards

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Development cards should supplement your expansion, not replace it
- Prioritize using Knight cards to protect your best hexes from the robber
- Save Knights when you're ahead to counter the opponent's robber placements
- Only buy development cards when you:
  1. Have excess sheep/wheat/ore but lack wood/brick for expansion
  2. Are close to securing largest army
  3. Need a specific card type (Road Building to break through a blockade)

# Initial Road Placement Analysis

I need to carefully evaluate which road will give me the best strategic advantage following the placement of my two initial settlements at nodes 16 and 0.

## Examining My Current Position
- I have settlements at nodes 16 and 0
- Node 16 produces wheat (9) and ore (5) - great for city upgrades
- Node 0 produces wood (10), ore (5), and brick (3) - excellent for expansion
- I already have balanced access to all resources except sheep
- I have exactly 1 wood, 1 brick, and 1 ore resource cards

## Road Options Analysis

**Option [0] - Road at edge (0, 1)**
- This road leads toward node 1, which connects to:
  - Brick (3), wood (10), and wheat (4)
  - But node 1 overlaps with my existing resources
- This direction doesn't lead to any sheep hex (my missing resource)
- It provides limited expansion options toward the middle of the board

**Option [1] - Road at edge (0, 20)**
- This road leads toward node 20, which connects to:
  - Brick (3) and ore (5)
  - These resources I already have access to
- It leads away from wheat and doesn't provide sheep access
- Expansion potential is more constrained

**Option [2] - Road at edge (0, 5)**
- This road leads toward node 5, which connects to:
  - Wood (10) and ore (5)
  - But also leads to nodes 16 (my existing settlement) and 19
- Most importantly, from node 5 I can expand toward nodes 15, 16, 17 which gives access to the sheep hex (8)
- It creates a path to complete a solid expansion route toward my missing resource (sheep)

<plan>
1. Build the initial road at edge (0, 5) to create a path toward sheep production (8)
2. Focus next on building a road from node 5 toward the sheep hex
3. Place a settlement to gain access to sheep, completing my resource diversity
4. Later upgrade my ore/wheat settlements to cities for maximum production
5. Monitor for development card opportunities once I have balanced production
</plan>

The optimal choice is road at edge (0, 5) which opens a strategic path toward securing my missing sheep resource while maintaining good expansion potential.

# Game Analysis for Turn 3

I'll analyze the current game state and available actions to make the optimal strategic decision.

## Current Resources
I have:
- 1 🌲 WOOD
- 1 🧱 BRICK
- 3 ⛏️ ORE

This is enough to build exactly one road.

## Production Analysis
My settlements:
- Node 16: Produces wheat (9) and ore (5) - good for city development
- Node 0: Produces wood (10), ore (5), and brick (3) - provides all expansion resources

What I'm missing:
- Sheep (8) - I have no access to this resource, limiting my development card options

## Expansion Opportunities

Let me analyze each road building option:

1. Edge (0, 1): Extends from my settlement toward wheat (4) and connects to RED's territory
2. Edge (0, 20): Extends toward brick (3) but goes in a less productive direction
3. Edge (4, 5): Not connected to my current network, invalid choice
4. Edge (5, 16): Creates a loop in my existing road network, not optimal for expansion
5. Edge (16, 21): Extends toward ore (5) hex, could be useful for city strategy
6. Edge (17, 18): Not connected to my current network, invalid choice

Option 1 (0, 1) is most promising as it:
1. Moves toward the wheat (4) hex 
2. Creates potential for expanding toward sheep (8) in future turns
3. Aligns with my plan to gain access to sheep production

<plan>
1. Build the road at edge (0, 1) to create an expansion path toward wheat (4) and sheep (8)
2. Next turn, focus on extending toward nodes that will give me sheep access
3. Place a settlement to secure sheep production as soon as possible
4. Then focus on upgrading settlements to cities, prioritizing my ore/wheat settlement at node 16
5. With balanced resource production, consider development cards for victory points
</plan>

Based on this analysis, I need to continue expanding toward the sheep resource to complete my resource diversity, and edge (0, 1) is the best path forward.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist whose primary goal is to defeat the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (HIGHEST PRIORITY):
- Target 6 & 8 numbered hexes at all costs - these are the most productive numbers
- Prioritize ore and wheat hexes for your settlements - they enable cities and development cards
- Position yourself on at least one good brick and wood hex to enable early expansion
- Aim to cover ALL five resources with your two settlements combined
- Try to place on intersections with 3 productive hexes rather than 2
- Evaluate probability dots (not just numbers) - more dots mean more frequent production
- Place settlements with clear expansion paths that won't be easily blocked
- Avoid placing where you'll be immediately cut off by the opponent
- Position roads toward your next planned settlement location
- Consider distance to valuable ports (especially 2:1 ports matching your abundant resources)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-8):
- Build at least one new road and one new settlement ASAP
- Focus on securing access to any missing resources through expansion
- Establish access to a port if you're lacking a key resource
- Prevent the opponent from cutting off your expansion path
- Only purchase development cards if excess resources available or for immediate victory
- Expand toward high-value hexes the opponent doesn't yet control

MID-GAME RESOURCE MANAGEMENT (TURNS 9-20):
- Target 3 cities minimum (worth 6 VP) - upgrade most productive settlements first
- Maintain 1 road per every 2 settlements for flexible expansion
- Always build a settlement when you have the resources (more production points)
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each build (cities give best long-term return)
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1 or better) to maintain resource balance
- Keep at least one viable road-building path open at all times
- If blocked from expansion, shift to city upgrades and development cards

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Development cards should supplement your expansion, not replace it
- Prioritize using Knight cards to protect your best hexes from the robber
- Save Knights when you're ahead to counter the opponent's robber placements
- Only buy development cards when you:
  1. Have excess sheep/wheat/ore but lack wood/brick for expansion
  2. Are close to securing largest army
  3. Need a specific card type (Road Building to break through a blockade)
- Use Road Building cards to save brick/wood and create surprise expansion paths
- Time Monopoly cards to capture opponent's stockpile after high-producing rolls
- Use Year of Plenty to complete crucial builds when short on specific resources

ROBBER PLACEMENT:
- Always target the opponent's highest-producing hex (high number + settlement/city)
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat hexes to slow city development
- If opponent relies heavily on one resource, target that resource's hexes
- Never place the robber on your own high-production hexes
- When stealing, target resources you immediately need for your next build

VICTORY PATH PLANNING:
- Target resource independence with at least one settlement/city on each resource
- Minimum viable infrastructure: 3-4 settlements total, with 2-3 upgraded to cities
- Calculate multiple paths to 10 VP and pursue the fastest:
  Path 1: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP)
  Path 2: 4 cities (8 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP)
  Path 3: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 victory point card
- Always track your direct path to 10 VP and focus on those builds
- Prioritize visible points (settlements/cities) over speculative development cards
- Switch paths if the opponent blocks your primary victory path
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Accept trades only when they enable an immediate, crucial build
- Never make trades that allow opponent to build a settlement or city immediately
- Trade away excess resources when at risk for robber (7+ cards)
- Calculate the production value of each settlement location before deciding to build
- When trading with ports, plan sequences that convert unwanted resources into needed ones

DETAILED DECISION FRAMEWORK:
1. Does this move bring me closer to 10 victory points?
2. Does this move increase my production capacity more than alternative builds?
3. Does this move protect me from being blocked or cut off?
4. Does this move position me for strongest expansion in next 2-3 turns?
5. Is this the most efficient use of my current resources?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 17 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Build the road at edge (0, 1) to create an expansion path toward wheat (4) and sheep (8)
2. Next turn, focus on extending toward nodes that will give me sheep access
3. Place a settlement to secure sheep production as soon as possible
4. Then focus on upgrading settlements to cities, prioritizing my ore/wheat settlement at node 16
5. With balanced resource production, consider development cards for victory points

# Game Analysis for Turn 17

I'll analyze the current game state and determine the optimal move:

## Resources Assessment
- I have: 2 🧱BRICK, 2 🌾WHEAT, 3 ⛏️ORE
- This is exactly enough for one city upgrade (2 wheat + 3 ore)

## Victory Point Analysis
- Current VP: 2/10 (from 2 settlements)
- If I upgrade a settlement to a city: +1 VP (3/10 total)
- Red also has 2 VP, so we're tied

## Production Analysis
- Settlement at node 16: produces wheat (9) and ore (5) - both critical city-building resources
- Settlement at node 0: produces wood (10), ore (5), and brick (3) - good for expansion

## Strategic Considerations:
1. Upgrading node 16 would double my wheat and ore production (crucial for further city upgrades)
2. Upgrading node 0 would double wood, ore and brick production (expansion resources)
3. The robber is on the ore hex (5), which is connected to both settlements
4. I currently lack sheep production completely

<plan>
1. Upgrade settlement at node 16 to city to double wheat/ore production
2. Use increased production to build roads toward sheep resources
3. Aim to build a settlement at a sheep-producing node (target areas near 8 sheep hex)
4. Continue upgrading settlements to cities, especially the one at node 0
5. Consider development cards once I have sheep access and solid production base
</plan>

Given the strategic importance of increasing wheat and ore production for further city upgrades and development cards, I should upgrade my settlement at node 16 to a city. This will increase my VP count to 3 and double my wheat/ore production, providing the foundation for future growth.

# Analyzing the Robber Movement Options

I need to carefully consider where to move the robber to most effectively hinder RED while advancing my position.

## Game State Analysis
- I'm BLUE with 3/10 VP (1 settlement, 1 city)
- RED has 2/10 VP (2 settlements)
- RED has 7 cards hidden (significant hand size!)
- I only have 2 brick cards
- My city at node 16 produces wheat (9) and ore (5)
- My settlement at node 0 produces wood (10), ore (5), and brick (3)

## Robber Options Evaluation:
[0] Move to (0,0,0) - Wood hex (10)
   - Blocks RED's settlement at node 4 (10 wood)
   - Blocks my settlement at node 0 (10 wood)
   - Stealing opportunity from RED
   - DISADVANTAGE: Hurts my own wood production too

[1] Move to (1,-1,0) - Wheat hex (4)
   - Blocks RED's settlement at node 6 (4 wheat)
   - Stealing opportunity from RED
   - Doesn't affect my production

[3] Move to (-1,0,1) - Sheep hex (8)
   - Blocks RED's settlement at node 4 (8 sheep - high value!)
   - Stealing opportunity from RED
   - High impact since it's an 8 (very productive)
   - RED gets 3 dots of sheep production here

[4] Move to (-1,1,0) - Wheat hex (9)
   - Blocks RED's settlement at node 4 (9 wheat)
   - Blocks my city at node 16 (9 wheat)
   - Stealing opportunity from RED
   - DISADVANTAGE: Hurts my own wheat production from my city

[5] Move to (1,0,-1) - Brick hex (3)
   - Blocks RED's settlement at node 6 (3 brick)
   - Blocks my settlement at node 0 (3 brick)
   - Stealing opportunity from RED
   - DISADVANTAGE: Hurts my own brick production too

[2] Move to (0,-1,1) - Desert
   - No production impact
   - No stealing opportunity
   - Completely ineffective choice

## Strategic Decision:
Looking at RED's settlements:
- Node 4: Produces wood(10), sheep(8), wheat(9) - very productive!
- Node 6: Produces wheat(4), brick(3) - less productive

<plan>
1. Block RED's most productive hex (sheep 8)
2. Continue working toward upgrading settlement at node 0 to city
3. Build roads toward sheep resources
4. Find opening for a new settlement, preferably with sheep production
5. Use ore/wheat dominance to pursue development cards once I have sheep access
</plan>

The sheep hex produces on an 8, which is one of the most frequently rolled numbers. Blocking this prevents RED from getting 3 dots of sheep production. This is clearly the most impactful move, and it doesn't hurt my own production at all.

Taking option [3] will:
- Block RED's high-value sheep production
- Allow me to steal a resource from RED
- Not impact my own production at all
- Potentially steal a resource I need (possibly sheep)

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist whose primary goal is to defeat the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (HIGHEST PRIORITY):
- Target 6 & 8 numbered hexes at all costs - these are the most productive numbers
- Prioritize ore and wheat hexes for your settlements - they enable cities and development cards
- Position yourself on at least one good brick and wood hex to enable early expansion
- Aim to cover ALL five resources with your two settlements combined
- Try to place on intersections with 3 productive hexes rather than 2
- Evaluate probability dots (not just numbers) - more dots mean more frequent production
- Place settlements with clear expansion paths that won't be easily blocked
- Avoid placing where you'll be immediately cut off by the opponent
- Position roads toward your next planned settlement location
- Consider distance to valuable ports (especially 2:1 ports matching your abundant resources)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-8):
- Build at least one new road and one new settlement ASAP
- Focus on securing access to any missing resources through expansion
- Establish access to a port if you're lacking a key resource
- Prevent the opponent from cutting off your expansion path
- Only purchase development cards if excess resources available or for immediate victory
- Expand toward high-value hexes the opponent doesn't yet control

MID-GAME RESOURCE MANAGEMENT (TURNS 9-20):
- Target 3 cities minimum (worth 6 VP) - upgrade most productive settlements first
- Maintain 1 road per every 2 settlements for flexible expansion
- Always build a settlement when you have the resources (more production points)
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each build (cities give best long-term return)
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1 or better) to maintain resource balance
- Keep at least one viable road-building path open at all times
- If blocked from expansion, shift to city upgrades and development cards

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Development cards should supplement your expansion, not replace it
- Prioritize using Knight cards to protect your best hexes from the robber
- Save Knights when you're ahead to counter the opponent's robber placements
- Only buy development cards when you:
  1. Have excess sheep/wheat/ore but lack wood/brick for expansion
  2. Are close to securing largest army
  3. Need a specific card type (Road Building to break through a blockade)
- Use Road Building cards to save brick/wood and create surprise expansion paths
- Time Monopoly cards to capture opponent's stockpile after high-producing rolls
- Use Year of Plenty to complete crucial builds when short on specific resources

ROBBER PLACEMENT:
- Always target the opponent's highest-producing hex (high number + settlement/city)
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat hexes to slow city development
- If opponent relies heavily on one resource, target that resource's hexes
- Never place the robber on your own high-production hexes
- When stealing, target resources you immediately need for your next build

VICTORY PATH PLANNING:
- Target resource independence with at least one settlement/city on each resource
- Minimum viable infrastructure: 3-4 settlements total, with 2-3 upgraded to cities
- Calculate multiple paths to 10 VP and pursue the fastest:
  Path 1: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP)
  Path 2: 4 cities (8 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP)
  Path 3: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 victory point card
- Always track your direct path to 10 VP and focus on those builds
- Prioritize visible points (settlements/cities) over speculative development cards
- Switch paths if the opponent blocks your primary victory path
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Accept trades only when they enable an immediate, crucial build
- Never make trades that allow opponent to build a settlement or city immediately
- Trade away excess resources when at risk for robber (7+ cards)
- Calculate the production value of each settlement location before deciding to build
- When trading with ports, plan sequences that convert unwanted resources into needed ones

DETAILED DECISION FRAMEWORK:
1. Does this move bring me closer to 10 victory points?
2. Does this move increase my production capacity more than alternative builds?
3. Does this move protect me from being blocked or cut off?
4. Does this move position me for strongest expansion in next 2-3 turns?
5. Is this the most efficient use of my current resources?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 27 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Block RED's most productive hex (sheep 8)
2. Continue working toward upgrading settlement at node 0 to city
3. Build roads toward sheep resources
4. Find opening for a new settlement, preferably with sheep production
5. Use ore/wheat dominance to pursue development cards once I have sheep access
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.

# Game Analysis for Catan Turn 27

Let me analyze the current game state and available actions:

## Current Game Status
- I have 3/10 victory points (1 settlement + 1 city)
- Resources: 1 Wood, 1 Brick, 1 Wheat
- RED has 2/10 points (2 settlements)
- RED has 9 cards in hand (danger of robber)
- The robber is currently on Ore hex (5)

## Resource Production Analysis
- My production: Ore(5), Wheat(9), Wood(10), Brick(3)
- RED's production: Wood(10), Sheep(8), Wheat(9), Wheat(4), Brick(3)
- RED has strong sheep production at the 8 hex, which I lack
- I have good ore production for cities

## Available Actions
I can either:
- End my turn [0]
- Build a road in one of 7 possible locations [1-7]

## Road Building Options Evaluation
1. Road at (1, 2): Extends toward wheat production but no clear settlement spot
2. Road at (0, 20): Extends toward brick production and potentially opens node 22/23  
3. Road at (4, 5): Not a strategic direction
4. Road at (5, 16): Connects my existing paths but doesn't open new territory
5. Road at (16, 21): Extends toward ore but doesn't lead to clear settlement locations
6. Road at (1, 6): Extends toward wheat/brick intersection
7. Road at (17, 18): Not connected to my network

## Strategic Decision
- I need to expand my production, especially for sheep
- Option [2] gives me the best path toward potential new settlement locations (nodes 22/23)
- RED has 9 cards which suggests they may be saving for important builds
- I should use my brick/wood now to advance my position

<plan>
1. Build road at edge (0, 20) to expand toward brick 3 hex
2. Continue working toward upgrading settlement at node 0 to city
3. Try to expand toward sheep resources for balanced production
4. Work toward building a new settlement at node 22 or 23
5. Use ore/wheat dominance to pursue development cards once I have sheep access
</plan>

Building the road at edge (0, 20) is my best option as it creates a path toward potential new settlement locations while using my limited resources effectively.

# Game Analysis for Turn 37

I need to analyze the current game state and determine the optimal move to maximize my chances of winning.

## Current Game State Assessment:
- I have 3/10 victory points (1 settlement + 1 city)
- Resources: 1 wood, 2 brick, 3 wheat (no ore or sheep)
- The robber is on the desert hex, not affecting any production
- My two buildings are at:
  * City at node 16 (produces wheat and ore)
  * Settlement at node 0 (produces wood, ore, and brick)

## Available Options Analysis:
I can either end my turn or build a road with my wood and brick resources. Let's analyze road options:

1. Edge (1, 2): Connects toward the center but doesn't advance toward any immediate settlement location
2. Edge (19, 20): Doesn't connect to my existing network
3. Edge (4, 5): Doesn't connect to my existing network
4. Edge (5, 16): Would connect my settlement at node 0 with city at node 16, creating a potential longest road path
5. Edge (16, 21): Extends from my city at node 16 toward the edge of the board
6. Edge (20, 22): Extends from my road at node 20 toward the brick 3 hex
7. Edge (1, 6): Extends from node 1 toward wheat 4 and brick 3 hexes
8. Edge (17, 18): Doesn't connect to my existing network

## Strategic Considerations:
1. My current plan mentions expanding toward the brick 3 hex
2. I need access to sheep for balanced production
3. I should work toward upgrading my settlement at node 0 to a city
4. Building a new settlement at node 22 or 23 near the brick hex is part of my plan

## Decision Making:
Looking at the options, road 6 (edge 20, 22) aligns best with my current plan:
- It extends toward the brick 3 hex as mentioned in my plan
- It allows me to potentially build a settlement at node 22 later
- It uses my wood and brick resources efficiently

Road 7 (edge 1, 6) is also worth considering as it extends toward wheat and brick resources, but option 6 seems to better align with my stated plan of building toward node 22.

<plan>
1. Build road at edge (20, 22) to continue expansion toward brick 3 hex
2. Work toward a settlement at node 22 or 23 to improve brick production
3. Focus on acquiring sheep resources through trading or expansion
4. Save wheat for upgrading settlement at node 0 to city once I get ore
5. Consider development cards once I have better sheep access
</plan>

Based on this analysis, I'll build a road at edge (20, 22) to continue my expansion toward the brick hex.

  Path 2: 4 cities (8 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP)
  Path 3: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 victory point card
- Always track your direct path to 10 VP and focus on those builds
- Prioritize visible points (settlements/cities) over speculative development cards
- Switch paths if the opponent blocks your primary victory path
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Accept trades only when they enable an immediate, crucial build
- Never make trades that allow opponent to build a settlement or city immediately
- Trade away excess resources when at risk for robber (7+ cards)
- Calculate the production value of each settlement location before deciding to build
- When trading with ports, plan sequences that convert unwanted resources into needed ones

DETAILED DECISION FRAMEWORK:
1. Does this move bring me closer to 10 victory points?
2. Does this move increase my production capacity more than alternative builds?
3. Does this move protect me from being blocked or cut off?
4. Does this move position me for strongest expansion in next 2-3 turns?
5. Is this the most efficient use of my current resources?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 41 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Build road at edge (20, 22) to continue expansion toward brick 3 hex
2. Work toward a settlement at node 22 or 23 to improve brick production
3. Focus on acquiring sheep resources through trading or expansion
4. Save wheat for upgrading settlement at node 0 to city once I get ore
5. Consider development cards once I have better sheep access

# Game Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state and my available options:

## Current Resources
- I have 1 BRICK and 5 WHEAT
- I need 3 WHEAT + 2 ORE for city upgrade
- I need 1 BRICK + 1 WOOD + 1 WHEAT + 1 SHEEP for settlement
- I need 1 BRICK + 1 WOOD for road

## Victory Point Situation
- I have 3 VP (1 settlement + 1 city)
- RED also has 3 VP (3 settlements)
- We're tied, but I have a city which gives better long-term production

## Production Analysis
- My city at node 16 produces WHEAT and ORE, good for city upgrades
- My settlement at node 0 produces WOOD, ORE and BRICK
- I'm missing consistent SHEEP production
- RED has good SHEEP and WHEAT production

## Available Actions Evaluation
- [0] End turn - Not optimal as I have resources to potentially use
- [1] Trade 4 WHEAT for 1 ORE - Could help with city upgrade path
- [2] Trade 4 WHEAT for 1 BRICK - Would give me 2 BRICK, but what next?
- [3] Trade 4 WHEAT for 1 SHEEP - Could work toward settlement
- [4] Trade 4 WHEAT for 1 WOOD - Could work toward road or settlement

## Strategic Considerations
Looking at my current plan: I was planning to build a road toward the brick hex to eventually build a settlement at node 22 or 23. However, I don't have WOOD right now to build a road.

My biggest weakness is SHEEP production. If I want to build a new settlement, I'll need SHEEP. I also can't build development cards without SHEEP.

With my current resources, I can't build anything immediately after trading. I'd need to make a trade and then wait for more resources.

<plan>
1. Trade WHEAT for SHEEP to prepare for either settlement or development card
2. Continue expansion toward the brick 3 hex (nodes 22/23) when I get wood
3. Focus on upgrading settlement at node 0 to city when I collect more ore
4. Try to secure SHEEP production in my next settlement location
</plan>

Based on this analysis, trading my excess WHEAT for SHEEP (which I completely lack) makes the most strategic sense for my long-term goals. This will position me to build either a settlement or development card when I acquire the remaining resources.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist whose primary goal is to defeat the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (HIGHEST PRIORITY):
- Target 6 & 8 numbered hexes at all costs - these are the most productive numbers
- Prioritize ore and wheat hexes for your settlements - they enable cities and development cards
- Position yourself on at least one good brick and wood hex to enable early expansion
- Aim to cover ALL five resources with your two settlements combined
- Try to place on intersections with 3 productive hexes rather than 2
- Evaluate probability dots (not just numbers) - more dots mean more frequent production
- Place settlements with clear expansion paths that won't be easily blocked
- Avoid placing where you'll be immediately cut off by the opponent
- Position roads toward your next planned settlement location
- Consider distance to valuable ports (especially 2:1 ports matching your abundant resources)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-8):
- Build at least one new road and one new settlement ASAP
- Focus on securing access to any missing resources through expansion
- Establish access to a port if you're lacking a key resource
- Prevent the opponent from cutting off your expansion path
- Only purchase development cards if excess resources available or for immediate victory
- Expand toward high-value hexes the opponent doesn't yet control

MID-GAME RESOURCE MANAGEMENT (TURNS 9-20):
- Target 3 cities minimum (worth 6 VP) - upgrade most productive settlements first
- Maintain 1 road per every 2 settlements for flexible expansion
- Always build a settlement when you have the resources (more production points)
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each build (cities give best long-term return)
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1 or better) to maintain resource balance
- Keep at least one viable road-building path open at all times
- If blocked from expansion, shift to city upgrades and development cards

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Development cards should supplement your expansion, not replace it
- Prioritize using Knight cards to protect your best hexes from the robber
- Save Knights when you're ahead to counter the opponent's robber placements
- Only buy development cards when you:
  1. Have excess sheep/wheat/ore but lack wood/brick for expansion
  2. Are close to securing largest army
  3. Need a specific card type (Road Building to break through a blockade)
- Use Road Building cards to save brick/wood and create surprise expansion paths
- Time Monopoly cards to capture opponent's stockpile after high-producing rolls
- Use Year of Plenty to complete crucial builds when short on specific resources

ROBBER PLACEMENT:
- Always target the opponent's highest-producing hex (high number + settlement/city)
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat hexes to slow city development
- If opponent relies heavily on one resource, target that resource's hexes
- Never place the robber on your own high-production hexes
- When stealing, target resources you immediately need for your next build

VICTORY PATH PLANNING:
- Target resource independence with at least one settlement/city on each resource
- Minimum viable infrastructure: 3-4 settlements total, with 2-3 upgraded to cities
- Calculate multiple paths to 10 VP and pursue the fastest:
  Path 1: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP)
  Path 2: 4 cities (8 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP)
  Path 3: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 victory point card
- Always track your direct path to 10 VP and focus on those builds
- Prioritize visible points (settlements/cities) over speculative development cards
- Switch paths if the opponent blocks your primary victory path
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Accept trades only when they enable an immediate, crucial build
- Never make trades that allow opponent to build a settlement or city immediately
- Trade away excess resources when at risk for robber (7+ cards)
- Calculate the production value of each settlement location before deciding to build
- When trading with ports, plan sequences that convert unwanted resources into needed ones

DETAILED DECISION FRAMEWORK:
1. Does this move bring me closer to 10 victory points?
2. Does this move increase my production capacity more than alternative builds?
3. Does this move protect me from being blocked or cut off?
4. Does this move position me for strongest expansion in next 2-3 turns?
5. Is this the most efficient use of my current resources?

# Analysis of Robber Placement Options

I need to decide where to place the robber to maximize my advantage against RED and protect my resources. Let me analyze each hex:

## Option 0: Move robber to (0, 0, 0) - Wood/Timber hex with number 10
- This is a productive hex (10 has 3 dots)
- RED has a settlement at node 4 that produces from this hex
- I also have a settlement at node 0 that produces from this hex
- Placing the robber here would hurt me as well as RED

## Option 1: Move robber to (1, -1, 0) - Wheat hex with number 4
- This is a less productive hex (4 has only 1 dot)
- RED has a settlement at node 6 that produces from this hex
- I don't produce from this hex
- Blocking this would have minimal impact on RED's production

## Option 2: Move robber to (0, -1, 1) - Desert hex
- This appears to be a desert with no production value
- Placing the robber here would be wasteful as it doesn't block any resources

## Option 3: Move robber to (-1, 0, 1) - Sheep hex with number 8
- This is a highly productive hex (8 has 5 dots)
- RED has two settlements (nodes 4 and 12) producing from this hex
- This is RED's best production hex
- I don't have any settlements here, so it won't affect me

## Option 4: Move robber to (-1, 1, 0) - Wheat hex with number 9
- This is a productive hex (9 has 4 dots)
- RED has a settlement at node 4 producing from this hex
- I have a city at node 16 producing from this hex
- Blocking this would hurt my production significantly

## Option 5: Move robber to (1, 0, -1) - Brick hex with number 3
- This is a less productive hex (3 has only 2 dots)
- RED has a settlement at node 6
- I have a settlement at node 0
- Blocking this would impact both of us, but brick is important for expansion

## Strategic Conclusion:
Option 3 is clearly the best choice:
1. It targets RED's most productive hex (sheep 8)
2. It blocks TWO of RED's settlements
3. It has no impact on my own production
4. Sheep is valuable for RED's development cards and settlements

<plan>
1. Move robber to sheep 8 hex to significantly hamper RED's production
2. Trade my wheat for sheep if possible to prepare for development card
3. Continue expansion toward the brick 3 hex (nodes 22/23) when I get wood
4. Focus on upgrading settlement at node 0 to city when I collect more ore
5. Try to secure additional sheep production in next settlement location
</plan>

# Robber Placement Analysis

I need to carefully evaluate each robber placement option to maximize my advantage against RED while advancing my plan. Let's analyze each option:

## Option 0: Move robber to (0, 0, 0) - Wood hex with 10
- This is a wood hex with number 10 (medium probability)
- RED has a settlement at node 4 that produces from this hex
- I have a settlement at node 0 that also produces from this hex
- This would hurt me as well as RED, not ideal

## Option 1: Move robber to (1, -1, 0) - Wheat hex with 4
- This is a wheat hex with number 4 (low probability)
- RED has a settlement at node 6 that produces from this hex
- Not a high-value target since it's a low probability hex

## Option 2: Move robber to (0, -1, 1) - Desert
- This is a desert hex which produces nothing
- Placing robber here would be completely ineffective
- Should never choose this option

## Option 3: Move robber to (-1, 1, 0) - Wheat hex with 9
- This is a wheat hex with number 9 (good probability)
- RED's settlement at node 4 produces from this hex
- I also have a city at node 16 that produces from this hex
- Placing robber here would hurt my production significantly

## Option 4: Move robber to (0, 1, -1) - Ore hex with 5
- This is an ore hex with number 5 (medium probability)
- I have both a settlement at node 0 and a city at node 16 that produce from this hex
- No RED buildings produce from this hex
- Placing robber here would only hurt myself, terrible option

## Option 5: Move robber to (1, 0, -1) - Brick hex with 3
- This is a brick hex with number 3 (low probability)
- RED has a settlement at node 6 that produces from this hex
- I have a settlement at node 0 that also produces from this hex
- This would hurt both of us, but brick is critical for expansion

## Option Analysis:
Looking back at my current game plan, I wanted to move the robber to the sheep 8 hex to hamper RED's production. That would be critically important as:
1. RED has TWO settlements (nodes 4 and 12) on the sheep 8 hex
2. 8 is one of the highest probability numbers (5 dots)
3. This would significantly reduce RED's sheep production
4. I currently have 2 sheep so I'm not dependent on this hex

The closest option to my plan is Option 0, targeting the wood 10 hex. While it impacts my production slightly, it hurts RED more and allows me to steal a resource from them.

<plan>
1. Move robber to wood 10 hex (0,0,0) to block RED's production and steal a resource
2. Save ore for city upgrade at node 0 when I get more ore
3. Use wheat and stolen resource (if useful) to build development card or trade
4. Continue expanding toward brick 3 hex (nodes 22/23) when I can get wood
5. Consider building more road segments toward potential settlement locations
</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist whose primary goal is to defeat the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (HIGHEST PRIORITY):
- Target 6 & 8 numbered hexes at all costs - these are the most productive numbers
- Prioritize ore and wheat hexes for your settlements - they enable cities and development cards
- Position yourself on at least one good brick and wood hex to enable early expansion
- Aim to cover ALL five resources with your two settlements combined
- Try to place on intersections with 3 productive hexes rather than 2
- Evaluate probability dots (not just numbers) - more dots mean more frequent production
- Place settlements with clear expansion paths that won't be easily blocked
- Avoid placing where you'll be immediately cut off by the opponent
- Position roads toward your next planned settlement location
- Consider distance to valuable ports (especially 2:1 ports matching your abundant resources)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-8):
- Build at least one new road and one new settlement ASAP
- Focus on securing access to any missing resources through expansion
- Establish access to a port if you're lacking a key resource
- Prevent the opponent from cutting off your expansion path
- Only purchase development cards if excess resources available or for immediate victory
- Expand toward high-value hexes the opponent doesn't yet control

MID-GAME RESOURCE MANAGEMENT (TURNS 9-20):
- Target 3 cities minimum (worth 6 VP) - upgrade most productive settlements first
- Maintain 1 road per every 2 settlements for flexible expansion
- Always build a settlement when you have the resources (more production points)
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each build (cities give best long-term return)
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1 or better) to maintain resource balance
- Keep at least one viable road-building path open at all times
- If blocked from expansion, shift to city upgrades and development cards

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Development cards should supplement your expansion, not replace it
- Prioritize using Knight cards to protect your best hexes from the robber
- Save Knights when you're ahead to counter the opponent's robber placements
- Only buy development cards when you:
  1. Have excess sheep/wheat/ore but lack wood/brick for expansion
  2. Are close to securing largest army
  3. Need a specific card type (Road Building to break through a blockade)
- Use Road Building cards to save brick/wood and create surprise expansion paths
- Time Monopoly cards to capture opponent's stockpile after high-producing rolls
- Use Year of Plenty to complete crucial builds when short on specific resources

ROBBER PLACEMENT:
- Always target the opponent's highest-producing hex (high number + settlement/city)
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat hexes to slow city development
- If opponent relies heavily on one resource, target that resource's hexes
- Never place the robber on your own high-production hexes
- When stealing, target resources you immediately need for your next build

VICTORY PATH PLANNING:
- Target resource independence with at least one settlement/city on each resource
- Minimum viable infrastructure: 3-4 settlements total, with 2-3 upgraded to cities
- Calculate multiple paths to 10 VP and pursue the fastest:
  Path 1: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP)
  Path 2: 4 cities (8 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP)
  Path 3: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 victory point card
- Always track your direct path to 10 VP and focus on those builds
- Prioritize visible points (settlements/cities) over speculative development cards
- Switch paths if the opponent blocks your primary victory path
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Accept trades only when they enable an immediate, crucial build
- Never make trades that allow opponent to build a settlement or city immediately
- Trade away excess resources when at risk for robber (7+ cards)
- Calculate the production value of each settlement location before deciding to build
- When trading with ports, plan sequences that convert unwanted resources into needed ones

DETAILED DECISION FRAMEWORK:
1. Does this move bring me closer to 10 victory points?
2. Does this move increase my production capacity more than alternative builds?
3. Does this move protect me from being blocked or cut off?
4. Does this move position me for strongest expansion in next 2-3 turns?
5. Is this the most efficient use of my current resources?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 47 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Move robber to wood 10 hex (0,0,0) to block RED's production and steal a resource
2. Save ore for city upgrade at node 0 when I get more ore
3. Use wheat and stolen resource (if useful) to build development card or trade
4. Continue expanding toward brick 3 hex (nodes 22/23) when I can get wood
5. Consider building more road segments toward potential settlement locations

# Game Analysis for Turn 47

Let me analyze the current game state and available actions carefully:

## Current Resources
- I have: 2 🐑SHEEP, 2 🌾WHEAT, 3 ⛏️ORE
- RED has 3 hidden cards

## Victory Points
- I have 3/10 VP (1 settlement + 1 city)
- RED has 3/10 VP (3 settlements)

## Available Actions
0. End turn
1. Upgrade settlement at node 0 to city (Cost: 2 🌾WHEAT, 3 ⛏️ORE)
2. Buy development card (Cost: 1 🐑SHEEP, 1 🌾WHEAT, 1 ⛏️ORE)

## Action Analysis

**Option 1: Upgrade settlement to city at node 0**
- This would cost all my wheat (2) and ore (3)
- Node 0 produces from 🌲10, ⛏️5, and 🧱3 hexes
- Upgrading would double my production from this node
- This gives me +1 VP, bringing me to 4/10
- The key resources produced here are ore and brick, which are valuable

**Option 2: Buy development card**
- This would cost 1 sheep, 1 wheat, 1 ore
- I'd have 1 wheat and 2 ore remaining
- Possible benefits:
  - 20% chance of Victory Point card (+1 VP)
  - 60% chance of Knight (helps move robber, work toward Largest Army)
  - 20% chance of other special cards (Monopoly, Year of Plenty, Road Building)
- Less certain immediate value than city upgrade

**Option 0: End turn**
- No immediate progress
- Save resources for future turns
- Risk losing resources to robber if a 7 is rolled

<plan>
1. Upgrade settlement at node 0 to city now to increase my production capacity
2. Focus on getting wood and brick for expansion toward node 22/23 area 
3. Target development cards when I have excess sheep
4. Continue developing toward brick 3 hex to secure more brick production
5. Use the robber strategically to block RED's high-production hexes when possible
</plan>

## Decision Logic
The city upgrade is clearly the optimal choice here:
- Provides immediate +1 VP
- Doubles production at a valuable node (especially ore and brick)
- Uses all my wheat and ore, which protects against resource loss from robber
- Creates stronger long-term production engine 
- Direct progress toward my ultimate 10 VP goal
- Sets me up for faster future expansion with increased resource production

The development card is too speculative compared to the guaranteed value of the city.

# Robber Placement Analysis

Let me analyze where to place the robber to maximize my advantage:

## Resource Evaluation by Hex
- (0, 0, 0): 🌲10 [⭐] - Wood hex with value 10 (moderate-high production)
  - Affects both RED settlement at node 4 and my city at node 0
  - Would hurt my own production significantly
  
- (1, -1, 0): 🌾4 [⭐] - Wheat hex with value 4 (low production)
  - Affects RED settlement at node 6
  - Low impact target due to the low roll number

- (0, -1, 1): 🏜️ - Desert hex
  - No production value, pointless to place robber here

- (-1, 0, 1): 🐑8 [⭐⭐⭐] - Sheep hex with value 8 (high production)
  - Affects RED settlements at nodes 4 and 12
  - High impact target as it blocks sheep production for RED at two settlements

- (-1, 1, 0): 🌾9 [⭐⭐] - Wheat hex with value 9 (high production)
  - Affects RED settlement at node 4
  - Also affects my city at node 16
  - Would hurt my own wheat production

- (1, 0, -1): 🧱3 [⭐] - Brick hex with value 3 (low production)
  - Affects RED settlement at node 6 and my city at node 0
  - Low impact due to infrequent roll number
  - Would hurt my own brick production

## Strategic Analysis
1. I want to target RED's high-producing hexes without hurting my own production
2. The sheep hex with value 8 is particularly valuable since:
   - It produces on a high-probability roll (8)
   - RED has TWO settlements connected to it (nodes 4 and 12)
   - I don't have any settlements/cities on this hex
3. Blocking RED's access to sheep will limit their ability to build development cards

## Decision
The sheep hex (-1, 0, 1) is clearly the best target because:
- It has a high production value (8)
- It blocks RED at two different settlements
- It doesn't affect any of my own production
- Sheep is crucial for development cards

<plan>
1. Place robber on sheep hex to block RED's high-production resource
2. Continue working toward getting wood and brick for expansion toward node 22/23 area
3. Target development cards when I have excess sheep
4. Look for opportunities to build toward the longest road bonus
5. Continue developing toward brick 3 hex to secure more brick production
</plan>

- Focus on securing access to any missing resources through expansion
- Establish access to a port if you're lacking a key resource
- Prevent the opponent from cutting off your expansion path
- Only purchase development cards if excess resources available or for immediate victory
- Expand toward high-value hexes the opponent doesn't yet control

MID-GAME RESOURCE MANAGEMENT (TURNS 9-20):
- Target 3 cities minimum (worth 6 VP) - upgrade most productive settlements first
- Maintain 1 road per every 2 settlements for flexible expansion
- Always build a settlement when you have the resources (more production points)
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each build (cities give best long-term return)
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1 or better) to maintain resource balance
- Keep at least one viable road-building path open at all times
- If blocked from expansion, shift to city upgrades and development cards

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Development cards should supplement your expansion, not replace it
- Prioritize using Knight cards to protect your best hexes from the robber
- Save Knights when you're ahead to counter the opponent's robber placements
- Only buy development cards when you:
  1. Have excess sheep/wheat/ore but lack wood/brick for expansion
  2. Are close to securing largest army
  3. Need a specific card type (Road Building to break through a blockade)
- Use Road Building cards to save brick/wood and create surprise expansion paths
- Time Monopoly cards to capture opponent's stockpile after high-producing rolls
- Use Year of Plenty to complete crucial builds when short on specific resources

ROBBER PLACEMENT:
- Always target the opponent's highest-producing hex (high number + settlement/city)
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat hexes to slow city development
- If opponent relies heavily on one resource, target that resource's hexes
- Never place the robber on your own high-production hexes
- When stealing, target resources you immediately need for your next build

VICTORY PATH PLANNING:
- Target resource independence with at least one settlement/city on each resource
- Minimum viable infrastructure: 3-4 settlements total, with 2-3 upgraded to cities
- Calculate multiple paths to 10 VP and pursue the fastest:
  Path 1: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP)
  Path 2: 4 cities (8 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP)
  Path 3: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 victory point card
- Always track your direct path to 10 VP and focus on those builds
- Prioritize visible points (settlements/cities) over speculative development cards
- Switch paths if the opponent blocks your primary victory path
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Accept trades only when they enable an immediate, crucial build
- Never make trades that allow opponent to build a settlement or city immediately
- Trade away excess resources when at risk for robber (7+ cards)
- Calculate the production value of each settlement location before deciding to build
- When trading with ports, plan sequences that convert unwanted resources into needed ones

DETAILED DECISION FRAMEWORK:
1. Does this move bring me closer to 10 victory points?
2. Does this move increase my production capacity more than alternative builds?
3. Does this move protect me from being blocked or cut off?
4. Does this move position me for strongest expansion in next 2-3 turns?
5. Is this the most efficient use of my current resources?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 53 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Place robber on sheep hex to block RED's high-production resource
2. Continue working toward getting wood and brick for expansion toward node 22/23 area
3. Target development cards when I have excess sheep
4. Look for opportunities to build toward the longest road bonus
5. Continue developing toward brick 3 hex to secure more brick production

# Game Analysis

I'll analyze the current game state and determine the optimal action to maximize my chances of winning.

## Current Game State
- I have 4 VP (2 cities worth 4 VP)
- Red has 3 VP (3 settlements worth 3 VP)
- I have: 2 🌲WOOD, 1 🧱BRICK, 1 🐑SHEEP, 4 ⛏️ORE
- The robber is on the sheep hex (-1, 0, 1), blocking Red's high production hex

## Resources & Production
- My production comes from cities at node 16 (🌾9[⭐⭐], ⛏️5[⭐⭐]) and node 0 (🌲10[⭐], ⛏️5[⭐⭐], 🧱3[⭐])
- I have good ore production but limited brick and wood production
- I'm missing wheat production completely, which I'll need for cities and development cards

## Victory Path Analysis
My path to 10 VP could be:
1. Current 4 VP from 2 cities
2. Potential +4 VP from 2 more cities (need settlements first)
3. Potential +2 VP from longest road (I already have 5 roads)
4. Potential +2 VP from largest army (would need 3 knights)

Since I don't have any settlements currently, I need to prioritize expansion.

## Action Evaluation
1. Road Building Options (1-8):
   - I have exactly enough resources (2 wood, 1 brick) to build one road
   - Need to determine which road placement best supports my expansion path

2. Maritime Trade (9-12):
   - Trading 4 ore for another resource could help with immediate needs
   - However, trading at 4:1 is inefficient without a specific urgent need

## Road Placement Analysis
- Edge (1, 2): Connects toward wheat hex but doesn't open immediate settlement spots
- Edge (19, 20): Moves toward brick hex, good for future resource diversity
- Edge (22, 23): Moves toward brick hex, potential settlement location at 23
- Edge (4, 5): Doesn't immediately open new settlement opportunities
- Edge (5, 16): Connects existing infrastructure but doesn't extend to new areas
- Edge (16, 21): Extends toward ⛏️5 hex, but I already have good ore production
- Edge (1, 6): Extends toward 🌾4 and 🧱3 hexes, potentially opening node 7 or 8 for settlement
- Edge (17, 18): Extends toward sheep hex but doesn't open immediate settlement spots

## Road Strategy Decision
Looking at the options, edge (1, 6) is most valuable as it:
1. Extends toward wheat (resource I'm missing entirely)
2. Extends toward another brick hex production spot
3. Positions me to potentially build a settlement at nodes 7 or 8
4. Will contribute to my longest road count

<plan>
1. Build road at edge (1, 6) to extend toward wheat and brick production
2. Next focus on accumulating resources for a settlement at node 7 or 8
3. Continue working toward longest road bonus by building strategically
4. After securing wheat production, focus on city upgrades and development cards
5. Keep tracking RED's progress and block expansion when necessary
</plan>

Based on this analysis, I'll build a road at edge (1, 6).

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist whose primary goal is to defeat the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (HIGHEST PRIORITY):
- Target 6 & 8 numbered hexes at all costs - these are the most productive numbers
- Prioritize ore and wheat hexes for your settlements - they enable cities and development cards
- Position yourself on at least one good brick and wood hex to enable early expansion
- Aim to cover ALL five resources with your two settlements combined
- Try to place on intersections with 3 productive hexes rather than 2
- Evaluate probability dots (not just numbers) - more dots mean more frequent production
- Place settlements with clear expansion paths that won't be easily blocked
- Avoid placing where you'll be immediately cut off by the opponent
- Position roads toward your next planned settlement location
- Consider distance to valuable ports (especially 2:1 ports matching your abundant resources)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-8):

# Game State Analysis

Currently, I'm at 4/10 victory points with:
- 2 cities (4 VP)
- 0 settlements 
- Not holding longest road or largest army

My resources are:
- 1 wood
- 1 sheep
- 4 ore

Available actions are:
- End turn
- Maritime trades using 4:1 ratio (ore for wood/wheat/brick/sheep)

## Resource Production Assessment
I have cities on nodes 16 and 0, which produce:
- Node 16: Wheat(9) and Ore(5)
- Node 0: Wood(10), Ore(5), and Brick(3)

I'm strong on ore production (two cities on ore hexes), but I need more balanced resources for future builds.

## Victory Path Analysis
To reach 10 VP, I need 6 more points. My most efficient path likely involves:
- Building 1-2 more cities (2-4 VP)
- Building 2-3 settlements (2-3 VP)
- Potentially securing longest road (2 VP) - I already have 6 roads built

## Current Turn Decision

I have 4 ore, which isn't immediately useful for any build:
- Settlement needs wood + brick + sheep + wheat
- City needs 3 ore + 2 wheat (need wheat)
- Road needs wood + brick (need brick)
- Development card needs ore + sheep + wheat (need wheat)

The maritime trade options would let me trade 4 ore for 1 of any resource. Given that I already have 1 wood and 1 sheep, the most valuable trade would be for wheat or brick.

However, trading at a 4:1 ratio is very inefficient. Since I'm not at immediate risk from the robber (holding 6 cards total), and my production is strong (two cities including an ore-producing 5), it would be better to wait and collect more diverse resources on the next roll rather than making this inefficient trade.

<plan>
1. Skip trading this turn and accumulate more resources
2. Focus on building a settlement at a location with wheat production (need wheat for city upgrades)
3. Continue expanding roads strategically toward optimal settlement spots
4. Work toward longest road bonus (I already have 6 roads)
5. Use my strong ore production to upgrade future settlements to cities
</plan>

Since none of the available actions provide good value this turn, I'll end my turn and wait for better opportunities.

# Game Analysis for Turn 55

Let me analyze the current game state and my available options:

## Current Status
- I have 4 VP (2 cities worth 4 VP)
- Resources: 1 🌲Wood, 4 ⛏️Ore
- No development cards
- Need 6 more VP to win
- The robber is currently on a hex that affects one of my cities (node 16)

## Resource Assessment
I'm strong in ore production with both my cities producing ore (from the 5 hex). However, I'm missing wheat, brick, and sheep resources at the moment, which limits my building options.

## Available Actions
0. End turn
1-4. Trade 4 ore for another resource (wood, wheat, brick, or sheep)

## Strategic Analysis

Looking at my current state:
- I cannot build a settlement (need wood, brick, wheat, sheep)
- I cannot build a road (need wood and brick)
- I cannot build a city (already have cities at both my settlements)
- I cannot buy a development card (need ore, wheat, sheep)

The only productive action available is to trade. Since I have 4 ore, I can make one 4:1 port trade.

My priorities:
1. Need to build more settlements to increase my resource production and victory points
2. Need roads to reach new settlement locations
3. Should target wheat production (currently have none)

To build a road, I need wood (have 1) and brick (have 0). Trading for brick would allow me to build a road this turn, potentially expanding toward a good settlement location.

<plan>
1. Trade for brick to build a road this turn
2. Continue expanding toward locations with wheat production
3. Build a settlement next at a location with wheat 
4. Work toward longest road bonus for 2 additional VP
5. Later, focus on development cards for largest army
</plan>

Given my current resources and needs, I should trade 4 ore for 1 brick, which would allow me to build a road with my existing wood.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist whose primary goal is to defeat the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (HIGHEST PRIORITY):
- Target 6 & 8 numbered hexes at all costs - these are the most productive numbers
- Prioritize ore and wheat hexes for your settlements - they enable cities and development cards
- Position yourself on at least one good brick and wood hex to enable early expansion
- Aim to cover ALL five resources with your two settlements combined
- Try to place on intersections with 3 productive hexes rather than 2
- Evaluate probability dots (not just numbers) - more dots mean more frequent production
- Place settlements with clear expansion paths that won't be easily blocked
- Avoid placing where you'll be immediately cut off by the opponent
- Position roads toward your next planned settlement location
- Consider distance to valuable ports (especially 2:1 ports matching your abundant resources)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-8):
- Build at least one new road and one new settlement ASAP
- Focus on securing access to any missing resources through expansion
- Establish access to a port if you're lacking a key resource
- Prevent the opponent from cutting off your expansion path
- Only purchase development cards if excess resources available or for immediate victory
- Expand toward high-value hexes the opponent doesn't yet control

MID-GAME RESOURCE MANAGEMENT (TURNS 9-20):
- Target 3 cities minimum (worth 6 VP) - upgrade most productive settlements first
- Maintain 1 road per every 2 settlements for flexible expansion
- Always build a settlement when you have the resources (more production points)
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each build (cities give best long-term return)
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1 or better) to maintain resource balance
- Keep at least one viable road-building path open at all times
- If blocked from expansion, shift to city upgrades and development cards

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Development cards should supplement your expansion, not replace it
- Prioritize using Knight cards to protect your best hexes from the robber
- Save Knights when you're ahead to counter the opponent's robber placements
- Only buy development cards when you:
  1. Have excess sheep/wheat/ore but lack wood/brick for expansion
  2. Are close to securing largest army
  3. Need a specific card type (Road Building to break through a blockade)
- Use Road Building cards to save brick/wood and create surprise expansion paths
- Time Monopoly cards to capture opponent's stockpile after high-producing rolls
- Use Year of Plenty to complete crucial builds when short on specific resources

ROBBER PLACEMENT:
- Always target the opponent's highest-producing hex (high number + settlement/city)
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat hexes to slow city development
- If opponent relies heavily on one resource, target that resource's hexes
- Never place the robber on your own high-production hexes
- When stealing, target resources you immediately need for your next build

VICTORY PATH PLANNING:
- Target resource independence with at least one settlement/city on each resource
- Minimum viable infrastructure: 3-4 settlements total, with 2-3 upgraded to cities
- Calculate multiple paths to 10 VP and pursue the fastest:
  Path 1: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP)
  Path 2: 4 cities (8 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP)
  Path 3: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 victory point card
- Always track your direct path to 10 VP and focus on those builds
- Prioritize visible points (settlements/cities) over speculative development cards
- Switch paths if the opponent blocks your primary victory path
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Accept trades only when they enable an immediate, crucial build
- Never make trades that allow opponent to build a settlement or city immediately
- Trade away excess resources when at risk for robber (7+ cards)
- Calculate the production value of each settlement location before deciding to build
- When trading with ports, plan sequences that convert unwanted resources into needed ones

DETAILED DECISION FRAMEWORK:
1. Does this move bring me closer to 10 victory points?
2. Does this move increase my production capacity more than alternative builds?
3. Does this move protect me from being blocked or cut off?
4. Does this move position me for strongest expansion in next 2-3 turns?
5. Is this the most efficient use of my current resources?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 55 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Trade for brick to build a road this turn
2. Continue expanding toward locations with wheat production
3. Build a settlement next at a location with wheat 
4. Work toward longest road bonus for 2 additional VP
5. Later, focus on development cards for largest army

# Game State Analysis

Let me carefully analyze the current game state and available options:

## Current Game Status
- I'm BLUE with 4 victory points from 2 cities
- RED has 3 victory points from 3 settlements
- I have exactly 1 wood, 1 brick - just enough to build a road
- The robber is on the ore (5) hex, blocking an important resource for city building
- Neither of us has longest road or largest army yet

## Road Building Options
I need to evaluate the 7 possible road placements:

1. Edge (1, 2): Would extend toward node 2, which connects to wheat (4) and desert
2. Edge (19, 20): Would extend toward the robber-blocked ore hex
3. Edge (22, 23): Would extend toward brick (3) hex
4. Edge (4, 5): Would extend toward a node near my city at node 16
5. Edge (5, 16): Would connect my two cities directly
6. Edge (16, 21): Would extend from my city at 16 toward empty nodes
7. Edge (17, 18): Would extend into an area I don't currently control

## Strategic Considerations

I need to:
1. Work toward longest road (current plan)
2. Find spots for new settlements, especially with wheat production
3. Position myself to block RED from expanding further

Looking at the board connectivity, I should choose a road that:
- Extends my current network in the most promising direction
- Could lead to a settlement placement in the near future
- Helps me work toward longest road

Edge (5, 16) stands out as it connects my two cities directly, which would strengthen my road network and potentially help me toward longest road. It creates a more cohesive network.

Edge (16, 21) would extend toward new territory from my city at node 16, potentially opening settlement opportunities.

<plan>
1. Build road at edge (5, 16) to connect my cities
2. Continue building roads toward potential settlement locations with wheat access
3. Work toward claiming longest road for 2 VP
4. When possible, build new settlements for additional production
5. Later, focus on development cards for either VP cards or largest army
</plan>

After analyzing all options, I believe connecting my cities with a road at edge (5, 16) creates the strongest network and provides the best foundation for claiming longest road while opening future settlement possibilities.

# Game Analysis

Let me analyze the current state of the game and my available options:

## Current Game State
- I have 6 VP (2 cities for 4 VP + longest road for 2 VP)
- I have 2 wood and 2 brick resources, which is enough to build one road
- I have the longest road (5 segments) currently
- The robber is on the ore hex (5)

## Strategic Considerations

1. **Victory Path Analysis**
   - I need 4 more VP to win
   - Options for those VP: build 2 settlements (2 VP), upgrade settlements to cities (2 VP), or get development cards with VP

2. **Resource Production**
   - I have cities at nodes 0 and 16, producing wood (10), ore (5), brick (3), and wheat (9)
   - The robber is blocking my ore production at node 0

3. **Road Building Options**
   I have 6 options for building a road, let me evaluate each one:
   
   - Option 1: Edge (1, 2) - Extends in a direction where I already have presence
   - Option 2: Edge (19, 20) - Extends toward ore hex
   - Option 3: Edge (22, 23) - Extends toward brick hex
   - Option 4: Edge (4, 5) - Connects toward wheat hex
   - Option 5: Edge (16, 21) - Extends from my city at node 16
   - Option 6: Edge (17, 18) - Extends in a new direction

4. **Settlement Expansion Opportunities**
   - Need to identify which road would position me best for building a new settlement
   - Need to find locations with good resource diversity, especially sheep which I'm missing

## Action Evaluation

Looking at the board connectivity and my existing infrastructure:

- Option 5 (edge 16, 21) extends from my city and could lead to potential settlement locations
- This would maintain my longest road status while opening expansion paths
- Edge (16, 21) connects to the blocked ore hex, so when the robber moves, I'll have access to that production

I also need to consider resources I'm currently missing:
- My cities produce wood, brick, wheat, and ore (when not blocked)
- I'm missing sheep production entirely
- Looking at the board, I should try to expand toward the sheep hex (8) if possible

Option 5 (edge 16, 21) seems most strategic as it:
1. Extends from my productive city
2. Maintains my longest road advantage
3. Could position me for future settlement building with access to the ore hex once the robber moves

<plan>
1. Build road at edge (16, 21) to extend from my city
2. Work toward building additional roads to reach potential settlement locations, especially ones providing sheep access
3. Build new settlements when possible to gain more VP and diverse production
4. Continue advancing toward 10 VP through a combination of settlements and potentially development cards

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist whose primary goal is to defeat the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (HIGHEST PRIORITY):
- Target 6 & 8 numbered hexes at all costs - these are the most productive numbers
- Prioritize ore and wheat hexes for your settlements - they enable cities and development cards
- Position yourself on at least one good brick and wood hex to enable early expansion
- Aim to cover ALL five resources with your two settlements combined
- Try to place on intersections with 3 productive hexes rather than 2
- Evaluate probability dots (not just numbers) - more dots mean more frequent production
- Place settlements with clear expansion paths that won't be easily blocked
- Avoid placing where you'll be immediately cut off by the opponent
- Position roads toward your next planned settlement location
- Consider distance to valuable ports (especially 2:1 ports matching your abundant resources)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-8):
- Build at least one new road and one new settlement ASAP
- Focus on securing access to any missing resources through expansion
- Establish access to a port if you're lacking a key resource
- Prevent the opponent from cutting off your expansion path
- Only purchase development cards if excess resources available or for immediate victory
- Expand toward high-value hexes the opponent doesn't yet control

MID-GAME RESOURCE MANAGEMENT (TURNS 9-20):
- Target 3 cities minimum (worth 6 VP) - upgrade most productive settlements first
- Maintain 1 road per every 2 settlements for flexible expansion
- Always build a settlement when you have the resources (more production points)
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each build (cities give best long-term return)
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1 or better) to maintain resource balance
- Keep at least one viable road-building path open at all times
- If blocked from expansion, shift to city upgrades and development cards

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Development cards should supplement your expansion, not replace it
- Prioritize using Knight cards to protect your best hexes from the robber
- Save Knights when you're ahead to counter the opponent's robber placements
- Only buy development cards when you:
  1. Have excess sheep/wheat/ore but lack wood/brick for expansion
  2. Are close to securing largest army
  3. Need a specific card type (Road Building to break through a blockade)
- Use Road Building cards to save brick/wood and create surprise expansion paths
- Time Monopoly cards to capture opponent's stockpile after high-producing rolls
- Use Year of Plenty to complete crucial builds when short on specific resources

ROBBER PLACEMENT:
- Always target the opponent's highest-producing hex (high number + settlement/city)
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat hexes to slow city development
- If opponent relies heavily on one resource, target that resource's hexes
- Never place the robber on your own high-production hexes
- When stealing, target resources you immediately need for your next build

VICTORY PATH PLANNING:
- Target resource independence with at least one settlement/city on each resource
- Minimum viable infrastructure: 3-4 settlements total, with 2-3 upgraded to cities
- Calculate multiple paths to 10 VP and pursue the fastest:
  Path 1: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP)
  Path 2: 4 cities (8 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP)
  Path 3: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 victory point card
- Always track your direct path to 10 VP and focus on those builds
- Prioritize visible points (settlements/cities) over speculative development cards
- Switch paths if the opponent blocks your primary victory path
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Accept trades only when they enable an immediate, crucial build
- Never make trades that allow opponent to build a settlement or city immediately
- Trade away excess resources when at risk for robber (7+ cards)
- Calculate the production value of each settlement location before deciding to build
- When trading with ports, plan sequences that convert unwanted resources into needed ones

DETAILED DECISION FRAMEWORK:
1. Does this move bring me closer to 10 victory points?
2. Does this move increase my production capacity more than alternative builds?
3. Does this move protect me from being blocked or cut off?
4. Does this move position me for strongest expansion in next 2-3 turns?
5. Is this the most efficient use of my current resources?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 61 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

# Game Analysis

I need to analyze the current game state and make the best strategic move with my available resources.

## Current Status:
- I have 6 VP (4 from 2 cities, 2 from longest road)
- I need 4 more VP to win
- I have only 1 wood and 1 brick (just enough for 1 road)
- No settlements yet - I'll need to build settlements for more VP
- I control longest road with 5 segments

## Available Options:
I can build one road with my current resources. Let me evaluate each potential road location:

1. Edge (1, 2): This connects to node 2 which is adjacent to wheat and wood
2. Edge (19, 20): This connects toward node 20, near brick
3. Edge (22, 23): This connects to node 23, near brick
4. Edge (4, 5): This connects to node 5, which is on the edge of the map
5. Edge (17, 18): This connects to node 18, which appears to be on the edge
6. Edge (19, 21): This connects to node 21, near the ore hex

## Strategic Priorities:
1. Maintain longest road (critical 2 VP)
2. Position for new settlements (need at least 2 more for VP)
3. Access missing resources (I notably lack sheep)

## Road Analysis:
- I need to understand which roads extend my path and lead to viable settlement locations
- I can't build settlements immediately (no resources), so this is preparation
- Need to check if RED can threaten my longest road

Looking at the available road options, I need to determine which will:
1. Strengthen my longest road position
2. Lead to viable settlement locations
3. Give me access to resources I'm missing (sheep)

Without complete visibility of the full map connectivity, I'll make my best assessment based on the information provided.

<plan>
1. Build a road that extends my longest road network if possible
2. Continue working toward viable settlement locations, particularly those with sheep resource access
3. When resources allow, build settlements to gain more VP
4. Aim to maintain longest road while working toward 10 VP through settlements/cities
</plan>

Based on the available information, I'll build a road that appears to both maintain/extend my road network and position me toward potential settlement spots. Edge (19, 21) seems promising as it connects near the ore hex which I already have good production of, and could lead toward unexplored territory.

# Strategic Analysis for Robber Movement

Let me analyze the game state and determine the optimal robber placement:

## Current Game State Assessment
- I (BLUE) have 6/10 VP: 2 cities (4 VP) + longest road (2 VP)
- RED has 4/10 VP with 4 settlements
- I need 4 more VP to win, which could come from 2 more cities or 4 settlements or some combination
- I currently have no resources, so disrupting RED's resource production is crucial

## Analyzing RED's Production Engine
Let me evaluate which hexes are most valuable to RED:
- RED has settlements at nodes 4, 6, 12, and 2
- Production frequency by resource hex:
  - 🐑8 [⭐⭐⭐]: Produces for RED at nodes 4 and 12 (HIGH priority target)
  - 🌲10 [⭐]: Produces for RED at nodes 4 and 2
  - 🌾9 [⭐⭐]: Produces for RED at node 4
  - 🌾4 [⭐]: Produces for RED at nodes 6 and 2
  - 🧱3 [⭐]: Produces for RED at node 6

## Robber Placement Options Analysis
0. (0, 0, 0) - 🌲10: Blocks wood (10) for RED's settlements at nodes 4 and 2
1. (1, -1, 0) - 🌾4: Blocks wheat (4) for RED's settlements at nodes 6 and 2
2. (0, -1, 1) - 🏜️: Desert - less effective choice
3. (-1, 0, 1) - 🐑8: Blocks sheep (8) for RED's settlements at nodes 4 and 12 - this is their highest producing hex!
4. (-1, 1, 0) - 🌾9: Blocks wheat (9) for RED's settlement at node 4
5. (1, 0, -1) - 🧱3: Blocks brick (3) for RED's settlement at node 6

## Optimal Robber Placement
The sheep hex (-1, 0, 1) is clearly the most productive hex for RED, affecting TWO of their settlements that both produce on an 8 (high probability). Blocking this hex will significantly hamper RED's resource generation.

<plan>
1. Disrupt RED's sheep production to limit their ability to build
2. Continue working toward viable settlement locations on my next turn
3. With my longest road secured, focus on building settlements or upgrading to cities when resources allow
4. Maintain pressure on RED's resource engine while expanding my own production
</plan>

The optimal action is to move the robber to the sheep hex and steal from RED.

- Prioritize visible points (settlements/cities) over speculative development cards
- Switch paths if the opponent blocks your primary victory path
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Accept trades only when they enable an immediate, crucial build
- Never make trades that allow opponent to build a settlement or city immediately
- Trade away excess resources when at risk for robber (7+ cards)
- Calculate the production value of each settlement location before deciding to build
- When trading with ports, plan sequences that convert unwanted resources into needed ones

DETAILED DECISION FRAMEWORK:
1. Does this move bring me closer to 10 victory points?
2. Does this move increase my production capacity more than alternative builds?
3. Does this move protect me from being blocked or cut off?
4. Does this move position me for strongest expansion in next 2-3 turns?
5. Is this the most efficient use of my current resources?

# Game Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state and my available options:

## Current Victory Points
- I have 6/10 VP: 2 cities (4 VP) + Longest Road (2 VP)
- RED has 5/10 VP: 5 settlements (5 VP)

## My Resources
- 2 Wood, 2 Brick, 4 Wheat
- This means I can build 2 roads with my current resources

## Available Actions
My options are:
- Build a road at various locations
- Trade wheat (4:1) for other resources
- End my turn

## Strategic Considerations

1. **Victory Path**:
   - I need 4 more points to win
   - Possible paths: build 2 settlements (2 more VP) + 2 VP from development cards OR upgrade settlements to cities for more VP

2. **Building Expansion**:
   - I need to establish new settlements to increase my production and victory points
   - To build settlements, I need to extend roads to viable locations

3. **Resource Management**:
   - I have exactly enough wood and brick for 2 road segments
   - I have excess wheat that could be traded if needed

Let me examine the road options more carefully to understand where they lead:

Looking at the available road options (1-5), I need to determine which road placement gives me the best strategic advantage, potentially leading to a settlement location.

Option 1: edge (1, 2) - This appears to be near node 2 where RED already has a settlement
Option 2: edge (19, 20) - Near node 20
Option 3: edge (22, 23) - Near nodes 22 and 23
Option 4: edge (4, 5) - Near nodes 4 and 5
Option 5: edge (17, 18) - Near nodes 17 and 18

Without a complete map visualization, it's challenging to determine which road leads to an available settlement location. However, I need to continue expanding my road network toward viable settlement locations.

Given that my current plan involves working toward viable settlement locations, I should build roads that advance this goal. Since I have enough resources for two roads, I'll build one now and potentially another on my next turn.

Option 2 (edge 19, 20) seems promising as it's connected to the ore hex which I need more production of. Building this road would utilize my resources effectively while working toward establishing a new settlement.

<plan>
1. Build road at edge (19, 20) to expand toward potential settlement location
2. Continue accumulating resources for settlement building
3. Maintain longest road advantage while working toward settlement placement
4. Target locations that would increase my ore and sheep production
</plan>

Therefore, I choose option 2: Build a road at edge (19, 20).

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist whose primary goal is to defeat the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (HIGHEST PRIORITY):
- Target 6 & 8 numbered hexes at all costs - these are the most productive numbers
- Prioritize ore and wheat hexes for your settlements - they enable cities and development cards
- Position yourself on at least one good brick and wood hex to enable early expansion
- Aim to cover ALL five resources with your two settlements combined
- Try to place on intersections with 3 productive hexes rather than 2
- Evaluate probability dots (not just numbers) - more dots mean more frequent production
- Place settlements with clear expansion paths that won't be easily blocked
- Avoid placing where you'll be immediately cut off by the opponent
- Position roads toward your next planned settlement location
- Consider distance to valuable ports (especially 2:1 ports matching your abundant resources)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-8):
- Build at least one new road and one new settlement ASAP
- Focus on securing access to any missing resources through expansion
- Establish access to a port if you're lacking a key resource
- Prevent the opponent from cutting off your expansion path
- Only purchase development cards if excess resources available or for immediate victory
- Expand toward high-value hexes the opponent doesn't yet control

MID-GAME RESOURCE MANAGEMENT (TURNS 9-20):
- Target 3 cities minimum (worth 6 VP) - upgrade most productive settlements first
- Maintain 1 road per every 2 settlements for flexible expansion
- Always build a settlement when you have the resources (more production points)
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each build (cities give best long-term return)
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1 or better) to maintain resource balance
- Keep at least one viable road-building path open at all times
- If blocked from expansion, shift to city upgrades and development cards

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Development cards should supplement your expansion, not replace it
- Prioritize using Knight cards to protect your best hexes from the robber
- Save Knights when you're ahead to counter the opponent's robber placements
- Only buy development cards when you:
  1. Have excess sheep/wheat/ore but lack wood/brick for expansion
  2. Are close to securing largest army
  3. Need a specific card type (Road Building to break through a blockade)
- Use Road Building cards to save brick/wood and create surprise expansion paths
- Time Monopoly cards to capture opponent's stockpile after high-producing rolls
- Use Year of Plenty to complete crucial builds when short on specific resources

ROBBER PLACEMENT:
- Always target the opponent's highest-producing hex (high number + settlement/city)
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat hexes to slow city development
- If opponent relies heavily on one resource, target that resource's hexes
- Never place the robber on your own high-production hexes
- When stealing, target resources you immediately need for your next build

VICTORY PATH PLANNING:
- Target resource independence with at least one settlement/city on each resource
- Minimum viable infrastructure: 3-4 settlements total, with 2-3 upgraded to cities
- Calculate multiple paths to 10 VP and pursue the fastest:
  Path 1: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP)
  Path 2: 4 cities (8 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP)
  Path 3: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 victory point card
- Always track your direct path to 10 VP and focus on those builds
- Prioritize visible points (settlements/cities) over speculative development cards
- Switch paths if the opponent blocks your primary victory path
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Accept trades only when they enable an immediate, crucial build
- Never make trades that allow opponent to build a settlement or city immediately
- Trade away excess resources when at risk for robber (7+ cards)
- Calculate the production value of each settlement location before deciding to build
- When trading with ports, plan sequences that convert unwanted resources into needed ones

# Game Analysis for Settlers of Catan Turn 73

Let me analyze the current game state and my available options carefully.

## Current Game State
- I have 6 VP (2 cities = 4 VP + Longest Road = 2 VP)
- RED has 5 VP (5 settlements = 5 VP)
- My resources: 1 🌲WOOD, 1 🧱BRICK, 4 🌾WHEAT
- The robber is on an ore hex (⛏️5), blocking one of my city's production

## Available Actions
1. End turn
2-5. Build roads at various locations
6-9. Maritime trades using wheat

## Strategic Considerations

First, let me evaluate whether to build a road or trade:

For road building:
- I have exactly the resources needed (1 wood, 1 brick)
- Building helps maintain my longest road advantage
- This advances toward settlement expansion

For trading:
- Could convert 4 wheat to get additional resources
- But I have no immediate build that would benefit from this

Let me analyze the road options to see which gives the best strategic advantage:

1. Edge (4, 5): Extends toward node 5, but doesn't seem to lead to good settlement opportunities.
2. Edge (1, 2): Connects toward node 2, which is already occupied by RED.
3. Edge (17, 18): Extends toward node 18, a potential settlement location.
4. Edge (22, 23): Extends toward node 23, another potential settlement location.

Looking at nodes 18 and 23:
- Node 18 connects to a wheat hex with number 9 (good production)
- Node 23 connects to a brick hex with number 3 (lower production)

However, I need to consider which location might be more strategically valuable for:
1. Future expansion
2. Access to missing resources
3. Blocking opponent's growth

<plan>
1. Build road at edge (17, 18) to expand toward node 18 for wheat production
2. Continue accumulating resources for settlement building
3. Maintain longest road advantage
4. Focus next on getting sheep resource access which I'm currently lacking
</plan>

Given my analysis, building a road at edge (17, 18) seems most strategic as it:
- Maintains my longest road advantage
- Positions me toward a productive wheat hex
- Creates a potential settlement location
- Uses my limited wood and brick efficiently

Therefore, my optimal action is:

# Game State Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state and my available options:

## Current Victory Points (6/10):
- 2 Cities (4 VP)
- Longest Road (2 VP)

## Resources:
- 4x WHEAT
- No other resources

## Key Observations:
1. I'm leading with 6 VP vs RED's 5 VP
2. I have longest road (7 segments vs RED's 4)
3. I have 4 WHEAT but need other resources for any building
4. My planned expansion is toward node 18 for wheat production, but I already have wheat
5. I'm currently lacking SHEEP access entirely

## Action Options:
- [0] End Turn - This would waste my 4 wheat cards and make no progress
- [1-4] Trade 4 WHEAT for another resource (ORE, BRICK, SHEEP, or WOOD)

## Strategic Considerations:

The critical question is: What resource will help me advance most effectively toward victory?

1. **SHEEP**: I have no access to sheep production - this is a critical gap in my resource portfolio
2. **BRICK**: Needed for roads and settlements
3. **WOOD**: Needed for roads and settlements
4. **ORE**: Needed for cities and development cards

Looking at my plan to build a road toward node 18, I notice this isn't optimal since:
1. I already have plenty of wheat production from my cities
2. I critically need sheep resource access

<plan>
1. Trade wheat for sheep as my biggest resource gap
2. Keep accumulating resources for next build
3. Maintain longest road advantage
4. Target building roads toward sheep hexes or sheep ports
5. Next focus on getting a settlement with sheep production
</plan>

Since I need to trade and sheep is my most critical missing resource, I should trade my 4 wheat for 1 sheep.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist whose primary goal is to defeat the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (HIGHEST PRIORITY):
- Target 6 & 8 numbered hexes at all costs - these are the most productive numbers
- Prioritize ore and wheat hexes for your settlements - they enable cities and development cards
- Position yourself on at least one good brick and wood hex to enable early expansion
- Aim to cover ALL five resources with your two settlements combined
- Try to place on intersections with 3 productive hexes rather than 2
- Evaluate probability dots (not just numbers) - more dots mean more frequent production
- Place settlements with clear expansion paths that won't be easily blocked
- Avoid placing where you'll be immediately cut off by the opponent
- Position roads toward your next planned settlement location
- Consider distance to valuable ports (especially 2:1 ports matching your abundant resources)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-8):
- Build at least one new road and one new settlement ASAP
- Focus on securing access to any missing resources through expansion
- Establish access to a port if you're lacking a key resource
- Prevent the opponent from cutting off your expansion path
- Only purchase development cards if excess resources available or for immediate victory
- Expand toward high-value hexes the opponent doesn't yet control

MID-GAME RESOURCE MANAGEMENT (TURNS 9-20):
- Target 3 cities minimum (worth 6 VP) - upgrade most productive settlements first
- Maintain 1 road per every 2 settlements for flexible expansion
- Always build a settlement when you have the resources (more production points)
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each build (cities give best long-term return)
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1 or better) to maintain resource balance
- Keep at least one viable road-building path open at all times
- If blocked from expansion, shift to city upgrades and development cards

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Development cards should supplement your expansion, not replace it
- Prioritize using Knight cards to protect your best hexes from the robber
- Save Knights when you're ahead to counter the opponent's robber placements
- Only buy development cards when you:
  1. Have excess sheep/wheat/ore but lack wood/brick for expansion
  2. Are close to securing largest army
  3. Need a specific card type (Road Building to break through a blockade)
- Use Road Building cards to save brick/wood and create surprise expansion paths
- Time Monopoly cards to capture opponent's stockpile after high-producing rolls
- Use Year of Plenty to complete crucial builds when short on specific resources

ROBBER PLACEMENT:
- Always target the opponent's highest-producing hex (high number + settlement/city)
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat hexes to slow city development
- If opponent relies heavily on one resource, target that resource's hexes
- Never place the robber on your own high-production hexes
- When stealing, target resources you immediately need for your next build

VICTORY PATH PLANNING:
- Target resource independence with at least one settlement/city on each resource
- Minimum viable infrastructure: 3-4 settlements total, with 2-3 upgraded to cities
- Calculate multiple paths to 10 VP and pursue the fastest:
  Path 1: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP)
  Path 2: 4 cities (8 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP)
  Path 3: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 victory point card
- Always track your direct path to 10 VP and focus on those builds
- Prioritize visible points (settlements/cities) over speculative development cards
- Switch paths if the opponent blocks your primary victory path
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Accept trades only when they enable an immediate, crucial build
- Never make trades that allow opponent to build a settlement or city immediately
- Trade away excess resources when at risk for robber (7+ cards)
- Calculate the production value of each settlement location before deciding to build
- When trading with ports, plan sequences that convert unwanted resources into needed ones

DETAILED DECISION FRAMEWORK:
1. Does this move bring me closer to 10 victory points?
2. Does this move increase my production capacity more than alternative builds?
3. Does this move protect me from being blocked or cut off?
4. Does this move position me for strongest expansion in next 2-3 turns?
5. Is this the most efficient use of my current resources?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 77 | Player: BLUE | Action: MOVE_ROBBER

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Trade wheat for sheep as my biggest resource gap
2. Keep accumulating resources for next build
3. Maintain longest road advantage
4. Target building roads toward sheep hexes or sheep ports
5. Next focus on getting a settlement with sheep production

# Robber Placement Analysis

I need to analyze where to place the robber to maximize my strategic advantage against the RED player.

## First, let's assess RED's settlements and their production:
- Node 4: 🌲10[⭐], 🐑8[⭐⭐⭐], 🌾9[⭐⭐] - High value with three resources and good numbers
- Node 6: 🌾4[⭐], 🧱3[⭐] - Low value with low probability numbers
- Node 12: 🐑8[⭐⭐⭐] - Medium value with good sheep production
- Node 2: 🌲10[⭐], 🌾4[⭐] - Medium value with wood production
- Node 17: 🌾9[⭐⭐] - Medium value with wheat production

## Resource hexes and their value to RED:
- 🐑8 (-1, 0, 1): Critical hex, produces for 2 RED settlements (nodes 4 and 12)
- 🌾9 (-1, 1, 0): Important hex, produces for 2 RED settlements (nodes 4 and 17)
- 🌲10 (0, 0, 0): Important hex, produces for 2 RED settlements (nodes 2 and 4)
- 🌾4 (1, -1, 0): Low value hex, produces for 2 RED settlements but low probability
- 🧱3 (1, 0, -1): Low value hex, produces for 1 RED settlement with low probability
- 🏜️ (0, -1, 1): Desert, no production

## My strategic needs:
- I need to block RED's highest producing hexes
- I particularly want to block hexes that produce multiple resources for RED
- Sheep is a resource I'm short on, so preventing RED from getting sheep is valuable

## Robber placement options:
- [0] (0, 0, 0) - 🌲10: Blocks wood for 2 RED settlements, including the productive node 4
- [1] (1, -1, 0) - 🌾4: Blocks wheat but with low probability number (4)
- [2] (0, -1, 1) - 🏜️: Desert has no production to block
- [3] (-1, 0, 1) - 🐑8: Blocks sheep for 2 RED settlements, highest probability (8)
- [4] (-1, 1, 0) - 🌾9: Blocks wheat for 2 RED settlements with good probability (9)
- [5] (1, 0, -1) - 🧱3: Blocks brick but with low probability (3)

## Decision:
Option [3] is clearly the strongest choice. Placing the robber on the sheep hex (-1, 0, 1) will:
1. Block RED's most productive resource (sheep on 8)
2. Affect two of RED's settlements (nodes 4 and 12)
3. Target a resource I'm short on myself (sheep)
4. Prevent RED from gaining sheep which could help them build more settlements

<plan>
1. Block RED's sheep production with robber
2. Continue accumulating resources for next build 
3. Maintain longest road advantage
4. Target building roads toward any sheep sources
5. Next focus on getting a settlement with sheep production

# Game Analysis: Robber Placement Decision

I need to identify the optimal hex to place my robber to disrupt RED's production while maximizing my chances of stealing a useful resource.

## Step 1: Analyze RED's settlements and production
RED has 5 settlements producing:
- 🐑8: 2 settlements (nodes 4 and 12) - highest sheep production
- 🌾4: 2 settlements (nodes 2 and 6) - wheat production
- 🌾9: 2 settlements (nodes 4 and 17) - wheat production
- 🌲10: 2 settlements (nodes 2 and 4) - wood production
- 🧱3: 1 settlement (node 6) - brick production

RED's most valuable hex appears to be 🐑8 with 3 probability dots and 2 settlements.

## Step 2: Evaluate my current resource needs
I have:
- 2 🐑SHEEP
- 2 🌾WHEAT
- Need brick, wood, and ore for most builds
- With 6 VP already, I need 4 more to win

## Step 3: Consider each robber placement option
- Option 0: Move to 🌲10 (0,0,0) - Blocks wood with 1 dot, RED has 2 settlements here
- Option 1: Move to 🌾4 (1,-1,0) - Blocks wheat with 1 dot, RED has 2 settlements here
- Option 2: Move to 🏜️ (0,-1,1) - Desert has no production value
- Option 3: Move to 🌾9 (-1,1,0) - Blocks wheat with 2 dots, RED has 2 settlements here
- Option 4: Move to ⛏️5 (0,1,-1) - Blocks ore, but I have 2 cities there and RED has none
- Option 5: Move to 🧱3 (1,0,-1) - Blocks brick with 1 dot, RED has 1 settlement here

## Step 4: Strategic considerations
1. I should avoid blocking my own production at hex ⛏️5 (option 4)
2. The desert (option 2) has no production to block
3. The 🐑8 hex already has the robber on it (can't select it)
4. RED likely has wheat resources since they have 4 settlements producing it
5. Blocking 🌾9 (option 3) would block the highest-dot wheat production

## Step 5: Make the optimal decision
Option 3 (moving robber to 🌾9) is optimal because:
- It blocks a 2-dot wheat hex that RED has two settlements on
- Wheat is critical for RED to build cities and development cards
- I have a good chance of stealing wheat which would complement my 2 wheat

<plan>
1. Block RED's wheat production by placing robber on hex 🌾9
2. Continue accumulating resources for next build
3. Maintain longest road advantage
4. Look for opportunities to expand toward sheep production
5. Eventually build cities to reach 10 VP

- Prioritize ore and wheat hexes for your settlements - they enable cities and development cards
- Position yourself on at least one good brick and wood hex to enable early expansion
- Aim to cover ALL five resources with your two settlements combined
- Try to place on intersections with 3 productive hexes rather than 2
- Evaluate probability dots (not just numbers) - more dots mean more frequent production
- Place settlements with clear expansion paths that won't be easily blocked
- Avoid placing where you'll be immediately cut off by the opponent
- Position roads toward your next planned settlement location
- Consider distance to valuable ports (especially 2:1 ports matching your abundant resources)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-8):
- Build at least one new road and one new settlement ASAP
- Focus on securing access to any missing resources through expansion
- Establish access to a port if you're lacking a key resource
- Prevent the opponent from cutting off your expansion path
- Only purchase development cards if excess resources available or for immediate victory
- Expand toward high-value hexes the opponent doesn't yet control

MID-GAME RESOURCE MANAGEMENT (TURNS 9-20):
- Target 3 cities minimum (worth 6 VP) - upgrade most productive settlements first
- Maintain 1 road per every 2 settlements for flexible expansion
- Always build a settlement when you have the resources (more production points)
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each build (cities give best long-term return)
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1 or better) to maintain resource balance
- Keep at least one viable road-building path open at all times
- If blocked from expansion, shift to city upgrades and development cards

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Development cards should supplement your expansion, not replace it
- Prioritize using Knight cards to protect your best hexes from the robber
- Save Knights when you're ahead to counter the opponent's robber placements
- Only buy development cards when you:
  1. Have excess sheep/wheat/ore but lack wood/brick for expansion
  2. Are close to securing largest army
  3. Need a specific card type (Road Building to break through a blockade)
- Use Road Building cards to save brick/wood and create surprise expansion paths
- Time Monopoly cards to capture opponent's stockpile after high-producing rolls
- Use Year of Plenty to complete crucial builds when short on specific resources

ROBBER PLACEMENT:
- Always target the opponent's highest-producing hex (high number + settlement/city)
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat hexes to slow city development
- If opponent relies heavily on one resource, target that resource's hexes
- Never place the robber on your own high-production hexes
- When stealing, target resources you immediately need for your next build

VICTORY PATH PLANNING:
- Target resource independence with at least one settlement/city on each resource
- Minimum viable infrastructure: 3-4 settlements total, with 2-3 upgraded to cities
- Calculate multiple paths to 10 VP and pursue the fastest:
  Path 1: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP)
  Path 2: 4 cities (8 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP)
  Path 3: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 victory point card
- Always track your direct path to 10 VP and focus on those builds
- Prioritize visible points (settlements/cities) over speculative development cards
- Switch paths if the opponent blocks your primary victory path
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Accept trades only when they enable an immediate, crucial build
- Never make trades that allow opponent to build a settlement or city immediately
- Trade away excess resources when at risk for robber (7+ cards)
- Calculate the production value of each settlement location before deciding to build
- When trading with ports, plan sequences that convert unwanted resources into needed ones

DETAILED DECISION FRAMEWORK:
1. Does this move bring me closer to 10 victory points?
2. Does this move increase my production capacity more than alternative builds?
3. Does this move protect me from being blocked or cut off?
4. Does this move position me for strongest expansion in next 2-3 turns?
5. Is this the most efficient use of my current resources?

Board Understanding Guide:

- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 81 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Block RED's wheat production by placing robber on hex 🌾9
2. Continue accumulating resources for next build
3. Maintain longest road advantage
4. Look for opportunities to expand toward sheep production
5. Eventually build cities to reach 10 VP

# Game State Analysis

Let me analyze my position and available options:

**Current Victory Points (6/10)**:
- 2 Cities (4 VP)
- Longest Road (2 VP)
- Need 4 more VP to win

**Resources**:
- 2 🐑 SHEEP
- 4 🌾 WHEAT
- Missing: ORE, BRICK, WOOD for most builds

**Production**:
- City at node 16: Produces wheat (9) and ore (5)
- City at node 0: Produces wood (10), ore (5), and brick (3)
- The robber is currently on ore hex (5) - blocking my most critical resource

**Opponent (RED)**:
- Has 5 VP (5 settlements)
- Has 6 hidden resource cards
- Currently no cities

## Action Analysis

Let's consider my available options:

**Option 0: End Turn**
- Pros: Will likely receive new resources on next dice roll
- Cons: Keeping 6 cards risks losing half if a 7 is rolled
- The robber is currently on my ore hex, limiting my production potential

**Options 1-4: Maritime Trade**
- I don't have any specialized ports, so all trades would be at the unfavorable 4:1 ratio
- Trading wheat for any resource doesn't make immediate sense as I don't have enough resources to build anything regardless of which resource I obtain

Since I can't build anything this turn and already have the longest road secured, my best option is to end my turn and hope for favorable dice rolls.

<plan>
1. End turn to preserve resources and wait for better dice rolls
2. If robber is moved off my ore hex (5), prioritize city building (need ore + wheat) 
3. If ore production resumes, work toward another settlement or city
4. Maintain longest road advantage (crucial 2 VP)
5. Watch for RED's expansion and be ready to block critical paths
</plan>

With 6 cards total, I'm not at risk of losing resources to a robber roll (need 8+ cards for that). The robber is currently on my ore production, which is critical. My best move is to end my turn and hope for favorable resource production on the next roll.

# Game State Analysis

Let me analyze my current position and available actions:

**Current Victory Points (6/10):**
- 2 Cities = 4 VP
- Longest Road = 2 VP
- Need 4 more VP to win

**Resources:**
- 2 Sheep
- 4 Wheat
- No Ore, Brick, or Wood

**Key Observations:**
1. The robber is on my ore hex (5), blocking a key production resource
2. I have longest road (7 segments vs RED's 4), giving me a critical 2 VP advantage
3. RED has 5 VP and 8 hidden cards - they could be planning a major build
4. I cannot build anything immediately with my current resources
5. RED has 5 settlements vs my 2 cities, giving them broader resource diversity

## Action Analysis

Let's evaluate each available option:

**[0] End Turn:**
- Preserves my current resources
- Allows me to wait for the robber to potentially move off my ore hex
- Doesn't advance my position immediately

**Trading Options [1-4]:**
- I could trade 4 Wheat for 1 of any resource
- However, I would still lack the combinations needed for any meaningful build:
  - Settlement needs Brick+Wood+Sheep+Wheat (would still lack Brick+Wood)
  - City needs 3 Ore + 2 Wheat (would still need 2 more Ore)
  - Development card needs Ore+Wheat+Sheep (would still lack Ore)
- Trading would deplete my Wheat stockpile with no immediate benefit

## Strategic Considerations

1. **Resource Efficiency:** Trading 4:1 is highly inefficient and should be avoided unless critical
2. **Build Path:** My next priority should be either:
   - Building another city (need 3 Ore + 2 Wheat)
   - Building a settlement (need Brick + Wood + Wheat + Sheep)
   - Buying a development card (need Ore + Wheat + Sheep)
3. **Robber Impact:** The robber on my Ore hex is significantly hindering my ability to upgrade or build dev cards
4. **Opponent's Position:** RED has 8 cards but hasn't built - they may be waiting for a specific resource

<plan>
1. End turn to conserve resources
2. Wait for better dice rolls and for robber to move off my ore hex
3. Work toward another settlement or city once ore production resumes
4. Maintain longest road advantage (crucial 2 VP)
5. Monitor RED's expansion and be ready to block critical paths
</plan>

Given my current resource constraints and lack of immediate building options, the most strategic move is to end my turn and wait for more favorable conditions.

# Game Analysis for Turn 85

Let me analyze the current game state and my options:

## Victory Points Assessment
- I have 6/10 VP: 2 cities (4 VP) + longest road (2 VP)
- RED has 5/10 VP: 5 settlements (5 VP)
- I need 4 more VP to win, which could come from 2 more cities or 4 settlements

## Resource Analysis
- Current resources: 2 🐑SHEEP, 6 🌾WHEAT
- Missing critical resources: ⛏️ORE, 🧱BRICK, 🌲WOOD
- The robber is on my ore hex (0,1,-1), blocking a key resource I need for city upgrades
- Without ore, brick, or wood, I cannot build roads, settlements, or cities right now

## Available Actions
- [0] End turn - conserve resources
- [1-4] Trade 4 🌾WHEAT for another resource

## Strategic Considerations:
1. I cannot build anything immediately even with a trade
2. Trading 4:1 is inefficient but might help prepare for future turns
3. RED has 9 hidden cards and might be close to building something significant
4. Maintaining longest road (2 VP) is crucial for my lead

<plan>
1. Preserve wheat for future city upgrades when ore production resumes
2. End turn to maintain resource efficiency (avoid inefficient 4:1 trades)
3. Hope for robber to move off my ore hex soon
4. Continue monitoring RED's expansion to protect longest road
5. Work toward a settlement (need wood + brick) once I acquire those resources
6. My next priority should be getting a settlement with ore production that isn't blocked by the robber
</plan>

The most strategically sound move is to end my turn. I don't have enough resources to build anything meaningful right now, and a 4:1 trade would be inefficient without an immediate build opportunity. Better to conserve my wheat for when I can access ore again (once the robber moves).

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist whose primary goal is to defeat the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (HIGHEST PRIORITY):
- Target 6 & 8 numbered hexes at all costs - these are the most productive numbers
- Prioritize ore and wheat hexes for your settlements - they enable cities and development cards
- Position yourself on at least one good brick and wood hex to enable early expansion
- Aim to cover ALL five resources with your two settlements combined
- Try to place on intersections with 3 productive hexes rather than 2
- Evaluate probability dots (not just numbers) - more dots mean more frequent production
- Place settlements with clear expansion paths that won't be easily blocked
- Avoid placing where you'll be immediately cut off by the opponent
- Position roads toward your next planned settlement location
- Consider distance to valuable ports (especially 2:1 ports matching your abundant resources)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-8):
- Build at least one new road and one new settlement ASAP
- Focus on securing access to any missing resources through expansion
- Establish access to a port if you're lacking a key resource
- Prevent the opponent from cutting off your expansion path
- Only purchase development cards if excess resources available or for immediate victory
- Expand toward high-value hexes the opponent doesn't yet control

MID-GAME RESOURCE MANAGEMENT (TURNS 9-20):
- Target 3 cities minimum (worth 6 VP) - upgrade most productive settlements first
- Maintain 1 road per every 2 settlements for flexible expansion
- Always build a settlement when you have the resources (more production points)
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each build (cities give best long-term return)
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1 or better) to maintain resource balance
- Keep at least one viable road-building path open at all times
- If blocked from expansion, shift to city upgrades and development cards

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Development cards should supplement your expansion, not replace it
- Prioritize using Knight cards to protect your best hexes from the robber
- Save Knights when you're ahead to counter the opponent's robber placements
- Only buy development cards when you:
  1. Have excess sheep/wheat/ore but lack wood/brick for expansion
  2. Are close to securing largest army
  3. Need a specific card type (Road Building to break through a blockade)
- Use Road Building cards to save brick/wood and create surprise expansion paths
- Time Monopoly cards to capture opponent's stockpile after high-producing rolls
- Use Year of Plenty to complete crucial builds when short on specific resources

ROBBER PLACEMENT:
- Always target the opponent's highest-producing hex (high number + settlement/city)
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat hexes to slow city development
- If opponent relies heavily on one resource, target that resource's hexes
- Never place the robber on your own high-production hexes
- When stealing, target resources you immediately need for your next build

VICTORY PATH PLANNING:
- Target resource independence with at least one settlement/city on each resource
- Minimum viable infrastructure: 3-4 settlements total, with 2-3 upgraded to cities
- Calculate multiple paths to 10 VP and pursue the fastest:
  Path 1: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP)
  Path 2: 4 cities (8 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP)
  Path 3: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 victory point card
- Always track your direct path to 10 VP and focus on those builds
- Prioritize visible points (settlements/cities) over speculative development cards
- Switch paths if the opponent blocks your primary victory path
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Accept trades only when they enable an immediate, crucial build
- Never make trades that allow opponent to build a settlement or city immediately
- Trade away excess resources when at risk for robber (7+ cards)
- Calculate the production value of each settlement location before deciding to build
- When trading with ports, plan sequences that convert unwanted resources into needed ones

DETAILED DECISION FRAMEWORK:
1. Does this move bring me closer to 10 victory points?
2. Does this move increase my production capacity more than alternative builds?
3. Does this move protect me from being blocked or cut off?
4. Does this move position me for strongest expansion in next 2-3 turns?
5. Is this the most efficient use of my current resources?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 87 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Preserve wheat for future city upgrades when ore production resumes
2. End turn to maintain resource efficiency (avoid inefficient 4:1 trades)
3. Hope for robber to move off my ore hex soon
4. Continue monitoring RED's expansion to protect longest road
5. Work toward a settlement (need wood + brick) once I acquire those resources
6. My next priority should be getting a settlement with ore production that isn't blocked by the robber

# Game Analysis

I'll analyze the current game state and my available options:

## Victory Point Status
- I have 6/10 VP: 2 cities (4 VP) + longest road (2 VP)
- RED has 5/10 VP: 5 settlements (5 VP)
- I need 4 more VP to win, which could come from 2 cities, 4 settlements, or a combination

## Resource Analysis
- I have: 2 🐑SHEEP, 6 🌾WHEAT
- The robber is blocking my ore hex at (0, 1, -1), limiting my city upgrades
- I'm currently lacking both WOOD and BRICK for settlement expansion

## Production Analysis
- My city at node 16 produces wheat and ore (when not blocked)
- My city at node 0 produces wood, ore (when not blocked), and brick
- RED has good coverage of sheep, wheat, and wood with moderate production values

## Strategic Position
- I hold longest road with 7 segments vs RED's 4, giving me a 2 VP advantage
- I have no settlements but 2 cities, while RED has 5 settlements
- Resources are tight now with the robber on my ore hex

## Available Actions
I can:
1. End my turn (option 0)
2. Make a 4:1 trade for various resources (options 1-4)

## Decision Analysis
- Trading wheat at a 4:1 ratio is inefficient
- I need both wood and brick to build a settlement
- Trading for just one of these resources won't immediately enable building
- I'm not at risk of losing cards to the robber (holding 8 cards total)
- Preserving wheat for future city upgrades once my ore production returns is valuable

<plan>
1. Maintain my resource efficiency by ending turn
2. Continue to accumulate wheat for future city upgrades when ore becomes available
3. Look for opportunities to trade for wood and brick to build a settlement
4. Watch RED's expansion to protect my longest road advantage
5. When possible, prioritize building a settlement near ore production to diversify away from the robber-blocked hex
</plan>

Given my current resources and the unavailability of efficient trades, the best action is to end my turn and wait for better opportunities.

# Game Analysis for Settlers of Catan

I'll analyze the current situation carefully to make the best strategic decision.

## Current Game State Assessment
- I have 6/10 victory points: 2 cities (4 VP) + longest road (2 VP)
- My resources: 2 sheep and 8 wheat
- RED has 5/10 victory points with 5 settlements
- The robber is on the ore hex (5), blocking one of my key production sources

## Resource Analysis
My current production:
- City at node 16: wheat(9) and ore(5) - but ore is blocked by robber
- City at node 0: wood(10), ore(5), and brick(3) - again, ore is blocked

My immediate issue is that while I have plenty of wheat, I'm completely lacking wood and brick for expansion, and the ore I need for city upgrades is currently blocked by the robber.

## Options Analysis

[0] End turn: This preserves my 8 wheat, but doesn't advance my position. I risk losing cards to the robber if a 7 is rolled.

[1-4] Maritime trades: I can trade 4 wheat for another resource, but with 8 wheat, I could make up to 2 trades.

Looking at potential builds:
- Settlement: Needs 1 brick, 1 wood, 1 sheep, 1 wheat
- Road: Needs 1 brick, 1 wood
- Development card: Needs 1 ore, 1 sheep, 1 wheat

With my current resources plus trades, I could:
- Trade for 1 wood and 1 brick to build 1 road (not very useful right now)
- Trade for 1 wood and 1 brick + use 1 wheat and 1 sheep to build a new settlement (most beneficial)

## Strategic Decision

Building a new settlement would be ideal, but I need both wood and brick. Since I only have 8 wheat, I can make at most 2 trades at 4:1 ratio. This would give me exactly what I need for a settlement.

However, I need to consider:
- Where would I build this settlement? I need to verify road connections.
- Do I have road access to a valid settlement location?

Given the incomplete information about available settlement locations, I believe the best move is to end my turn and preserve my resources. I'm already leading with 6 VP to RED's 5 VP, and trading at a 4:1 ratio is inefficient. It's better to wait for the robber to move off my ore hex and then make a more efficient build.

<plan>
1. End turn to preserve wheat for future builds
2. When robber moves off ore, prioritize city upgrades or development cards
3. If I get wood and brick naturally, build a settlement to secure more production
4. Maintain my longest road advantage as it's a key 2 VP
5. Watch for RED's expansion and be ready to counter if they threaten my lead
</plan>

You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist whose primary goal is to defeat the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (HIGHEST PRIORITY):
- Target 6 & 8 numbered hexes at all costs - these are the most productive numbers
- Prioritize ore and wheat hexes for your settlements - they enable cities and development cards
- Position yourself on at least one good brick and wood hex to enable early expansion
- Aim to cover ALL five resources with your two settlements combined
- Try to place on intersections with 3 productive hexes rather than 2
- Evaluate probability dots (not just numbers) - more dots mean more frequent production
- Place settlements with clear expansion paths that won't be easily blocked
- Avoid placing where you'll be immediately cut off by the opponent
- Position roads toward your next planned settlement location
- Consider distance to valuable ports (especially 2:1 ports matching your abundant resources)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-8):
- Build at least one new road and one new settlement ASAP
- Focus on securing access to any missing resources through expansion
- Establish access to a port if you're lacking a key resource
- Prevent the opponent from cutting off your expansion path
- Only purchase development cards if excess resources available or for immediate victory
- Expand toward high-value hexes the opponent doesn't yet control

MID-GAME RESOURCE MANAGEMENT (TURNS 9-20):
- Target 3 cities minimum (worth 6 VP) - upgrade most productive settlements first
- Maintain 1 road per every 2 settlements for flexible expansion
- Always build a settlement when you have the resources (more production points)
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each build (cities give best long-term return)
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1 or better) to maintain resource balance
- Keep at least one viable road-building path open at all times
- If blocked from expansion, shift to city upgrades and development cards

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Development cards should supplement your expansion, not replace it
- Prioritize using Knight cards to protect your best hexes from the robber
- Save Knights when you're ahead to counter the opponent's robber placements
- Only buy development cards when you:
  1. Have excess sheep/wheat/ore but lack wood/brick for expansion
  2. Are close to securing largest army
  3. Need a specific card type (Road Building to break through a blockade)
- Use Road Building cards to save brick/wood and create surprise expansion paths
- Time Monopoly cards to capture opponent's stockpile after high-producing rolls
- Use Year of Plenty to complete crucial builds when short on specific resources

ROBBER PLACEMENT:
- Always target the opponent's highest-producing hex (high number + settlement/city)
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat hexes to slow city development
- If opponent relies heavily on one resource, target that resource's hexes
- Never place the robber on your own high-production hexes
- When stealing, target resources you immediately need for your next build

VICTORY PATH PLANNING:
- Target resource independence with at least one settlement/city on each resource
- Minimum viable infrastructure: 3-4 settlements total, with 2-3 upgraded to cities
- Calculate multiple paths to 10 VP and pursue the fastest:
  Path 1: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP)
  Path 2: 4 cities (8 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP)
  Path 3: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 victory point card
- Always track your direct path to 10 VP and focus on those builds
- Prioritize visible points (settlements/cities) over speculative development cards
- Switch paths if the opponent blocks your primary victory path
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Accept trades only when they enable an immediate, crucial build
- Never make trades that allow opponent to build a settlement or city immediately
- Trade away excess resources when at risk for robber (7+ cards)
- Calculate the production value of each settlement location before deciding to build
- When trading with ports, plan sequences that convert unwanted resources into needed ones

DETAILED DECISION FRAMEWORK:
1. Does this move bring me closer to 10 victory points?
2. Does this move increase my production capacity more than alternative builds?
3. Does this move protect me from being blocked or cut off?
4. Does this move position me for strongest expansion in next 2-3 turns?
5. Is this the most efficient use of my current resources?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 91 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. End turn to preserve wheat for future builds
2. When robber moves off ore, prioritize city upgrades or development cards
3. If I get wood and brick naturally, build a settlement to secure more production
4. Maintain my longest road advantage as it's a key 2 VP
5. Watch for RED's expansion and be ready to counter if they threaten my lead

# Game State Analysis

Let me analyze my current game state and evaluate my options:

## Victory Points
- I have 6/10 VP: 2 cities (4 VP) + longest road (2 VP)
- RED has 5/10 VP: 5 settlements (5 VP)
- I need 4 more VP to win

## Resource Analysis
- I currently have: 2 brick, 2 sheep, 8 wheat
- I'm missing: wood and ore for my next builds
- The robber is on the ore hex (0, 1, -1), blocking one of my important ore production hexes

## Building Possibilities
With my current resources, I cannot:
- Build a settlement (need wood)
- Build a city (need ore)
- Buy a development card (need ore)

## Trading Options
I could trade 4 wheat for 1 of:
- Ore (option 1)
- Brick (option 2)
- Sheep (option 3)
- Wood (option 4)

## Strategic Evaluation

1. **Trading wheat for ore (option 1)**:
   - Would allow me to buy a development card (potentially a VP or Knight)
   - But I already have 2 cities and no settlements, so development cards offer better VP potential than further city upgrades

2. **Trading wheat for brick (option 2)**:
   - I already have 2 brick, so this gives me 3 brick
   - Not enough to build anything without wood

3. **Trading wheat for sheep (option 3)**:
   - I already have 2 sheep, so this gives me 3 sheep
   - Not useful on its own

4. **Trading wheat for wood (option 4)**:
   - Would give me 1 wood + 2 brick I already have
   - Still need 1 more wood or 1 more sheep for a settlement

5. **End turn (option 0)**:
   - Preserves my 8 wheat for future more efficient builds
   - Risks losing resources if a 7 is rolled (I have 12 cards total)

## Decision Logic

The best move appears to be trading for ore to buy a development card, as it's my most direct path to potentially gaining another VP or securing largest army. However, I need to consider that I have 12 resources total, which puts me at risk for the robber.

Despite this risk, none of the trades are particularly efficient. Trading 4 wheat for 1 ore would leave me with 4 wheat + other resources, still over the 7-card limit.

Given my strong position (ahead by 1 VP), the optimal move is to end my turn and preserve resources for more efficient future builds. I'll risk the robber rather than make inefficient trades.

<plan>
1. End turn to preserve resources, accepting the robber risk
2. When robber moves off ore, prioritize city upgrades or development cards
3. If I get wood naturally, build a road or settlement to extend my network
4. Maintain my longest road advantage as it's a key 2 VP
5. Monitor RED's expansion and be ready to counter if they threaten my lead

# Game Analysis for Settlers of Catan

Let me analyze the current game state and my options carefully:

## Victory Point Status
- I have 6 VP: 2 cities (4 VP) + longest road (2 VP)
- RED has 5 VP: 5 settlements (5 VP)
- I need 4 more VP to win

## Resource Analysis
- I have: 2 brick, 2 sheep, 10 wheat
- The robber is on ore (5), which is blocking one of my production sources
- I have no immediate way to build a settlement (need wood)
- I can't build a city (need ore + wheat)
- I can't buy a development card (need ore + wheat + sheep)

## Options Evaluation

**Option 0: End Turn**
- Risk: I have 14 cards, well above the 7-card limit for robber safety
- If a 7 is rolled, I'll lose half my cards
- Benefit: Preserve resources for future turns when I might get ore naturally

**Trading Options (1-4):**
- Option 1: Trade 4 wheat for 1 ore
  - This would enable me to buy a development card (with 2 sheep, 1 ore, 1 wheat)
  - Development card could be VP, Knight, Road Building, etc.
  - Knight would help move robber off my ore hex
- Options 2-4: Trade for brick/sheep/wood
  - Not immediately useful as I already have brick and sheep
  - Wood would help build roads but not settlements (need brick+wood+wheat+sheep)

## Strategic Considerations
- RED has 10 hidden resources - they might be close to building
- The robber is on my ore hex, limiting my ability to build cities or buy development cards
- I have a strong wheat surplus but can't effectively use it without other resources
- My longest road (2 VP) is crucial to my current lead

<plan>
1. Trade wheat for ore to buy a development card
2. Hope for a knight card to move the robber off my ore hex
3. Continue building toward 10 VP by upgrading to cities when possible
4. Maintain longest road advantage
5. Watch RED's expansion and be ready to counter
</plan>

Given my resource situation and the risk of losing half my cards if I end turn with 14 resources, the best option is to trade 4 wheat for 1 ore. This would allow me to buy a development card, which could be a victory point card or a knight to move the robber. This is better than ending my turn with too many cards.

# Game Analysis for Turn 93

I'll analyze my current position and available options to determine the optimal move for maximizing my chances of winning.

## Current Game State
- I have 6 VP (2 cities = 4 VP + Longest Road = 2 VP)
- RED has 5 VP (5 settlements = 5 VP)
- My resources: 2 brick, 2 sheep, 6 wheat, 1 ore
- The robber is on my ore hex (5), limiting my ore production

## Available Actions Analysis

**[0] End Turn**
- This would waste my current resources and give RED another turn to advance
- Not optimal when I have actions available

**[1] Buy a Development Card (1 sheep, 1 wheat, 1 ore)**
- Would use my only ore, 1 sheep, and 1 wheat
- Could potentially yield:
  * Knight (most common) - Would let me move the robber off my ore hex
  * Victory Point - Would increase me to 7 VP
  * Road Building - Could extend my lead in longest road
  * Year of Plenty - Would help with resource flexibility
  * Monopoly - Could be powerful against RED's 10 hidden cards

**[2-5] Maritime Trade (4 wheat for another resource)**
- Trade 4 wheat for 1 ore would enable building another development card
- Trade 4 wheat for other resources isn't as valuable right now

## Victory Path Analysis
I need 4 more VP to win. Possible paths:
1. Build 2 more cities (+4 VP)
2. Build 2 settlements (+2 VP) and maintain longest road (+2 VP)
3. Get largest army (+2 VP), 1 settlement (+1 VP), and maintain longest road (+2 VP)
4. Get VP development cards to supplement other builds

## Decision Process
Looking at my options, I should maximize my VP potential while protecting my position.

The robber on my ore hex is problematic since ore is crucial for city upgrades. I have excess wheat but limited ore.

Buying a development card is appealing because:
1. It could be a victory point card (immediate progress)
2. It could be a knight (letting me move the robber off my ore hex)
3. It uses resources I have right now and makes progress toward my goal

After buying a development card, I'd still have 1 wheat, 2 brick, and 1 sheep, which isn't enough for another significant build.

<plan>
1. Buy a development card now to potentially get a knight or VP card
2. If I get a knight, use it to move the robber off my ore hex
3. Focus on collecting ore to upgrade settlements or build another development card
4. Maintain longest road advantage by extending when threatened
5. Target getting to 10 VP through a combination of cities, knights, and possible VP cards
</plan>

Looking at my options, buying a development card provides the best chance to advance my position and protect my resource production.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist whose primary goal is to defeat the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (HIGHEST PRIORITY):
- Target 6 & 8 numbered hexes at all costs - these are the most productive numbers
- Prioritize ore and wheat hexes for your settlements - they enable cities and development cards
- Position yourself on at least one good brick and wood hex to enable early expansion
- Aim to cover ALL five resources with your two settlements combined
- Try to place on intersections with 3 productive hexes rather than 2
- Evaluate probability dots (not just numbers) - more dots mean more frequent production
- Place settlements with clear expansion paths that won't be easily blocked
- Avoid placing where you'll be immediately cut off by the opponent
- Position roads toward your next planned settlement location
- Consider distance to valuable ports (especially 2:1 ports matching your abundant resources)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-8):
- Build at least one new road and one new settlement ASAP
- Focus on securing access to any missing resources through expansion
- Establish access to a port if you're lacking a key resource
- Prevent the opponent from cutting off your expansion path
- Only purchase development cards if excess resources available or for immediate victory
- Expand toward high-value hexes the opponent doesn't yet control

MID-GAME RESOURCE MANAGEMENT (TURNS 9-20):
- Target 3 cities minimum (worth 6 VP) - upgrade most productive settlements first
- Maintain 1 road per every 2 settlements for flexible expansion
- Always build a settlement when you have the resources (more production points)
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each build (cities give best long-term return)
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1 or better) to maintain resource balance
- Keep at least one viable road-building path open at all times
- If blocked from expansion, shift to city upgrades and development cards

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Development cards should supplement your expansion, not replace it
- Prioritize using Knight cards to protect your best hexes from the robber
- Save Knights when you're ahead to counter the opponent's robber placements
- Only buy development cards when you:
  1. Have excess sheep/wheat/ore but lack wood/brick for expansion
  2. Are close to securing largest army
  3. Need a specific card type (Road Building to break through a blockade)
- Use Road Building cards to save brick/wood and create surprise expansion paths
- Time Monopoly cards to capture opponent's stockpile after high-producing rolls
- Use Year of Plenty to complete crucial builds when short on specific resources

ROBBER PLACEMENT:
- Always target the opponent's highest-producing hex (high number + settlement/city)
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat hexes to slow city development
- If opponent relies heavily on one resource, target that resource's hexes
- Never place the robber on your own high-production hexes
- When stealing, target resources you immediately need for your next build

VICTORY PATH PLANNING:
- Target resource independence with at least one settlement/city on each resource
- Minimum viable infrastructure: 3-4 settlements total, with 2-3 upgraded to cities
- Calculate multiple paths to 10 VP and pursue the fastest:
  Path 1: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP)
  Path 2: 4 cities (8 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP)
  Path 3: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 victory point card
- Always track your direct path to 10 VP and focus on those builds
- Prioritize visible points (settlements/cities) over speculative development cards
- Switch paths if the opponent blocks your primary victory path
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Accept trades only when they enable an immediate, crucial build
- Never make trades that allow opponent to build a settlement or city immediately
- Trade away excess resources when at risk for robber (7+ cards)
- Calculate the production value of each settlement location before deciding to build
- When trading with ports, plan sequences that convert unwanted resources into needed ones

DETAILED DECISION FRAMEWORK:
1. Does this move bring me closer to 10 victory points?
2. Does this move increase my production capacity more than alternative builds?
3. Does this move protect me from being blocked or cut off?
4. Does this move position me for strongest expansion in next 2-3 turns?
5. Is this the most efficient use of my current resources?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game Analysis for Turn 93

Let me carefully examine the current game state and my available options.

## Game State Analysis
- I currently have 6/10 VP (2 cities = 4 VP + longest road = 2 VP)
- Resources: 2 Brick, 1 Sheep, 5 Wheat
- I have 1 KNIGHT development card
- The robber is on my ore hex (5), blocking my production
- My opponent has 5/10 VP (5 settlements)
- My opponent has 10 hidden resource cards

## Resource Analysis
I'm rich in wheat (5 cards) but missing critical ore for development cards or city upgrades. The robber is on my ore hex, which is a significant problem for my progress.

## Available Actions
0. End turn
1-4. Maritime trade options to convert wheat to other resources

## Strategic Options

**Option 1: End Turn**
Pros:
- I avoid trading at unfavorable 4:1 rates
- I wait for better opportunities next turn
Cons:
- I don't use excess wheat, risking robber theft
- I make no progress this turn

**Option 2: Trade 4 Wheat for Ore**
Pros:
- Gets me ore, which is critical and currently blocked
- Could enable development card purchase next turn
Cons:
- Very inefficient 4:1 trade

**Option 3: Trade for Wood/Other Resources**
Pros:
- Diversifies my resources
Cons:
- Doesn't align with immediate needs

## Decision Making
With the robber on my ore hex, I need to prioritize getting ore through alternative means. I have 5 wheat, making a 4:1 trade possible while still keeping 1 wheat.

My existing development card (KNIGHT) could move the robber on a future turn, but I need ore now to make progress. Trading 4 wheat for 1 ore is inefficient but necessary considering my current position.

<plan>
1. Trade 4 wheat for 1 ore this turn
2. On my next turn, use my knight to move the robber off my ore hex
3. Focus on collecting ore and wheat to build development cards or upgrade settlements
4. Maintain longest road advantage
5. Target 10 VP through cities, development cards, and longest road
</plan>

Given the analysis, I should make the trade for ore to unblock my progression path.

The only build option available to me is buying a development card. This would use all my resources except the brick. Let's evaluate this option:

**Pros of buying a development card:**
- Could get a Victory Point card (instant hidden VP)
- Could get a Knight to move the robber off my ore hex
- Could get Road Building to extend my road network
- Could get Year of Plenty or Monopoly for resource advantage
- Prevents resource loss if a 7 is rolled next turn
- Moves me toward Largest Army (currently no one has it)

**Cons of buying a development card:**
- Uses all my non-brick resources
- Development cards (except VP cards) can't be played this turn
- May get a card that doesn't help immediate needs

**If I end my turn:**
- Keep my resources for potential trades or builds next turn
- Risk losing half my cards if a 7 is rolled (though I only have 5 cards)
- The robber stays on my ore hex, limiting my ore production

<plan>
1. Buy a development card this turn (sheep, wheat, ore)
2. On my next turn, use knights (both the one I have and potentially the new one) to move the robber off my key production hexes
3. Focus on collecting resources to build more cities
4. Maintain longest road advantage
5. Target 10 VP through cities, development cards, and longest road
</plan>

Given that:
1. I'm ahead in points (6 vs 5)
2. I can afford a development card
3. This reduces my vulnerability to the robber
4. Development cards offer multiple pathways to victory
5. I already have a knight to move the robber next turn
6. The potential benefit outweighs keeping the resources

The optimal decision is to buy a development card.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist whose primary goal is to defeat the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (HIGHEST PRIORITY):
- Target 6 & 8 numbered hexes at all costs - these are the most productive numbers
- Prioritize ore and wheat hexes for your settlements - they enable cities and development cards
- Position yourself on at least one good brick and wood hex to enable early expansion
- Aim to cover ALL five resources with your two settlements combined
- Try to place on intersections with 3 productive hexes rather than 2
- Evaluate probability dots (not just numbers) - more dots mean more frequent production
- Place settlements with clear expansion paths that won't be easily blocked
- Avoid placing where you'll be immediately cut off by the opponent
- Position roads toward your next planned settlement location
- Consider distance to valuable ports (especially 2:1 ports matching your abundant resources)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-8):
- Build at least one new road and one new settlement ASAP
- Focus on securing access to any missing resources through expansion
- Establish access to a port if you're lacking a key resource
- Prevent the opponent from cutting off your expansion path
- Only purchase development cards if excess resources available or for immediate victory
- Expand toward high-value hexes the opponent doesn't yet control

MID-GAME RESOURCE MANAGEMENT (TURNS 9-20):
- Target 3 cities minimum (worth 6 VP) - upgrade most productive settlements first
- Maintain 1 road per every 2 settlements for flexible expansion
- Always build a settlement when you have the resources (more production points)
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each build (cities give best long-term return)
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1 or better) to maintain resource balance
- Keep at least one viable road-building path open at all times
- If blocked from expansion, shift to city upgrades and development cards

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Development cards should supplement your expansion, not replace it
- Prioritize using Knight cards to protect your best hexes from the robber
- Save Knights when you're ahead to counter the opponent's robber placements
- Only buy development cards when you:
  1. Have excess sheep/wheat/ore but lack wood/brick for expansion
  2. Are close to securing largest army
  3. Need a specific card type (Road Building to break through a blockade)
- Use Road Building cards to save brick/wood and create surprise expansion paths
- Time Monopoly cards to capture opponent's stockpile after high-producing rolls
- Use Year of Plenty to complete crucial builds when short on specific resources

ROBBER PLACEMENT:
- Always target the opponent's highest-producing hex (high number + settlement/city)
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat hexes to slow city development
- If opponent relies heavily on one resource, target that resource's hexes
- Never place the robber on your own high-production hexes
- When stealing, target resources you immediately need for your next build

VICTORY PATH PLANNING:
- Target resource independence with at least one settlement/city on each resource
- Minimum viable infrastructure: 3-4 settlements total, with 2-3 upgraded to cities
- Calculate multiple paths to 10 VP and pursue the fastest:
  Path 1: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP)
  Path 2: 4 cities (8 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP)
  Path 3: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 victory point card
- Always track your direct path to 10 VP and focus on those builds
- Prioritize visible points (settlements/cities) over speculative development cards
- Switch paths if the opponent blocks your primary victory path
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Accept trades only when they enable an immediate, crucial build
- Never make trades that allow opponent to build a settlement or city immediately
- Trade away excess resources when at risk for robber (7+ cards)
- Calculate the production value of each settlement location before deciding to build
- When trading with ports, plan sequences that convert unwanted resources into needed ones

DETAILED DECISION FRAMEWORK:
1. Does this move bring me closer to 10 victory points?
2. Does this move increase my production capacity more than alternative builds?
3. Does this move protect me from being blocked or cut off?
4. Does this move position me for strongest expansion in next 2-3 turns?
5. Is this the most efficient use of my current resources?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game Analysis for Settlers of Catan

I need to analyze the current game state and make the optimal decision to maximize my chances of winning.

## Current Position Analysis
- I have 6/10 victory points (4 from 2 cities, 2 from longest road)
- I have 2 brick, 2 wheat, no sheep or ore currently
- I have 2 development cards: 1 Knight and 1 Monopoly
- The robber is on the ore hex (0, 1, -1), which is blocking my city at node 16
- RED player has 5 settlements (5 VP) but no cities

## Available Actions
1. Play Monopoly for any resource
2. Play Knight to move the robber
3. Roll the dice

## Strategic Considerations

First, I'll consider the Monopoly card options:
- WOOD: Could be useful for building roads to maintain longest road
- BRICK: I already have 2 brick, so getting more might let me build roads
- SHEEP: I need sheep for development cards
- WHEAT: I already have 2 wheat, and it's needed for cities/dev cards
- ORE: Critical for city upgrades and development cards

The Knight card would let me:
- Move the robber off my ore hex that's currently blocked
- Potentially steal a useful resource
- Start working toward Largest Army (need 3 knights)

If I roll the dice:
- I might get resources from my cities (but ore is blocked)
- The robber stays on my ore hex
- RED might roll a 7 and target my cities if I get too many resources

Looking at my plan:
1. I wanted to buy a development card this turn
2. Use knights to move the robber off my key hexes
3. Focus on collecting resources for cities

The most urgent issue is that my ore production is blocked. Since I need ore for cities and development cards, my priority should be to get the robber off my ore hex.

## Decision

Playing the Knight card (action 5) is clearly the best move because:
1. It immediately removes the robber from my ore hex, restoring my ore production
2. I can steal a resource from the opponent
3. It advances me toward the Largest Army bonus (2 VP)
4. The Monopoly card is more valuable to save for when I know RED has collected many of a specific resource

<plan>
1. Use knight card to move robber off my ore hex
2. Target RED's best production hex with the robber
3. Continue collecting resources for another city (need ore and wheat)
4. Consider using Monopoly card strategically when RED accumulates resources
5. Maintain longest road while working toward 10 VP through cities and possibly largest army
</plan>

# Analyzing Robber Placement Options

I need to choose the optimal hex to place the robber to maximize my chances of winning. Let me analyze each option carefully.

## Current Game State Assessment
- I have 6 VP (2 cities = 4 VP + longest road = 2 VP)
- RED has 5 VP (5 settlements = 5 VP)
- I have 2 brick, 2 wheat in hand plus a Monopoly card
- The robber is currently on my ore hex (0, 1, -1), blocking my ore production

## Robber Placement Analysis

**[0] Move robber to (0, 0, 0) - Wood 10**
- This is a 10-value wood hex
- RED has 2 settlements that produce from this hex (nodes 2 and 4)
- This is a high-production hex for RED (⭐ rating per settlement)
- Would block significant wood production from RED

**[1] Move robber to (1, -1, 0) - Wheat 4**
- This is a 4-value wheat hex
- RED has 2 settlements that produce from this hex (nodes 2 and 6)
- Low productivity (⭐ rating per settlement)
- Not a critical block

**[2] Move robber to (0, -1, 1) - Desert**
- This is a desert tile that produces nothing
- Placing the robber here wastes the opportunity to block resources
- Not a strategic choice

**[3] Move robber to (-1, 0, 1) - Sheep 8**
- This is an 8-value sheep hex
- RED has 2 settlements that produce from this (nodes 4 and 12)
- Very high productivity (⭐⭐⭐ rating per settlement)
- Would block significant sheep production from RED

**[4] Move robber to (-1, 1, 0) - Wheat 9**
- This is a 9-value wheat hex
- RED has 2 settlements that produce from this (nodes 4 and 17)
- High productivity (⭐⭐ rating per settlement)
- Would block significant wheat production from RED

**[5] Move robber to (1, 0, -1) - Brick 3**
- This is a 3-value brick hex
- RED has 1 settlement that produces from this (node 6)
- Low productivity (⭐ rating)
- Not a critical block

## Strategic Decision Making

Looking at RED's settlements, node 4 is their most productive settlement, connected to three high-value resources:
- Wood (10) - ⭐
- Sheep (8) - ⭐⭐⭐
- Wheat (9) - ⭐⭐

Since RED has 7 cards (which is a lot), I should target their highest production to slow them down and potentially steal a valuable resource.

Node 4 is connected to three hexes: options [0], [3], and [4]. Among these:
- Option [3] (Sheep 8) has the highest productivity rating (⭐⭐⭐)
- Option [4] (Wheat 9) has the second highest (⭐⭐)
- Both [3] and [4] affect multiple settlements

Since I need to keep RED from building cities (which require ore and wheat), and RED's settlement at node 4 is their most productive overall, I should prioritize blocking their best hex.

<plan>
1. Place robber on RED's sheep 8 hex to block their highest production
2. Continue working toward another city (need ore and wheat)
3. Use Monopoly card strategically when I can maximize resource gain
4. Maintain longest road while working toward 10 VP through cities
5. Consider development cards to work toward largest army
</plan>

Based on this analysis, I choose to move the robber to the sheep 8 hex:

  3. Need a specific card type (Road Building to break through a blockade)
- Use Road Building cards to save brick/wood and create surprise expansion paths
- Time Monopoly cards to capture opponent's stockpile after high-producing rolls
- Use Year of Plenty to complete crucial builds when short on specific resources

ROBBER PLACEMENT:
- Always target the opponent's highest-producing hex (high number + settlement/city)
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat hexes to slow city development
- If opponent relies heavily on one resource, target that resource's hexes
- Never place the robber on your own high-production hexes
- When stealing, target resources you immediately need for your next build

VICTORY PATH PLANNING:
- Target resource independence with at least one settlement/city on each resource
- Minimum viable infrastructure: 3-4 settlements total, with 2-3 upgraded to cities
- Calculate multiple paths to 10 VP and pursue the fastest:
  Path 1: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP)
  Path 2: 4 cities (8 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP)
  Path 3: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 victory point card
- Always track your direct path to 10 VP and focus on those builds
- Prioritize visible points (settlements/cities) over speculative development cards
- Switch paths if the opponent blocks your primary victory path
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Accept trades only when they enable an immediate, crucial build
- Never make trades that allow opponent to build a settlement or city immediately
- Trade away excess resources when at risk for robber (7+ cards)
- Calculate the production value of each settlement location before deciding to build
- When trading with ports, plan sequences that convert unwanted resources into needed ones

DETAILED DECISION FRAMEWORK:
1. Does this move bring me closer to 10 victory points?
2. Does this move increase my production capacity more than alternative builds?
3. Does this move protect me from being blocked or cut off?
4. Does this move position me for strongest expansion in next 2-3 turns?
5. Is this the most efficient use of my current resources?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 97 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Place robber on RED's sheep 8 hex to block their highest production
2. Continue working toward another city (need ore and wheat)
3. Use Monopoly card strategically when I can maximize resource gain
4. Maintain longest road while working toward 10 VP through cities
5. Consider development cards to work toward largest army

# Game Analysis & Decision Making

I need to decide between playing a Monopoly card or rolling the dice. Let's analyze the current game state:

## Current Status
- I have 6/10 VP (2 cities = 4 VP + longest road = 2 VP)
- I need 4 more VP to win
- I have resources: 2 🧱BRICK, 5 🌾WHEAT
- I have 1 MONOPOLY development card

## Strategic considerations:
1. **Path to victory**: I need 4 more VP, which could come from:
   - 2 more cities (4 VP)
   - 2 settlements and 1 city (3 VP) + development card VP (1 VP)
   - Settlements + largest army

2. **Resource needs**:
   - For a city upgrade: 3 ore + 2 wheat
   - For a settlement: 1 brick + 1 wood + 1 wheat + 1 sheep
   - I have plenty of wheat (5) but lack ore for cities and wood/sheep for settlements

3. **Monopoly card value**:
   - Most valuable when there are many resources to collect
   - RED has only 3 cards total, limiting the potential gain
   - We don't know which resources RED has

## Evaluating Options:
- Playing Monopoly now guarantees some resources, but the gain is limited (max 3 cards)
- Rolling dice could produce more resources for me
- I should save Monopoly for a more opportune moment when:
  a) RED has more cards
  b) I'm certain RED has resources I need
  c) I need specific resources for an immediate build

## Decision:
The Monopoly card's value is currently limited since RED only has 3 cards total. I don't know which resources RED has, making the Monopoly choice speculative. My best action is to roll the dice and potentially gain more resources from production, then save the Monopoly card for when RED has more resources or when I need a specific resource to complete a critical build.

<plan>
1. Roll dice to gain resources
2. Continue focusing on city upgrades (need ore)
3. Save Monopoly card for when RED has more resources or when I need a specific resource for a critical build
4. Maintain longest road advantage
5. Consider development cards to work toward largest army if excess resources
</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist whose primary goal is to defeat the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (HIGHEST PRIORITY):
- Target 6 & 8 numbered hexes at all costs - these are the most productive numbers
- Prioritize ore and wheat hexes for your settlements - they enable cities and development cards
- Position yourself on at least one good brick and wood hex to enable early expansion
- Aim to cover ALL five resources with your two settlements combined
- Try to place on intersections with 3 productive hexes rather than 2
- Evaluate probability dots (not just numbers) - more dots mean more frequent production
- Place settlements with clear expansion paths that won't be easily blocked
- Avoid placing where you'll be immediately cut off by the opponent
- Position roads toward your next planned settlement location
- Consider distance to valuable ports (especially 2:1 ports matching your abundant resources)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-8):
- Build at least one new road and one new settlement ASAP
- Focus on securing access to any missing resources through expansion
- Establish access to a port if you're lacking a key resource
- Prevent the opponent from cutting off your expansion path
- Only purchase development cards if excess resources available or for immediate victory
- Expand toward high-value hexes the opponent doesn't yet control

MID-GAME RESOURCE MANAGEMENT (TURNS 9-20):
- Target 3 cities minimum (worth 6 VP) - upgrade most productive settlements first
- Maintain 1 road per every 2 settlements for flexible expansion
- Always build a settlement when you have the resources (more production points)
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each build (cities give best long-term return)
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1 or better) to maintain resource balance
- Keep at least one viable road-building path open at all times
- If blocked from expansion, shift to city upgrades and development cards

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Development cards should supplement your expansion, not replace it
- Prioritize using Knight cards to protect your best hexes from the robber
- Save Knights when you're ahead to counter the opponent's robber placements
- Only buy development cards when you:
  1. Have excess sheep/wheat/ore but lack wood/brick for expansion
  2. Are close to securing largest army
  3. Need a specific card type (Road Building to break through a blockade)
- Use Road Building cards to save brick/wood and create surprise expansion paths
- Time Monopoly cards to capture opponent's stockpile after high-producing rolls
- Use Year of Plenty to complete crucial builds when short on specific resources

ROBBER PLACEMENT:
- Always target the opponent's highest-producing hex (high number + settlement/city)
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat hexes to slow city development
- If opponent relies heavily on one resource, target that resource's hexes
- Never place the robber on your own high-production hexes

  Path 2: 4 cities (8 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP)
  Path 3: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 victory point card
- Always track your direct path to 10 VP and focus on those builds
- Prioritize visible points (settlements/cities) over speculative development cards
- Switch paths if the opponent blocks your primary victory path
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Accept trades only when they enable an immediate, crucial build
- Never make trades that allow opponent to build a settlement or city immediately
- Trade away excess resources when at risk for robber (7+ cards)
- Calculate the production value of each settlement location before deciding to build

# Robber Placement Analysis

Let me analyze the available options for robber placement, focusing on the best strategic choice to maximize my chances of winning.

## Current Game Situation
- I have 6/10 victory points (2 cities = 4 VP, longest road = 2 VP)
- RED has 5/10 victory points (5 settlements = 5 VP)
- I need 4 more VPs to win, which could come from:
  - 2 more cities (+4 VP)
  - or 2 settlements (+2 VP) + largest army (+2 VP)
- I have 2 brick, 5 wheat, and a monopoly card
- I need ore to build cities, which is my most critical resource currently

## Robber Placement Options Analysis

[0] Move robber to (0, 0, 0) and steal from RED
- This is the wood (🌲10) hex
- Blocks production from RED settlements at nodes 2 and 4
- Blocks my own city at node 0
- **BAD CHOICE**: blocks my own high production and I need wood for settlements

[1] Move robber to (1, -1, 0) and steal from RED
- This is a wheat (🌾4) hex
- Blocks production from RED settlements at nodes 2 and 6
- Only 1 dot (low productivity)
- I already have 5 wheat, so this is not a high-priority block

[2] Move robber to (0, -1, 1) and steal from RED
- This is a desert tile, no production to block
- **BAD CHOICE**: wasted robber placement

[3] Move robber to (-1, 1, 0) and steal from RED
- This is a wheat (🌾9) hex with 2 dots (good productivity)
- Blocks production from RED settlements at nodes 4 and 17
- I already have 5 wheat, but this is a good productivity tile for RED

[4] Move robber to (0, 1, -1)
- This is the ore (⛏️5) hex with 2 dots
- Blocks my city at node 16 and 0
- **TERRIBLE CHOICE**: blocks my only source of ore which I critically need for cities

[5] Move robber to (1, 0, -1) and steal from RED
- This is a brick (🧱3) hex
- Blocks production from RED settlement at node 6
- Blocks my city at node 0
- I already have 2 brick, and this is a low-productivity hex

## Strategic Considerations
1. I need ore most urgently for city upgrades
2. RED has 3 hidden cards - stealing could give me a needed resource
3. I should block RED's most productive hexes without hurting my own production
4. The sheep (🐑8) hex is currently blocked

Looking at RED's settlements:
- Node 4: produces 🌲10[⭐], 🐑8[⭐⭐⭐], 🌾9[⭐⭐] - high production!
- Node 17: produces 🌾9[⭐⭐] - good wheat production

Option [3] blocks two of RED's settlements including one of their best wheat-producing nodes, and doesn't affect my production. This slows down RED's growth while potentially stealing a useful resource.

<plan>
1. Block RED's wheat production to slow them down
2. Work toward building settlements with my brick resources
3. Use monopoly card when RED accumulates ore to enable my city upgrades
4. Maintain longest road advantage
5. Target 2 more settlements or 2 more cities to reach 10 VP
</plan>

Therefore, the optimal choice is:

# Game Analysis for Settlers of Catan

Let me carefully analyze the current game situation to determine the optimal move.

## Game Status Assessment:
- I have 6/10 VP (2 cities = 4 VP, longest road = 2 VP)
- RED has 5/10 VP (5 settlements = 5 VP)
- I need 4 more VP to win, which could come from:
  * 2 more cities (+4 VP)
  * 4 more settlements (+4 VP)
  * Some combination of settlements, cities, largest army, or VP cards

## Resource Analysis:
- I currently have: 2 brick, 1 sheep, 5 wheat
- I'm missing: wood and ore, which are critical for building
- I have a Monopoly development card which could be game-changing

## Potential Actions:
1. Play Monopoly card for different resources
2. End turn (no building possible with current resources)
3. Trade wheat for other resources at 4:1 port rate

## Action Analysis:
If I end my turn, I'm not making progress. With my current resources, I can't build anything significant without trading or playing Monopoly.

To determine the optimal Monopoly play, I need to assess what RED likely has:
- RED has 2 hidden cards
- RED has settlements on wood (10), sheep (8), wheat (9, 4), and brick (3) hexes
- RED is likely collecting these resources, but especially sheep (with 3 settlements on sheep hex)
- RED has no cities yet, so they might be saving ore for that purpose

Looking at my needs:
- I need ore to upgrade settlements to cities
- I need wood for roads and settlements
- Both are critical for my progress

Since I already have a comfortable lead in the longest road (7 vs 4), my priority should be to focus on settlement/city building rather than roads. Cities require ore, which I currently lack completely.

Given that RED has several settlements but no cities yet, they may be accumulating ore for city upgrades. Playing the Monopoly card to collect ore could both advance my position and hinder RED's city development strategy.

## Decision:
I'll play the Monopoly card to collect all ORE from RED. This may give me the ore I need for city upgrades while simultaneously blocking RED's ability to build cities.

<plan>
1. Use Monopoly to collect RED's ore
2. Build cities or settlements based on resources acquired
3. Continue to protect longest road advantage
4. Target building 2 more settlements or 1 more city + 1 settlement to reach 10 VP
</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist whose primary goal is to defeat the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (HIGHEST PRIORITY):
- Target 6 & 8 numbered hexes at all costs - these are the most productive numbers
- Prioritize ore and wheat hexes for your settlements - they enable cities and development cards
- Position yourself on at least one good brick and wood hex to enable early expansion
- Aim to cover ALL five resources with your two settlements combined
- Try to place on intersections with 3 productive hexes rather than 2
- Evaluate probability dots (not just numbers) - more dots mean more frequent production
- Place settlements with clear expansion paths that won't be easily blocked
- Avoid placing where you'll be immediately cut off by the opponent
- Position roads toward your next planned settlement location
- Consider distance to valuable ports (especially 2:1 ports matching your abundant resources)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-8):
- Build at least one new road and one new settlement ASAP
- Focus on securing access to any missing resources through expansion
- Establish access to a port if you're lacking a key resource
- Prevent the opponent from cutting off your expansion path
- Only purchase development cards if excess resources available or for immediate victory
- Expand toward high-value hexes the opponent doesn't yet control

MID-GAME RESOURCE MANAGEMENT (TURNS 9-20):
- Target 3 cities minimum (worth 6 VP) - upgrade most productive settlements first
- Maintain 1 road per every 2 settlements for flexible expansion
- Always build a settlement when you have the resources (more production points)
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each build (cities give best long-term return)
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1 or better) to maintain resource balance
- Keep at least one viable road-building path open at all times
- If blocked from expansion, shift to city upgrades and development cards

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Development cards should supplement your expansion, not replace it
- Prioritize using Knight cards to protect your best hexes from the robber
- Save Knights when you're ahead to counter the opponent's robber placements
- Only buy development cards when you:
  1. Have excess sheep/wheat/ore but lack wood/brick for expansion
  2. Are close to securing largest army
  3. Need a specific card type (Road Building to break through a blockade)
- Use Road Building cards to save brick/wood and create surprise expansion paths
- Time Monopoly cards to capture opponent's stockpile after high-producing rolls
- Use Year of Plenty to complete crucial builds when short on specific resources

ROBBER PLACEMENT:
- Always target the opponent's highest-producing hex (high number + settlement/city)
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat hexes to slow city development
- If opponent relies heavily on one resource, target that resource's hexes
- Never place the robber on your own high-production hexes
- When stealing, target resources you immediately need for your next build

VICTORY PATH PLANNING:
- Target resource independence with at least one settlement/city on each resource
- Minimum viable infrastructure: 3-4 settlements total, with 2-3 upgraded to cities
- Calculate multiple paths to 10 VP and pursue the fastest:
  Path 1: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP)
  Path 2: 4 cities (8 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP)
  Path 3: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 victory point card
- Always track your direct path to 10 VP and focus on those builds
- Prioritize visible points (settlements/cities) over speculative development cards
- Switch paths if the opponent blocks your primary victory path
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Accept trades only when they enable an immediate, crucial build
- Never make trades that allow opponent to build a settlement or city immediately
- Trade away excess resources when at risk for robber (7+ cards)
- Calculate the production value of each settlement location before deciding to build
- When trading with ports, plan sequences that convert unwanted resources into needed ones

DETAILED DECISION FRAMEWORK:
1. Does this move bring me closer to 10 victory points?
2. Does this move increase my production capacity more than alternative builds?
3. Does this move protect me from being blocked or cut off?
4. Does this move position me for strongest expansion in next 2-3 turns?
5. Is this the most efficient use of my current resources?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 97 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Use Monopoly to collect RED's ore
2. Build cities or settlements based on resources acquired
3. Continue to protect longest road advantage
4. Target building 2 more settlements or 1 more city + 1 settlement to reach 10 VP
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.

# Game Analysis and Decision Making

Let me analyze the current game state and available options:

## Game Status Summary
- I have 6 Victory Points: 2 cities (4 VP) + Longest Road (2 VP)
- Need 4 more VP to win
- Resources: 2 🧱BRICK, 1 🐑SHEEP, 5 🌾WHEAT
- Played Cards: 1 KNIGHT, 1 MONOPOLY
- RED has 5 VP (5 settlements)

## Building Options
With my current resources, I can't build:
- A settlement (need 1🧱 + 1🌲 + 1🐑 + 1🌾) - missing wood
- A city (need 2🌾 + 3⛏️) - missing ore
- More roads (need 1🧱 + 1🌲 per road) - missing wood

## Available Actions
0. End turn
1-4. Trade wheat at 4:1 ratio for other resources

## Strategic Considerations
- I have lots of wheat (5) but no immediate build without other resources
- Trading 4:1 is inefficient but might let me build something
- I need ore for cities and wood for roads/settlements

## Action Analysis
1. Trade 4 wheat for 1 ore: Can't build a city yet (would still need 2 more ore)
2. Trade 4 wheat for 1 brick: Would have 3 brick, but no wood for roads
3. Trade 4 wheat for 1 sheep: Would have 2 sheep, but can't complete any builds
4. Trade 4 wheat for 1 wood: Could build a road with 1 brick + 1 wood

<plan>
1. Preserve resources until I can make an efficient build
2. Focus on building settlements at next opportunity (need 3-4 more VP)
3. Protect longest road advantage
4. Use ports for better trades when available
</plan>

Since none of the trade options provide an immediate significant advantage, and I already have the longest road secured, the most strategic choice is to end my turn and wait for better building opportunities with more efficient resource combinations.

# Game Analysis

Let me analyze my current game position and available actions:

## Current Status
- I have 6/10 victory points (2 cities = 4 VP, Longest Road = 2 VP)
- I need 4 more VP to win
- Resources: 2 🧱BRICK, 1 🐑SHEEP, 5 🌾WHEAT
- No development cards

## Opponent Status
- RED has 5/10 victory points (5 settlements)
- RED has 2 hidden resource cards

## Available Actions
- [0] End turn
- [1-4] Maritime trades giving 4 🌾WHEAT for various resources

## Strategic Assessment

I need to determine the best use of my current resources. With 5 🌾WHEAT, 2 🧱BRICK, and 1 🐑SHEEP, I don't have enough for any immediate builds:
- Settlement requires: 1 🧱BRICK, 1 🐑SHEEP, 1 🌲WOOD, 1 🌾WHEAT
- City requires: 2 🌾WHEAT, 3 ⛏️ORE
- Development card requires: 1 🐑SHEEP, 1 🌾WHEAT, 1 ⛏️ORE
- Road requires: 1 🧱BRICK, 1 🌲WOOD

Looking at my missing resources for potential builds:
1. For a settlement: I have the 🧱BRICK, 🐑SHEEP, and 🌾WHEAT, but need 🌲WOOD
2. For a development card: I have the 🐑SHEEP and 🌾WHEAT, but need ⛏️ORE

Given my current position (6 VP vs. RED's 5 VP), I should focus on efficiently using resources to get to 10 VP. The most direct path would be building settlements (need 2) and maintaining longest road.

<plan>
1. Trade for wood to enable settlement building
2. Build settlements to gain 2 more VP (reaching 8 VP)
3. Protect my longest road advantage (currently at 2 VP)
4. Either build another settlement or get VP development cards for the last points
</plan>

Since I need 🌲WOOD to build a settlement, and I have excess 🌾WHEAT (5), I should trade 4 🌾WHEAT for 1 🌲WOOD.

- Evaluate probability dots (not just numbers) - more dots mean more frequent production
- Place settlements with clear expansion paths that won't be easily blocked
- Avoid placing where you'll be immediately cut off by the opponent
- Position roads toward your next planned settlement location
- Consider distance to valuable ports (especially 2:1 ports matching your abundant resources)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-8):
- Build at least one new road and one new settlement ASAP
- Focus on securing access to any missing resources through expansion
- Establish access to a port if you're lacking a key resource
- Prevent the opponent from cutting off your expansion path
- Only purchase development cards if excess resources available or for immediate victory
- Expand toward high-value hexes the opponent doesn't yet control

MID-GAME RESOURCE MANAGEMENT (TURNS 9-20):
- Target 3 cities minimum (worth 6 VP) - upgrade most productive settlements first
- Maintain 1 road per every 2 settlements for flexible expansion
- Always build a settlement when you have the resources (more production points)
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each build (cities give best long-term return)
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1 or better) to maintain resource balance
- Keep at least one viable road-building path open at all times
- If blocked from expansion, shift to city upgrades and development cards

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Development cards should supplement your expansion, not replace it
- Prioritize using Knight cards to protect your best hexes from the robber
- Save Knights when you're ahead to counter the opponent's robber placements
- Only buy development cards when you:
  1. Have excess sheep/wheat/ore but lack wood/brick for expansion
  2. Are close to securing largest army
  3. Need a specific card type (Road Building to break through a blockade)
- Use Road Building cards to save brick/wood and create surprise expansion paths
- Time Monopoly cards to capture opponent's stockpile after high-producing rolls
- Use Year of Plenty to complete crucial builds when short on specific resources

ROBBER PLACEMENT:
- Always target the opponent's highest-producing hex (high number + settlement/city)
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat hexes to slow city development
- If opponent relies heavily on one resource, target that resource's hexes
- Never place the robber on your own high-production hexes
- When stealing, target resources you immediately need for your next build

VICTORY PATH PLANNING:
- Target resource independence with at least one settlement/city on each resource
- Minimum viable infrastructure: 3-4 settlements total, with 2-3 upgraded to cities
- Calculate multiple paths to 10 VP and pursue the fastest:
  Path 1: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP)
  Path 2: 4 cities (8 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP)
  Path 3: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 victory point card
- Always track your direct path to 10 VP and focus on those builds
- Prioritize visible points (settlements/cities) over speculative development cards
- Switch paths if the opponent blocks your primary victory path
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Accept trades only when they enable an immediate, crucial build
- Never make trades that allow opponent to build a settlement or city immediately
- Trade away excess resources when at risk for robber (7+ cards)
- Calculate the production value of each settlement location before deciding to build
- When trading with ports, plan sequences that convert unwanted resources into needed ones

DETAILED DECISION FRAMEWORK:
1. Does this move bring me closer to 10 victory points?
2. Does this move increase my production capacity more than alternative builds?
3. Does this move protect me from being blocked or cut off?
4. Does this move position me for strongest expansion in next 2-3 turns?
5. Is this the most efficient use of my current resources?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Trade for wood to enable settlement building
2. Build settlements to gain 2 more VP (reaching 8 VP)
3. Protect my longest road advantage (currently at 2 VP)
4. Either build another settlement or get VP development cards for the last points

# Game State Analysis

Let me analyze my current situation:

**Victory Points (6/10)**:
- 2 cities = 4 VP
- Longest Road (7 segments) = 2 VP
- I need 4 more VP to win

**Resources**: 1 Wood, 2 Brick, 1 Sheep, 1 Wheat

**Available Actions**:
- End Turn [0]
- Build Roads [1,2]
- Build Settlements [3,4]

## Settlement Analysis

Building a settlement would give me +1 VP, bringing me to 7/10 VP, and increase my production capabilities. I have exactly the resources needed (1 Wood, 1 Brick, 1 Sheep, 1 Wheat).

Let's evaluate the settlement options:
- Node 19: Connected to ⛏️5 hex (decent ore production)
- Node 22: Connected to 🧱3 hex (low-probability brick)

Node 19 is clearly better as it gives me access to ore with a good number (5). This aligns with my strategy of prioritizing ore for city upgrades.

## Road Analysis

Building a road would use 1 Wood and 1 Brick, leaving me with 0 Wood, 1 Brick, 1 Sheep, 1 Wheat. This would maintain my longest road advantage but not increase my VP immediately.

## Strategic Decision

I need to prioritize immediate VP gains while maintaining my longest road advantage. Building a settlement at node 19 accomplishes both:
- Gains 1 VP immediately (7/10 total)
- Increases ore production (valuable resource)
- Uses my resources efficiently
- Positions me better for future expansion

<plan>
1. Build settlement at node 19 for +1 VP (reaching 7/10)
2. Focus on getting resources for another settlement
3. Protect longest road advantage (currently 2 VP)
4. For final VP: either build one more settlement or get a VP development card
</plan>

The optimal move is to build a settlement at node 19.

PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist whose primary goal is to defeat the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (HIGHEST PRIORITY):
- Target 6 & 8 numbered hexes at all costs - these are the most productive numbers
- Prioritize ore and wheat hexes for your settlements - they enable cities and development cards
- Position yourself on at least one good brick and wood hex to enable early expansion

# Game State Analysis

Let me analyze my current position and available actions:

## Current Game State
- I have 7/10 victory points (2 cities = 4 VP, 1 settlement = 1 VP, longest road = 2 VP)
- I have 5 brick resources
- No development cards
- I need 3 more VP to win

## Resource Analysis
- I currently only have brick (5 of them)
- I can't build anything with only brick
- My production: I have good ore (5) and brick (3) production from my city at node 0, and good wheat (9) and ore (5) production from my city at node 16

## Possible Paths to Victory
1. Build 1 more settlement (+1 VP) and 1 more city (+1 VP) → total 9 VP
2. Build 3 more settlements (+3 VP) → total 10 VP
3. Maintain longest road (+2 VP) and get a victory point development card (+1 VP) → total 10 VP

## Available Actions Analysis
My only options are:
1. Trade 4 brick for another resource
2. End turn

Since I can't build anything with just brick, and I need a mix of resources for my next build, trading makes sense. The question is which resource to trade for.

For a settlement, I need: 🧱brick (have plenty), 🌲wood, 🐑sheep, 🌾wheat
For a city, I need: 🌾wheat (x2), ⛏️ore (x3)
For a development card, I need: 🌾wheat, 🐑sheep, ⛏️ore

Given my current state and production, I should prioritize resources I don't produce well. I produce good ore and wheat from my cities, but I have no wood production and limited sheep production.

<plan>
1. Trade for wood (to work toward a settlement)
2. Next, focus on getting sheep and wheat
3. Build settlement at a strategic location for 8 VP
4. Maintain longest road (2 VP)
5. Either build one more settlement or get a VP development card for final points
</plan>

Therefore, I should trade for wood to start working toward a settlement.

# Game Analysis for Turn 107

Let me analyze the current game state and available options:

## Current Game Status
- I have 7/10 victory points (2 cities = 4 VP, 1 settlement = 1 VP, longest road = 2 VP)
- I need 3 more VP to win
- My resources: 1 wood, 1 brick (exactly enough for 1 road)
- No development cards in hand

## Available Actions
- [0] End turn
- [1] Build road at edge (4, 5)
- [2] Build road at edge (1, 2)

## Strategic Considerations
1. I cannot build a settlement or city this turn due to lack of resources
2. Building a road would use all my current resources
3. The robber is on a wheat hex (-1, 1, 0), which is blocking one of my potential wheat sources
4. I already have longest road (7 segments vs RED's 4)
5. I need to consider if either road position offers strategic advantage

## Road Placement Analysis
- Edge (4, 5) connects nodes 4 and 5
- Edge (1, 2) connects nodes 1 and 2

Looking at the board structure:
- Node 4 already has a RED settlement
- Node 2 already has a RED settlement
- Building either road doesn't seem to open an immediate settlement opportunity for me
- Neither road appears strategically vital for maintaining longest road

<plan>
1. Conserve my wood and brick for potential settlement opportunities
2. Try to get wheat and sheep through trades or production rolls
3. Look to build a settlement at next available node for 8 VP
4. Maintain longest road (2 VP)
5. Either build one more settlement or get a VP development card for final 10 VP
</plan>

Since neither road is strategically necessary at this moment, and I should conserve my resources for potential trades or future settlement opportunities, the optimal choice is to end my turn.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist whose primary goal is to defeat the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (HIGHEST PRIORITY):
- Target 6 & 8 numbered hexes at all costs - these are the most productive numbers
- Prioritize ore and wheat hexes for your settlements - they enable cities and development cards
- Position yourself on at least one good brick and wood hex to enable early expansion
- Aim to cover ALL five resources with your two settlements combined
- Try to place on intersections with 3 productive hexes rather than 2
- Evaluate probability dots (not just numbers) - more dots mean more frequent production
- Place settlements with clear expansion paths that won't be easily blocked
- Avoid placing where you'll be immediately cut off by the opponent
- Position roads toward your next planned settlement location
- Consider distance to valuable ports (especially 2:1 ports matching your abundant resources)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-8):
- Build at least one new road and one new settlement ASAP
- Focus on securing access to any missing resources through expansion
- Establish access to a port if you're lacking a key resource
- Prevent the opponent from cutting off your expansion path
- Only purchase development cards if excess resources available or for immediate victory
- Expand toward high-value hexes the opponent doesn't yet control

MID-GAME RESOURCE MANAGEMENT (TURNS 9-20):
- Target 3 cities minimum (worth 6 VP) - upgrade most productive settlements first
- Maintain 1 road per every 2 settlements for flexible expansion
- Always build a settlement when you have the resources (more production points)
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each build (cities give best long-term return)
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1 or better) to maintain resource balance
- Keep at least one viable road-building path open at all times
- If blocked from expansion, shift to city upgrades and development cards

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Development cards should supplement your expansion, not replace it
- Prioritize using Knight cards to protect your best hexes from the robber
- Save Knights when you're ahead to counter the opponent's robber placements
- Only buy development cards when you:
  1. Have excess sheep/wheat/ore but lack wood/brick for expansion
  2. Are close to securing largest army
  3. Need a specific card type (Road Building to break through a blockade)
- Use Road Building cards to save brick/wood and create surprise expansion paths
- Time Monopoly cards to capture opponent's stockpile after high-producing rolls
- Use Year of Plenty to complete crucial builds when short on specific resources

ROBBER PLACEMENT:
- Always target the opponent's highest-producing hex (high number + settlement/city)
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat hexes to slow city development
- If opponent relies heavily on one resource, target that resource's hexes
- Never place the robber on your own high-production hexes
- When stealing, target resources you immediately need for your next build

VICTORY PATH PLANNING:
- Target resource independence with at least one settlement/city on each resource
- Minimum viable infrastructure: 3-4 settlements total, with 2-3 upgraded to cities
- Calculate multiple paths to 10 VP and pursue the fastest:
  Path 1: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP)
  Path 2: 4 cities (8 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP)
  Path 3: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 victory point card
- Always track your direct path to 10 VP and focus on those builds
- Prioritize visible points (settlements/cities) over speculative development cards
- Switch paths if the opponent blocks your primary victory path
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Accept trades only when they enable an immediate, crucial build
- Never make trades that allow opponent to build a settlement or city immediately
- Trade away excess resources when at risk for robber (7+ cards)
- Calculate the production value of each settlement location before deciding to build
- When trading with ports, plan sequences that convert unwanted resources into needed ones

DETAILED DECISION FRAMEWORK:
1. Does this move bring me closer to 10 victory points?
2. Does this move increase my production capacity more than alternative builds?
3. Does this move protect me from being blocked or cut off?
4. Does this move position me for strongest expansion in next 2-3 turns?
5. Is this the most efficient use of my current resources?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 109 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Conserve my wood and brick for potential settlement opportunities
2. Try to get wheat and sheep through trades or production rolls
3. Look to build a settlement at next available node for 8 VP
4. Maintain longest road (2 VP)
5. Either build one more settlement or get a VP development card for final 10 VP
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.

# Game State Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state:

- **My VP Count**: 7/10 VP (2 cities = 4 VP, 1 settlement = 1 VP, longest road = 2 VP)
- **Opponent VP Count**: 5/10 VP (5 settlements = 5 VP)
- **My Resources**: 1 wood, 1 brick
- **My Development Cards**: None remaining
- **Board Position**: I have the longest road (7 segments) worth 2 VP
- **Available Actions**: End turn, or build a road at 2 possible locations

## Resource Analysis
I only have 1 wood and 1 brick, exactly enough to build one road. I don't have any wheat, sheep, or ore to build settlements, cities, or development cards.

## Victory Path Analysis
I need 3 more VP to win. Most efficient paths:
1. Build 2 more settlements (+2 VP) and get 1 VP development card (+1 VP)
2. Build 1 more settlement (+1 VP) and upgrade existing settlement to city (+1 VP) + 1 VP card

## Road Building Options
Looking at the two road options:
- Edge (4,5): Would this extend my road network toward a viable settlement location?
- Edge (1,2): Would this extend my road network toward a viable settlement location?

Given the limited information about exact node connectivity, I need to consider if either road will help me reach a settlement location. However, since I currently don't have settlement resources (wheat + sheep + wood + brick), using my only wood and brick now might not be optimal.

## Decision Logic
1. Using my only wood and brick now means I won't be able to immediately build a settlement even if I gain the other required resources on my next turn.
2. Ending my turn preserves my resources for potential settlement building next turn if I roll/trade for wheat and sheep.
3. I'm leading in VPs (7 vs 5), so I don't need to make desperate moves.
4. Maintaining resources gives me flexibility on my next turn.

<plan>
1. Conserve wood and brick resources for settlement building
2. Hope to get wheat and sheep through production next turn
3. Build settlement at the first opportunity to reach 8 VP
4. Continue to protect longest road (2 VP)
5. Look for final VP through another settlement or VP development card
</plan>

Based on this analysis, I'll end my turn to conserve resources for better opportunities in the next round.

# Turn Analysis: Blue Player

Let me carefully analyze the game state and available options:

## Game Status Assessment
- I have 5 VP (2 cities at 2 VP each, 1 settlement at 1 VP)
- Red has 7 VP (5 settlements at 1 VP each, longest road bonus of 2 VP)
- I have 2 🌲Wood and 2 🧱Brick resources
- Red is closer to victory with 7/10 VP and has a significant settlement advantage

## My Resources
- 2 🌲Wood and 2 🧱Brick
- This is exactly enough to build one road

## Available Actions
0. End turn
1. Build a road at edge (4, 5)
2. Build a road at edge (1, 2)

## Strategic Analysis
Currently, I'm behind by 2 VP. My current plan focuses on building settlements, but I need to evaluate if building a road now is the best use of my resources.

Looking at the board:
- I have 2 cities and 1 settlement (5 VP total)
- I need 5 more VP to win
- Building roads could help extend my network for future settlements or possibly challenge for longest road

The most critical factor is understanding where these road locations are on the board and if they advance my position. Unfortunately, the exact positioning of edges (4, 5) and (1, 2) isn't completely clear from the board layout, but I need to determine if either road:
1. Opens a path to a valuable settlement spot
2. Extends my road network toward claiming longest road (currently Red has it with 10 segments, and I have 7)
3. Blocks Red's expansion

Since I have exactly enough resources for one road, and no other build options, the question is whether to build now or save resources for a potential settlement next turn if I gain the needed wheat and sheep.

<plan>
1. Build a road to extend my network and maintain flexibility
2. Focus on obtaining wheat and sheep for my next settlement
3. Target reaching 8 VP with next settlement
4. Consider challenging for longest road if feasible
5. Look for opportunities to gain final VPs through settlements or development cards
</plan>

Given that I need to expand my road network to reach potential settlement locations, and I have exactly the resources needed for a road, building a road now is more strategic than ending my turn with these valuable resources (which could be stolen by the robber or targeted with Monopoly).

Between the two road options, without seeing the exact board layout, I'll choose edge (1, 2) as it appears to be connected to my starting settlement area based on the node numbers.

   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (HIGHEST PRIORITY):
- Target 6 & 8 numbered hexes at all costs - these are the most productive numbers
- Prioritize ore and wheat hexes for your settlements - they enable cities and development cards
- Position yourself on at least one good brick and wood hex to enable early expansion
- Aim to cover ALL five resources with your two settlements combined
- Try to place on intersections with 3 productive hexes rather than 2
- Evaluate probability dots (not just numbers) - more dots mean more frequent production
- Place settlements with clear expansion paths that won't be easily blocked
- Avoid placing where you'll be immediately cut off by the opponent
- Position roads toward your next planned settlement location
- Consider distance to valuable ports (especially 2:1 ports matching your abundant resources)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-8):
- Build at least one new road and one new settlement ASAP
- Focus on securing access to any missing resources through expansion
- Establish access to a port if you're lacking a key resource
- Prevent the opponent from cutting off your expansion path
- Only purchase development cards if excess resources available or for immediate victory
- Expand toward high-value hexes the opponent doesn't yet control

MID-GAME RESOURCE MANAGEMENT (TURNS 9-20):
- Target 3 cities minimum (worth 6 VP) - upgrade most productive settlements first
- Maintain 1 road per every 2 settlements for flexible expansion
- Always build a settlement when you have the resources (more production points)
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each build (cities give best long-term return)
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1 or better) to maintain resource balance
- Keep at least one viable road-building path open at all times
- If blocked from expansion, shift to city upgrades and development cards

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Development cards should supplement your expansion, not replace it
- Prioritize using Knight cards to protect your best hexes from the robber
- Save Knights when you're ahead to counter the opponent's robber placements
- Only buy development cards when you:
  1. Have excess sheep/wheat/ore but lack wood/brick for expansion
  2. Are close to securing largest army
  3. Need a specific card type (Road Building to break through a blockade)
- Use Road Building cards to save brick/wood and create surprise expansion paths
- Time Monopoly cards to capture opponent's stockpile after high-producing rolls
- Use Year of Plenty to complete crucial builds when short on specific resources

ROBBER PLACEMENT:
- Always target the opponent's highest-producing hex (high number + settlement/city)
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat hexes to slow city development
- If opponent relies heavily on one resource, target that resource's hexes
- Never place the robber on your own high-production hexes
- When stealing, target resources you immediately need for your next build

VICTORY PATH PLANNING:
- Target resource independence with at least one settlement/city on each resource
- Minimum viable infrastructure: 3-4 settlements total, with 2-3 upgraded to cities
- Calculate multiple paths to 10 VP and pursue the fastest:
  Path 1: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP)
  Path 2: 4 cities (8 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP)
  Path 3: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 victory point card
- Always track your direct path to 10 VP and focus on those builds
- Prioritize visible points (settlements/cities) over speculative development cards
- Switch paths if the opponent blocks your primary victory path
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Accept trades only when they enable an immediate, crucial build
- Never make trades that allow opponent to build a settlement or city immediately
- Trade away excess resources when at risk for robber (7+ cards)
- Calculate the production value of each settlement location before deciding to build
- When trading with ports, plan sequences that convert unwanted resources into needed ones

DETAILED DECISION FRAMEWORK:
1. Does this move bring me closer to 10 victory points?
2. Does this move increase my production capacity more than alternative builds?
3. Does this move protect me from being blocked or cut off?
4. Does this move position me for strongest expansion in next 2-3 turns?
5. Is this the most efficient use of my current resources?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 121 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Build a road to extend my network and maintain flexibility
2. Focus on obtaining wheat and sheep for my next settlement
3. Target reaching 8 VP with next settlement
4. Consider challenging for longest road if feasible
5. Look for opportunities to gain final VPs through settlements or development cards

# Game Analysis

I need to analyze the current game state and decide between ending my turn or building a road.

## Victory Point Analysis
- RED has 7 VP (5 settlements + 2 VP for longest road)
- BLUE (me) has 5 VP (1 settlement + 2 cities worth 4 VP)
- To win, I need 5 more VP

## Resource Analysis
- I have 1 wood, 1 brick - exactly enough to build a road
- RED has 7 hidden cards

## Strategic Considerations
1. **VP Path to Victory**: I need 5 more VP, which could come from:
   - 1-2 more cities (2-4 VP)
   - 1-2 more settlements (1-2 VP)
   - Taking longest road from RED (2 VP swing)
   - Development cards (VP cards or largest army)

2. **Longest Road Analysis**:
   - RED has 10-segment longest road
   - I have 7-segment longest road
   - To overtake RED, I'd need to build at least 4 more roads

3. **Building Opportunities**:
   - Building the road at edge (4, 5) would continue my network
   - It doesn't give me immediate building options but maintains flexibility

<plan>
1. Build the road to use my exact resources rather than wasting them
2. Focus on acquiring resources for settlements or cities next
3. Continue building my road network to potentially compete for longest road
4. Target reaching 7-8 VP in my next few turns
5. Watch for development card opportunities if I get sheep, wheat, and ore
</plan>

## Decision Logic
- If I don't build the road now, my resources will likely be wasted if the robber moves
- Building maintains my flexibility and uses resources efficiently
- Not building provides no strategic advantage
- Building the road continues my expansion and positions me to potentially challenge for longest road later

The optimal decision is to build the road at edge (4, 5) using my exact wood and brick resources.

# Analyzing Robber Placement Options

I need to carefully consider where to place the robber to maximize my advantage and hinder my opponent RED, who is at 8 VP versus my 5 VP.

Let's analyze each hex option based on:
1. How valuable the hex is to RED
2. Resources I might potentially steal
3. Strategic impact on RED's production

## Evaluating Each Robber Placement:

**[0] Move robber to (0, 0, 0) - WOOD 10:**
- RED has 2 settlements (nodes 2 and 4) and 1 city at node 4 producing on 10
- Value to RED: HIGH (10 is a productive number with only one⭐ but it's being collected at 3 locations)
- RED likely needs wood for more roads to maintain longest road

**[1] Move robber to (1, -1, 0) - WHEAT 4:**
- RED has 2 settlements (nodes 2 and 6) on this hex
- Value to RED: MEDIUM (4 is not highly productive with one⭐)
- But wheat is crucial for cities and development cards

**[2] Move robber to (0, -1, 1) - DESERT:**
- No production to block
- No strategic value

**[3] Move robber to (-1, 0, 1) - SHEEP 8:**
- RED has 2 buildings here (city at node 4, settlement at node 12)
- Value to RED: HIGH (8 is very productive at three⭐⭐⭐)
- Sheep is needed for development cards

**[4] Move robber to (-1, 1, 0) - WHEAT 9:**
- RED has 2 buildings (city at node 4, settlement at node 17)
- Value to RED: HIGH (9 is productive at two⭐⭐)
- Wheat is crucial for cities and development cards

**[5] Move robber to (1, 0, -1) - BRICK 3:**
- RED has 1 settlement (node 6)
- Value to RED: LOW-MEDIUM (3 is less productive at one⭐)
- But brick is valuable for road building to maintain longest road

## Strategic Assessment:

RED is at 8 VP (with longest road) and needs only 2 more VP to win. I must disrupt their most likely path to victory. They may be planning to:
1. Upgrade a settlement to a city (+1 VP)
2. Build another settlement (+1 VP)
3. Maintain longest road (+2 VP, already counted)

Looking at RED's current position, blocking their access to wheat (for cities) or brick/wood (for roads) would be most impactful. Among these options, the SHEEP 8 hex is their most productive resource, followed by WHEAT 9.

<plan>
1. Disrupt RED's high-production resources to slow their progress
2. Build a road to extend my network where I can challenge longest road
3. Use my wood/brick to expand toward new settlement locations
4. Prioritize city upgrades to increase my resource production
5. Watch for development card opportunities to secure largest army
</plan>

Since RED is 3 VP ahead and likely holding resources for their next build, I need to make the most disruptive move. The SHEEP 8 hex is their highest production hex with three stars, and RED has multiple buildings there. Blocking it would significantly hamper their development card strategy.

# Game Analysis for Settlers of Catan

I'll analyze the current game state and determine the best action to take.

## Current Game Status
- RED has 8/10 victory points (4 settlements, 1 city, longest road bonus)
- I (BLUE) have 5/10 victory points (1 settlement, 2 cities)
- RED is close to winning, just needing 2 more points
- I'm 5 points away from victory

## My Resources
- 2 WOOD, 2 BRICK, 3 WHEAT, 5 ORE
- No development cards
- I've played 1 KNIGHT and 1 MONOPOLY card already

## Available Actions
0. End turn
1. Upgrade settlement at node 19 to city (Cost: 2 WHEAT, 3 ORE)
2-5. Various maritime trades using ORE

## Strategic Analysis

The most significant action available is upgrading my settlement at node 19 to a city:
- Cost: 2 WHEAT, 3 ORE - I have exactly these resources
- Benefits:
  1. Increases my victory points from 5 to 6
  2. Doubles my production on the 5-value ore hex
  3. Closes the gap with RED who has 8 points

If I don't upgrade to a city, my only other options are maritime trading (poor value) or ending my turn without doing anything.

Node 19 is on a 5-value ore hex, which is already one of my best production spots. Doubling this production will accelerate my ability to build more cities in the future, as ore is crucial for city building.

RED is 2 points away from winning, so I need to accelerate my point accumulation. This city upgrade is the most efficient way to do this with my current resources.

<plan>
1. Upgrade settlement at node 19 to a city now
2. Continue focusing on city upgrades since I now have good ore production
3. Look for opportunities to challenge longest road in future turns
4. Consider development cards to potentially secure largest army
5. Disrupt RED's high-production resources with robber when possible
</plan>

Therefore, the optimal action is to upgrade my settlement to a city.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist whose primary goal is to defeat the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (HIGHEST PRIORITY):
- Target 6 & 8 numbered hexes at all costs - these are the most productive numbers
- Prioritize ore and wheat hexes for your settlements - they enable cities and development cards
- Position yourself on at least one good brick and wood hex to enable early expansion
- Aim to cover ALL five resources with your two settlements combined
- Try to place on intersections with 3 productive hexes rather than 2
- Evaluate probability dots (not just numbers) - more dots mean more frequent production
- Place settlements with clear expansion paths that won't be easily blocked
- Avoid placing where you'll be immediately cut off by the opponent
- Position roads toward your next planned settlement location
- Consider distance to valuable ports (especially 2:1 ports matching your abundant resources)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-8):
- Build at least one new road and one new settlement ASAP
- Focus on securing access to any missing resources through expansion
- Establish access to a port if you're lacking a key resource
- Prevent the opponent from cutting off your expansion path
- Only purchase development cards if excess resources available or for immediate victory
- Expand toward high-value hexes the opponent doesn't yet control

MID-GAME RESOURCE MANAGEMENT (TURNS 9-20):
- Target 3 cities minimum (worth 6 VP) - upgrade most productive settlements first
- Maintain 1 road per every 2 settlements for flexible expansion
- Always build a settlement when you have the resources (more production points)
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each build (cities give best long-term return)
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1 or better) to maintain resource balance
- Keep at least one viable road-building path open at all times
- If blocked from expansion, shift to city upgrades and development cards

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Development cards should supplement your expansion, not replace it
- Prioritize using Knight cards to protect your best hexes from the robber
- Save Knights when you're ahead to counter the opponent's robber placements
- Only buy development cards when you:
  1. Have excess sheep/wheat/ore but lack wood/brick for expansion
  2. Are close to securing largest army
  3. Need a specific card type (Road Building to break through a blockade)
- Use Road Building cards to save brick/wood and create surprise expansion paths
- Time Monopoly cards to capture opponent's stockpile after high-producing rolls
- Use Year of Plenty to complete crucial builds when short on specific resources

ROBBER PLACEMENT:
- Always target the opponent's highest-producing hex (high number + settlement/city)
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat hexes to slow city development
- If opponent relies heavily on one resource, target that resource's hexes
- Never place the robber on your own high-production hexes
- When stealing, target resources you immediately need for your next build

VICTORY PATH PLANNING:
- Target resource independence with at least one settlement/city on each resource
- Minimum viable infrastructure: 3-4 settlements total, with 2-3 upgraded to cities
- Calculate multiple paths to 10 VP and pursue the fastest:
  Path 1: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP)
  Path 2: 4 cities (8 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP)
  Path 3: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 victory point card
- Always track your direct path to 10 VP and focus on those builds
- Prioritize visible points (settlements/cities) over speculative development cards
- Switch paths if the opponent blocks your primary victory path
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Accept trades only when they enable an immediate, crucial build
- Never make trades that allow opponent to build a settlement or city immediately
- Trade away excess resources when at risk for robber (7+ cards)
- Calculate the production value of each settlement location before deciding to build
- When trading with ports, plan sequences that convert unwanted resources into needed ones

DETAILED DECISION FRAMEWORK:
1. Does this move bring me closer to 10 victory points?
2. Does this move increase my production capacity more than alternative builds?
3. Does this move protect me from being blocked or cut off?
4. Does this move position me for strongest expansion in next 2-3 turns?
5. Is this the most efficient use of my current resources?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 135 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Upgrade settlement at node 19 to a city now
2. Continue focusing on city upgrades since I now have good ore production
3. Look for opportunities to challenge longest road in future turns
4. Consider development cards to potentially secure largest army
5. Disrupt RED's high-production resources with robber when possible
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.

# Game State Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state:

**Victory Points:**
- Red: 8/10 VP (4 settlements + 1 city + longest road)
- Blue (me): 6/10 VP (3 cities)

**My Resources:**
- 2 Wood
- 2 Brick 
- 5 Wheat
- 2 Ore

**Critical Observations:**
- Red is 2 VP ahead and only needs 2 more VP to win
- Red has the longest road (10 segments vs my 7)
- I have 3 cities already (6 VP)
- I need 4 more VP to win

## Available Options

Looking at my available actions:
- [0] End my turn
- [1-4] Trade wheat (4:1) for various resources

I can't build anything right now with my current resources. I'm lacking resources to build:
- Settlement: Need 1 wheat, 1 sheep (have no sheep)
- City: Need 3 ore, 2 wheat (only have 2 ore)
- Road: Have enough (2 wood, 2 brick)
- Dev Card: Need 1 ore, 1 wheat, 1 sheep (have no sheep)

## Strategic Assessment

Red is dangerously close to winning at 8 VP. My current plan mentioned upgrading a settlement at node 19 to a city, but I just checked and node 19 already is a city. My resource position isn't ideal for immediate building.

Let's think about what I need to focus on:
1. I need 4 more VP
2. Options: build 4 settlements, 2 cities, or a combination with longest road/largest army
3. Red already has longest road and likely has resources since they have 10 hidden cards
4. I need to improve my resource position

<plan>
1. Seek to build settlements to increase my victory points and production
2. Consider development cards for potential largest army (+2 VP)
3. Target building roads to challenge longest road in future turns
4. Focus on getting sheep which I'm lacking completely
</plan>

Given my current resources, I can't build anything immediately useful. Trading 4 wheat for 1 sheep would allow me to at least build a development card on a future turn (if I have enough ore and wheat remaining).

However, I should be strategic with my resources. Trading at a 4:1 ratio isn't efficient, and I should probably save my resources for future turns when I might have better trading options or direct resource production.

Based on this analysis, I should:

   - 4 wood, 4 brick, 5 wheat, 2 ore, 0 sheep
   - I have no development cards

3. **Critical Observations**:
   - RED is at 9 VP and likely to win next turn
   - I need to accelerate my path to 10 VP
   - I'm lacking sheep completely, which is needed for development cards
   - I have good wood/brick combinations for roads
   - I have good wheat/ore for city upgrades but no settlements to upgrade

## Strategic Considerations

**Victory Path Analysis**:
- I need 4 more VP to win
- Potential sources:
  - Building settlements (I have wood/brick for 2 settlements = 2 VP)
  - Development cards (need sheep)
  - Challenging longest road (would need at least 4 more road segments)

**Emergency Response Required**:
RED is at 9 VP, meaning they could win on their next turn. I must:
1. Make progress toward victory
2. Acquire sheep to allow development card purchases (potential VP or Knights)

<plan>
1. Trade for sheep immediately to enable development card purchases
2. Build at least one new settlement this turn if possible
3. Continue building roads toward potential settlement locations
4. Focus on development cards as a path to victory (knights to get largest army)
</plan>

## Action Evaluation

The only actions available are maritime trades or ending my turn. Since RED is about to win, I need sheep to buy development cards which might yield victory point cards or knights.

Looking at the trading options:
- Option #11: Give 4 wood for 1 sheep
- Option #12: Give 4 brick for 1 sheep

Since I have equal amounts of wood and brick (4 each), either trade would work. However, I should preserve resources I'll need next for settlements and roads.

After trading for sheep, I'll have:
- If trade wood: 0 wood, 4 brick, 5 wheat, 2 ore, 1 sheep
- If trade brick: 4 wood, 0 brick, 5 wheat, 2 ore, 1 sheep

Since both wood and brick are equally important for settlements and roads, and I have equal amounts, I'll choose to trade wood since wood is listed first in the available actions.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist whose primary goal is to defeat the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (HIGHEST PRIORITY):
- Target 6 & 8 numbered hexes at all costs - these are the most productive numbers
- Prioritize ore and wheat hexes for your settlements - they enable cities and development cards
- Position yourself on at least one good brick and wood hex to enable early expansion
- Aim to cover ALL five resources with your two settlements combined
- Try to place on intersections with 3 productive hexes rather than 2
- Evaluate probability dots (not just numbers) - more dots mean more frequent production
- Place settlements with clear expansion paths that won't be easily blocked
- Avoid placing where you'll be immediately cut off by the opponent
- Position roads toward your next planned settlement location
- Consider distance to valuable ports (especially 2:1 ports matching your abundant resources)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-8):
- Build at least one new road and one new settlement ASAP
- Focus on securing access to any missing resources through expansion
- Establish access to a port if you're lacking a key resource
- Prevent the opponent from cutting off your expansion path
- Only purchase development cards if excess resources available or for immediate victory
- Expand toward high-value hexes the opponent doesn't yet control

MID-GAME RESOURCE MANAGEMENT (TURNS 9-20):
- Target 3 cities minimum (worth 6 VP) - upgrade most productive settlements first
- Maintain 1 road per every 2 settlements for flexible expansion
- Always build a settlement when you have the resources (more production points)
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each build (cities give best long-term return)
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1 or better) to maintain resource balance
- Keep at least one viable road-building path open at all times
- If blocked from expansion, shift to city upgrades and development cards

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Development cards should supplement your expansion, not replace it
- Prioritize using Knight cards to protect your best hexes from the robber
- Save Knights when you're ahead to counter the opponent's robber placements
- Only buy development cards when you:
  1. Have excess sheep/wheat/ore but lack wood/brick for expansion
  2. Are close to securing largest army
  3. Need a specific card type (Road Building to break through a blockade)
- Use Road Building cards to save brick/wood and create surprise expansion paths
- Time Monopoly cards to capture opponent's stockpile after high-producing rolls
- Use Year of Plenty to complete crucial builds when short on specific resources

ROBBER PLACEMENT:
- Always target the opponent's highest-producing hex (high number + settlement/city)
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat hexes to slow city development
- If opponent relies heavily on one resource, target that resource's hexes
- Never place the robber on your own high-production hexes
- When stealing, target resources you immediately need for your next build

VICTORY PATH PLANNING:
- Target resource independence with at least one settlement/city on each resource
- Minimum viable infrastructure: 3-4 settlements total, with 2-3 upgraded to cities
- Calculate multiple paths to 10 VP and pursue the fastest:
  Path 1: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP)
  Path 2: 4 cities (8 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP)
  Path 3: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 victory point card
- Always track your direct path to 10 VP and focus on those builds
- Prioritize visible points (settlements/cities) over speculative development cards
- Switch paths if the opponent blocks your primary victory path
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Accept trades only when they enable an immediate, crucial build
- Never make trades that allow opponent to build a settlement or city immediately
- Trade away excess resources when at risk for robber (7+ cards)
- Calculate the production value of each settlement location before deciding to build
- When trading with ports, plan sequences that convert unwanted resources into needed ones

DETAILED DECISION FRAMEWORK:
1. Does this move bring me closer to 10 victory points?
2. Does this move increase my production capacity more than alternative builds?
3. Does this move protect me from being blocked or cut off?
4. Does this move position me for strongest expansion in next 2-3 turns?
5. Is this the most efficient use of my current resources?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game State Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state and make the best strategic decision:

## Victory Point Situation
- RED: 9/10 VP (5 settlements = 5 VP, 1 city = 2 VP, longest road = 2 VP)
- BLUE (me): 6/10 VP (3 cities = 6 VP)
- RED is only 1 point away from winning, making this a critical turn

## My Resources
- 4 🧱BRICK, 1 🐑SHEEP, 5 🌾WHEAT, 2 ⛏️ORE
- Missing: 🌲WOOD (needed for settlements and roads)

## Available Actions
1. Buy development card (1 🐑SHEEP, 1 🌾WHEAT, 1 ⛏️ORE)
2-9. Various maritime trades (mostly giving away 🌾WHEAT or 🧱BRICK)

## Strategic Analysis

The situation is critical because RED is at 9/10 VP. I need to gain victory points quickly while trying to block RED if possible.

Looking at my resources, I can't build a settlement directly (need wood + brick + wheat + sheep). I can't build a city (need 3 ore + 2 wheat) because I only have 2 ore. I don't have enough roads built (7) to challenge RED's longest road (10).

The most direct path to victory:
1. Buy development cards hoping for Victory Point cards or Knights (to get Largest Army = 2 VP)
2. Build settlements in strategic locations (need to trade for wood first)
3. Upgrade a settlement to a city (need 1 more ore)

Since RED is 1 point away from winning, my priority is gaining points as quickly as possible. A development card could be an immediate Victory Point card or a Knight that helps me work toward Largest Army.

<plan>
1. Buy development cards immediately to seek Victory Point cards or Knights
2. If I get a resource-providing development card (Year of Plenty), use it to get wood for expansion
3. Trade for wood next turn to build new settlements
4. Focus on getting enough resources to build at least one more city
</plan>

Given the urgent situation with RED at 9 VP, I'll purchase a development card, which gives me the best immediate chance at gaining or setting up victory points.

# Game Analysis

Let me assess the current game state and available options thoroughly:

## Victory Point Status:
- RED: 9/10 VP (5 settlements × 1 VP + 1 city × 2 VP + Longest Road bonus × 2 VP = 9 VP)
- BLUE (me): 6/10 VP (0 settlements × 1 VP + 3 cities × 2 VP = 6 VP)

## My Resources:
- 4 BRICK
- 4 WHEAT
- 1 ORE
- Development cards: 1 KNIGHT

## Strategic Assessment:
1. RED is only 1 VP away from winning
2. I need 4 more VP to reach 10
3. I can potentially gain VP through:
   - Building settlements (+1 VP each)
   - Building cities (+1 VP from upgrading a settlement)
   - Getting Largest Army (+2 VP with 3+ knights)
   - Taking Longest Road from RED (+2 VP shift: -2 for RED, +2 for me)

## Key Problems:
1. I have no settlements to upgrade to cities
2. I can't build a settlement without WOOD and SHEEP
3. I need more knights for Largest Army (currently have 1 played, 1 in hand)
4. I need significantly longer roads to challenge Longest Road

## Evaluation of Available Actions:

The available actions are:
- End turn [0]
- Various maritime trades [1-8]

Looking at the maritime trades, my best options would be to trade WHEAT or BRICK for WOOD or SHEEP to work toward a settlement. However, I need both WOOD and SHEEP, and the 4:1 trade is very inefficient.

Since RED is at 9 VP, they are likely to win on their next turn. My priority should be to either:
1. Set up for a big move next turn after collecting more resources
2. If possible, disrupt RED's winning move

Given my limited options this turn, I should focus on position for my next turn. I will end my turn [0] and hope to get better resources on the next round of dice rolls.

<plan>
1. End turn and collect resources on next roll
2. Save my knight card to move the robber away from my production hexes if needed
3. On next turn, aim to trade for WOOD and SHEEP to build a settlement
4. Long-term, work toward Largest Army (+2 VP) by buying development cards
5. Build roads to interrupt RED's road network if possible
</plan>

Based on this analysis, I will end my turn:

- Only buy development cards when you:
  1. Have excess sheep/wheat/ore but lack wood/brick for expansion
  2. Are close to securing largest army
  3. Need a specific card type (Road Building to break through a blockade)
- Use Road Building cards to save brick/wood and create surprise expansion paths
- Time Monopoly cards to capture opponent's stockpile after high-producing rolls
- Use Year of Plenty to complete crucial builds when short on specific resources

ROBBER PLACEMENT:
- Always target the opponent's highest-producing hex (high number + settlement/city)
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat hexes to slow city development
- If opponent relies heavily on one resource, target that resource's hexes
- Never place the robber on your own high-production hexes
- When stealing, target resources you immediately need for your next build

VICTORY PATH PLANNING:
- Target resource independence with at least one settlement/city on each resource
- Minimum viable infrastructure: 3-4 settlements total, with 2-3 upgraded to cities
- Calculate multiple paths to 10 VP and pursue the fastest:
  Path 1: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP)
  Path 2: 4 cities (8 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP)
  Path 3: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 victory point card
- Always track your direct path to 10 VP and focus on those builds
- Prioritize visible points (settlements/cities) over speculative development cards
- Switch paths if the opponent blocks your primary victory path
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Accept trades only when they enable an immediate, crucial build
- Never make trades that allow opponent to build a settlement or city immediately
- Trade away excess resources when at risk for robber (7+ cards)
- Calculate the production value of each settlement location before deciding to build
- When trading with ports, plan sequences that convert unwanted resources into needed ones

DETAILED DECISION FRAMEWORK:
1. Does this move bring me closer to 10 victory points?
2. Does this move increase my production capacity more than alternative builds?
3. Does this move protect me from being blocked or cut off?
4. Does this move position me for strongest expansion in next 2-3 turns?
5. Is this the most efficient use of my current resources?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 139 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. End turn and collect resources on next roll
2. Save my knight card to move the robber away from my production hexes if needed
3. On next turn, aim to trade for WOOD and SHEEP to build a settlement
4. Long-term, work toward Largest Army (+2 VP) by buying development cards
5. Build roads to interrupt RED's road network if possible

# Game State Analysis

Let me carefully analyze the current game situation:

## Victory Points Status
- RED: 9/10 VP (very close to winning - 5 settlements, 1 city, longest road)
- BLUE (me): 6/10 VP (0 settlements, 3 cities)

## Resources & Cards
- I have: 4 🧱BRICK, 4 🌾WHEAT, 1 ⛏️ORE, 1 KNIGHT card
- I need WOOD and SHEEP to build anything currently

## Robber & Production
- Robber is on 🐑8 (-1, 0, 1) - a high-value sheep hex
- This hex is connected to RED's settlements at nodes 4 and 12
- The robber is blocking a productive resource (sheep) that I need

## Opponent Status
- RED is at 9 VP, just 1 away from winning
- RED has 7 cards in hand (hidden)
- RED has longest road (10 segments)

## Decision Analysis

I have two options:
1. Roll the dice and hope for favorable resources
2. Play my Knight card to move the robber and potentially steal a needed resource

Critical factors:
- RED is 1 VP away from winning and has 7 cards
- I need WOOD and SHEEP to build anything
- The robber is on a sheep hex (which I need)
- Moving the robber gives me a chance to steal a card and disrupt RED's production

Playing the Knight card now would:
1. Let me move the robber to a high-production hex for RED (perhaps 🌲10 or 🌾4)
2. Let me steal a resource that could be WOOD or SHEEP
3. Start building toward Largest Army (I already have 1 played)
4. Protect my own hexes from having the robber placed on them after my roll
5. Potentially disrupt RED from winning on their next turn

<plan>
1. Play Knight to move robber to RED's most productive hex (🌲10 next to their city)
2. Target stealing from RED's city at node 4 to maximize chance of getting a valuable resource
3. On my next roll, aim to trade my surplus BRICK/WHEAT to get WOOD/SHEEP for settlement 
4. Continue buying development cards when possible to pursue Largest Army
5. Build settlement when resources available to increase production
</plan>

Given RED is at 9 VP and likely to win soon, playing defensively and disrupting their production while potentially gaining a resource I need is the optimal move.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist whose primary goal is to defeat the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (HIGHEST PRIORITY):
- Target 6 & 8 numbered hexes at all costs - these are the most productive numbers
- Prioritize ore and wheat hexes for your settlements - they enable cities and development cards
- Position yourself on at least one good brick and wood hex to enable early expansion
- Aim to cover ALL five resources with your two settlements combined
- Try to place on intersections with 3 productive hexes rather than 2
- Evaluate probability dots (not just numbers) - more dots mean more frequent production
- Place settlements with clear expansion paths that won't be easily blocked
- Avoid placing where you'll be immediately cut off by the opponent
- Position roads toward your next planned settlement location
- Consider distance to valuable ports (especially 2:1 ports matching your abundant resources)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-8):
- Build at least one new road and one new settlement ASAP
- Focus on securing access to any missing resources through expansion
- Establish access to a port if you're lacking a key resource
- Prevent the opponent from cutting off your expansion path
- Only purchase development cards if excess resources available or for immediate victory
- Expand toward high-value hexes the opponent doesn't yet control

MID-GAME RESOURCE MANAGEMENT (TURNS 9-20):
- Target 3 cities minimum (worth 6 VP) - upgrade most productive settlements first
- Maintain 1 road per every 2 settlements for flexible expansion
- Always build a settlement when you have the resources (more production points)
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each build (cities give best long-term return)
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1 or better) to maintain resource balance
- Keep at least one viable road-building path open at all times
- If blocked from expansion, shift to city upgrades and development cards

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Development cards should supplement your expansion, not replace it
- Prioritize using Knight cards to protect your best hexes from the robber
- Save Knights when you're ahead to counter the opponent's robber placements
- Only buy development cards when you:
  1. Have excess sheep/wheat/ore but lack wood/brick for expansion
  2. Are close to securing largest army
  3. Need a specific card type (Road Building to break through a blockade)
- Use Road Building cards to save brick/wood and create surprise expansion paths

- Use Year of Plenty to complete crucial builds when short on specific resources

ROBBER PLACEMENT:
- Always target the opponent's highest-producing hex (high number + settlement/city)

  Path 2: 4 cities (8 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP)
  Path 3: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 victory point card
- Always track your direct path to 10 VP and focus on those builds
- Prioritize visible points (settlements/cities) over speculative development cards
- Switch paths if the opponent blocks your primary victory path
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

# Analysis of Robber Placement Options

Let me analyze the available options for robber placement to maximize my strategic advantage against RED, who is dangerously close to winning with 9/10 victory points.

## Option Analysis:

**[0] Move robber to (0, 0, 0) and steal from RED**
- This is the 🌲10 hex
- This is a highly productive hex (rare number with 3 dots ⭐)
- RED has a city at node 4 and a settlement at node 2 connected to this hex
- This would block significant wood production for RED
- Wood is critical for settlements and roads, which RED might need for their final point

**[1] Move robber to (1, -1, 0) and steal from RED**
- This is the 🌾4 hex
- Lower productivity number (only 1 dot ⭐)
- RED has settlements at nodes 2, 6, and 8 connected to this hex
- Less impactful blockage

**[2] Move robber to (0, -1, 1) and steal from RED**
- This is a 🏜️ desert hex 
- No resource production to block
- Not a strategic choice

**[3] Move robber to (-1, 1, 0) and steal from RED**
- This is the 🌾9 hex
- Good productivity (2 dots ⭐⭐)
- RED has a city at node 4 and a settlement at node 17 connected to this hex
- This would block wheat production for RED
- Wheat is critical for cities and development cards

**[4] Move robber to (0, 1, -1)**
- This is the ⛏️5 hex
- Good productivity (2 dots ⭐⭐)
- Only I have buildings here (cities at nodes 0, 16, and 19)
- This would hurt MY production, not RED's
- Definitely not a good choice

**[5] Move robber to (1, 0, -1) and steal from RED**
- This is the 🧱3 hex
- Lower productivity number (only 1 dot ⭐)
- RED has a settlement at node 6
- Less impactful blockage

## Strategic Considerations:
1. RED is at 9 VP, just 1 VP away from winning
2. RED likely needs to build either a city, buy a victory point card, or find another way to get that last point
3. Blocking their most valuable resources is crucial
4. The two most valuable options are clearly 0 and 3 (🌲10 and 🌾9)

## Final Decision:
Option [0] is optimal because:
- It blocks a 10 number tile (highest production frequency besides 6/8)
- RED has both a city and settlement on this hex, making it their most productive wood source
- Wood is critical for RED to build more roads/settlements
- At 9 VP with longest road, RED is most likely to win by building another settlement, which requires wood

<plan>
1. Move robber to RED's 🌲10 hex to block their wood production and steal a resource
2. Continue accumulating resources for development cards to pursue Largest Army (need 1 more Knight)
3. Consider building a settlement at a strategic location to increase production
4. Watch for opportunity to break RED's longest road if possible
5. Maintain defensive posture until I can close the VP gap

# Game Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state:

## Victory Points
- RED: 9/10 VPs (5 settlements, 1 city, longest road +2 VP)
- BLUE (me): 6/10 VPs (0 settlements, 3 cities)
- RED is very close to winning - just needs 1 more VP

## Resources
- I have: 5 🧱BRICK, 4 🌾WHEAT, 1 ⛏️ORE
- RED has 9 hidden cards

## Current Board State
- The robber is on 🌲10 (0, 0, 0)
- This is already blocking RED's wood production (they have buildings at nodes 2 and 4 that produce from this hex)
- RED has longest road with 10 segments

## Possible Actions
I can either end my turn or make maritime trades. I don't have the resources to build anything significant right now.

## Strategic Considerations
1. RED is one point away from winning
2. I need to increase my production and block RED wherever possible
3. Since the robber is already on RED's 🌲10 hex, I'm already blocking their wood production
4. My current resources don't allow for building a settlement or city
5. Development cards could be crucial, but I need more resources (especially sheep)
6. RED already has longest road secured with 10 segments

<plan>
1. End turn to maintain the robber's position on RED's 🌲10 hex
2. On future turns, aim to acquire sheep to buy development cards
3. Target getting Largest Army (need 1 more Knight)
4. Look for opportunities to build a settlement to increase production
5. Continue defensive posture until I can close the VP gap
</plan>

Currently, I don't have the right resources to build anything significant. Making any of the port trades would be inefficient as they're all 4:1 trades, and none would enable me to immediately build something valuable. Since the robber is already in an optimal position (blocking RED's wood production on the 10 hex), my best move is to end my turn and hope for better dice rolls.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist whose primary goal is to defeat the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (HIGHEST PRIORITY):
- Target 6 & 8 numbered hexes at all costs - these are the most productive numbers
- Prioritize ore and wheat hexes for your settlements - they enable cities and development cards
- Position yourself on at least one good brick and wood hex to enable early expansion
- Aim to cover ALL five resources with your two settlements combined
- Try to place on intersections with 3 productive hexes rather than 2
- Evaluate probability dots (not just numbers) - more dots mean more frequent production
- Place settlements with clear expansion paths that won't be easily blocked
- Avoid placing where you'll be immediately cut off by the opponent
- Position roads toward your next planned settlement location
- Consider distance to valuable ports (especially 2:1 ports matching your abundant resources)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-8):
- Build at least one new road and one new settlement ASAP
- Focus on securing access to any missing resources through expansion
- Establish access to a port if you're lacking a key resource
- Prevent the opponent from cutting off your expansion path
- Only purchase development cards if excess resources available or for immediate victory
- Expand toward high-value hexes the opponent doesn't yet control

MID-GAME RESOURCE MANAGEMENT (TURNS 9-20):
- Target 3 cities minimum (worth 6 VP) - upgrade most productive settlements first
- Maintain 1 road per every 2 settlements for flexible expansion
- Always build a settlement when you have the resources (more production points)
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each build (cities give best long-term return)
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1 or better) to maintain resource balance
- Keep at least one viable road-building path open at all times
- If blocked from expansion, shift to city upgrades and development cards

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Development cards should supplement your expansion, not replace it
- Prioritize using Knight cards to protect your best hexes from the robber
- Save Knights when you're ahead to counter the opponent's robber placements
- Only buy development cards when you:
  1. Have excess sheep/wheat/ore but lack wood/brick for expansion
  2. Are close to securing largest army
  3. Need a specific card type (Road Building to break through a blockade)
- Use Road Building cards to save brick/wood and create surprise expansion paths
- Time Monopoly cards to capture opponent's stockpile after high-producing rolls
- Use Year of Plenty to complete crucial builds when short on specific resources

ROBBER PLACEMENT:
- Always target the opponent's highest-producing hex (high number + settlement/city)
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat hexes to slow city development
- If opponent relies heavily on one resource, target that resource's hexes
- Never place the robber on your own high-production hexes
- When stealing, target resources you immediately need for your next build

VICTORY PATH PLANNING:
- Target resource independence with at least one settlement/city on each resource
- Minimum viable infrastructure: 3-4 settlements total, with 2-3 upgraded to cities
- Calculate multiple paths to 10 VP and pursue the fastest:
  Path 1: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP)
  Path 2: 4 cities (8 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP)
  Path 3: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 victory point card
- Always track your direct path to 10 VP and focus on those builds
- Prioritize visible points (settlements/cities) over speculative development cards
- Switch paths if the opponent blocks your primary victory path
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Accept trades only when they enable an immediate, crucial build
- Never make trades that allow opponent to build a settlement or city immediately
- Trade away excess resources when at risk for robber (7+ cards)
- Calculate the production value of each settlement location before deciding to build
- When trading with ports, plan sequences that convert unwanted resources into needed ones

DETAILED DECISION FRAMEWORK:
1. Does this move bring me closer to 10 victory points?
2. Does this move increase my production capacity more than alternative builds?
3. Does this move protect me from being blocked or cut off?
4. Does this move position me for strongest expansion in next 2-3 turns?
5. Is this the most efficient use of my current resources?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Analyzing Move Robber Options

I need to analyze where to place the robber to maximize my strategic advantage against RED, who is dangerously close to winning with 9 VP.

Let me evaluate each option systematically:

## Option [0]: Move robber to (1, -1, 0) and steal from RED
- This is a 🌾 Wheat hex with number 4
- Affects RED's settlements at nodes 2, 6, and 8
- Would block 3 of RED's wheat production points (⭐+⭐+⭐)
- Wheat is important for both settlements and development cards

## Option [1]: Move robber to (0, -1, 1) and steal from RED
- This is a 🏜️ Desert hex
- No production value to block
- Not a strategically useful choice

## Option [2]: Move robber to (-1, 0, 1) and steal from RED
- This is a 🐑 Sheep hex with number 8
- Affects RED's city at node 4 and settlement at node 12
- Would block 4 of RED's sheep production points (⭐⭐⭐+⭐)
- Sheep is needed for development cards and settlements

## Option [3]: Move robber to (-1, 1, 0) and steal from RED
- This is a 🌾 Wheat hex with number 9
- Affects RED's city at node 4 and settlement at node 17
- Would block 4 of RED's wheat production points (⭐⭐+⭐⭐)
- Wheat is crucial for both settlements and development cards

## Option [4]: Move robber to (0, 1, -1)
- This is a ⛏️ Ore hex with number 5
- Affects my own cities at nodes 0, 16, and 19
- Would block 6 of my own ore production points (⭐⭐+⭐⭐+⭐⭐)
- This would be extremely detrimental to me

## Option [5]: Move robber to (1, 0, -1) and steal from RED
- This is a 🧱 Brick hex with number 3
- Affects RED's settlement at node 6 and my city at node 0
- Would block 1 of RED's brick production points (⭐) and 1 of my own (⭐)
- Brick is important for roads and settlements

## Strategic Considerations
1. RED is at 9 VP and needs just 1 more to win
2. Blocking RED's most productive resources is critical
3. Stealing a useful resource could be valuable
4. I should avoid hurting my own production

Based on these factors, Option [3] appears strongest - blocking RED's wheat production on the 9 hex would significantly hamper their ability to build settlements or buy development cards. This hex produces for both RED's city at node 4 and settlement at node 17, blocking a total of 4 wheat production points.

<plan>
1. Move robber to (-1, 1, 0) to block RED's 🌾9 wheat hex
2. Continue targeting development cards to gain Largest Army
3. Look for opportunities to build roads to eventually challenge Longest Road
4. Use our ore and brick advantage to build settlements when possible
5. Prevent RED from obtaining the 10th victory point at all costs

1. Buy a development card (costs 1 🐑SHEEP, 1 🌾WHEAT, 1 ⛏️ORE)
2-5. Maritime trades (giving 4 BRICK for another resource)

## Strategic Analysis

This is a critical decision point - RED is at 9 VP and needs just 1 more to win. My primary goal must be to prevent RED from winning while advancing my position.

Looking at my resources, I can afford to buy a development card. This is actually the only build action I can take with my current resources.

### Why buying a development card is optimal:
1. **Potential Knight Card**: If I get a Knight, it would be my 3rd Knight, giving me Largest Army (+2 VP), increasing my score to 8 VP.
2. **Potential Victory Point Card**: Would immediately boost me to 7 VP.
3. **Potential Monopoly/Year of Plenty**: Would help my resource situation significantly.
4. **Resource Depletion**: Spending resources means less to lose if a 7 is rolled and the robber is activated.

Trading 4 brick for another resource doesn't make strategic sense right now, as I don't have enough additional resources to make a meaningful build.

<plan>
1. Buy development card hoping for Knight to gain Largest Army (2 VP)
2. Look to build settlements at strategic locations when resources allow
3. Continue challenging for Longest Road if possible
4. Work toward 10 points through a combination of buildings and development cards
</plan>

## Decision
Buying a development card is clearly the best option as it offers multiple paths to victory and prevents me from holding excess resources.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist whose primary goal is to defeat the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (HIGHEST PRIORITY):
- Target 6 & 8 numbered hexes at all costs - these are the most productive numbers
- Prioritize ore and wheat hexes for your settlements - they enable cities and development cards
- Position yourself on at least one good brick and wood hex to enable early expansion
- Aim to cover ALL five resources with your two settlements combined
- Try to place on intersections with 3 productive hexes rather than 2
- Evaluate probability dots (not just numbers) - more dots mean more frequent production
- Place settlements with clear expansion paths that won't be easily blocked
- Avoid placing where you'll be immediately cut off by the opponent
- Position roads toward your next planned settlement location
- Consider distance to valuable ports (especially 2:1 ports matching your abundant resources)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-8):
- Build at least one new road and one new settlement ASAP
- Focus on securing access to any missing resources through expansion
- Establish access to a port if you're lacking a key resource
- Prevent the opponent from cutting off your expansion path
- Only purchase development cards if excess resources available or for immediate victory
- Expand toward high-value hexes the opponent doesn't yet control

MID-GAME RESOURCE MANAGEMENT (TURNS 9-20):
- Target 3 cities minimum (worth 6 VP) - upgrade most productive settlements first
- Maintain 1 road per every 2 settlements for flexible expansion
- Always build a settlement when you have the resources (more production points)
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each build (cities give best long-term return)
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1 or better) to maintain resource balance
- Keep at least one viable road-building path open at all times
- If blocked from expansion, shift to city upgrades and development cards

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Development cards should supplement your expansion, not replace it
- Prioritize using Knight cards to protect your best hexes from the robber
- Save Knights when you're ahead to counter the opponent's robber placements
- Only buy development cards when you:
  1. Have excess sheep/wheat/ore but lack wood/brick for expansion
  2. Are close to securing largest army
  3. Need a specific card type (Road Building to break through a blockade)
- Use Road Building cards to save brick/wood and create surprise expansion paths
- Time Monopoly cards to capture opponent's stockpile after high-producing rolls
- Use Year of Plenty to complete crucial builds when short on specific resources

ROBBER PLACEMENT:
- Always target the opponent's highest-producing hex (high number + settlement/city)
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat hexes to slow city development
- If opponent relies heavily on one resource, target that resource's hexes
- Never place the robber on your own high-production hexes
- When stealing, target resources you immediately need for your next build

VICTORY PATH PLANNING:
- Target resource independence with at least one settlement/city on each resource
- Minimum viable infrastructure: 3-4 settlements total, with 2-3 upgraded to cities
- Calculate multiple paths to 10 VP and pursue the fastest:
  Path 1: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP)
  Path 2: 4 cities (8 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP)
  Path 3: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 victory point card
- Always track your direct path to 10 VP and focus on those builds
- Prioritize visible points (settlements/cities) over speculative development cards
- Switch paths if the opponent blocks your primary victory path
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Accept trades only when they enable an immediate, crucial build
- Never make trades that allow opponent to build a settlement or city immediately
- Trade away excess resources when at risk for robber (7+ cards)
- Calculate the production value of each settlement location before deciding to build
- When trading with ports, plan sequences that convert unwanted resources into needed ones

DETAILED DECISION FRAMEWORK:
1. Does this move bring me closer to 10 victory points?
2. Does this move increase my production capacity more than alternative builds?
3. Does this move protect me from being blocked or cut off?
4. Does this move position me for strongest expansion in next 2-3 turns?
5. Is this the most efficient use of my current resources?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

❓ Select action by number (0-4):


Based on this information, which action number do you choose? Think step by step about your options, then put the final action number in a box like \boxed{1}.
RESPONSE:
I'll analyze the current game state and my available options step by step:

**Game State Assessment:**
- I have 6 VP (3 cities = 6 VP)
- Opponent has 9 VP (5 settlements = 5 VP, 1 city = 2 VP, Longest Road = 2 VP)
- My resources: 4 BRICK
- My development cards: 1 KNIGHT card
- I've already played 2 KNIGHT cards, so I have 2 toward Largest Army (need 3 total)
- Opponent is at 9 VP, just 1 away from winning

**Options Analysis:**
1. End turn [0] - This does nothing to improve my position
2. Trade options [1-4] - Trading 4 BRICK for another resource

**Victory Path Assessment:**
- Opponent needs just 1 more VP to win, making this extremely urgent
- My path to 10 VP would require:
  * Current: 6 VP from cities
  * Need 4 more VP from: settlements (1 VP each), Largest Army (2 VP), or development cards with VP
- Playing my KNIGHT would give me 3 knights total, which would earn me Largest Army (2 VP)
- If I could build a settlement, that would be another 1 VP

**Strategic Decision:**
The opponent is at 9 VP and could win on their next turn. I need to play my KNIGHT card to get Largest Army (2 VP), but I cannot do that with the current action options. I need to save my brick and wait until next turn when I hopefully can play my KNIGHT card. Then I'll need to build 2 settlements to reach 10 VP (6 from cities + 2 from Largest Army + 2 from settlements).

Trading my brick away isn't useful right now because I can't immediately build anything. I should keep my resources and end my turn.

<plan>
1. End turn to preserve resources
2. Play KNIGHT card on next turn to gain Largest Army (2 VP)
3. Focus on gathering resources to build 2 settlements (need 2 more VP)
4. Monitor opponent's movements closely to block their path to victory

# Game Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state:

**Victory Point Status:**
- RED: 9/10 VP (5 settlements, 1 city, longest road bonus)
- BLUE (me): 6/10 VP (0 settlements, 3 cities)

**Critical Observations:**
- RED is just 1 VP away from winning
- I have a KNIGHT card available to play
- I have 3 BRICK resources but nothing else
- I've already played 2 KNIGHT cards - playing a 3rd would give me Largest Army (+2 VP)
- The robber is currently on an ore hex (⛏️5), blocking one of my production sources

## Decision Analysis

**Option 0: Play Knight Card**
- Advantages:
  - I gain Largest Army (+2 VP), increasing my VP from 6 to 8
  - I can move the robber from my ore hex to disrupt RED's production
  - I can potentially steal a useful resource from RED
  - This immediate play prevents RED from potentially winning on their next turn

**Option 1: Roll the Dice**
- Advantages:
  - Could gain more resources if I roll well
- Disadvantages:
  - RED might win on their next turn if I don't act now
  - Even with new resources, I'm still several turns away from building anything significant

## Strategic Assessment

The situation is critical. RED has 9 VP and needs just 1 more to win. They likely have resources to either build another settlement or potentially buy a victory point development card. I cannot risk waiting.

Playing the Knight card immediately gives me Largest Army bonus (2 VP), bringing my total to 8 VP. This makes the race much closer at 9 VP vs 8 VP. Additionally, I can disrupt RED's production by moving the robber to their most productive hex.

<plan>
1. Play Knight card immediately to secure Largest Army (2 VP)
2. Move robber to disrupt RED's most productive hex (node 4 with the 8 sheep)
3. Try to steal a useful resource (wheat or ore ideally)
4. On future turns, use my brick plus any new resources to expand toward potential settlement locations
5. Need 2 more VP - either through 2 settlements or 1 settlement + 1 development card
</plan>

The situation is urgent and the strategic value of playing the Knight card now is overwhelming. I must act to secure Largest Army and prevent RED from winning on their next turn.

# Analyzing Robber Placement Options

Let me analyze the current game state and evaluate each robber placement option:

## Current Situation
- I have 8 VP (3 cities = 6 VP, Largest Army = 2 VP)
- RED has 9 VP (5 settlements = 5 VP, 1 city = 2 VP, Longest Road = 2 VP)
- RED is just 1 VP away from winning
- I need 2 more VP to win (likely through 2 settlements)

## Robber Placement Analysis

Let me assess each hex by its resource type, production value, and impact on RED:

[0] (0, 0, 0) - 🌲10 (Wood)
- Connected to RED buildings at nodes 2 and 4 (including a city)
- Wood is valuable for RED's expansion and maintaining longest road
- Medium-high production value (10 is rolled with probability 3/36)

[1] (1, -1, 0) - 🌾4 (Wheat)
- Connected to RED buildings at nodes 2, 6, and 8 (3 settlements)
- Wheat is critical for settlements and development cards
- Lower production value (4 is rolled with probability 3/36)

[2] (0, -1, 1) - 🏜️ (Desert)
- This is already non-productive, placing robber here is wasteful

[3] (-1, 0, 1) - 🐑8 (Sheep)
- Connected to RED buildings at nodes 4 and 12 (1 city and 1 settlement)
- High production number (8 is rolled with probability 5/36)
- Sheep is needed for settlements and development cards

[4] (-1, 1, 0) - 🌾9 (Wheat)
- Connected to RED buildings at nodes 4 and 17 (1 city and 1 settlement)
- Wheat is critical for settlements and development cards
- Good production number (9 is rolled with probability 4/36)

[5] (1, 0, -1) - 🧱3 (Brick)
- Connected to RED buildings at node 6 (1 settlement)
- Brick is essential for road building and settlements
- Lower production value (3 is rolled with probability 2/36)

## Strategic Priorities
1. Block RED's most productive resources to prevent them from getting the final VP
2. Target hexes that affect multiple RED buildings, especially cities
3. Focus on resources RED likely needs most (wheat, brick, wood for expansion)

## Decision

The best choices are:
- Option [3] (-1, 0, 1): 🐑8 - This hex has the highest production value (8 is rolled with probability 5/36) and affects both a city and settlement belonging to RED
- Option [4] (-1, 1, 0): 🌾9 - This wheat hex has good production value and also affects a city and settlement
- Option [0] (0, 0, 0): 🌲10 - Wood hex affecting city and settlement

Since RED is just 1 VP away from winning, I need to disrupt their most productive hex. The sheep hex with the 8 (option 3) is clearly RED's most productive resource generator, connecting to both a city and settlement, with the highest probability of being rolled.

<plan>
1. Move robber to (-1, 0, 1) sheep hex with number 8 to block RED's most productive resource
2. Steal a resource from RED (hoping for wheat/brick)
3. On future turns, use my brick plus any new resources to build toward new settlement locations
4. Need 2 more VP - prioritize building settlements
</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist whose primary goal is to defeat the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (HIGHEST PRIORITY):
- Target 6 & 8 numbered hexes at all costs - these are the most productive numbers
- Prioritize ore and wheat hexes for your settlements - they enable cities and development cards
- Position yourself on at least one good brick and wood hex to enable early expansion
- Aim to cover ALL five resources with your two settlements combined
- Try to place on intersections with 3 productive hexes rather than 2
- Evaluate probability dots (not just numbers) - more dots mean more frequent production
- Place settlements with clear expansion paths that won't be easily blocked
- Avoid placing where you'll be immediately cut off by the opponent
- Position roads toward your next planned settlement location
- Consider distance to valuable ports (especially 2:1 ports matching your abundant resources)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-8):
- Build at least one new road and one new settlement ASAP
- Focus on securing access to any missing resources through expansion
- Establish access to a port if you're lacking a key resource
- Prevent the opponent from cutting off your expansion path
- Only purchase development cards if excess resources available or for immediate victory
- Expand toward high-value hexes the opponent doesn't yet control

MID-GAME RESOURCE MANAGEMENT (TURNS 9-20):
- Target 3 cities minimum (worth 6 VP) - upgrade most productive settlements first
- Maintain 1 road per every 2 settlements for flexible expansion
- Always build a settlement when you have the resources (more production points)
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each build (cities give best long-term return)
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1 or better) to maintain resource balance
- Keep at least one viable road-building path open at all times
- If blocked from expansion, shift to city upgrades and development cards

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Development cards should supplement your expansion, not replace it
- Prioritize using Knight cards to protect your best hexes from the robber
- Save Knights when you're ahead to counter the opponent's robber placements
- Only buy development cards when you:
  1. Have excess sheep/wheat/ore but lack wood/brick for expansion
  2. Are close to securing largest army
  3. Need a specific card type (Road Building to break through a blockade)
- Use Road Building cards to save brick/wood and create surprise expansion paths
- Time Monopoly cards to capture opponent's stockpile after high-producing rolls
- Use Year of Plenty to complete crucial builds when short on specific resources

ROBBER PLACEMENT:
- Always target the opponent's highest-producing hex (high number + settlement/city)
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat hexes to slow city development
- If opponent relies heavily on one resource, target that resource's hexes
- Never place the robber on your own high-production hexes
- When stealing, target resources you immediately need for your next build

VICTORY PATH PLANNING:
- Target resource independence with at least one settlement/city on each resource
- Minimum viable infrastructure: 3-4 settlements total, with 2-3 upgraded to cities
- Calculate multiple paths to 10 VP and pursue the fastest:
  Path 1: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP)
  Path 2: 4 cities (8 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP)
  Path 3: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 victory point card
- Always track your direct path to 10 VP and focus on those builds
- Prioritize visible points (settlements/cities) over speculative development cards
- Switch paths if the opponent blocks your primary victory path
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Accept trades only when they enable an immediate, crucial build
- Never make trades that allow opponent to build a settlement or city immediately
- Trade away excess resources when at risk for robber (7+ cards)
- Calculate the production value of each settlement location before deciding to build
- When trading with ports, plan sequences that convert unwanted resources into needed ones

DETAILED DECISION FRAMEWORK:
1. Does this move bring me closer to 10 victory points?
2. Does this move increase my production capacity more than alternative builds?
3. Does this move protect me from being blocked or cut off?
4. Does this move position me for strongest expansion in next 2-3 turns?
5. Is this the most efficient use of my current resources?

# Game State Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state and my available options carefully:

## Current Game State
- I have 8 VP (3 cities = 6 VP + Largest Army = 2 VP)
- RED has 9 VP (5 settlements = 5 VP + 1 city = 2 VP + Longest Road = 2 VP)
- RED needs just 1 more VP to win
- I need 2 more VP to win
- My resources: 1 wood, 3 brick, 6 ore
- Robber is already on (-1, 0, 1) - the sheep hex with number 8

## Victory Path Analysis
To get 2 more VP, I need to either:
1. Build 2 settlements (+2 VP)
2. Build 1 settlement and steal Longest Road (+3 VP)
3. Buy and play development cards hoping for Victory Point cards

## Current Production Analysis
- I have good ore production (three cities on hex 5)
- The robber is already on the sheep hex, blocking RED's production
- I'm missing reliable wood, wheat and sheep production

## Available Actions Evaluation

Option 0: End Turn
- This is non-productive. I have resources I should try to use.

Options 1-4: Maritime Trades
- I have 6 ore, which allows me to make one or more 4:1 trades
- For building a settlement, I need wood + brick + wheat + sheep
- I already have 3 brick and 1 wood
- I'm missing wheat and sheep completely

The most urgent need is to convert my resources into something actionable before ending my turn. Since I need 2 more VP and settlements are the fastest path, I should prepare to build a settlement.

<plan>
1. Trade ore for resources I'm completely missing (wheat and sheep)
2. On future turns, continue building toward new settlement locations
3. Use my brick plus any new resources to build roads and settlements
4. Need 2 more VP - must prioritize building settlements
</plan>

Since I already have wood and brick, but completely lack wheat and sheep, I should trade to get one of those resources. Between wheat and sheep, wheat is generally more valuable as it's needed for both settlements and cities.

Therefore, I'll trade 4 ore for 1 wheat:

# Robber Placement Analysis

I need to carefully consider where to place the robber to maximize my chances of winning. Let me analyze all options:

## Game State Assessment
- I have 8 VP (6 from cities + 2 from largest army)
- I need 2 more VP to win, which means I need to build 2 settlements
- For a settlement I need: 1 brick, 1 wood, 1 wheat, 1 sheep
- I have: 1 wood, 3 brick, 1 wheat, 2 ore (missing sheep)
- RED player has 9 VP (is close to winning!)
- The robber is currently on (-1, 0, 1) which is a sheep hex with value 8

## Robber Placement Options

[0] Move robber to (0, 0, 0) - Wood hex with value 10
- This blocks a 10-value wood hex
- RED has 2 buildings producing from this hex (city at node 4, settlement at node 2)
- I also have production here (city at node 0)
- CONS: This would block my own wood production when I need wood

[1] Move robber to (1, -1, 0) - Wheat hex with value 4
- This blocks a 4-value wheat hex
- RED has 3 buildings producing from this (settlements at nodes 6, 2, and 8)
- Moderate impact on RED's production
- Doesn't affect my production

[2] Move robber to (0, -1, 1) - Desert
- This is a desert hex with no production
- Completely ineffective choice

[3] Move robber to (-1, 1, 0) - Wheat hex with value 9
- This blocks a 9-value wheat hex
- RED has 2 buildings producing from this (city at node 4, settlement at node 17)
- I also have production here (city at node 16)
- CONS: This would block my own wheat production when I need wheat

[4] Move robber to (0, 1, -1) - Ore hex with value 5
- This blocks a 5-value ore hex
- I have 2 cities producing from this (nodes 16, 0, and 19)
- RED has no buildings here
- CONS: This would block my own critical ore production

[5] Move robber to (1, 0, -1) - Brick hex with value 3
- This blocks a 3-value brick hex
- RED has 1 building producing from this (settlement at node 6)
- I also have production here (city at node 0)
- CONS: This would block my own brick production when I need brick

## Strategic Analysis
Since I need 2 more settlements to win, and I'm missing sheep:
1. I should avoid blocking my own resources that I need (wood, wheat, brick)
2. I should target RED's strongest production to slow them down
3. I should try to steal a resource I need (ideally sheep)

RED has buildings on every hex except the ore hex (0, 1, -1), but placing the robber there would severely hurt my own production.

Option [1] (wheat hex with value 4) affects 3 of RED's settlements without hurting my production. Although it's only a 4-value hex, RED has significant production from this hex.

<plan>
1. Block RED's wheat production to slow them down
2. Try to steal sheep from RED if possible
3. Trade for sheep on my next turn to build a settlement
4. Continue building toward new settlement locations using my brick reserves
5. Need 2 more VP - must prioritize building settlements
</plan>

Based on this analysis, I choose:

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist whose primary goal is to defeat the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (HIGHEST PRIORITY):
- Target 6 & 8 numbered hexes at all costs - these are the most productive numbers
- Prioritize ore and wheat hexes for your settlements - they enable cities and development cards
- Position yourself on at least one good brick and wood hex to enable early expansion
- Aim to cover ALL five resources with your two settlements combined
- Try to place on intersections with 3 productive hexes rather than 2
- Evaluate probability dots (not just numbers) - more dots mean more frequent production
- Place settlements with clear expansion paths that won't be easily blocked
- Avoid placing where you'll be immediately cut off by the opponent
- Position roads toward your next planned settlement location
- Consider distance to valuable ports (especially 2:1 ports matching your abundant resources)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-8):
- Build at least one new road and one new settlement ASAP
- Focus on securing access to any missing resources through expansion
- Establish access to a port if you're lacking a key resource
- Prevent the opponent from cutting off your expansion path
- Only purchase development cards if excess resources available or for immediate victory
- Expand toward high-value hexes the opponent doesn't yet control

MID-GAME RESOURCE MANAGEMENT (TURNS 9-20):
- Target 3 cities minimum (worth 6 VP) - upgrade most productive settlements first
- Maintain 1 road per every 2 settlements for flexible expansion
- Always build a settlement when you have the resources (more production points)
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each build (cities give best long-term return)
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1 or better) to maintain resource balance
- Keep at least one viable road-building path open at all times
- If blocked from expansion, shift to city upgrades and development cards

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Development cards should supplement your expansion, not replace it
- Prioritize using Knight cards to protect your best hexes from the robber
- Save Knights when you're ahead to counter the opponent's robber placements
- Only buy development cards when you:
  1. Have excess sheep/wheat/ore but lack wood/brick for expansion
  2. Are close to securing largest army
  3. Need a specific card type (Road Building to break through a blockade)
- Use Road Building cards to save brick/wood and create surprise expansion paths
- Time Monopoly cards to capture opponent's stockpile after high-producing rolls
- Use Year of Plenty to complete crucial builds when short on specific resources

ROBBER PLACEMENT:
- Always target the opponent's highest-producing hex (high number + settlement/city)
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat hexes to slow city development
- If opponent relies heavily on one resource, target that resource's hexes
- Never place the robber on your own high-production hexes
- When stealing, target resources you immediately need for your next build

VICTORY PATH PLANNING:
- Target resource independence with at least one settlement/city on each resource
- Minimum viable infrastructure: 3-4 settlements total, with 2-3 upgraded to cities
- Calculate multiple paths to 10 VP and pursue the fastest:
  Path 1: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP)
  Path 2: 4 cities (8 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP)
  Path 3: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 victory point card
- Always track your direct path to 10 VP and focus on those builds
- Prioritize visible points (settlements/cities) over speculative development cards
- Switch paths if the opponent blocks your primary victory path
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Accept trades only when they enable an immediate, crucial build
- Never make trades that allow opponent to build a settlement or city immediately
- Trade away excess resources when at risk for robber (7+ cards)
- Calculate the production value of each settlement location before deciding to build
- When trading with ports, plan sequences that convert unwanted resources into needed ones

DETAILED DECISION FRAMEWORK:
1. Does this move bring me closer to 10 victory points?
2. Does this move increase my production capacity more than alternative builds?
3. Does this move protect me from being blocked or cut off?
4. Does this move position me for strongest expansion in next 2-3 turns?
5. Is this the most efficient use of my current resources?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game State Analysis

I need to carefully review my current situation and make a strategic decision to maximize my chances of winning against RED, who is already at 9 VP and just needs 1 more to win.

## Victory Point Status
- RED: 9/10 VP (5 settlements + 1 city = 7 VP + 2 VP for longest road)
- BLUE (me): 8/10 VP (3 cities = 6 VP + 2 VP for largest army)

## My Resources
- 1 wood, 4 brick, 1 wheat, 2 ore
- No development cards

## Critical Observations
1. RED is 1 VP away from winning
2. I need 2 more VP to reach 10
3. I have 4 brick which isn't immediately useful without sufficient wood for roads/settlements

## Action Analysis:
- [0] End turn - This would waste my opportunity to optimize my resources before RED's turn
- [1] Trade 4 brick for 1 wood - I already have 1 wood; getting another wood gives me 2 wood + 1 wheat, but I'd still need sheep for a settlement
- [2] Trade 4 brick for 1 wheat - I already have 1 wheat; getting another isn't immediately useful
- [3] Trade 4 brick for 1 ore - I already have 2 ore; getting a 3rd ore doesn't help without more wheat for a city
- [4] Trade 4 brick for 1 sheep - I have no sheep; getting 1 sheep + 1 wood + 1 wheat would enable a settlement on my next turn

## Strategic Considerations
1. I need 2 more VP, which could come from:
   - 2 settlements (2 VP)
   - 1 city upgrade (1 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP)
   - Longest road (2 VP) - but RED currently has this with 10 segments vs my 7

2. The most immediate path to points would be building settlements, which require wood + brick + wheat + sheep.
   - I already have: wood (1), brick (4), wheat (1)
   - I'm missing: sheep

<plan>
1. Trade 4 brick for 1 sheep now
2. End turn
3. On next turn, use wood + brick + wheat + sheep to build a new settlement
4. Continue building roads and settlements to reach 10 VP
5. Monitor RED's progress and try to block them if possible
</plan>

The optimal action is to trade for sheep, which would allow me to build a settlement on my next turn (assuming I don't lose resources to the robber). This gets me closer to the 10 VP I need.

# Game Analysis: Turn 147

Let me carefully analyze the current game state and available actions to make the optimal decision.

## Victory Point Analysis
- RED: 9/10 VP (5 settlements + 1 city + longest road bonus)
- BLUE (me): 8/10 VP (3 cities + largest army bonus)
- RED is just 1 point away from winning

## Resource Analysis
My resources: 1 WOOD, 1 SHEEP, 1 WHEAT, 2 ORE
Bank resources: All resources available for trade

## Available Actions
- [0] End turn
- [1] Buy development card (costs: 1 SHEEP, 1 WHEAT, 1 ORE)

## Current Plan Evaluation
My current plan was:
1. Trade 4 brick for 1 sheep
2. End turn
3. Build settlement next turn

However, I notice two critical issues:
1. I don't have 4 brick to trade as stated in the plan
2. RED is at 9 VP and will likely win on their next turn

## Decision Process

First, I need to determine if buying a development card could help me:
- If I get a Victory Point card: I would have 9 VP, but still need one more to win
- If I get a Knight: I already have largest army
- If I get Road Building: Not immediately useful without brick
- If I get Year of Plenty: Could help get resources for a settlement next turn
- If I get Monopoly: Could be useful next turn depending on rolls

RED is at 9 VP and will likely win on their next turn. My priority must be to either:
1. Win this turn (not possible with current resources)
2. Block RED's win
3. Position myself to win quickly on my next turn

Since I cannot win this turn, and have limited blocking options, my best move is to maximize my chances of drawing a Victory Point card or a useful development card that could help me win on my next turn.

<plan>
1. Buy development card, hoping for a Victory Point card or Year of Plenty
2. If no VP card, plan to build a settlement on my next turn
3. Monitor RED's progress and try to use the robber to block them if possible
</plan>

Given the game state, buying a development card is my best option to potentially get a Victory Point card or other useful development card that could help me win next turn.

5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (HIGHEST PRIORITY):
- Target 6 & 8 numbered hexes at all costs - these are the most productive numbers
- Prioritize ore and wheat hexes for your settlements - they enable cities and development cards
- Position yourself on at least one good brick and wood hex to enable early expansion
- Aim to cover ALL five resources with your two settlements combined
- Try to place on intersections with 3 productive hexes rather than 2
- Evaluate probability dots (not just numbers) - more dots mean more frequent production
- Place settlements with clear expansion paths that won't be easily blocked
- Avoid placing where you'll be immediately cut off by the opponent
- Position roads toward your next planned settlement location
- Consider distance to valuable ports (especially 2:1 ports matching your abundant resources)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-8):
- Build at least one new road and one new settlement ASAP
- Focus on securing access to any missing resources through expansion
- Establish access to a port if you're lacking a key resource
- Prevent the opponent from cutting off your expansion path
- Only purchase development cards if excess resources available or for immediate victory
- Expand toward high-value hexes the opponent doesn't yet control

MID-GAME RESOURCE MANAGEMENT (TURNS 9-20):
- Target 3 cities minimum (worth 6 VP) - upgrade most productive settlements first
- Maintain 1 road per every 2 settlements for flexible expansion
- Always build a settlement when you have the resources (more production points)
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each build (cities give best long-term return)
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1 or better) to maintain resource balance
- Keep at least one viable road-building path open at all times
- If blocked from expansion, shift to city upgrades and development cards

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Development cards should supplement your expansion, not replace it
- Prioritize using Knight cards to protect your best hexes from the robber
- Save Knights when you're ahead to counter the opponent's robber placements
- Only buy development cards when you:
  1. Have excess sheep/wheat/ore but lack wood/brick for expansion
  2. Are close to securing largest army
  3. Need a specific card type (Road Building to break through a blockade)
- Use Road Building cards to save brick/wood and create surprise expansion paths
- Time Monopoly cards to capture opponent's stockpile after high-producing rolls
- Use Year of Plenty to complete crucial builds when short on specific resources

ROBBER PLACEMENT:
- Always target the opponent's highest-producing hex (high number + settlement/city)
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat hexes to slow city development
- If opponent relies heavily on one resource, target that resource's hexes
- Never place the robber on your own high-production hexes
- When stealing, target resources you immediately need for your next build

VICTORY PATH PLANNING:
- Target resource independence with at least one settlement/city on each resource
- Minimum viable infrastructure: 3-4 settlements total, with 2-3 upgraded to cities
- Calculate multiple paths to 10 VP and pursue the fastest:
  Path 1: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP)
  Path 2: 4 cities (8 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP)
  Path 3: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 victory point card
- Always track your direct path to 10 VP and focus on those builds
- Prioritize visible points (settlements/cities) over speculative development cards
- Switch paths if the opponent blocks your primary victory path
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Accept trades only when they enable an immediate, crucial build
- Never make trades that allow opponent to build a settlement or city immediately
- Trade away excess resources when at risk for robber (7+ cards)
- Calculate the production value of each settlement location before deciding to build
- When trading with ports, plan sequences that convert unwanted resources into needed ones

DETAILED DECISION FRAMEWORK:
1. Does this move bring me closer to 10 victory points?
2. Does this move increase my production capacity more than alternative builds?
3. Does this move protect me from being blocked or cut off?
4. Does this move position me for strongest expansion in next 2-3 turns?
5. Is this the most efficient use of my current resources?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Initial Placement Strategy for First Settlement

I'm choosing the optimal placement for my first settlement in Settlers of Catan. Let me analyze the board carefully:

## Resource Analysis
Looking at the available hexes:
- 🐑 Sheep: Number 6 (high frequency)
- 🌾 Wheat: Numbers 4 and 9 (medium frequency)
- 🌲 Wood: Number 10 (low-medium frequency)
- ⛏️ Ore: Number 3 (low frequency)
- 🧱 Brick: Number 5 (medium frequency)
- 🏜️ Desert with robber

## Node Analysis
Let me identify the intersections that connect to multiple productive hexes:

- Node 0: Connected to (🌾9, ⛏️3, 🧱5) - wheat, ore, brick
- Node 1: Connected to (🌾9, 🌾4, ⛏️3) - double wheat, ore
- Node 2: Connected to (🌾9, 🌾4, 🐑6) - double wheat, sheep
- Node 3: Connected to (🌾9, 🐑6, 🌲10) - wheat, sheep, wood
- Node 4: Connected to (🌾9, 🌲10, 🏜️-) - wheat, wood, desert (only 2 producing)
- Node 5: Connected to (🌾9, 🏜️-, 🧱5) - wheat, desert, brick (only 2 producing)

Evaluating further nodes...

## Strategic Decision
The most valuable spots based on my initial placement strategy are:

1. Node 3: Connects to 🌾9, 🐑6, 🌲10
   - Covers wheat, sheep, wood
   - Has number 6 (high frequency)
   - Good resource diversity
   - Numbers 6, 9, 10 provide balanced probability

2. Node 0: Connects to 🌾9, ⛏️3, 🧱5
   - Covers wheat, ore, brick
   - Critical ore access for city upgrades
   - Numbers 3, 5, 9 provide balanced probability

3. Node 2: Connects to 🌾9, 🌾4, 🐑6
   - Has number 6 (high frequency)
   - Double wheat is valuable for development cards and cities
   - Numbers 4, 6, 9 provide good probability spread

Node 3 is the optimal choice as it gives me access to three different resources including the valuable 6-numbered sheep hex, plus wood for early expansion and wheat for development. This follows my priority to target high-producing numbers (6) and ensure resource diversity.

<plan>
1. Place first settlement at Node 3 to secure wheat, sheep, and wood
2. For second settlement, target a location with ore and brick to complete all 5 resources
3. Begin early expansion toward brick and ore hexes
4. Focus on city upgrades once all resources are accessible
</plan>

# Analysis of Initial Road Placement

This is a critical moment - my first road placement after establishing my initial settlement at Node 3. This road will determine my early expansion path.

Let's examine the three options:

## Option 0: Road at edge (2, 3)
- Direction: Heading northeast toward the wheat hex (🌾4)
- Adjacent nodes to Node 2: Connects to wheat (🌾4) and sheep (🐑6)
- Future potential: Could expand toward wheat production

## Option 1: Road at edge (3, 4)
- Direction: Heading east along the bottom of wheat hex (🌾9)
- Adjacent nodes to Node 4: Connects to wheat (🌾9), wood (🌲10), and desert (🏜️)
- Future potential: Provides path toward the brick hex (🧱5)

## Option 2: Road at edge (3, 12)
- Direction: Heading southwest toward wood hex (🌲10)
- Adjacent nodes to Node 12: Connects to wheat (🌾9), sheep (🐑6), and wood (🌲10)
- Future potential: More wood production, but less resource diversity

## Strategic Analysis

My first settlement is at Node 3, which gives me access to:
- Wheat (🌾9 - good number with 2 dots)
- Sheep (🐑6 - excellent number with 3 dots)
- Wood (🌲10 - weaker number with 1 dot)

What I'm missing:
- Ore (⛏️) - critical for city upgrades
- Brick (🧱) - essential for early expansion

Looking at the board, I can see the brick hex (🧱5) is in the southeast area, and an ore hex (⛏️3) appears to be in the east. For balanced resource access, I need to expand in that direction.

<plan>
1. Build road eastward toward brick and ore hexes
2. Place second settlement at a location with ore and brick access
3. Early expansion to secure all 5 resources
4. Transition to city upgrades once resource production is stable
</plan>

Option 1 (edge 3, 4) gives me the clearest path toward the brick hex that I need for continued expansion, and potentially toward ore as well. This aligns with my goal of securing all 5 resources with my two initial settlements.

Therefore, my choice is:

# Analysis of Initial Settlement Placement Options

I'm tasked with selecting my second initial settlement. This is a critical decision that will define my entire game strategy.

## Current Game State
- I have my first settlement at node 3, producing wheat(9), sheep(6), and wood(10)
- Opponent has settlements at node 0 (wheat 9, brick 5, ore 3) and node 9 (wheat 4, sheep 6)
- I need to prioritize resources I don't yet have: ore and brick
- No ports are visible in the current board description
- Need to secure good expansion paths

## Evaluating Settlement Options

Let me analyze the node options with respect to resources, numbers, and strategic positioning:

### Option by Option Analysis:

1. Node 13: Produces wood(10) - already have this resource at my first settlement
2. Node 14: Produces wood(10) - redundant
3. Node 15: Produces wood(10) and desert hex (no production) - poor choice
4. Node 16: Connected to desert and brick(5) - only one productive hex
5. Node 22: Connected to ore(3) - low probability number
6. Node 23: Connected to ore(3) - low probability number

Node 15 is adjacent to 3 hexes - wood(10), desert, and brick(5).
Node 16 is also connected to desert and brick(5).

Looking at the overall board:
- I currently have access to wheat(9), sheep(6), and wood(10)
- I need access to brick and ore for a complete resource set
- Ideally, I want access to high-probability numbers (5,6,8,9)

The most strategically important node appears to be **node 15**, which gives me access to both wood(10) and brick(5). While I already have wood from my first settlement, having brick is crucial for early expansion. The brick hex has a good production number (5), representing a solid probability.

<plan>
1. Place second settlement at node 15 to secure brick resource
2. Prioritize early road building to expand toward ore resource
3. Target expansion to either get ore access or reach a port
4. Work toward city upgrades at my wheat-producing settlement
</plan>

This placement will secure the brick resource I need for early expansion while still having a decent number distribution (wheat 9, sheep 6, wood 10, brick 5). This will allow me to build roads and expand quickly.

\boxed{5}
========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist whose primary goal is to defeat the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (HIGHEST PRIORITY):
- Target 6 & 8 numbered hexes at all costs - these are the most productive numbers
- Prioritize ore and wheat hexes for your settlements - they enable cities and development cards
- Position yourself on at least one good brick and wood hex to enable early expansion
- Aim to cover ALL five resources with your two settlements combined
- Try to place on intersections with 3 productive hexes rather than 2
- Evaluate probability dots (not just numbers) - more dots mean more frequent production
- Place settlements with clear expansion paths that won't be easily blocked
- Avoid placing where you'll be immediately cut off by the opponent
- Position roads toward your next planned settlement location
- Consider distance to valuable ports (especially 2:1 ports matching your abundant resources)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-8):
- Build at least one new road and one new settlement ASAP
- Focus on securing access to any missing resources through expansion
- Establish access to a port if you're lacking a key resource
- Prevent the opponent from cutting off your expansion path
- Only purchase development cards if excess resources available or for immediate victory
- Expand toward high-value hexes the opponent doesn't yet control

MID-GAME RESOURCE MANAGEMENT (TURNS 9-20):
- Target 3 cities minimum (worth 6 VP) - upgrade most productive settlements first
- Maintain 1 road per every 2 settlements for flexible expansion
- Always build a settlement when you have the resources (more production points)
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each build (cities give best long-term return)
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1 or better) to maintain resource balance
- Keep at least one viable road-building path open at all times
- If blocked from expansion, shift to city upgrades and development cards

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Development cards should supplement your expansion, not replace it
- Prioritize using Knight cards to protect your best hexes from the robber
- Save Knights when you're ahead to counter the opponent's robber placements
- Only buy development cards when you:
  1. Have excess sheep/wheat/ore but lack wood/brick for expansion
  2. Are close to securing largest army
  3. Need a specific card type (Road Building to break through a blockade)
- Use Road Building cards to save brick/wood and create surprise expansion paths
- Time Monopoly cards to capture opponent's stockpile after high-producing rolls
- Use Year of Plenty to complete crucial builds when short on specific resources

ROBBER PLACEMENT:
- Always target the opponent's highest-producing hex (high number + settlement/city)
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat hexes to slow city development
- If opponent relies heavily on one resource, target that resource's hexes
- Never place the robber on your own high-production hexes
- When stealing, target resources you immediately need for your next build

VICTORY PATH PLANNING:
- Target resource independence with at least one settlement/city on each resource
- Minimum viable infrastructure: 3-4 settlements total, with 2-3 upgraded to cities
- Calculate multiple paths to 10 VP and pursue the fastest:
  Path 1: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP)
  Path 2: 4 cities (8 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP)
  Path 3: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 victory point card
- Always track your direct path to 10 VP and focus on those builds
- Prioritize visible points (settlements/cities) over speculative development cards
- Switch paths if the opponent blocks your primary victory path
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Accept trades only when they enable an immediate, crucial build
- Never make trades that allow opponent to build a settlement or city immediately
- Trade away excess resources when at risk for robber (7+ cards)
- Calculate the production value of each settlement location before deciding to build
- When trading with ports, plan sequences that convert unwanted resources into needed ones

DETAILED DECISION FRAMEWORK:
1. Does this move bring me closer to 10 victory points?
2. Does this move increase my production capacity more than alternative builds?
3. Does this move protect me from being blocked or cut off?
4. Does this move position me for strongest expansion in next 2-3 turns?
5. Is this the most efficient use of my current resources?

# Game Analysis: Initial Road Placement for Second Settlement

I need to analyze the optimal road placement for my second settlement at node 15, which is currently connected to forest (wood) with a 10 value.

## Option Analysis:

**[0] Build road at edge (15, 17)**
- Expands eastward toward the desert hex
- Desert produces nothing, limiting future settlement value
- May eventually reach the brick hex (5) which I already have limited access to

**[1] Build road at edge (4, 15)**
- This connects my two settlements directly
- Creates a safer, more protected pathway between my settlements
- But doesn't open new expansion opportunities as efficiently

**[2] Build road at edge (14, 15)**
- Expands westward toward unexplored territory
- Potentially gives access to new resource types in that direction
- Opens up multiple future expansion paths

## Strategic Considerations:

1. My settlements currently produce wood (10), wheat (9), and sheep (6)
2. I'm missing ore and have limited brick access
3. I need to expand toward new resources, particularly ore
4. Option [2] gives me the best expansion potential westward
5. This aligns with my plan to expand toward ore or reach a port

<plan>
1. Build road westward from node 15 to maximize expansion options
2. Target next settlement placement to secure ore resource access
3. Use my wheat production advantage to work toward city upgrades
4. Maintain flexible expansion paths to avoid being blocked by RED
</plan>

The westward expansion from node 15 gives me the most strategic flexibility and potentially opens access to ore, which I currently lack completely. This is critical for my city development strategy.

# Game Analysis: Robber Placement Decision

I need to decide where to place the robber to maximize my chances of winning against the AlphaBeta algorithm. Let me analyze each option carefully.

## Current Game State Assessment
- I have 2 settlements (nodes 3 and 15), producing wheat, sheep, and wood
- RED has 2 settlements (nodes 0 and 9), producing wheat, brick, ore, and sheep
- I have only 1 wood and 1 wheat in my hand
- RED has 4 hidden resource cards
- I lack access to brick and ore, which limits my expansion capability

## Robber Placement Options Analysis

Let me analyze each hex option:

**[0] Move robber to (0, 0, 0) and steal from RED**
- This is the wheat hex with number 9
- Both RED and I have settlements here
- Blocks my own production (wheat 9 - very productive)
- Not optimal as it hurts me as much as RED

**[1] Move robber to (1, -1, 0) and steal from RED**
- This is a wheat hex with number 4
- RED has a settlement here, I don't
- Blocks only RED's wheat production
- Decent option to limit RED's wheat access

**[2] Move robber to (0, -1, 1) and steal from RED**
- This is the sheep hex with number 6
- Both RED and I have settlements here
- Very productive (6 is high probability)
- Not ideal as it blocks my own major sheep production

**[3] Move robber to (-1, 0, 1)**
- This is the wood hex with number 10
- Only I have settlements here
- Would block my own wood production
- Very poor choice as it only hurts me

**[4] Move robber to (0, 1, -1) and steal from RED**
- This is the brick hex with number 5
- Only RED has a settlement here
- Blocks a key resource I don't have access to
- Very good option to limit RED's expansion capability

**[5] Move robber to (1, 0, -1) and steal from RED**
- This is the ore hex with number 3
- Only RED has a settlement here
- Blocks RED's only ore source
- Good option to limit RED's city upgrades

## Strategic Considerations

Looking at RED's resources:
- RED has access to all 5 resource types
- RED can potentially build roads, settlements, or even work toward cities
- Limiting RED's brick or ore would slow expansion and city development

Looking at my strategic needs:
- I need to steal resources I don't have (brick or ore)
- I need to block RED's most productive unique hexes

## Decision Making

The best options are [4] and [5]:
- Option [4] blocks RED's brick (5) which would slow their road and settlement expansion
- Option [5] blocks RED's ore (3) which would prevent their city development
- Brick (5) has higher probability than ore (3)
- RED may have saved these resources already, so stealing could be valuable

Between these two, I'll choose option [4] - blocking the brick hex:
1. Brick has higher production probability (5 vs 3)
2. RED needs brick for expansion which is critical in early game
3. Ore becomes more important later for cities, but brick is key right now
4. I have a chance to steal a brick which I don't have access to

<plan>
1. Block RED's brick production to slow their expansion
2. Use my wheat production advantage to trade for needed resources
3. Build road westward from node 15 to secure expansion options
4. Target next settlement placement to secure ore resource access
5. Continue building toward city upgrades for long-term advantage
</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist whose primary goal is to defeat the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (HIGHEST PRIORITY):
- Target 6 & 8 numbered hexes at all costs - these are the most productive numbers
- Prioritize ore and wheat hexes for your settlements - they enable cities and development cards
- Position yourself on at least one good brick and wood hex to enable early expansion
- Aim to cover ALL five resources with your two settlements combined
- Try to place on intersections with 3 productive hexes rather than 2
- Evaluate probability dots (not just numbers) - more dots mean more frequent production
- Place settlements with clear expansion paths that won't be easily blocked
- Avoid placing where you'll be immediately cut off by the opponent
- Position roads toward your next planned settlement location
- Consider distance to valuable ports (especially 2:1 ports matching your abundant resources)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-8):
- Build at least one new road and one new settlement ASAP
- Focus on securing access to any missing resources through expansion
- Establish access to a port if you're lacking a key resource
- Prevent the opponent from cutting off your expansion path
- Only purchase development cards if excess resources available or for immediate victory
- Expand toward high-value hexes the opponent doesn't yet control

MID-GAME RESOURCE MANAGEMENT (TURNS 9-20):
- Target 3 cities minimum (worth 6 VP) - upgrade most productive settlements first
- Maintain 1 road per every 2 settlements for flexible expansion
- Always build a settlement when you have the resources (more production points)
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each build (cities give best long-term return)
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1 or better) to maintain resource balance
- Keep at least one viable road-building path open at all times
- If blocked from expansion, shift to city upgrades and development cards

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Development cards should supplement your expansion, not replace it
- Prioritize using Knight cards to protect your best hexes from the robber
- Save Knights when you're ahead to counter the opponent's robber placements
- Only buy development cards when you:
  1. Have excess sheep/wheat/ore but lack wood/brick for expansion
  2. Are close to securing largest army
  3. Need a specific card type (Road Building to break through a blockade)
- Use Road Building cards to save brick/wood and create surprise expansion paths
- Time Monopoly cards to capture opponent's stockpile after high-producing rolls
- Use Year of Plenty to complete crucial builds when short on specific resources

ROBBER PLACEMENT:
- Always target the opponent's highest-producing hex (high number + settlement/city)
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat hexes to slow city development
- If opponent relies heavily on one resource, target that resource's hexes
- Never place the robber on your own high-production hexes
- When stealing, target resources you immediately need for your next build

VICTORY PATH PLANNING:
- Target resource independence with at least one settlement/city on each resource
- Minimum viable infrastructure: 3-4 settlements total, with 2-3 upgraded to cities
- Calculate multiple paths to 10 VP and pursue the fastest:
  Path 1: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP)
  Path 2: 4 cities (8 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP)
  Path 3: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 victory point card
- Always track your direct path to 10 VP and focus on those builds
- Prioritize visible points (settlements/cities) over speculative development cards
- Switch paths if the opponent blocks your primary victory path
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Accept trades only when they enable an immediate, crucial build
- Never make trades that allow opponent to build a settlement or city immediately
- Trade away excess resources when at risk for robber (7+ cards)
- Calculate the production value of each settlement location before deciding to build
- When trading with ports, plan sequences that convert unwanted resources into needed ones

DETAILED DECISION FRAMEWORK:
1. Does this move bring me closer to 10 victory points?
2. Does this move increase my production capacity more than alternative builds?
3. Does this move protect me from being blocked or cut off?
4. Does this move position me for strongest expansion in next 2-3 turns?
5. Is this the most efficient use of my current resources?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 8 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Block RED's brick production to slow their expansion
2. Use my wheat production advantage to trade for needed resources
3. Build road westward from node 15 to secure expansion options
4. Target next settlement placement to secure ore resource access
5. Continue building toward city upgrades for long-term advantage
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.

❓ Select action by number (0-6):


Based on this information, which action number do you choose? Think step by step about your options, then put the final action number in a box like \boxed{1}.
RESPONSE:
I'll analyze the current game state and available actions to determine the optimal move.

## Game State Analysis

1. **Resources**: I have 1 wood, 1 brick, and 1 wheat. This allows me to build exactly one road.
2. **Settlements**: I have two settlements - one at node 3 (producing wheat, sheep, wood) and one at node 15 (producing wood).
3. **Opponent Position**: RED has settlements at node 0 (producing wheat, brick, ore) and node 9 (producing wheat, sheep).
4. **Robber**: Currently on the brick hex (0,1,-1), which is RED's brick production.

## Road Building Options
I need to consider where to expand next:

- Option 1: Edge (13,14) - Extends toward the center but not in a clear expansion direction
- Option 2: Edge (15,17) - Expands westward from my settlement at node 15
- Option 3: Edge (2,3) - Would connect back to my existing settlement (not useful)
- Option 4: Edge (4,15) - Would connect my road network, but doesn't open new expansion paths
- Option 5: Edge (4,5) - Expands southeast from node 4
- Option 6: Edge (3,12) - Expands northeast from my settlement at node 3

## Strategic Considerations

1. **Resource Access**: I need to aim for ore access, which I'm currently lacking. The ore hex is at (1,0,-1) connected to nodes 0, 1, 6, 20, 22, and 23.

2. **Expansion Paths**: Looking at the map, I should consider which road gives me the best path toward:
   - Securing ore access
   - Creating expansion options toward productive hexes
   - Blocking opponent's expansion

3. **Current Production**: I have good wheat and sheep production but need ore for cities.

<plan>
1. Build road toward potential ore access
2. Focus on securing a settlement location with ore production
3. After securing all resources, start upgrading settlements to cities
4. Balance road building to maintain expansion options
5. Watch for development card opportunities once I have ore
</plan>

Based on the board layout, edge (15,17) seems most strategic as it continues my expansion westward from node 15, potentially opening paths to new resource hexes. While I don't have a complete view of the entire board, this expansion direction seems promising based on what I can see, and maintains my options.

Therefore, I choose:

# Robber Placement Analysis

I need to determine the best hex for placing the robber to maximize my chances of winning. Let me analyze the board state first.

## Game State Assessment
- I (BLUE) have 2 VP from settlements
- RED has 2 VP from settlements
- I have only 1 wheat resource
- RED has 6 hidden resources
- The robber is currently on the desert hex (-1, 1, 0)

## Opponent's Settlements and Production
- RED at node 0: produces wheat(9), brick(5), ore(3)
- RED at node 9: produces wheat(4), sheep(6)

## My Strategic Needs
Looking at my settlements:
- I produce sheep(6), wheat(9), and wood(10)
- I'm missing brick and ore production
- According to my plan, I need to build toward ore access

## Robber Placement Options
Let me evaluate each option:

[0] Move robber to (0, 0, 0) and steal from RED
- This blocks wheat(9) - a high-value hex that both RED and I produce from
- This would hurt my production significantly as wheat(9) is my best wheat source

[1] Move robber to (1, -1, 0) and steal from RED
- This blocks wheat(4) - affects RED's settlement at node 9
- This is a lower-value hex (4 is less productive than 9)

[2] Move robber to (0, -1, 1) and steal from RED
- This blocks sheep(6) - affects both RED and me
- Would hurt my production as sheep(6) is one of my key resources

[3] Move robber to (-1, 0, 1)
- This blocks wood(10) - only affects me
- Would eliminate my wood production completely
- This is a terrible choice for me

[4] Move robber to (0, 1, -1) and steal from RED
- This blocks brick(5) - only affects RED
- Blocks a relatively productive resource that I don't have access to
- RED has this resource at their settlement at node 0

[5] Move robber to (1, 0, -1) and steal from RED
- This blocks ore(3) - only affects RED
- Blocks a less productive resource (number 3)
- RED has this resource at their settlement at node 0
- Ore is crucial for city upgrades

## Decision Logic
The best robber placement should:
1. Block a resource RED has that I don't have
2. Preferably block a productive number
3. Allow me to steal a resource I need

Looking at the options, I should target either brick or ore since I don't produce these. RED has both at their settlement at node 0.

Option [4] (brick-5) is better than option [5] (ore-3) because:
- 5 is more productive than 3 (more probability dots)
- Brick is critical for early game expansion
- RED likely has brick in their 6 hidden resources since they have brick production
- Blocking brick will slow down their road/settlement expansion

<plan>
1. Block RED's brick production to slow their expansion
2. Build road toward potential ore access (node 17 to 18 direction)
3. Focus on securing a settlement location with ore production
4. After securing all resources, start upgrading settlements to cities
5. Watch for development card opportunities once I have ore
</plan>

Therefore, my best move is:

\boxed{4}

- Prevent the opponent from cutting off your expansion path
- Only purchase development cards if excess resources available or for immediate victory
- Expand toward high-value hexes the opponent doesn't yet control

MID-GAME RESOURCE MANAGEMENT (TURNS 9-20):
- Target 3 cities minimum (worth 6 VP) - upgrade most productive settlements first
- Maintain 1 road per every 2 settlements for flexible expansion
- Always build a settlement when you have the resources (more production points)
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each build (cities give best long-term return)
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1 or better) to maintain resource balance
- Keep at least one viable road-building path open at all times
- If blocked from expansion, shift to city upgrades and development cards

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Development cards should supplement your expansion, not replace it
- Prioritize using Knight cards to protect your best hexes from the robber
- Save Knights when you're ahead to counter the opponent's robber placements
- Only buy development cards when you:
  1. Have excess sheep/wheat/ore but lack wood/brick for expansion
  2. Are close to securing largest army
  3. Need a specific card type (Road Building to break through a blockade)
- Use Road Building cards to save brick/wood and create surprise expansion paths
- Time Monopoly cards to capture opponent's stockpile after high-producing rolls
- Use Year of Plenty to complete crucial builds when short on specific resources

ROBBER PLACEMENT:
- Always target the opponent's highest-producing hex (high number + settlement/city)
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat hexes to slow city development
- If opponent relies heavily on one resource, target that resource's hexes
- Never place the robber on your own high-production hexes
- When stealing, target resources you immediately need for your next build

VICTORY PATH PLANNING:
- Target resource independence with at least one settlement/city on each resource
- Minimum viable infrastructure: 3-4 settlements total, with 2-3 upgraded to cities
- Calculate multiple paths to 10 VP and pursue the fastest:
  Path 1: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP)
  Path 2: 4 cities (8 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP)
  Path 3: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 victory point card
- Always track your direct path to 10 VP and focus on those builds
- Prioritize visible points (settlements/cities) over speculative development cards
- Switch paths if the opponent blocks your primary victory path
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Accept trades only when they enable an immediate, crucial build
- Never make trades that allow opponent to build a settlement or city immediately
- Trade away excess resources when at risk for robber (7+ cards)
- Calculate the production value of each settlement location before deciding to build
- When trading with ports, plan sequences that convert unwanted resources into needed ones

DETAILED DECISION FRAMEWORK:
1. Does this move bring me closer to 10 victory points?
2. Does this move increase my production capacity more than alternative builds?
3. Does this move protect me from being blocked or cut off?
4. Does this move position me for strongest expansion in next 2-3 turns?
5. Is this the most efficient use of my current resources?

❓ Select action by number (0-5):


Based on this information, which action number do you choose? Think step by step about your options, then put the final action number in a box like \boxed{1}.
RESPONSE:
I'll carefully analyze this game state to determine the optimal robber move as a grandmaster Catan strategist.

Current Situation Assessment:
- I have 2 settlements: one at node 3 (produces wheat, sheep, and wood) and one at node 15 (produces only wood)
- My opponent (RED) has 2 settlements: node 0 (produces wheat, brick, ore) and node 9 (produces wheat, sheep)
- I currently have 2 wheat resources
- RED has 5 hidden resource cards
- The robber is currently on the brick hex (0, 1, -1), which is connected to RED's settlement at node 0

Step 1: Analyze RED's production capabilities
- RED has access to all 5 resources: wheat (4, 9), sheep (6), brick (5), and ore (3)
- Their strongest number is sheep on 6 (5 dots)
- Their brick production (5) is already blocked by the robber

Step 2: Analyze my production needs
- I'm lacking direct access to brick and ore
- I need to expand toward these resources or set up for city upgrades
- Looking at my current plan, I want to expand toward ore access

Step 3: Evaluate each robber placement option:
[0] Move to wheat hex (0, 0, 0) - blocks both RED and ME from wheat production
[1] Move to wheat hex (1, -1, 0) - blocks RED's wheat (4) production
[2] Move to sheep hex (0, -1, 1) - blocks both RED and ME from sheep production (6)
[3] Move to wood hex (-1, 0, 1) - blocks both RED and ME from wood production (10)
[4] Move to desert hex (-1, 1, 0) - wasted move as desert produces nothing
[5] Move to ore hex (1, 0, -1) - blocks RED's ore production (3)

Step 4: Strategic considerations:
- Since sheep (6) is the highest probability number on the board, blocking it would reduce both RED's and my own production
- RED already has access to all 5 resources, making them capable of any build
- I need to block resources that might enable RED to expand or upgrade
- Ore is critically important for city upgrades and development cards
- Wheat is important for settlements, cities and development cards

Step 5: Decision analysis:
- Option [4] is clearly inferior (desert produces nothing)
- Option [0] hurts my own wheat production significantly (9 is a good number)
- Option [2] blocks the highest probability hex (6), but hurts me too
- Option [3] blocks wood (10) which hurts both of us
- Option [1] blocks RED's wheat (4) without hurting me
- Option [5] blocks RED's ore (3) which is critical for city development

<plan>
1. Block RED's access to ore to prevent city development
2. Build road from node 17 to 18 to approach potential settlement locations
3. Save resources for settlement that gives me ore access
4. Once I have all resources, upgrade my best settlement to a city
5. Watch for development card opportunities when I have excess resources
</plan>

Since ore is crucial for city upgrades and development cards, and RED already has access to it while I don't, blocking RED's ore access is the optimal strategic move. This prevents RED from racing ahead with city upgrades while I work on expanding my resource access.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist whose primary goal is to defeat the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (HIGHEST PRIORITY):
- Target 6 & 8 numbered hexes at all costs - these are the most productive numbers
- Prioritize ore and wheat hexes for your settlements - they enable cities and development cards
- Position yourself on at least one good brick and wood hex to enable early expansion
- Aim to cover ALL five resources with your two settlements combined
- Try to place on intersections with 3 productive hexes rather than 2
- Evaluate probability dots (not just numbers) - more dots mean more frequent production
- Place settlements with clear expansion paths that won't be easily blocked
- Avoid placing where you'll be immediately cut off by the opponent
- Position roads toward your next planned settlement location
- Consider distance to valuable ports (especially 2:1 ports matching your abundant resources)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-8):
- Build at least one new road and one new settlement ASAP
- Focus on securing access to any missing resources through expansion
- Establish access to a port if you're lacking a key resource
- Prevent the opponent from cutting off your expansion path
- Only purchase development cards if excess resources available or for immediate victory
- Expand toward high-value hexes the opponent doesn't yet control

MID-GAME RESOURCE MANAGEMENT (TURNS 9-20):
- Target 3 cities minimum (worth 6 VP) - upgrade most productive settlements first

❓ Select action by number (0-4):


Based on this information, which action number do you choose? Think step by step about your options, then put the final action number in a box like \boxed{1}.
RESPONSE:
I'll analyze the current game state and available actions carefully to determine the best move.

## Game State Analysis

1. **Resource Assessment**:
   - I have 4 Wood, 2 Sheep, 3 Wheat
   - I'm completely missing Brick and Ore
   - I can't build anything significant with my current resources

2. **Board Position**:
   - I have settlements at nodes 3 and 15
   - I have roads extending from node 15 to node 17
   - Node 3 is my most productive settlement (9 Wheat, 6 Sheep, 10 Wood)
   - The robber is on the Ore hex (1,0,-1), affecting Red's settlement at node 0

3. **Victory Point Status**:
   - Both players have 2 VP (from 2 settlements each)
   - Neither player has longest road or largest army

4. **Available Actions**:
   - End turn [0]
   - Trade 4 Wood for various resources [1-4]

## Strategic Considerations

I want to continue my expansion but need brick to build roads or settlements. My next goal should be to establish a road from node 17 to node 18, as mentioned in my current plan. This requires brick.

Looking at the maritime trade options, I could trade 4 Wood for 1 Brick using option [2]. This would leave me with 0 Wood, 2 Sheep, 3 Wheat, and 1 Brick.

With 1 Brick, I could build one road on my next turn if I collect at least 1 Wood. Given that I have a settlement on a Wood hex (10), this is reasonably likely.

<plan>
1. Trade 4 Wood for 1 Brick now to prepare for road building
2. Build road from node 17 to 18 on next turn (when I collect more Wood)
3. Continue expanding toward ore access
4. Save resources for settlement once I reach a viable location
5. Upgrade settlements to cities once I have ore access
</plan>

The 4:1 port trade is expensive, but gaining the brick now positions me to build a road on my next turn if I collect wood. This aligns with my expansion strategy toward better resource diversity.

# Game Analysis for Settlers of Catan - Turn 30

Let me carefully analyze the current game state and my available options to determine the optimal move.

## Current Game State Assessment
- I have 2 settlements producing resources from: wheat (9), sheep (6), and wood (10)
- I currently hold: 2 wood, 1 brick, 2 sheep, 3 wheat
- My opponent has 6 hidden cards and also has 2 settlements
- The robber is on the ore hex (3), blocking a resource I don't yet have access to
- We're even at 2 victory points each, still in early game

## Resource Analysis
- I lack access to ore, which is critical for city upgrades
- I need brick and wood for expansion through roads and settlements
- I have only 1 brick available, limiting immediate road building options

## Available Actions Evaluation
Looking at my road building options:
1. Edge (13, 14): Connects back toward my settlement at node 15, not expanding
2. Edge (2, 3): Builds toward my existing settlement, not expanding outward
3. Edge (4, 15): Connects back to my settlement at node 15, not expanding
4. Edge (4, 5): Expands toward nodes 5, 16, 18 - could lead to expansion possibilities
5. Edge (3, 12): Expands toward sheep hex, but I already have sheep access
6. Edge (17, 18): Expands from my road at node 17, potentially toward ore or brick

My current plan suggested trading 4 wood for 1 brick to prepare for road building, but I only have 2 wood, making this impossible right now.

## Strategic Direction
I need to prioritize:
1. Getting access to ore (missing resource)
2. Building new settlements to increase production
3. Establishing better brick access for expansion

Looking at the board connectivity and direction of expansion, building a road at edge (17, 18) seems most promising as it continues my path toward potentially reaching ore access and new settlement locations.

However, I need to consider resource efficiency. Since I already have 1 brick and 2 wood, I can build one road immediately without trading.

<plan>
1. Build road at edge (17, 18) now using my existing resources
2. Continue expanding toward ore access with future roads
3. Save resources for settlement once I reach a viable location
4. Target 3-4 settlements before focusing on city upgrades
</plan>

After analyzing the available options, I've decided to build the road at edge (17, 18) as it advances my expansion path in a promising direction while making efficient use of my current resources.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist whose primary goal is to defeat the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (HIGHEST PRIORITY):
- Target 6 & 8 numbered hexes at all costs - these are the most productive numbers
- Prioritize ore and wheat hexes for your settlements - they enable cities and development cards
- Position yourself on at least one good brick and wood hex to enable early expansion
- Aim to cover ALL five resources with your two settlements combined
- Try to place on intersections with 3 productive hexes rather than 2
- Evaluate probability dots (not just numbers) - more dots mean more frequent production
- Place settlements with clear expansion paths that won't be easily blocked
- Avoid placing where you'll be immediately cut off by the opponent
- Position roads toward your next planned settlement location
- Consider distance to valuable ports (especially 2:1 ports matching your abundant resources)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-8):
- Build at least one new road and one new settlement ASAP
- Focus on securing access to any missing resources through expansion
- Establish access to a port if you're lacking a key resource
- Prevent the opponent from cutting off your expansion path
- Only purchase development cards if excess resources available or for immediate victory
- Expand toward high-value hexes the opponent doesn't yet control

MID-GAME RESOURCE MANAGEMENT (TURNS 9-20):
- Target 3 cities minimum (worth 6 VP) - upgrade most productive settlements first
- Maintain 1 road per every 2 settlements for flexible expansion
- Always build a settlement when you have the resources (more production points)
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each build (cities give best long-term return)
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1 or better) to maintain resource balance
- Keep at least one viable road-building path open at all times
- If blocked from expansion, shift to city upgrades and development cards

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Development cards should supplement your expansion, not replace it
- Prioritize using Knight cards to protect your best hexes from the robber
- Save Knights when you're ahead to counter the opponent's robber placements
- Only buy development cards when you:
  1. Have excess sheep/wheat/ore but lack wood/brick for expansion
  2. Are close to securing largest army
  3. Need a specific card type (Road Building to break through a blockade)
- Use Road Building cards to save brick/wood and create surprise expansion paths
- Time Monopoly cards to capture opponent's stockpile after high-producing rolls
- Use Year of Plenty to complete crucial builds when short on specific resources

ROBBER PLACEMENT:
- Always target the opponent's highest-producing hex (high number + settlement/city)
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat hexes to slow city development
- If opponent relies heavily on one resource, target that resource's hexes
- Never place the robber on your own high-production hexes
- When stealing, target resources you immediately need for your next build

VICTORY PATH PLANNING:
- Target resource independence with at least one settlement/city on each resource
- Minimum viable infrastructure: 3-4 settlements total, with 2-3 upgraded to cities
- Calculate multiple paths to 10 VP and pursue the fastest:
  Path 1: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP)
  Path 2: 4 cities (8 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP)
  Path 3: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 victory point card
- Always track your direct path to 10 VP and focus on those builds
- Prioritize visible points (settlements/cities) over speculative development cards
- Switch paths if the opponent blocks your primary victory path
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Accept trades only when they enable an immediate, crucial build
- Never make trades that allow opponent to build a settlement or city immediately
- Trade away excess resources when at risk for robber (7+ cards)
- Calculate the production value of each settlement location before deciding to build
- When trading with ports, plan sequences that convert unwanted resources into needed ones

DETAILED DECISION FRAMEWORK:
1. Does this move bring me closer to 10 victory points?
2. Does this move increase my production capacity more than alternative builds?
3. Does this move protect me from being blocked or cut off?
4. Does this move position me for strongest expansion in next 2-3 turns?
5. Is this the most efficient use of my current resources?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 34 | Player: BLUE | Action: MOVE_ROBBER

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Build road at edge (17, 18) now using my existing resources
2. Continue expanding toward ore access with future roads

# Move Robber Analysis - Turn 34

I need to analyze where to place the robber to maximize my advantage while hurting RED's position.

## Game State Assessment:
- I control two settlements (nodes 3 and 15) producing wheat, sheep, and wood
- RED has settlements at nodes 0 and 9, producing wheat, brick, ore, and sheep
- I currently have 2 sheep and 3 wheat
- My plan is to build roads and expand, which requires brick and wood

## Robber Placement Options:
[0] Move robber to (0, 0, 0) wheat hex - blocks RED's wheat production at node 0
[1] Move robber to (1, -1, 0) wheat hex - blocks RED's wheat production at node 9
[2] Move robber to (0, -1, 1) sheep hex - blocks RED's sheep at node 9 and my sheep at node 3
[3] Move robber to (-1, 0, 1) wood hex - blocks my wood production at both nodes 3 and 15
[4] Move robber to (-1, 1, 0) desert hex - no production impact
[5] Move robber to (0, 1, -1) brick hex - blocks RED's brick production at node 0

## Strategic Analysis:

Option [0] - Wheat (9): This blocks RED at node 0 but also blocks my wheat production at node 3. Since wheat has number 9 (high frequency), this would hurt both of us.

Option [1] - Wheat (4): This blocks RED's wheat at node 9, which is a low-frequency roll (4). Less impactful.

Option [2] - Sheep (6): This blocks one of the most productive hexes (6 is high frequency), but it would hurt both RED and me.

Option [3] - Wood (10): This would block my wood production completely, which I need for expansion. Absolutely avoid.

Option [4] - Desert: No impact on production, wastes the robber placement.

Option [5] - Brick (5): This blocks RED's brick production at node 0. Brick is critical for road building, which RED needs for expansion. This prevents RED from building roads to block my expansion paths.

<plan>
1. Block RED's brick production to slow their expansion
2. Continue with road building when I acquire brick/wood
3. Target settlement placement at a location with ore access
4. Save development card resources if brick/wood is still scarce
</plan>

The optimal move is to block RED's brick production, which is critical for their expansion and could prevent them from blocking my paths. I should also steal a resource from RED which might give me a resource I need.

# Game Analysis: Robber Placement Decision

I need to decide where to move the robber to maximize my strategic advantage against the RED player.

## Current Game State Analysis
- I (BLUE) have 2 VP with 2 settlements
- RED has 3 VP with 1 settlement and 1 city
- RED is ahead and has a city producing wheat, brick, and ore
- I currently have 3 sheep and 2 wheat, but lack brick, wood, and ore

## Robber Placement Options
Let me analyze each hex I could place the robber on:

[0] (0, 0, 0) - Wheat 9 - This is a high-producing hex (2 dots) connected to both my settlement at node 3 and RED's city at node 0. This would block RED's wheat production which is crucial for development cards and cities.

[1] (1, -1, 0) - Wheat 4 - This is connected to RED's settlement at node 9, but it's a low-producing hex (1 dot), so not a high-impact target.

[2] (0, -1, 1) - Sheep 6 - This is a very high-producing hex (3 dots) connected to both RED's settlement at node 9 and my settlement at node 3. Blocking this would hurt us both, but me more since this is my best sheep producer.

[3] (-1, 1, 0) - Desert - The desert produces nothing, so placing the robber here has no impact.

[4] (0, 1, -1) - Brick 5 - This is connected to RED's city at node 0. Blocking this would deny RED access to brick, which is critical for road and settlement expansion.

[5] (1, 0, -1) - Ore 3 - This is connected to RED's city at node 0. Ore is crucial for city upgrades, but this is a low-producing hex (1 dot).

## Strategic Decision
The robber should be placed to maximize damage to RED while minimizing impact on me. My priorities:

1. I want to slow RED's expansion, especially by denying brick which enables building roads and settlements
2. I need to steal a resource from RED that will help my development
3. I should target RED's highest-producing hexes when possible

The best option is to block RED's brick production at hex (0, 1, -1) by choosing option [4]. This is strategic because:
- RED likely needs brick for expansion
- The hex is connected to RED's city but not to any of my settlements
- By stopping RED's ability to build roads, I can prevent them from blocking my expansion paths
- This gives me time to gather brick/wood for my own expansion

<plan>
1. Place robber on RED's brick hex to slow their expansion
2. Continue gathering resources for road building
3. Expand toward accessible ore production
4. Build a road network that can reach at least one more productive settlement location
</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist whose primary goal is to defeat the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (HIGHEST PRIORITY):
- Target 6 & 8 numbered hexes at all costs - these are the most productive numbers
- Prioritize ore and wheat hexes for your settlements - they enable cities and development cards
- Position yourself on at least one good brick and wood hex to enable early expansion
- Aim to cover ALL five resources with your two settlements combined
- Try to place on intersections with 3 productive hexes rather than 2
- Evaluate probability dots (not just numbers) - more dots mean more frequent production
- Place settlements with clear expansion paths that won't be easily blocked
- Avoid placing where you'll be immediately cut off by the opponent
- Position roads toward your next planned settlement location
- Consider distance to valuable ports (especially 2:1 ports matching your abundant resources)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-8):
- Build at least one new road and one new settlement ASAP
- Focus on securing access to any missing resources through expansion
- Establish access to a port if you're lacking a key resource
- Prevent the opponent from cutting off your expansion path
- Only purchase development cards if excess resources available or for immediate victory
- Expand toward high-value hexes the opponent doesn't yet control

MID-GAME RESOURCE MANAGEMENT (TURNS 9-20):
- Target 3 cities minimum (worth 6 VP) - upgrade most productive settlements first
- Maintain 1 road per every 2 settlements for flexible expansion
- Always build a settlement when you have the resources (more production points)
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each build (cities give best long-term return)
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1 or better) to maintain resource balance
- Keep at least one viable road-building path open at all times
- If blocked from expansion, shift to city upgrades and development cards

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Development cards should supplement your expansion, not replace it
- Prioritize using Knight cards to protect your best hexes from the robber
- Save Knights when you're ahead to counter the opponent's robber placements
- Only buy development cards when you:
  1. Have excess sheep/wheat/ore but lack wood/brick for expansion
  2. Are close to securing largest army
  3. Need a specific card type (Road Building to break through a blockade)
- Use Road Building cards to save brick/wood and create surprise expansion paths
- Time Monopoly cards to capture opponent's stockpile after high-producing rolls
- Use Year of Plenty to complete crucial builds when short on specific resources

ROBBER PLACEMENT:
- Always target the opponent's highest-producing hex (high number + settlement/city)
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat hexes to slow city development
- If opponent relies heavily on one resource, target that resource's hexes
- Never place the robber on your own high-production hexes
- When stealing, target resources you immediately need for your next build

VICTORY PATH PLANNING:
- Target resource independence with at least one settlement/city on each resource
- Minimum viable infrastructure: 3-4 settlements total, with 2-3 upgraded to cities
- Calculate multiple paths to 10 VP and pursue the fastest:
  Path 1: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP)
  Path 2: 4 cities (8 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP)
  Path 3: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 victory point card
- Always track your direct path to 10 VP and focus on those builds
- Prioritize visible points (settlements/cities) over speculative development cards
- Switch paths if the opponent blocks your primary victory path
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Accept trades only when they enable an immediate, crucial build
- Never make trades that allow opponent to build a settlement or city immediately
- Trade away excess resources when at risk for robber (7+ cards)
- Calculate the production value of each settlement location before deciding to build
- When trading with ports, plan sequences that convert unwanted resources into needed ones

DETAILED DECISION FRAMEWORK:
1. Does this move bring me closer to 10 victory points?
2. Does this move increase my production capacity more than alternative builds?
3. Does this move protect me from being blocked or cut off?
4. Does this move position me for strongest expansion in next 2-3 turns?
5. Is this the most efficient use of my current resources?

# Game Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state and determine the best action.

## Current Game State
- I have 2 VP (2 settlements) vs RED's 4 VP (2 settlements, 1 city)
- I have 1 WOOD, 2 SHEEP, 4 WHEAT
- I need to catch up to RED who is ahead by 2 VP
- The robber is currently on desert (-1,1,0), so it's not blocking any production

## Resource Analysis
- I have good WHEAT production (node 3 with wheat 9)
- My SHEEP production is decent (node 3 with sheep 6)
- My WOOD production is limited (nodes 3 and 15 with wood 10)
- I'm lacking ORE and BRICK completely

## Available Actions
- End turn [0]
- Trade 4 WHEAT for resources [1-4]

## Strategic Considerations
I need to decide whether to:
1. Save resources for future turns
2. Trade for a needed resource

Looking at my current resources (1 WOOD, 2 SHEEP, 4 WHEAT), I don't have enough to build anything immediately:
- Settlement: Need 1 WOOD, 1 BRICK, 1 SHEEP, 1 WHEAT (missing BRICK)
- Road: Need 1 WOOD, 1 BRICK (missing BRICK)
- Development Card: Need 1 ORE, 1 SHEEP, 1 WHEAT (missing ORE)
- City: Need 2 WHEAT, 3 ORE (missing all ORE)

I could trade 4 WHEAT for 1 BRICK or 1 ORE, but that would leave me with only limited resources. 

<plan>
1. Save resources this turn to maintain flexibility
2. Target acquiring BRICK next through production or better trading
3. Focus on road building to expand to new settlement locations
4. First expansion target should be toward ORE production
5. Prioritize city upgrades once expansion path is secured
</plan>

Since I can't complete any build action this turn even with trading, and trading at 4:1 is inefficient, the best option is to save my resources for future opportunities.

# Game Analysis for Turn 64

I'll evaluate the current game state and available options to determine the optimal move.

## Current Game State
- I have 2 VP, opponent has 4 VP (they're ahead)
- My resources: 1 🌲WOOD, 2 🐑SHEEP, 4 🌾WHEAT
- I need more BRICK to build roads and expand
- The robber is blocking my 🌲WOOD production on the 10 hex
- Opponent has 8 cards (at risk of losing half if a 7 is rolled)

## My Production Capabilities
- Strong wheat production (9 on settlement)
- Decent sheep production (6 on settlement)
- Limited wood production (10 on both settlements, but currently blocked by robber)
- No brick or ore production

## Available Actions Analysis
0. End Turn - I have resources that could potentially be used
1-4. Trading options - I can trade 4 WHEAT for any resource

Since I have 4 WHEAT, I could trade for a needed resource. Let's evaluate what I need most:
- BRICK: Would enable road building, crucial for expansion
- ORE: Needed for city upgrades, but I'm not close to having enough resources for a city
- WOOD: I already have 1, getting another would not complete any build yet
- SHEEP: I already have 2, getting another would not complete any build

## Strategic Priority
Looking at the board, my main weakness is lack of BRICK production. I need to expand my network to gain access to more resources, particularly ORE and BRICK. To do this, I need roads, which require BRICK.

<plan>
1. Trade WHEAT for BRICK now to enable road building soon
2. Continue expanding my road network toward unoccupied valuable hexes
3. Focus next expansion on getting BRICK or ORE production
4. Build a new settlement when I get enough resources
5. After securing expansion, transition to city upgrades
</plan>

The most effective action right now is to trade my 4 WHEAT for 1 BRICK (option 2), which will position me closer to building a road and expanding when I get more WOOD.

# Game State Analysis

Let me analyze the current situation carefully:

## Current Resources
- 1 Wood, 1 Brick, 2 Sheep
- This means I could build a road if I wanted to

## Victory Points
- Me: 2 VPs (2 settlements)
- Opponent: 4 VPs (2 settlements + 1 city)
- Opponent is ahead, but not insurmountably

## Production Analysis
- My settlements:
  - Node 3: Wheat (9), Sheep (6), Wood (10) - good production
  - Node 15: Wood (10) - limited production
- I'm producing Wheat, Sheep, and Wood, but lack Brick and Ore production

## Road Building Options
I have 6 options to build roads:
1. Edge (13, 14) - connects toward the northwest from my Wood hex
2. Edge (2, 3) - extends from my settlement at node 3
3. Edge (4, 15) - connects my two settlements
4. Edge (4, 5) - extends east from node 4
5. Edge (16, 18) - extends south from node 16/18
6. Edge (3, 12) - extends southwest from my settlement at node 3

## Strategy Consideration

The robber is currently on the Wood (10) hex, which affects my production. I should consider:
1. Where can I expand to gain Brick or Ore production?
2. Can I block my opponent's expansion?
3. Which road provides the most strategic value for future settlement placement?

Looking at the map, I need to understand which road would help me expand toward valuable hexes. Particularly, I should consider paths that help me access brick or ore resources, as I'm currently lacking those.

The opponent has 8 hidden cards, which means they might be planning a significant build soon. I should try to position myself to block their potential expansion routes if possible.

Since I already have the exact resources needed for a road (1 Wood, 1 Brick), I should use them rather than end my turn, as building a road expands my options.

<plan>
1. Build a road now to position for future settlement placement
2. Target expansion toward brick (5) or ore (3) production areas
3. Watch opponent's resource accumulation and be ready to place the robber if they roll 7
4. Continue building my road network strategically to secure valuable intersections
5. Work toward my third settlement on a hex that provides brick or ore
</plan>

Based on the board layout, road option #2 (edge 2, 3) would extend from my productive settlement at node 3 and potentially help me expand toward more resources. Road option #6 (edge 3, 12) would expand southwest from the same settlement, which could lead toward unexplored territory.

After careful consideration, I believe the most strategic choice is to build a road that expands my network toward potential new settlement locations with priority resources. Road option #6 (edge 3, 12) appears to offer the best expansion potential from my current position.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist whose primary goal is to defeat the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (HIGHEST PRIORITY):
- Target 6 & 8 numbered hexes at all costs - these are the most productive numbers
- Prioritize ore and wheat hexes for your settlements - they enable cities and development cards
- Position yourself on at least one good brick and wood hex to enable early expansion
- Aim to cover ALL five resources with your two settlements combined
- Try to place on intersections with 3 productive hexes rather than 2
- Evaluate probability dots (not just numbers) - more dots mean more frequent production
- Place settlements with clear expansion paths that won't be easily blocked
- Avoid placing where you'll be immediately cut off by the opponent
- Position roads toward your next planned settlement location
- Consider distance to valuable ports (especially 2:1 ports matching your abundant resources)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-8):
- Build at least one new road and one new settlement ASAP
- Focus on securing access to any missing resources through expansion
- Establish access to a port if you're lacking a key resource
- Prevent the opponent from cutting off your expansion path
- Only purchase development cards if excess resources available or for immediate victory
- Expand toward high-value hexes the opponent doesn't yet control

MID-GAME RESOURCE MANAGEMENT (TURNS 9-20):
- Target 3 cities minimum (worth 6 VP) - upgrade most productive settlements first
- Maintain 1 road per every 2 settlements for flexible expansion
- Always build a settlement when you have the resources (more production points)
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each build (cities give best long-term return)
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1 or better) to maintain resource balance
- Keep at least one viable road-building path open at all times
- If blocked from expansion, shift to city upgrades and development cards

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Development cards should supplement your expansion, not replace it
- Prioritize using Knight cards to protect your best hexes from the robber
- Save Knights when you're ahead to counter the opponent's robber placements
- Only buy development cards when you:
  1. Have excess sheep/wheat/ore but lack wood/brick for expansion
  2. Are close to securing largest army
  3. Need a specific card type (Road Building to break through a blockade)
- Use Road Building cards to save brick/wood and create surprise expansion paths
- Time Monopoly cards to capture opponent's stockpile after high-producing rolls
- Use Year of Plenty to complete crucial builds when short on specific resources

ROBBER PLACEMENT:
- Always target the opponent's highest-producing hex (high number + settlement/city)
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat hexes to slow city development
- If opponent relies heavily on one resource, target that resource's hexes
- Never place the robber on your own high-production hexes
- When stealing, target resources you immediately need for your next build

VICTORY PATH PLANNING:
- Target resource independence with at least one settlement/city on each resource
- Minimum viable infrastructure: 3-4 settlements total, with 2-3 upgraded to cities
- Calculate multiple paths to 10 VP and pursue the fastest:
  Path 1: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP)
  Path 2: 4 cities (8 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP)
  Path 3: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 victory point card
- Always track your direct path to 10 VP and focus on those builds
- Prioritize visible points (settlements/cities) over speculative development cards
- Switch paths if the opponent blocks your primary victory path
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Accept trades only when they enable an immediate, crucial build
- Never make trades that allow opponent to build a settlement or city immediately
- Trade away excess resources when at risk for robber (7+ cards)
- Calculate the production value of each settlement location before deciding to build
- When trading with ports, plan sequences that convert unwanted resources into needed ones

DETAILED DECISION FRAMEWORK:
1. Does this move bring me closer to 10 victory points?
2. Does this move increase my production capacity more than alternative builds?
3. Does this move protect me from being blocked or cut off?
4. Does this move position me for strongest expansion in next 2-3 turns?
5. Is this the most efficient use of my current resources?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game Analysis: Move Robber Decision

I need to decide where to place the robber to maximize my strategic advantage while hindering my opponent who is currently ahead (4 VP vs my 2 VP).

## Current Game State Assessment
- I'm behind in points (2 vs 4)
- RED has a city and is producing more efficiently
- The robber is currently on the 🌲10 hex, which is one of my own producing hexes
- RED has settlements/cities on wheat (9 and 4), sheep (6), brick (5), and ore (3)
- I need to block RED's most valuable production

## Robber Placement Options Analysis:

[0] Move to (0, 0, 0) - Wheat 9 hex:
- This blocks a wheat hex that produces for both RED's city (double production) and my settlement
- Would hurt both of us, but RED more due to city production
- Good option as wheat is critical for settlements and cities

[1] Move to (1, -1, 0) - Wheat 4 hex:
- Only blocks RED's settlement at node 9
- Less impactful as it's a lower probability number (4)

[2] Move to (0, -1, 1) - Sheep 6 hex:
- High probability number (6)
- Blocks RED's settlement at node 9
- Also blocks my settlement at node 3
- Would hurt both of us, not ideal since I already have 3 sheep

[3] Move to (-1, 1, 0) - Desert hex:
- Desert produces nothing, so placing robber here is wasteful
- No strategic value

[4] Move to (0, 1, -1) - Brick 5 hex:
- Blocks RED's settlement at node 19 and city at node 0
- Brick is crucial for road building and expansion
- Good probability number (5)
- Very strategic choice

[5] Move to (1, 0, -1) - Ore 3 hex:
- Blocks RED's city at node 0
- Ore is critical for city upgrades
- Lower probability number (3)
- But ore is very valuable for cities

## Strategic Decision:
Looking at RED's production, they have a city (double production) on wheat, brick, and ore. The most critical resources for advancement are ore and wheat for cities, and brick for expansion.

The best options are:
1. Option [4] - Block brick 5, affecting RED's city and settlement
2. Option [0] - Block wheat 9, affecting RED's city
3. Option [5] - Block ore 3, affecting RED's city

Given that RED is ahead and likely planning city upgrades, blocking ore or wheat would slow them down most effectively. Between these, the wheat 9 hex has a higher probability than ore 3, so it will have more impact.

<plan>
1. Block RED's wheat production on the 9 hex to slow down their city building
2. Continue building roads strategically to set up my third settlement
3. Focus on acquiring brick and ore for expansion and city upgrades
4. Target a settlement location that gives access to brick or ore
5. Build toward developing a city at my most productive settlement (node 3)
</plan>

The optimal robber placement is on wheat 9 hex (option 0), as it blocks a high-probability resource critical for RED's advancement while allowing me to steal a resource.

Let me carefully analyze the current game state to make the optimal decision:

## Resources
- I have: 2 Wood, 4 Sheep, 1 Wheat
- I'm lacking Brick and Ore, which are essential for expansion and city upgrades

## Victory Points Comparison
- I have 2 VPs (2 settlements)
- RED has 4 VPs (2 settlements + 1 city)
- RED is ahead by 2 VPs

## Production
- My node 3 produces when 6, 9, or 10 are rolled (high-value node)
- The robber is currently on the 9 wheat hex, blocking everyone's wheat production
- RED has a city at node 0, which is a strong production point

## Available Actions
1-4: Trade 4 sheep for 1 of any other resource
0: End turn

## Decision Analysis

I have 4 sheep, which allows me to make a 4:1 port trade. Let me evaluate what resource would be most valuable:

- Brick: Would allow me to build another road, potentially improving my position for future settlements
- Ore: Could get me 1/3 of the way toward a city upgrade
- Wood: I already have 2, so getting a 3rd doesn't unlock anything immediately
- More Wheat: I already have 1, so getting a 2nd doesn't unlock anything immediately

Looking at the bigger picture:
1. RED is ahead with 4 VPs vs my 2 VPs
2. I need to focus on expansion to catch up
3. I already have 5 roads built but only 2 settlements
4. My most immediate need is to build a new settlement, which requires Brick + Wood + Sheep + Wheat

Since I already have Wood, Sheep, and Wheat, the missing resource for a new settlement is Brick.

<plan>
1. Trade 4 sheep for 1 brick now
2. Build roads to position for a new settlement, prioritizing locations with Brick or Ore production
3. Focus on getting a third settlement to increase my production and VPs
4. Once I have better production, start working toward city upgrades
5. Continue monitoring RED's expansion to avoid being blocked
</plan>

The most effective action right now is to trade for brick, which will help me continue my road network and prepare for a new settlement.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist whose primary goal is to defeat the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (HIGHEST PRIORITY):
- Target 6 & 8 numbered hexes at all costs - these are the most productive numbers
- Prioritize ore and wheat hexes for your settlements - they enable cities and development cards
- Position yourself on at least one good brick and wood hex to enable early expansion
- Aim to cover ALL five resources with your two settlements combined
- Try to place on intersections with 3 productive hexes rather than 2
- Evaluate probability dots (not just numbers) - more dots mean more frequent production
- Place settlements with clear expansion paths that won't be easily blocked
- Avoid placing where you'll be immediately cut off by the opponent
- Position roads toward your next planned settlement location
- Consider distance to valuable ports (especially 2:1 ports matching your abundant resources)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-8):
- Build at least one new road and one new settlement ASAP
- Focus on securing access to any missing resources through expansion
- Establish access to a port if you're lacking a key resource
- Prevent the opponent from cutting off your expansion path
- Only purchase development cards if excess resources available or for immediate victory
- Expand toward high-value hexes the opponent doesn't yet control

MID-GAME RESOURCE MANAGEMENT (TURNS 9-20):
- Target 3 cities minimum (worth 6 VP) - upgrade most productive settlements first
- Maintain 1 road per every 2 settlements for flexible expansion
- Always build a settlement when you have the resources (more production points)
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each build (cities give best long-term return)
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1 or better) to maintain resource balance
- Keep at least one viable road-building path open at all times
- If blocked from expansion, shift to city upgrades and development cards

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Development cards should supplement your expansion, not replace it
- Prioritize using Knight cards to protect your best hexes from the robber
- Save Knights when you're ahead to counter the opponent's robber placements
- Only buy development cards when you:
  1. Have excess sheep/wheat/ore but lack wood/brick for expansion
  2. Are close to securing largest army
  3. Need a specific card type (Road Building to break through a blockade)
- Use Road Building cards to save brick/wood and create surprise expansion paths
- Time Monopoly cards to capture opponent's stockpile after high-producing rolls
- Use Year of Plenty to complete crucial builds when short on specific resources

ROBBER PLACEMENT:
- Always target the opponent's highest-producing hex (high number + settlement/city)
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat hexes to slow city development
- If opponent relies heavily on one resource, target that resource's hexes
- Never place the robber on your own high-production hexes
- When stealing, target resources you immediately need for your next build

VICTORY PATH PLANNING:
- Target resource independence with at least one settlement/city on each resource
- Minimum viable infrastructure: 3-4 settlements total, with 2-3 upgraded to cities
- Calculate multiple paths to 10 VP and pursue the fastest:
  Path 1: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP)
  Path 2: 4 cities (8 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP)
  Path 3: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 victory point card
- Always track your direct path to 10 VP and focus on those builds
- Prioritize visible points (settlements/cities) over speculative development cards
- Switch paths if the opponent blocks your primary victory path
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Accept trades only when they enable an immediate, crucial build
- Never make trades that allow opponent to build a settlement or city immediately
- Trade away excess resources when at risk for robber (7+ cards)
- Calculate the production value of each settlement location before deciding to build
- When trading with ports, plan sequences that convert unwanted resources into needed ones

DETAILED DECISION FRAMEWORK:
1. Does this move bring me closer to 10 victory points?
2. Does this move increase my production capacity more than alternative builds?
3. Does this move protect me from being blocked or cut off?
4. Does this move position me for strongest expansion in next 2-3 turns?
5. Is this the most efficient use of my current resources?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 74 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Trade 4 sheep for 1 brick now
2. Build roads to position for a new settlement, prioritizing locations with Brick or Ore production
3. Focus on getting a third settlement to increase my production and VPs
4. Once I have better production, start working toward city upgrades
5. Continue monitoring RED's expansion to avoid being blocked

# Game Analysis for Turn 74

Let me analyze the current game state and evaluate my options carefully.

## Current Status
- I have 2 Victory Points (2 settlements)
- RED has 4 Victory Points (2 settlements + 1 city)
- I have 2 wood, 1 brick, 1 wheat (can build 1 road)
- Settlements at nodes 3 and 15
- Robber is on wheat hex (0,0,0) - blocking a high-production 9 hex
- RED is ahead by 2 points and has more infrastructure

## Strategy Considerations
1. I need to expand my production capacity by building a third settlement
2. I need to place this settlement on hexes with resources I'm lacking (ore is missing completely)
3. I need to build roads strategically to reach valuable settlement locations
4. I need to block RED's expansion paths if possible

## Road Building Options
Looking at the available road locations:
- [1] Road at (13, 14): Extends toward the north side of the board
- [2] Road at (12, 13): Connects to my settlement at node 15, potentially opening expansion path
- [3] Road at (2, 3): Connects to my settlement at node 3, but might go toward RED's territory
- [4] Road at (4, 15): Connects to my settlement at node 15, directs north/northeast
- [5] Road at (4, 5): Extends northward from node 4
- [6] Road at (11, 12): Extends from node 11 toward my settlement at node 15
- [7] Road at (16, 18): Extends from node 16 toward edge of board

Without seeing the full connectivity of the board, I need to prioritize roads that:
1. Push toward hex corners with multiple productive resources
2. Secure access to ore (which I completely lack)
3. Block RED's potential expansion paths

Based on the node numbers, road option [2] connecting nodes 12-13 appears to connect to my settlement at node 15 and move toward unexplored territory. This seems to open a path for expansion where I might access new resources.

<plan>
1. Build road at (12, 13) to extend from my settlement at node 15
2. Gather resources for additional roads and a settlement, prioritizing locations with Ore
3. Continue monitoring RED's expansion to avoid being blocked
4. Once I have 3 settlements with better production, focus on city upgrades
5. Aim for at least one city upgrade by turn 85
</plan>

Given the limited information about the full board layout, I'll choose option [2] to build a road at edge (12, 13), which appears to create a path from my settlement at node 15 toward potential new settlement locations.

# Analyzing Robber Placement Options

Let me analyze each possible robber placement to determine the optimal move:

## Action Analysis

**[0] Move robber to (0, 0, 0) and steal from RED**
- This is the wheat hex with number 9
- It's a highly productive hex (⭐⭐)
- It blocks RED's city at node 0 (which produces wheat from this hex)
- It also blocks my settlement at node 3 (which produces wheat from this hex)
- Disadvantage: I'd be blocking my own wheat production

**[1] Move robber to (1, -1, 0) and steal from RED**
- This is the wheat hex with number 4
- Has lower productivity (⭐)
- It blocks RED's settlement at node 9
- Doesn't block any of my production

**[2] Move robber to (0, -1, 1) and steal from RED**
- This is the sheep hex with number 6
- Very high productivity (⭐⭐⭐)
- It blocks RED's settlement at node 9
- Also blocks my settlement at node 3
- Disadvantage: I'd be blocking my own sheep production

**[3] Move robber to (-1, 1, 0)**
- This is the desert hex
- No productivity to block
- No resources to steal
- Useless move

**[4] Move robber to (0, 1, -1) and steal from RED**
- This is the brick hex with number 5
- Good productivity (⭐⭐)
- It blocks RED's city at node 0 and settlement at node 19
- Doesn't block any of my production
- Blocks a key resource (brick) that RED has good access to

**[5] Move robber to (1, 0, -1) and steal from RED**
- This is the ore hex with number 3
- Lower productivity (⭐)
- It blocks RED's city at node 0
- Doesn't block any of my production

## Strategic Considerations

1. RED is ahead at 4 VP vs my 2 VP, so hampering their production is critical
2. Blocking brick would slow RED's road/settlement expansion
3. I should avoid blocking my own production if possible
4. Stealing needed resources from RED is also important
5. RED has a city, so blocking high production hexes they control is valuable

## Decision

The best option is **[4] Move robber to (0, 1, -1) and steal from RED** because:
- It blocks a valuable brick resource (⭐⭐) that RED has strong access to with two buildings
- It doesn't block any of my own production
- Brick is crucial for expansion (roads and settlements)
- It targets a player with a city, maximizing the impact
- I'll also get to steal a resource from RED

<plan>
1. Move robber to (0, 1, -1) to block RED's brick production
2. Build road at (12, 13) to expand from settlement at node 15
3. Look for opportunities to build towards ore resources
4. Aim to establish a settlement at a port, ideally a 2:1 port
5. Continue monitoring RED's expansion to block them when possible
6. Start saving for a city upgrade once I've secured a third settlement
</plan>

  1. Have excess sheep/wheat/ore but lack wood/brick for expansion
  2. Are close to securing largest army
  3. Need a specific card type (Road Building to break through a blockade)
- Use Road Building cards to save brick/wood and create surprise expansion paths
- Time Monopoly cards to capture opponent's stockpile after high-producing rolls
- Use Year of Plenty to complete crucial builds when short on specific resources

ROBBER PLACEMENT:
- Always target the opponent's highest-producing hex (high number + settlement/city)
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat hexes to slow city development
- If opponent relies heavily on one resource, target that resource's hexes
- Never place the robber on your own high-production hexes
- When stealing, target resources you immediately need for your next build

VICTORY PATH PLANNING:
- Target resource independence with at least one settlement/city on each resource
- Minimum viable infrastructure: 3-4 settlements total, with 2-3 upgraded to cities
- Calculate multiple paths to 10 VP and pursue the fastest:
  Path 1: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP)
  Path 2: 4 cities (8 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP)
  Path 3: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 victory point card
- Always track your direct path to 10 VP and focus on those builds
- Prioritize visible points (settlements/cities) over speculative development cards
- Switch paths if the opponent blocks your primary victory path
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Accept trades only when they enable an immediate, crucial build
- Never make trades that allow opponent to build a settlement or city immediately
- Trade away excess resources when at risk for robber (7+ cards)
- Calculate the production value of each settlement location before deciding to build
- When trading with ports, plan sequences that convert unwanted resources into needed ones

DETAILED DECISION FRAMEWORK:
1. Does this move bring me closer to 10 victory points?
2. Does this move increase my production capacity more than alternative builds?
3. Does this move protect me from being blocked or cut off?
4. Does this move position me for strongest expansion in next 2-3 turns?
5. Is this the most efficient use of my current resources?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 92 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Move robber to (0, 1, -1) to block RED's brick production
2. Build road at (12, 13) to expand from settlement at node 15
3. Look for opportunities to build towards ore resources
4. Aim to establish a settlement at a port, ideally a 2:1 port
5. Continue monitoring RED's expansion to block them when possible
6. Start saving for a city upgrade once I've secured a third settlement

# Game Analysis for Turn 92

Let me analyze the current game state and my options carefully:

## Game Status Assessment
- **Victory points**: I have 2 VP (from 2 settlements), RED has 5 VP (from 1 settlement and 2 cities)
- **My resources**: 1 Wood, 4 Sheep, 3 Wheat
- **RED resources**: 8 cards (hidden)
- **Robber location**: On (-1, 0, 1), which is a Wood 10 hex
- **Critical observation**: RED is significantly ahead with 5 VP vs my 2 VP

## My Build Options
- I don't have enough resources to build a settlement (need Brick + Wood)
- I don't have enough resources to build a city (need 3 Ore + 2 Wheat)
- I don't have enough resources to build a road (need Brick + Wood)
- I don't have enough resources to buy a development card (need Ore + Wheat + Sheep)

## Strategy Considerations
1. The robber is currently on my Wood 10 hex, limiting my wood production
2. RED already has 5 VP, halfway to victory, so I need to accelerate my strategy
3. I have excess sheep but lack critical brick and ore resources
4. With 4 sheep and 3 wheat, I'm close to being able to buy a development card if I can get ore

## Available Actions
My only available actions are to trade or end my turn:
- **Option 0**: End turn (doing nothing)
- **Options 1-4**: Trade 4 sheep for another resource

<plan>
1. Trade 4 sheep for 1 ore to progress toward development card purchase
2. Next turn, aim to move the robber off my wood hex to improve production
3. Focus on getting a development card on next turn to close the point gap
4. Continue building roads toward potential settlement locations when able
5. Target RED's ore production with the robber when possible to slow their city upgrades
</plan>

Since I have excess sheep (4) and I'm missing ore completely, and development cards offer the fastest path to points given my current situation, I should trade my sheep for ore. This will position me to potentially buy a development card next turn if I get one more wheat or sheep.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist whose primary goal is to defeat the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (HIGHEST PRIORITY):
- Target 6 & 8 numbered hexes at all costs - these are the most productive numbers
- Prioritize ore and wheat hexes for your settlements - they enable cities and development cards
- Position yourself on at least one good brick and wood hex to enable early expansion
- Aim to cover ALL five resources with your two settlements combined
- Try to place on intersections with 3 productive hexes rather than 2
- Evaluate probability dots (not just numbers) - more dots mean more frequent production
- Place settlements with clear expansion paths that won't be easily blocked
- Avoid placing where you'll be immediately cut off by the opponent
- Position roads toward your next planned settlement location
- Consider distance to valuable ports (especially 2:1 ports matching your abundant resources)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-8):
- Build at least one new road and one new settlement ASAP
- Focus on securing access to any missing resources through expansion
- Establish access to a port if you're lacking a key resource
- Prevent the opponent from cutting off your expansion path
- Only purchase development cards if excess resources available or for immediate victory
- Expand toward high-value hexes the opponent doesn't yet control

MID-GAME RESOURCE MANAGEMENT (TURNS 9-20):
- Target 3 cities minimum (worth 6 VP) - upgrade most productive settlements first
- Maintain 1 road per every 2 settlements for flexible expansion
- Always build a settlement when you have the resources (more production points)
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each build (cities give best long-term return)
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1 or better) to maintain resource balance
- Keep at least one viable road-building path open at all times
- If blocked from expansion, shift to city upgrades and development cards

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Development cards should supplement your expansion, not replace it
- Prioritize using Knight cards to protect your best hexes from the robber
- Save Knights when you're ahead to counter the opponent's robber placements
- Only buy development cards when you:
  1. Have excess sheep/wheat/ore but lack wood/brick for expansion
  2. Are close to securing largest army
  3. Need a specific card type (Road Building to break through a blockade)
- Use Road Building cards to save brick/wood and create surprise expansion paths
- Time Monopoly cards to capture opponent's stockpile after high-producing rolls
- Use Year of Plenty to complete crucial builds when short on specific resources

ROBBER PLACEMENT:
- Always target the opponent's highest-producing hex (high number + settlement/city)
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat hexes to slow city development
- If opponent relies heavily on one resource, target that resource's hexes
- Never place the robber on your own high-production hexes
- When stealing, target resources you immediately need for your next build

VICTORY PATH PLANNING:
- Target resource independence with at least one settlement/city on each resource
- Minimum viable infrastructure: 3-4 settlements total, with 2-3 upgraded to cities
- Calculate multiple paths to 10 VP and pursue the fastest:
  Path 1: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP)
  Path 2: 4 cities (8 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP)
  Path 3: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 victory point card
- Always track your direct path to 10 VP and focus on those builds
- Prioritize visible points (settlements/cities) over speculative development cards
- Switch paths if the opponent blocks your primary victory path
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Accept trades only when they enable an immediate, crucial build
- Never make trades that allow opponent to build a settlement or city immediately
- Trade away excess resources when at risk for robber (7+ cards)
- Calculate the production value of each settlement location before deciding to build
- When trading with ports, plan sequences that convert unwanted resources into needed ones

# Game Analysis for Robber Placement

Let me analyze the game state and determine the best robber placement strategy:

## Current Game Status
- RED is leading with 8/10 victory points (3 cities + longest road)
- BLUE (me) has only 2/10 victory points (2 settlements)
- I need to slow RED down while maximizing my production

## Robber Target Analysis

Let me evaluate each robber placement option:

**[0] Move robber to (0, 0, 0) and steal from RED**
- This is the wheat hex with a 9
- RED has a city (node 0) producing from this hex
- This hex has 2 probability dots (good production frequency)
- I also have a settlement on this hex, so I would block my own wheat production

**[1] Move robber to (1, -1, 0) and steal from RED**
- This is a wheat hex with a 4
- RED has a city (node 9) producing from this hex
- This hex has only 1 probability dot (low production frequency)

**[2] Move robber to (0, -1, 1) and steal from RED**
- This is a sheep hex with a 6
- RED has a city (node 9) producing from this hex
- This hex has 3 probability dots (excellent production frequency)
- I also have a settlement on this hex, so I would block my own sheep production

**[3] Move robber to (-1, 1, 0)**
- This is a desert hex with no production
- No impact on either player's production
- No resource stealing opportunity

**[4] Move robber to (0, 1, -1) and steal from RED**
- This is a brick hex with a 5
- RED has two cities (nodes 0 and 19) producing from this hex
- This hex has 2 probability dots (good production frequency)
- Would block 2 city productions for RED

**[5] Move robber to (1, 0, -1) and steal from RED**
- This is an ore hex with a 3
- RED has a city (node 0) producing from this hex
- This hex has only 1 probability dot (low production frequency)

## Strategic Considerations

1. RED is close to winning (8/10 VP)
2. Ore is critical for city building and development cards
3. Brick is important for RED's continued road expansion and maintaining longest road
4. I shouldn't block my own production hexes (options 0 and 2)
5. The desert (option 3) has no strategic value

## Decision Logic

Option [4] targeting the brick hex is optimal because:
- It blocks production from TWO of RED's cities
- It has a good production frequency (5 is rolled more often than 3 or 4)
- Brick is critical for RED to extend their road network
- RED already has longest road, and blocking brick will make it harder for them to defend it
- I get to steal a resource from RED
- I don't block any of my own production

<plan>
1. Move robber to brick hex to block RED's production and steal a resource
2. Work toward getting development cards to compete for largest army
3. Build roads toward potential settlement locations to contest longest road
4. Focus on city upgrades when possible to close the VP gap
5. Continue targeting RED's key resources (ore and brick) with future robber placements
</plan>

# Game Analysis

First, let me carefully assess the current game state:

## Victory Point Situation
- BLUE (me): 2 VP (from 2 settlements)
- RED: 8 VP (3 cities = 6 VP, longest road = 2 VP)

RED is very close to winning, needing only 2 more VP to reach 10.

## My Resources
I have: 1 Wood, 2 Sheep, 1 Wheat, 1 Ore

## Available Actions
[0] End turn
[1] Buy a development card (costs 1 Sheep, 1 Wheat, 1 Ore)

## Strategic Assessment

RED is clearly in the lead with 8 VP versus my 2 VP. With such a large gap, I need to take actions that can potentially disrupt RED's progress while advancing my position significantly.

Looking at my resources, I have exactly what's needed to purchase a development card (1 Sheep, 1 Wheat, 1 Ore). Development cards offer several potential benefits:
1. Knight cards (most common) would help me compete for largest army (2 VP)
2. Victory point cards provide an immediate hidden VP
3. Road building, monopoly, or year of plenty could help me catch up

Given that RED is only 2 points away from winning, my priority must be to slow them down while accelerating my own VP acquisition. Development cards are my best path forward since:
- They are hidden information, making it harder for RED to plan against me
- They potentially give me immediate VPs or tools to gain advantage
- I have exactly the resources needed

<plan>
1. Buy development card to potentially get a knight (toward largest army) or a VP card
2. Focus on upgrading settlements to cities when resources allow
3. Build roads strategically to challenge longest road
4. Use the robber aggressively on RED's high-producing hexes
5. Work toward a minimum of 3 cities (6 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP)
</plan>

Since RED is so close to winning, taking a calculated risk with a development card is necessary. Ending my turn without taking any action would waste this opportunity.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist whose primary goal is to defeat the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (HIGHEST PRIORITY):
- Target 6 & 8 numbered hexes at all costs - these are the most productive numbers
- Prioritize ore and wheat hexes for your settlements - they enable cities and development cards
- Position yourself on at least one good brick and wood hex to enable early expansion
- Aim to cover ALL five resources with your two settlements combined
- Try to place on intersections with 3 productive hexes rather than 2
- Evaluate probability dots (not just numbers) - more dots mean more frequent production
- Place settlements with clear expansion paths that won't be easily blocked
- Avoid placing where you'll be immediately cut off by the opponent
- Position roads toward your next planned settlement location
- Consider distance to valuable ports (especially 2:1 ports matching your abundant resources)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-8):
- Build at least one new road and one new settlement ASAP
- Focus on securing access to any missing resources through expansion
- Establish access to a port if you're lacking a key resource
- Prevent the opponent from cutting off your expansion path
- Only purchase development cards if excess resources available or for immediate victory
- Expand toward high-value hexes the opponent doesn't yet control

MID-GAME RESOURCE MANAGEMENT (TURNS 9-20):
- Target 3 cities minimum (worth 6 VP) - upgrade most productive settlements first
- Maintain 1 road per every 2 settlements for flexible expansion
- Always build a settlement when you have the resources (more production points)
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each build (cities give best long-term return)
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1 or better) to maintain resource balance
- Keep at least one viable road-building path open at all times
- If blocked from expansion, shift to city upgrades and development cards

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Development cards should supplement your expansion, not replace it
- Prioritize using Knight cards to protect your best hexes from the robber
- Save Knights when you're ahead to counter the opponent's robber placements
- Only buy development cards when you:
  1. Have excess sheep/wheat/ore but lack wood/brick for expansion
  2. Are close to securing largest army
  3. Need a specific card type (Road Building to break through a blockade)
- Use Road Building cards to save brick/wood and create surprise expansion paths
- Time Monopoly cards to capture opponent's stockpile after high-producing rolls
- Use Year of Plenty to complete crucial builds when short on specific resources

ROBBER PLACEMENT:
- Always target the opponent's highest-producing hex (high number + settlement/city)
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat hexes to slow city development
- If opponent relies heavily on one resource, target that resource's hexes
- Never place the robber on your own high-production hexes
- When stealing, target resources you immediately need for your next build

VICTORY PATH PLANNING:
- Target resource independence with at least one settlement/city on each resource
- Minimum viable infrastructure: 3-4 settlements total, with 2-3 upgraded to cities
- Calculate multiple paths to 10 VP and pursue the fastest:
  Path 1: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP)
  Path 2: 4 cities (8 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP)
  Path 3: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 victory point card
- Always track your direct path to 10 VP and focus on those builds
- Prioritize visible points (settlements/cities) over speculative development cards
- Switch paths if the opponent blocks your primary victory path
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Accept trades only when they enable an immediate, crucial build
- Never make trades that allow opponent to build a settlement or city immediately
- Trade away excess resources when at risk for robber (7+ cards)
- Calculate the production value of each settlement location before deciding to build
- When trading with ports, plan sequences that convert unwanted resources into needed ones

DETAILED DECISION FRAMEWORK:
1. Does this move bring me closer to 10 victory points?
2. Does this move increase my production capacity more than alternative builds?
3. Does this move protect me from being blocked or cut off?
4. Does this move position me for strongest expansion in next 2-3 turns?
5. Is this the most efficient use of my current resources?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game Analysis for Settlers of Catan

Let me analyze my current situation and the available options:

## Current Game State Assessment
- I have 2 VP (from 2 settlements)
- RED has 8 VP (3 cities = 6 VP + longest road = 2 VP)
- RED is dangerously close to winning (needs only 2 more VP)
- I have very limited resources (1 wood, 1 sheep)
- I have 1 Knight development card available

## Options Analysis

**Option 0: Play Knight Card**
- This would:
  - Allow me to move the robber away from the brick hex at (0,1,-1)
  - Let me steal a resource from RED
  - Count toward largest army (I'd have 1 knight played)
  - Potentially disrupt RED's plans if they need the resource I steal

**Option 1: Roll the Dice**
- This would:
  - Potentially give me resources based on the roll
  - Risk a 7 which would activate the robber with my low card count (advantage)
  - Allow me to continue my turn with more options if I get resources

## Strategic Considerations
1. RED is at 8 VP and needs only 2 more to win
2. The robber is currently on a brick hex, which is not hurting me as I'm not producing brick
3. Playing the Knight card now would not immediately gain me the largest army (need 3 knights)
4. My resource situation is poor, and I need more resources to build
5. Saving the Knight for when RED has more resources could be more impactful

<plan>
1. Focus on obtaining more resources through favorable dice rolls
2. Save the Knight card for when RED has accumulated resources or is about to make a decisive move
3. Work toward upgrading settlements to cities (need ore and wheat)
4. Consider development cards when resources allow
5. Build roads toward potential settlement locations
6. Use the robber aggressively when possible to slow RED down
</plan>

Given my limited resources and RED's position, I need to gain more resources before I can execute any significant moves. Playing the Knight now would use my only development card without significantly advancing my position.

The best strategic choice is to roll the dice and hope for favorable resource production.

# Game Analysis for Turn 102

I need to carefully analyze the current game state to make the optimal decision.

## Game State Assessment
- **Victory Points**: I (BLUE) have 2/10 VP vs RED's 8/10 VP
- **My Resources**: 1 Wood, 1 Sheep
- **My Development Cards**: 1 Knight card
- **RED's Resources**: Unknown (2 cards)
- **RED's Victory Path**: RED is at 8 VP (3 cities = 6 VP + Longest Road = 2 VP)
- **Robber Position**: Currently on Brick hex (0,1,-1) with value 5

## Critical Situation Analysis
RED is very close to winning with 8/10 VP. They need just one more city to reach 10 VP. With 3 cities already built, they have significant production power. If they get the resources for another city or 2 settlements, they will win.

## Knight Card Strategy
I can use my Knight card to:
1. Move the robber to a hex producing resources for RED
2. Potentially steal a useful resource from RED
3. Disrupt RED's resource collection

## Considerations
- With only Wood and Sheep, I can't build anything significant this turn
- The Knight card is my only way to actively interfere with RED's strategy
- Playing the Knight now would target RED's resource production and potentially delay their win
- If I don't play the Knight now, RED might collect enough resources on their turn to win

<plan>
1. Play Knight card now to disrupt RED's production and potentially steal a valuable resource
2. Target RED's most productive hexes (wheat 4 or wheat 9)
3. Focus on collecting ore and wheat to upgrade settlements to cities when possible
4. Continue building roads to reach new settlement locations
5. Consider buying development cards when resources allow for potential VP or Knights
</plan>

## Decision
I should play the Knight card now. RED is very close to winning, and I need to be as disruptive as possible. Targeting their wheat production would be ideal since they need wheat for cities. This is my best chance to slow them down and potentially gain a resource I need.

  Path 1: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP)
  Path 2: 4 cities (8 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP)
  Path 3: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 victory point card
- Always track your direct path to 10 VP and focus on those builds
- Prioritize visible points (settlements/cities) over speculative development cards
- Switch paths if the opponent blocks your primary victory path
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Accept trades only when they enable an immediate, crucial build
- Never make trades that allow opponent to build a settlement or city immediately
- Trade away excess resources when at risk for robber (7+ cards)
- Calculate the production value of each settlement location before deciding to build
- When trading with ports, plan sequences that convert unwanted resources into needed ones

DETAILED DECISION FRAMEWORK:
1. Does this move bring me closer to 10 victory points?
2. Does this move increase my production capacity more than alternative builds?
3. Does this move protect me from being blocked or cut off?
4. Does this move position me for strongest expansion in next 2-3 turns?
5. Is this the most efficient use of my current resources?

# Game Analysis: Robber Placement Decision

I need to analyze where to place the robber to maximize my advantage against RED, who is very close to winning with 8/10 victory points.

## Step 1: Evaluate RED's Production Centers
RED has cities at nodes:
- Node 0: Produces wheat (9), brick (5), and ore (3)
- Node 9: Produces wheat (4) and sheep (6)
- Node 19: Produces brick (5)

## Step 2: Assess Robber Impact on Each Hex
Looking at the available options:
- [0] Move to (0, 0, 0) = Wheat 9 hex - This blocks a high-value wheat hex that RED's city at node 0 produces from
- [1] Move to (1, -1, 0) = Wheat 4 hex - This blocks RED's city at node 9 from wheat production
- [2] Move to (0, -1, 1) = Sheep 6 hex - This blocks RED's city at node 9 from sheep production
- [3] Move to (-1, 0, 1) = Wood 10 hex - This would block my own settlement at node 3 and 15 (bad move)
- [4] Move to (-1, 1, 0) = Desert hex - This has no production value (pointless)
- [5] Move to (1, 0, -1) = Ore 3 hex - This blocks RED's city at node 0 from ore production

## Step 3: Consider My Own Production
- I must avoid blocking my own production (especially option 3 which would block my wood)
- I need to maintain access to resources for future builds

## Step 4: Strategic Priority
RED is very close to victory at 8/10 points. I need to severely disrupt their economy.

Wheat is crucial for settlements and cities, and RED has two wheat-producing locations. Based on probability:
- Wheat 9 (option 0) is a very high probability hex (4 dots)
- Wheat 4 (option 1) is a lower probability (3 dots)

The wheat 9 hex is clearly RED's most productive and valuable hex as it feeds their city at node 0. Blocking this would significantly slow their progress while also giving me a chance to steal a resource.

<plan>
1. Block RED's wheat 9 production with robber to slow their city/settlement building
2. Focus on collecting brick and wood for roads and settlements
3. Target building a settlement at my next viable location
4. Work toward breaking RED's longest road if possible
5. Consider development cards for potential knights to keep robber on RED's wheat
</plan>

Therefore, the optimal choice is to place the robber on the wheat 9 hex:

PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist whose primary goal is to defeat the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (HIGHEST PRIORITY):
- Target 6 & 8 numbered hexes at all costs - these are the most productive numbers
- Prioritize ore and wheat hexes for your settlements - they enable cities and development cards
- Position yourself on at least one good brick and wood hex to enable early expansion
- Aim to cover ALL five resources with your two settlements combined
- Try to place on intersections with 3 productive hexes rather than 2
- Evaluate probability dots (not just numbers) - more dots mean more frequent production
- Place settlements with clear expansion paths that won't be easily blocked
- Avoid placing where you'll be immediately cut off by the opponent
- Position roads toward your next planned settlement location
- Consider distance to valuable ports (especially 2:1 ports matching your abundant resources)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-8):
- Build at least one new road and one new settlement ASAP
- Focus on securing access to any missing resources through expansion
- Establish access to a port if you're lacking a key resource
- Prevent the opponent from cutting off your expansion path
- Only purchase development cards if excess resources available or for immediate victory
- Expand toward high-value hexes the opponent doesn't yet control

MID-GAME RESOURCE MANAGEMENT (TURNS 9-20):
- Target 3 cities minimum (worth 6 VP) - upgrade most productive settlements first
- Maintain 1 road per every 2 settlements for flexible expansion
- Always build a settlement when you have the resources (more production points)
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each build (cities give best long-term return)
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1 or better) to maintain resource balance
- Keep at least one viable road-building path open at all times
- If blocked from expansion, shift to city upgrades and development cards

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Development cards should supplement your expansion, not replace it
- Prioritize using Knight cards to protect your best hexes from the robber
- Save Knights when you're ahead to counter the opponent's robber placements
- Only buy development cards when you:
  1. Have excess sheep/wheat/ore but lack wood/brick for expansion
  2. Are close to securing largest army
  3. Need a specific card type (Road Building to break through a blockade)
- Use Road Building cards to save brick/wood and create surprise expansion paths
- Time Monopoly cards to capture opponent's stockpile after high-producing rolls
- Use Year of Plenty to complete crucial builds when short on specific resources

ROBBER PLACEMENT:
- Always target the opponent's highest-producing hex (high number + settlement/city)
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat hexes to slow city development
- If opponent relies heavily on one resource, target that resource's hexes
- Never place the robber on your own high-production hexes
- When stealing, target resources you immediately need for your next build

VICTORY PATH PLANNING:
- Target resource independence with at least one settlement/city on each resource
- Minimum viable infrastructure: 3-4 settlements total, with 2-3 upgraded to cities
- Calculate multiple paths to 10 VP and pursue the fastest:
  Path 1: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP)
  Path 2: 4 cities (8 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP)
  Path 3: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 victory point card
- Always track your direct path to 10 VP and focus on those builds
- Prioritize visible points (settlements/cities) over speculative development cards
- Switch paths if the opponent blocks your primary victory path
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

# Initial Settlement Placement Analysis

I need to place my first settlement optimally, considering resource distribution, high-probability numbers, and future expansion opportunities.

Let me analyze the available nodes by examining the resources and numbers they connect to:

## Primary Considerations:
- Target 6 & 8 hexes (highest productivity after 6 & 8)
- Cover diverse resources, especially ore and wheat
- Position for future expansion
- Evaluate hex probabilities (dots)

## Node Analysis:

**Node 1**: Connects to sheep4, wood5 - only 2 resources, not optimal
**Node 2**: Connects to desert, sheep4, wheat10 - desert provides no resources
**Node 3**: Connects to desert, sheep4, brick3 - low probability numbers
**Node 4**: Not provided in options

Most promising nodes:
- **Node 12**: Connects to desert, brick3, wheat8 - has valuable wheat8 (high probability)
- **Node 15**: Connects to brick3, wheat8, wood6 - excellent node with 3 distinct resources including wheat8 and wood6
- **Node 16**: Connects to wheat8, wood6 - only 2 resources but high probability
- **Node 20**: Connects to wood6, ore5 - good mix of resources

Best option appears to be **Node 15** which gives me:
- Brick (3) - needed for roads/settlements
- Wheat (8) - high probability, crucial for cities
- Wood (6) - high probability, needed for expansion

This gives me 3 different resources including wheat, all with reasonable probability numbers. The 8 and 6 are especially valuable as they're among the most frequently rolled numbers.

<plan>
1. Place initial settlement at node 15 to secure wheat8, wood6, and brick3
2. For second settlement, look for ore and sheep to complete all 5 resources
3. Initially expand toward resource-rich areas, particularly targeting ore
4. Consider early roads toward high-value nodes to block RED's expansion
</plan>

# Initial Road Placement Analysis

I need to choose my initial road placement after placing my first settlement at node 15. This is a critical decision that will determine my future expansion options.

Let me analyze the three options:

**[0] Road at edge (4, 15)**
- This connects toward node 4, which is at the intersection of sheep4, wheat8, and brick3
- Expansion path: Moving north toward sheep4 and brick3 territories

**[1] Road at edge (15, 17)**
- This connects toward node 17, moving southeast along the wheat8 hex
- Expansion path: Moving toward potential ore/sheep resources

**[2] Road at edge (14, 15)**
- This connects toward node 14, moving southwest along the brick3 hex
- Expansion path: Moving toward unexplored territory

## Strategic Considerations:
1. I need to secure access to all 5 resources - my current settlement has wheat and brick, so I need ore, sheep, and wood
2. I need to establish a clear expansion path that won't be easily blocked
3. Looking at the visible board, I can see node 17 connects to wheat8, but I need to see what other resources it connects to
4. The road at edge (15, 17) points towards unexplored territory that might have ore/sheep
5. RED has already secured wood, sheep, and wheat with their settlement at node 5
6. I need to ensure I have access to wood for expansion

## Decision:
Edge (15, 17) gives me the best expansion options. It points toward unexplored territory which likely contains ore and sheep resources that I need to complete my resource distribution. This path also moves away from RED's area, giving me room to expand without immediate competition.

<plan>
1. Place initial road at edge (15, 17) to expand southeast
2. For second settlement, prioritize finding a location with ore, sheep, and wood to complete all resources
3. Early expansion should focus on securing ore deposits for city upgrades
4. Build toward 3:1 or 2:1 ports to compensate for any resource shortages
</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist whose primary goal is to defeat the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (HIGHEST PRIORITY):
- Target 6 & 8 numbered hexes at all costs - these are the most productive numbers
- Prioritize ore and wheat hexes for your settlements - they enable cities and development cards
- Position yourself on at least one good brick and wood hex to enable early expansion
- Aim to cover ALL five resources with your two settlements combined
- Try to place on intersections with 3 productive hexes rather than 2
- Evaluate probability dots (not just numbers) - more dots mean more frequent production
- Place settlements with clear expansion paths that won't be easily blocked
- Avoid placing where you'll be immediately cut off by the opponent
- Position roads toward your next planned settlement location
- Consider distance to valuable ports (especially 2:1 ports matching your abundant resources)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-8):
- Build at least one new road and one new settlement ASAP
- Focus on securing access to any missing resources through expansion
- Establish access to a port if you're lacking a key resource
- Prevent the opponent from cutting off your expansion path
- Only purchase development cards if excess resources available or for immediate victory
- Expand toward high-value hexes the opponent doesn't yet control

MID-GAME RESOURCE MANAGEMENT (TURNS 9-20):
- Target 3 cities minimum (worth 6 VP) - upgrade most productive settlements first
- Maintain 1 road per every 2 settlements for flexible expansion
- Always build a settlement when you have the resources (more production points)
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each build (cities give best long-term return)
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1 or better) to maintain resource balance
- Keep at least one viable road-building path open at all times
- If blocked from expansion, shift to city upgrades and development cards

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Development cards should supplement your expansion, not replace it
- Prioritize using Knight cards to protect your best hexes from the robber
- Save Knights when you're ahead to counter the opponent's robber placements
- Only buy development cards when you:
  1. Have excess sheep/wheat/ore but lack wood/brick for expansion
  2. Are close to securing largest army
  3. Need a specific card type (Road Building to break through a blockade)
- Use Road Building cards to save brick/wood and create surprise expansion paths
- Time Monopoly cards to capture opponent's stockpile after high-producing rolls
- Use Year of Plenty to complete crucial builds when short on specific resources

ROBBER PLACEMENT:
- Always target the opponent's highest-producing hex (high number + settlement/city)
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat hexes to slow city development
- If opponent relies heavily on one resource, target that resource's hexes
- Never place the robber on your own high-production hexes
- When stealing, target resources you immediately need for your next build

VICTORY PATH PLANNING:
- Target resource independence with at least one settlement/city on each resource
- Minimum viable infrastructure: 3-4 settlements total, with 2-3 upgraded to cities
- Calculate multiple paths to 10 VP and pursue the fastest:
  Path 1: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP)
  Path 2: 4 cities (8 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP)
  Path 3: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 victory point card
- Always track your direct path to 10 VP and focus on those builds
- Prioritize visible points (settlements/cities) over speculative development cards
- Switch paths if the opponent blocks your primary victory path
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Accept trades only when they enable an immediate, crucial build
- Never make trades that allow opponent to build a settlement or city immediately
- Trade away excess resources when at risk for robber (7+ cards)
- Calculate the production value of each settlement location before deciding to build
- When trading with ports, plan sequences that convert unwanted resources into needed ones

DETAILED DECISION FRAMEWORK:
1. Does this move bring me closer to 10 victory points?
2. Does this move increase my production capacity more than alternative builds?
3. Does this move protect me from being blocked or cut off?
4. Does this move position me for strongest expansion in next 2-3 turns?
5. Is this the most efficient use of my current resources?

Board Understanding Guide:

- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex

- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Analysis of Initial Settlement Placement Options

I need to carefully analyze my second settlement placement since this is critical for early game success. Let's evaluate the available options:

## Current Resources and Status
- My first settlement is at node 15, producing brick (3) and wheat (8)
- I'm still missing: wood, sheep, and ore
- High priority is to get all 5 resources and prioritize strong production values

## Node Analysis by Resource Combinations
Let me analyze the most promising nodes:

### Nodes with Ore (⛏️):
- Node 0: Ore(5) + Wood(6) + Sheep(4) = 3 resources, good numbers
- Node 1: Ore(5) + Wheat(10) + Sheep(4) = 3 resources, but Wheat(10) is less productive than 8
- Node 6: Ore(5) + Wheat(10) = 2 resources only
- Node 20: Ore(5) + Wood(6) = 2 resources only
- Node 22: Ore(5) only = 1 resource only
- Node 23: Ore(5) only = 1 resource only

### Nodes with Wood (🌲):
- Node 0: Wood(6) + Ore(5) + Sheep(4) = 3 resources, great combo
- Node 5: Wood(6) + Sheep(4) = 2 resources (already taken by RED)
- Node 16: Wood(6) + Wheat(8) = 2 resources
- Node 19: Wood(6) only = 1 resource only
- Node 20: Wood(6) + Ore(5) = 2 resources
- Node 21: Wood(6) only = 1 resource only

### Nodes with Sheep (🐑):
- Node 0: Sheep(4) + Wood(6) + Ore(5) = 3 resources, excellent combo
- Node 1: Sheep(4) + Wheat(10) + Ore(5) = 3 resources
- Node 2: Sheep(4) + Wheat(10) = 2 resources
- Node 3: Sheep(4) + Brick(3) = 2 resources
- Node 4: Sheep(4) only = 1 resource only
- Node 5: Sheep(4) + Wood(6) + Wheat(8) = 3 resources (already taken by RED)

## Best Options:
1. **Node 0**: Provides Ore(5) + Wood(6) + Sheep(4) - gives me all my missing resources with good numbers
2. **Node 1**: Provides Ore(5) + Wheat(10) + Sheep(4) - gives me all missing resources except wood

Node 0 is clearly the best choice as it gives me access to all three resources I'm missing, each with decent production numbers. This will ensure I have access to all 5 resources between my two settlements, giving me flexibility in the early game.

<plan>
1. Place second settlement at node 0 to secure ore(5), wood(6), and sheep(4)
2. Use my brick and wood production to expand toward more ore hexes
3. Focus on city upgrades at my wheat-producing settlement first
4. Aim for a balanced strategy of 3 cities + 2 settlements + largest army (or some VP cards)
</plan>

# Analyzing Turn 1: Initial Road Placement

I need to analyze where to place my initial road connected to my new settlement at node 1. This is a critical decision as it will determine my early expansion path.

## Evaluating My Current Settlements:
- Settlement at node 15: Produces brick(3) and wheat(8) - good wheat production but on only 2 resources
- Settlement at node 1: Produces sheep(4), wheat(10), and ore(5) - access to 3 resources with good ore

## Analyzing Road Options:
1. **Option 0 - Road at edge (0, 1)**:
   - Leads toward node 0, which connects to ore(5), wood(6), and sheep(4)
   - Would give me access to wood resource which I'm currently missing
   - Creates a path toward the wood(6) hex which is a highly productive number

2. **Option 1 - Road at edge (1, 2)**:
   - Leads toward nodes 2/3 which connect to desert, wheat(10), brick(3), and sheep(4)
   - Doesn't provide access to any new resources I don't already have

3. **Option 2 - Road at edge (1, 6)**:
   - Leads toward node 6, which connects to wheat(10), ore(5)
   - Doesn't provide access to wood which I'm currently missing

## Strategic Assessment:
- I need access to wood to enable consistent building
- Option 0 provides a clear path to node 0, which would give me access to all 5 resources
- Node 0 is particularly valuable as it connects to wood(6) - a highly productive number
- This aligns with my plan to secure ore(5), wood(6), and sheep(4) with my next settlement

<plan>
1. Build road at edge (0, 1) to create path toward node 0
2. Work toward building a settlement at node 0 to secure wood(6)
3. After securing wood resource, focus on city upgrades starting with my wheat-producing settlements
4. Continue with balanced strategy of 3 cities + 2 settlements + development cards for largest army or VP
</plan>

Option 0 is clearly the superior choice as it creates a direct path to gaining access to wood, which is crucial for early expansion and currently missing from my resource portfolio.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist whose primary goal is to defeat the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (HIGHEST PRIORITY):
- Target 6 & 8 numbered hexes at all costs - these are the most productive numbers
- Prioritize ore and wheat hexes for your settlements - they enable cities and development cards
- Position yourself on at least one good brick and wood hex to enable early expansion
- Aim to cover ALL five resources with your two settlements combined
- Try to place on intersections with 3 productive hexes rather than 2
- Evaluate probability dots (not just numbers) - more dots mean more frequent production
- Place settlements with clear expansion paths that won't be easily blocked
- Avoid placing where you'll be immediately cut off by the opponent
- Position roads toward your next planned settlement location
- Consider distance to valuable ports (especially 2:1 ports matching your abundant resources)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-8):
- Build at least one new road and one new settlement ASAP
- Focus on securing access to any missing resources through expansion
- Establish access to a port if you're lacking a key resource
- Prevent the opponent from cutting off your expansion path
- Only purchase development cards if excess resources available or for immediate victory
- Expand toward high-value hexes the opponent doesn't yet control

MID-GAME RESOURCE MANAGEMENT (TURNS 9-20):
- Target 3 cities minimum (worth 6 VP) - upgrade most productive settlements first
- Maintain 1 road per every 2 settlements for flexible expansion
- Always build a settlement when you have the resources (more production points)
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each build (cities give best long-term return)
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1 or better) to maintain resource balance
- Keep at least one viable road-building path open at all times
- If blocked from expansion, shift to city upgrades and development cards

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Development cards should supplement your expansion, not replace it
- Prioritize using Knight cards to protect your best hexes from the robber
- Save Knights when you're ahead to counter the opponent's robber placements
- Only buy development cards when you:
  1. Have excess sheep/wheat/ore but lack wood/brick for expansion
  2. Are close to securing largest army
  3. Need a specific card type (Road Building to break through a blockade)
- Use Road Building cards to save brick/wood and create surprise expansion paths
- Time Monopoly cards to capture opponent's stockpile after high-producing rolls
- Use Year of Plenty to complete crucial builds when short on specific resources

ROBBER PLACEMENT:
- Always target the opponent's highest-producing hex (high number + settlement/city)
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat hexes to slow city development
- If opponent relies heavily on one resource, target that resource's hexes
- Never place the robber on your own high-production hexes
- When stealing, target resources you immediately need for your next build

VICTORY PATH PLANNING:
- Target resource independence with at least one settlement/city on each resource
- Minimum viable infrastructure: 3-4 settlements total, with 2-3 upgraded to cities
- Calculate multiple paths to 10 VP and pursue the fastest:
  Path 1: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP)
  Path 2: 4 cities (8 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP)
  Path 3: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 victory point card
- Always track your direct path to 10 VP and focus on those builds
- Prioritize visible points (settlements/cities) over speculative development cards
- Switch paths if the opponent blocks your primary victory path
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Accept trades only when they enable an immediate, crucial build
- Never make trades that allow opponent to build a settlement or city immediately
- Trade away excess resources when at risk for robber (7+ cards)
- Calculate the production value of each settlement location before deciding to build
- When trading with ports, plan sequences that convert unwanted resources into needed ones

DETAILED DECISION FRAMEWORK:
1. Does this move bring me closer to 10 victory points?
2. Does this move increase my production capacity more than alternative builds?
3. Does this move protect me from being blocked or cut off?
4. Does this move position me for strongest expansion in next 2-3 turns?
5. Is this the most efficient use of my current resources?

RESPONSE:
# Analyzing Current Game State

Let me carefully evaluate my position and options:

**Current Resources:**
- 1 🐑 SHEEP
- 1 🌾 WHEAT
- 1 ⛏️ ORE

**Available Actions:**
- [0] End Turn
- [1] Buy Development Card (costs exactly what I have: 1 SHEEP, 1 WHEAT, 1 ORE)

**Current Production:**
- My settlement at node 15: Produces brick(3) and wheat(8)
- My settlement at node 1: Produces sheep(4), wheat(10), and ore(5)
- I have access to all resources except wood

**Strategic Analysis:**
1. My current plan involves building a road at edge (0,1) to reach node 0 for wood access, but I don't have the brick and wood needed for a road right now.
2. I could buy a development card with my exact resources, which could yield:
   - Victory Point card (immediate hidden progress)
   - Knight card (defense against robber + progress toward Largest Army)
   - Road Building (saves resources later)
   - Monopoly or Year of Plenty (resource acquisition)

**Decision Factors:**
- I cannot make progress on my road/settlement expansion plan this turn
- Development cards provide flexibility and hidden advantages
- Without wood, my building options are limited until I expand to node 0
- Keeping resources risks losing them to a "7" roll or targeted robbery

**Plan Evaluation:**
The current plan to expand toward node 0 for wood access is still sound, but requires resources I don't have yet. Buying a development card now makes good use of my current resources while waiting to collect brick and wood.

<plan>
1. Buy development card this turn to utilize current resources efficiently
2. Continue working toward building road at edge (0,1) to create path toward node 0
3. Build settlement at node 0 to secure wood(6) production
4. After securing wood resource, focus on city upgrades starting with my wheat-producing settlements
5. Work toward 3 cities + 2 settlements + largest army strategy
</plan>

Given my current resources and inability to build roads/settlements this turn, purchasing a development card is the optimal use of my resources.

❓ Select action by number (0-1):


Based on this information, which action number do you choose? Think step by step about your options, then put the final action number in a box like \boxed{1}.
RESPONSE:
I need to decide whether to play my Knight card now or roll the dice.

Let's analyze my current situation:
- I have 2 victory points from my 2 settlements
- I have no resources currently
- I have 1 Knight development card
- The robber is on a desert hex at (0, -1, 1), which isn't blocking any production

If I play the Knight card (Option 0):
- Pros: 
  - I could move the robber to block an important resource for RED
  - I could potentially steal a resource from RED
  - It gets me closer to Largest Army (need 3 Knights)
- Cons:
  - I would be using my Knight card without having resources to build anything
  - The robber isn't currently blocking any of my production, so there's no urgency

If I roll the dice (Option 1):
- Pros:
  - I will likely gain resources I need for my next builds
  - I can save my Knight card for a more strategic moment
  - After gaining resources, I can still decide what to build
- Cons:
  - Risk of rolling a 7, which wouldn't give me resources

Looking at my current strategy:
- I need resources to advance any of my plans
- I can use the Knight card more strategically later when I have resources to build something immediately
- Rolling gives me a 5/6 chance of gaining resources rather than a 7

<plan>
1. Roll dice to gain resources
2. Build road at edge (0,1) if I gain brick and wood
3. Save up for settlement at node 0 to secure wood(6) production
4. Continue working toward city upgrades at my most productive settlements
5. Work toward 3 cities + 2 settlements + largest army strategy
</plan>

The optimal move is to roll the dice to collect resources first, rather than using my Knight card when I have no resources to build with afterward.

# Game Analysis

Let me think through the current game state and my options carefully:

## Current Game State
- I'm playing as BLUE with 2 victory points
- I have 1 brick resource and 1 Knight development card
- My settlements are at nodes 15 (producing brick-3, wheat-8) and node 1 (producing sheep-4, wheat-10, ore-5)
- The robber is on the desert hex (0,-1,1)
- It's my turn (PLAY_TURN) which means I've already rolled the dice, and these are my remaining options for this turn

## Available Actions
- [0] Play Knight card - Move the robber and steal a resource
- [1] End my turn

## Resource Analysis
I only have 1 brick and no other resources, so I cannot build anything this turn. This suggests the dice roll didn't produce any resources for me this turn.

## Knight Card Considerations
Playing the Knight card would:
1. Allow me to move the robber to block an opponent's hex
2. Let me steal a random resource from RED if I place it on a hex adjacent to their settlement
3. Give me 1 step toward Largest Army (2 VP)

Currently, RED has only 1 card, so the stealing benefit is limited. However, blocking a high-producing hex could be valuable.

RED's settlements are at nodes 5 (sheep-4, wheat-8, wood-6) and node 20 (wood-6, ore-5). Their node 5 is particularly productive with wheat-8 and wood-6, both high-value numbers.

## Strategic Decision

Looking at my current plan, I wanted to:
- Build road at edge (0,1) if I gain brick and wood
- Save for settlement at node 0 to secure wood(6)
- Work toward city upgrades and largest army

Since I didn't get wood from this roll, I can't build the road. But I should consider if using the Knight is better than saving it:

Benefits of playing Knight now:
- Block RED's production on their best hex (likely the wheat-8/wood-6)
- Potentially steal a resource
- Start building toward Largest Army

Benefits of saving Knight:
- Protect my best production if the robber targets me later
- Have flexibility to use it when I'm about to make a significant build

<plan>
1. Save Knight card for when RED is accumulating resources or when I'm close to building something significant
2. Keep focused on getting a road built toward node 0 to secure wood-6 production
3. Work on upgrading my settlement at node 15 (wheat-8) to a city for increased production
4. Long-term continue with 3 cities + 2 settlements + largest army strategy
</plan>

Since RED only has 1 card, the benefit of stealing is minimal. The Knight would be more valuable later when I need protection from the robber or when RED has accumulated more resources worth stealing.

Therefore, I should end my turn.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist whose primary goal is to defeat the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (HIGHEST PRIORITY):
- Target 6 & 8 numbered hexes at all costs - these are the most productive numbers
- Prioritize ore and wheat hexes for your settlements - they enable cities and development cards
- Position yourself on at least one good brick and wood hex to enable early expansion
- Aim to cover ALL five resources with your two settlements combined
- Try to place on intersections with 3 productive hexes rather than 2
- Evaluate probability dots (not just numbers) - more dots mean more frequent production
- Place settlements with clear expansion paths that won't be easily blocked
- Avoid placing where you'll be immediately cut off by the opponent
- Position roads toward your next planned settlement location
- Consider distance to valuable ports (especially 2:1 ports matching your abundant resources)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-8):
- Build at least one new road and one new settlement ASAP
- Focus on securing access to any missing resources through expansion
- Establish access to a port if you're lacking a key resource
- Prevent the opponent from cutting off your expansion path
- Only purchase development cards if excess resources available or for immediate victory
- Expand toward high-value hexes the opponent doesn't yet control

MID-GAME RESOURCE MANAGEMENT (TURNS 9-20):
- Target 3 cities minimum (worth 6 VP) - upgrade most productive settlements first
- Maintain 1 road per every 2 settlements for flexible expansion
- Always build a settlement when you have the resources (more production points)
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each build (cities give best long-term return)
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1 or better) to maintain resource balance
- Keep at least one viable road-building path open at all times
- If blocked from expansion, shift to city upgrades and development cards

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Development cards should supplement your expansion, not replace it
- Prioritize using Knight cards to protect your best hexes from the robber
- Save Knights when you're ahead to counter the opponent's robber placements
- Only buy development cards when you:
  1. Have excess sheep/wheat/ore but lack wood/brick for expansion
  2. Are close to securing largest army
  3. Need a specific card type (Road Building to break through a blockade)
- Use Road Building cards to save brick/wood and create surprise expansion paths
- Time Monopoly cards to capture opponent's stockpile after high-producing rolls
- Use Year of Plenty to complete crucial builds when short on specific resources

ROBBER PLACEMENT:
- Always target the opponent's highest-producing hex (high number + settlement/city)
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat hexes to slow city development
- If opponent relies heavily on one resource, target that resource's hexes
- Never place the robber on your own high-production hexes
- When stealing, target resources you immediately need for your next build

VICTORY PATH PLANNING:
- Target resource independence with at least one settlement/city on each resource
- Minimum viable infrastructure: 3-4 settlements total, with 2-3 upgraded to cities
- Calculate multiple paths to 10 VP and pursue the fastest:
  Path 1: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP)
  Path 2: 4 cities (8 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP)
  Path 3: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 victory point card
- Always track your direct path to 10 VP and focus on those builds
- Prioritize visible points (settlements/cities) over speculative development cards
- Switch paths if the opponent blocks your primary victory path
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Accept trades only when they enable an immediate, crucial build
- Never make trades that allow opponent to build a settlement or city immediately
- Trade away excess resources when at risk for robber (7+ cards)
- Calculate the production value of each settlement location before deciding to build
- When trading with ports, plan sequences that convert unwanted resources into needed ones

DETAILED DECISION FRAMEWORK:
1. Does this move bring me closer to 10 victory points?
2. Does this move increase my production capacity more than alternative builds?
3. Does this move protect me from being blocked or cut off?
4. Does this move position me for strongest expansion in next 2-3 turns?
5. Is this the most efficient use of my current resources?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 7 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Save Knight card for when RED is accumulating resources or when I'm close to building something significant
2. Keep focused on getting a road built toward node 0 to secure wood-6 production
3. Work on upgrading my settlement at node 15 (wheat-8) to a city for increased production
4. Long-term continue with 3 cities + 2 settlements + largest army strategy

RESPONSE:
I'll analyze the current game state and available options to make the best strategic decision.

**Current Game State Analysis:**
- I (BLUE) have 2 victory points from my 2 settlements
- I have no resources in hand
- I have 1 Knight development card
- RED has 2 victory points from 2 settlements
- RED has 2 hidden resource cards
- The robber is currently on a wheat-10 hex (1, -1, 0), which is connected to my settlement at node 1

**Available Options:**
0. Play Knight card - Move the robber and steal a resource from RED
1. Roll the dice

**Strategic Considerations:**
1. If I play the Knight card now:
   - I can move the robber off my wheat-10 hex, allowing it to produce again
   - I can steal one of RED's 2 cards, which would give me a resource
   - I'd be 1/3 of the way toward Largest Army (2 VP)

2. If I roll the dice:
   - I'll likely get resources based on the roll
   - I save the Knight for a potentially more strategic situation
   - My Knight card remains hidden from RED

According to my current plan, I should save the Knight card for when RED is accumulating resources or when I'm close to building something significant. Currently:
- RED only has 2 resources
- I have no resources to build anything immediately
- The robber is already on one of my production hexes

<plan>
1. Roll the dice to collect resources this turn
2. Save Knight card for when RED has more resources or when I need a specific resource to complete a build
3. Continue focusing on getting a road built toward node 0 to secure wood-6 production
4. Work on upgrading my settlement at node 15 to a city
5. Long-term continue with 3 cities + 2 settlements + largest army strategy
</plan>

Following this analysis, I'll roll the dice to potentially gain resources that can help me expand. The Knight card will be more valuable when RED has more resources to steal or when I need a specific resource to complete a build.

RESPONSE:
I'll analyze the game state to decide between playing my Knight card or ending my turn.

## Current Game State Analysis

- I have 2 VP from my 2 settlements
- I have 1 wheat resource and 1 Knight development card 
- I cannot build any roads, settlements, cities, or buy development cards with my current resources
- The robber is on the wheat-10 hex, which is affecting one of my settlements at node 1
- RED has 3 hidden resource cards

## Option Analysis

**[0] Play Knight Card:**
- Benefits:
  * Move the robber off my wheat-10 hex, potentially improving my future production
  * Steal one of RED's 3 resource cards, gaining a resource
  * Make progress toward Largest Army (2 VP)
- Drawbacks:
  * Using my only development card now may be premature
  * RED only has 3 cards, which isn't a significant haul to steal from
  * I might need the Knight later when RED has more resources or when I need to protect a key hex

**[1] End Turn:**
- Benefits:
  * Save the Knight card for a more strategic moment
  * Keep flexibility for future turns
- Drawbacks:
  * The robber stays on my wheat-10 hex, limiting my production
  * I don't get an extra resource from RED this turn

## Decision Logic

Since I currently have no build options and RED doesn't have many resources to steal, the optimal strategy is to save the Knight card for when:
1. RED has accumulated more resources
2. I need one more resource to complete an important build
3. I need to move the robber from a critical hex when I'm closer to getting largest army

<plan>
1. Roll dice next turn hoping for resources from my productive hexes
2. Save Knight card for when RED has more resources or when I need a specific resource
3. Continue focusing on building roads toward node 0 to secure wood-6 production
4. Work toward upgrading my settlement at node 15 to a city
5. Long-term goal remains 3 cities + 2 settlements + largest army strategy
</plan>

The most strategic choice now is to end my turn and save the Knight card for a higher-value opportunity.

- Focus on securing access to any missing resources through expansion
- Establish access to a port if you're lacking a key resource
- Prevent the opponent from cutting off your expansion path
- Only purchase development cards if excess resources available or for immediate victory
- Expand toward high-value hexes the opponent doesn't yet control

MID-GAME RESOURCE MANAGEMENT (TURNS 9-20):
- Target 3 cities minimum (worth 6 VP) - upgrade most productive settlements first
- Maintain 1 road per every 2 settlements for flexible expansion
- Always build a settlement when you have the resources (more production points)
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each build (cities give best long-term return)
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1 or better) to maintain resource balance
- Keep at least one viable road-building path open at all times
- If blocked from expansion, shift to city upgrades and development cards

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Development cards should supplement your expansion, not replace it
- Prioritize using Knight cards to protect your best hexes from the robber
- Save Knights when you're ahead to counter the opponent's robber placements
- Only buy development cards when you:
  1. Have excess sheep/wheat/ore but lack wood/brick for expansion
  2. Are close to securing largest army
  3. Need a specific card type (Road Building to break through a blockade)
- Use Road Building cards to save brick/wood and create surprise expansion paths
- Time Monopoly cards to capture opponent's stockpile after high-producing rolls
- Use Year of Plenty to complete crucial builds when short on specific resources

ROBBER PLACEMENT:
- Always target the opponent's highest-producing hex (high number + settlement/city)
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat hexes to slow city development
- If opponent relies heavily on one resource, target that resource's hexes
- Never place the robber on your own high-production hexes
- When stealing, target resources you immediately need for your next build

VICTORY PATH PLANNING:
- Target resource independence with at least one settlement/city on each resource
- Minimum viable infrastructure: 3-4 settlements total, with 2-3 upgraded to cities
- Calculate multiple paths to 10 VP and pursue the fastest:
  Path 1: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP)
  Path 2: 4 cities (8 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP)
  Path 3: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 victory point card
- Always track your direct path to 10 VP and focus on those builds
- Prioritize visible points (settlements/cities) over speculative development cards
- Switch paths if the opponent blocks your primary victory path
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Accept trades only when they enable an immediate, crucial build
- Never make trades that allow opponent to build a settlement or city immediately
- Trade away excess resources when at risk for robber (7+ cards)
- Calculate the production value of each settlement location before deciding to build
- When trading with ports, plan sequences that convert unwanted resources into needed ones

DETAILED DECISION FRAMEWORK:
1. Does this move bring me closer to 10 victory points?
2. Does this move increase my production capacity more than alternative builds?
3. Does this move protect me from being blocked or cut off?
4. Does this move position me for strongest expansion in next 2-3 turns?
5. Is this the most efficient use of my current resources?

- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 9 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Roll dice next turn hoping for resources from my productive hexes
2. Save Knight card for when RED has more resources or when I need a specific resource
3. Continue focusing on building roads toward node 0 to secure wood-6 production
4. Work toward upgrading my settlement at node 15 to a city
5. Long-term goal remains 3 cities + 2 settlements + largest army strategy

❓ Select action by number (0-1):


Based on this information, which action number do you choose? Think step by step about your options, then put the final action number in a box like \boxed{1}.
RESPONSE:
I'll analyze this Settlers of Catan game state carefully to make the optimal decision between my two options.

Current Game Status:
- I have 2 VP (2 settlements)
- I have 2 wheat resources and 1 knight development card
- The robber is on a wheat hex (1, -1, 0) with value 10
- My opponent has 4 hidden resources

Option 0: Play Knight Card
- Benefits:
  * Move robber from wheat-10 hex to another location (likely one of Red's productive hexes)
  * Steal a resource from Red (they have 4 cards)
  * Progress toward Largest Army (need 3 knights)
- Drawbacks:
  * Using my only development card now means I won't have protection if I accumulate resources later

Option 1: Roll Dice
- Benefits:
  * Chance to gain more resources based on my settlement production
  * Maintain my knight card for later strategic use
  * The robber is currently on wheat-10, which isn't one of my most productive hexes
- Drawbacks:
  * If I roll a 7, I'll need to move the robber anyway without the knight card benefit

Strategic Analysis:
1. My settlements produce on rolls 3, 4, 5, 8, 10 - decent coverage
2. The robber currently affects a wheat-10 hex, which isn't one of my best producing hexes (I have wheat-8 production at node 15)
3. I only have 2 wheat cards, so I'm not at risk of discarding with a 7 roll
4. My opponent has 4 cards, which is also below the discard threshold
5. My current plan focuses on building toward node 0 for wood and upgrading my settlement at node 15 to a city

Given that:
- I'm not at immediate risk from the robber's current position
- I'm not at risk of losing cards to a 7 roll
- I only have a few resources and need more to execute my plan
- Keeping the knight for protection when I have more resources is valuable

Rolling the dice is the better move. This aligns with my current plan to gather resources before making my next build. The knight card should be saved for when I have more resources to protect or when I need a specific resource from my opponent.

PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist whose primary goal is to defeat the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}

5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (HIGHEST PRIORITY):
- Target 6 & 8 numbered hexes at all costs - these are the most productive numbers
- Prioritize ore and wheat hexes for your settlements - they enable cities and development cards
- Position yourself on at least one good brick and wood hex to enable early expansion
- Aim to cover ALL five resources with your two settlements combined
- Try to place on intersections with 3 productive hexes rather than 2
- Evaluate probability dots (not just numbers) - more dots mean more frequent production
- Place settlements with clear expansion paths that won't be easily blocked
- Avoid placing where you'll be immediately cut off by the opponent
- Position roads toward your next planned settlement location
- Consider distance to valuable ports (especially 2:1 ports matching your abundant resources)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-8):
- Build at least one new road and one new settlement ASAP
- Focus on securing access to any missing resources through expansion
- Establish access to a port if you're lacking a key resource

❓ Select action by number (0-1):


Based on this information, which action number do you choose? Think step by step about your options, then put the final action number in a box like \boxed{1}.
RESPONSE:
I need to decide whether to play my Knight card now or end my turn. Let me analyze the current game state to make the optimal decision.

**Current Game State Analysis:**
- I have 2 settlements producing resources from wheat, sheep, brick, and ore
- I currently hold 3 wheat cards and 1 Knight development card
- The robber is on wheat-10 (1, -1, 0), blocking one of my wheat productions
- RED player has 5 hidden resource cards
- My long-term goal is 3 cities + 2 settlements + largest army

**Knight Card Considerations:**
1. Playing the Knight would:
   - Move the robber from wheat-10, enabling that hex to produce for me again
   - Allow me to steal one of RED's 5 resources
   - Give me 1 step toward Largest Army (need 3 total)
   - Make my wheat-10 hex productive again

2. Saving the Knight would:
   - Preserve an emergency response option for future robber placements
   - Allow using it at a more strategic time when I need a specific resource

**Current Resources:**
- With only 3 wheat, I cannot build anything meaningful this turn
- I need brick+wood+sheep+wheat for a settlement
- I need ore+ore+wheat for a city upgrade
- I need wood+brick for a road

**Decision Analysis:**
The robber is blocking my wheat-10 hex, reducing my income. RED has 5 cards, which is a good number of resources to steal from. Moving the robber would increase my production potential on future rolls, and I could gain a resource immediately from RED.

However, my main weakness right now is that I don't have enough diversity in my resources (only wheat). Playing the Knight now would only get me one random resource, which may not significantly help my position unless I get exactly what I need (brick or wood for roads).

I'm better off waiting to use the Knight card when:
1. I have more information about what RED has collected
2. I need a specific resource to complete a build
3. RED is about to make a significant move
4. The robber is placed on one of my more productive hexes (like wheat-8)

<plan>
1. End my turn to collect more diverse resources on my next dice roll
2. Save Knight card for when the robber blocks my wheat-8 hex or when I need a specific resource to complete a build
3. Continue focusing on building roads toward node 0 to secure wood-6 production
4. Work toward upgrading my settlement at node 15 to a city
5. Long-term goal remains 3 cities + 2 settlements + largest army strategy
</plan>

Since I have limited resources and the robber isn't blocking my most productive hex, the optimal decision is to end my turn and hope for better resource distribution on my next roll.

❓ Select action by number (0-1):


Based on this information, which action number do you choose? Think step by step about your options, then put the final action number in a box like \boxed{1}.
RESPONSE:
I need to decide between playing a Knight card now or rolling the dice.

Let me analyze the game state and my options:

**Current Resources:**
- I have 3 🌾WHEAT
- No other resources
- 1 KNIGHT development card

**Game Position:**
- I have 2 settlements (2 VP)
- RED also has 2 settlements (2 VP)
- The robber is currently on the wheat-10 hex, which is one of my production hexes
- I need diverse resources for my future builds

**Analysis of Options:**

Option 0: Play Knight Card
- Advantages:
  - Move the robber off my wheat-10 hex
  - Could steal a resource from RED
  - Start building toward largest army (need 3 knights)
- Disadvantages:
  - I only have wheat right now, which isn't enough for any building action
  - Even if I steal a resource, it's unlikely to give me enough for a meaningful build
  - Better to save the Knight for a more strategically valuable moment

Option 1: Roll the Dice
- Advantages:
  - Could collect more diverse resources (brick, wheat, sheep, ore)
  - My settlement at node 15 produces on 3 and 8, while my settlement at node 1 produces on 4, 5, and 10
  - Rolling allows me to potentially collect resources for my next build
- Disadvantages:
  - If I roll a 7, I'll need to discard cards if I have more than 7 (not a concern now)
  - The robber stays on my wheat-10 hex

**Strategic Decision:**
While the robber is on one of my hexes (wheat-10), it's not my most critical production hex. My wheat-8 hex is more valuable (has 3 probability dots vs 1 for wheat-10). I should save my Knight card for when the robber blocks my wheat-8 hex or when I need a specific resource to complete a build.

With only wheat in my hand, playing the Knight now won't enable any immediate builds. It's better to roll and collect more diverse resources.

<plan>
1. Roll the dice to collect more diverse resources
2. Save Knight card for when the robber blocks my wheat-8 hex or when I need a specific resource to complete a build
3. Continue focusing on building roads toward node 0 to secure wood-6 production
4. Work toward upgrading my settlement at node 15 to a city
5. Long-term goal remains 3 cities + 2 settlements + largest army strategy
</plan>

Based on this analysis, I will choose to roll the dice:

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist whose primary goal is to defeat the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (HIGHEST PRIORITY):
- Target 6 & 8 numbered hexes at all costs - these are the most productive numbers
- Prioritize ore and wheat hexes for your settlements - they enable cities and development cards
- Position yourself on at least one good brick and wood hex to enable early expansion
- Aim to cover ALL five resources with your two settlements combined
- Try to place on intersections with 3 productive hexes rather than 2
- Evaluate probability dots (not just numbers) - more dots mean more frequent production
- Place settlements with clear expansion paths that won't be easily blocked
- Avoid placing where you'll be immediately cut off by the opponent
- Position roads toward your next planned settlement location
- Consider distance to valuable ports (especially 2:1 ports matching your abundant resources)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-8):
- Build at least one new road and one new settlement ASAP
- Focus on securing access to any missing resources through expansion
- Establish access to a port if you're lacking a key resource
- Prevent the opponent from cutting off your expansion path
- Only purchase development cards if excess resources available or for immediate victory
- Expand toward high-value hexes the opponent doesn't yet control

MID-GAME RESOURCE MANAGEMENT (TURNS 9-20):
- Target 3 cities minimum (worth 6 VP) - upgrade most productive settlements first
- Maintain 1 road per every 2 settlements for flexible expansion
- Always build a settlement when you have the resources (more production points)
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each build (cities give best long-term return)
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1 or better) to maintain resource balance
- Keep at least one viable road-building path open at all times
- If blocked from expansion, shift to city upgrades and development cards

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Development cards should supplement your expansion, not replace it
- Prioritize using Knight cards to protect your best hexes from the robber
- Save Knights when you're ahead to counter the opponent's robber placements
- Only buy development cards when you:
  1. Have excess sheep/wheat/ore but lack wood/brick for expansion
  2. Are close to securing largest army
  3. Need a specific card type (Road Building to break through a blockade)
- Use Road Building cards to save brick/wood and create surprise expansion paths
- Time Monopoly cards to capture opponent's stockpile after high-producing rolls
- Use Year of Plenty to complete crucial builds when short on specific resources

ROBBER PLACEMENT:
- Always target the opponent's highest-producing hex (high number + settlement/city)
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat hexes to slow city development
- If opponent relies heavily on one resource, target that resource's hexes
- Never place the robber on your own high-production hexes
- When stealing, target resources you immediately need for your next build

VICTORY PATH PLANNING:
- Target resource independence with at least one settlement/city on each resource
- Minimum viable infrastructure: 3-4 settlements total, with 2-3 upgraded to cities
- Calculate multiple paths to 10 VP and pursue the fastest:
  Path 1: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP)
  Path 2: 4 cities (8 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP)
  Path 3: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 victory point card
- Always track your direct path to 10 VP and focus on those builds
- Prioritize visible points (settlements/cities) over speculative development cards
- Switch paths if the opponent blocks your primary victory path
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Accept trades only when they enable an immediate, crucial build
- Never make trades that allow opponent to build a settlement or city immediately
- Trade away excess resources when at risk for robber (7+ cards)
- Calculate the production value of each settlement location before deciding to build
- When trading with ports, plan sequences that convert unwanted resources into needed ones

DETAILED DECISION FRAMEWORK:
1. Does this move bring me closer to 10 victory points?
2. Does this move increase my production capacity more than alternative builds?
3. Does this move protect me from being blocked or cut off?
4. Does this move position me for strongest expansion in next 2-3 turns?
5. Is this the most efficient use of my current resources?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 11 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Roll the dice to collect more diverse resources
2. Save Knight card for when the robber blocks my wheat-8 hex or when I need a specific resource to complete a build
3. Continue focusing on building roads toward node 0 to secure wood-6 production
4. Work toward upgrading my settlement at node 15 to a city
5. Long-term goal remains 3 cities + 2 settlements + largest army strategy

# Game Analysis for Turn 11

I'll evaluate the current game state and analyze my available options.

## Current Resources
- 3 WHEAT
- 1 KNIGHT development card

## Available Actions
- [0] Play Knight card - Move robber and steal
- [1] End turn

## Game Position Analysis
- I have 2 settlements (2 VP), aiming for 10
- My settlements produce:
  * Node 15: BRICK(3), WHEAT(8)
  * Node 1: SHEEP(4), WHEAT(10), ORE(5)
- RED has 5 hidden resources
- The robber is currently blocking my WHEAT(10) hex
- I can't build anything with just 3 WHEAT

## Knight Card Evaluation
Playing the Knight card now would:
- Remove the robber from my WHEAT(10) hex
- Allow me to steal a resource from RED (who has 5)
- Start me toward Largest Army (need 3 knights)
- Enable future WHEAT production from both my settlements

## Decision Logic
1. The robber is directly impacting my production by blocking WHEAT(10)
2. RED has 5 resources, meaning good chance to steal something valuable
3. I'm resource-constrained and can't build anything currently
4. Moving the robber helps my immediate resource generation
5. RED has settlements on high-value 6 and 8 hexes I could block instead
6. This aligns with my strategy to protect high-value hexes and work toward largest army

<plan>
1. Play Knight card to move robber off my WHEAT and onto RED's high-value WOOD(6) hex
2. Steal a resource from RED to improve my resource diversity
3. Focus on building roads toward node 0 to secure WOOD(6) production
4. Continue working toward upgrading settlement at node 15 to a city
5. Long-term goal remains 3 cities + 2 settlements + largest army strategy
</plan>

Given these considerations, I should play the Knight card now to unblock my WHEAT production and potentially gain an additional resource.

# Analysis of Robber Placement Options

I need to decide where to move the robber to maximize my advantage while hindering RED player's progress.

Let me review the options and analyze each hex:

**[0] Move robber to (0, 0, 0) and steal from RED**
- This is the SHEEP(4) hex
- RED has a settlement at node 5 that produces from this hex
- This hex only has 1 dot (★) of productivity - relatively low impact

**[1] Move robber to (0, -1, 1)**
- This is the DESERT hex
- Blocking this produces no benefit as it doesn't produce resources
- Would waste the robber movement

**[2] Move robber to (-1, 0, 1)**
- This is the BRICK(3) hex with 1 dot (★)
- My settlement at node 15 produces from this hex
- Placing here would block my own production - counterproductive

**[3] Move robber to (-1, 1, 0) and steal from RED**
- This is the WHEAT(8) hex with 3 dots (★★★)
- RED has a settlement at node 5 that produces from this hex
- My settlement at node 15 also produces from this hex
- Placing here would block both RED and myself from a high-value hex

**[4] Move robber to (0, 1, -1) and steal from RED**
- This is the WOOD(6) hex with 3 dots (★★★)
- RED has settlements at both node 5 and node 20 that produce from this hex
- This is RED's only source of wood and has high productivity
- Blocking this would significantly impact RED's ability to build roads and settlements

**[5] Move robber to (1, 0, -1) and steal from RED**
- This is the ORE(5) hex with 2 dots (★★)
- RED has a settlement at node 20 that produces from this hex
- My settlement at node 1 also produces from this hex
- Placing here would block both RED and myself from a medium-value hex

## Strategic Decision:

The most impactful move is option [4] - placing the robber on the WOOD(6) hex. This is RED's only source of wood, and it produces for TWO of RED's settlements. RED needs wood for both roads and settlements, so blocking this resource will significantly hamper their expansion. Additionally, I can steal a resource from RED, potentially getting wood that I currently lack.

Options [3] and [5] would block my own production as well, which is not ideal. Option [0] targets a low-productivity hex, and options [1] and [2] are ineffective or self-harming.

<plan>
1. Place robber on RED's WOOD(6) hex to block their only source of wood
2. Steal a resource from RED, hoping for wood or brick
3. Use my wheat to trade for other resources if needed
4. Continue building toward node 0 to secure the WOOD(6) production for myself
5. Save resources to upgrade my settlement at node 15 to a city
</plan>

   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (HIGHEST PRIORITY):
- Target 6 & 8 numbered hexes at all costs - these are the most productive numbers
- Prioritize ore and wheat hexes for your settlements - they enable cities and development cards
- Position yourself on at least one good brick and wood hex to enable early expansion
- Aim to cover ALL five resources with your two settlements combined
- Try to place on intersections with 3 productive hexes rather than 2
- Evaluate probability dots (not just numbers) - more dots mean more frequent production
- Place settlements with clear expansion paths that won't be easily blocked
- Avoid placing where you'll be immediately cut off by the opponent
- Position roads toward your next planned settlement location
- Consider distance to valuable ports (especially 2:1 ports matching your abundant resources)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-8):
- Build at least one new road and one new settlement ASAP
- Focus on securing access to any missing resources through expansion
- Establish access to a port if you're lacking a key resource
- Prevent the opponent from cutting off your expansion path
- Only purchase development cards if excess resources available or for immediate victory
- Expand toward high-value hexes the opponent doesn't yet control

MID-GAME RESOURCE MANAGEMENT (TURNS 9-20):
- Target 3 cities minimum (worth 6 VP) - upgrade most productive settlements first
- Maintain 1 road per every 2 settlements for flexible expansion
- Always build a settlement when you have the resources (more production points)
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each build (cities give best long-term return)
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1 or better) to maintain resource balance
- Keep at least one viable road-building path open at all times
- If blocked from expansion, shift to city upgrades and development cards

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Development cards should supplement your expansion, not replace it
- Prioritize using Knight cards to protect your best hexes from the robber
- Save Knights when you're ahead to counter the opponent's robber placements
- Only buy development cards when you:
  1. Have excess sheep/wheat/ore but lack wood/brick for expansion
  2. Are close to securing largest army
  3. Need a specific card type (Road Building to break through a blockade)
- Use Road Building cards to save brick/wood and create surprise expansion paths
- Time Monopoly cards to capture opponent's stockpile after high-producing rolls
- Use Year of Plenty to complete crucial builds when short on specific resources

ROBBER PLACEMENT:
- Always target the opponent's highest-producing hex (high number + settlement/city)
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat hexes to slow city development
- If opponent relies heavily on one resource, target that resource's hexes
- Never place the robber on your own high-production hexes
- When stealing, target resources you immediately need for your next build

VICTORY PATH PLANNING:
- Target resource independence with at least one settlement/city on each resource
- Minimum viable infrastructure: 3-4 settlements total, with 2-3 upgraded to cities
- Calculate multiple paths to 10 VP and pursue the fastest:
  Path 1: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP)
  Path 2: 4 cities (8 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP)
  Path 3: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 victory point card
- Always track your direct path to 10 VP and focus on those builds
- Prioritize visible points (settlements/cities) over speculative development cards
- Switch paths if the opponent blocks your primary victory path
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Accept trades only when they enable an immediate, crucial build
- Never make trades that allow opponent to build a settlement or city immediately
- Trade away excess resources when at risk for robber (7+ cards)
- Calculate the production value of each settlement location before deciding to build
- When trading with ports, plan sequences that convert unwanted resources into needed ones

DETAILED DECISION FRAMEWORK:
1. Does this move bring me closer to 10 victory points?
2. Does this move increase my production capacity more than alternative builds?
3. Does this move protect me from being blocked or cut off?
4. Does this move position me for strongest expansion in next 2-3 turns?
5. Is this the most efficient use of my current resources?

- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Analysis of Game State and Available Actions

Let me carefully analyze the current situation to make the optimal decision:

## Current Resources
- I have: 1 Brick, 1 Sheep, 4 Wheat
- Missing: Wood and more Brick to build roads or settlements
- Missing: Ore to build cities
- Can trade 4 Wheat for any resource using 4:1 port trade

## Game Position
- RED and I both have 2 VP from 2 settlements each
- The robber is on the Wood(6) hex, blocking RED's key resource production
- RED has 5 hidden resources
- I have a strong production of Wheat from my settlements

## Current Plan Evaluation
Our plan involved:
1. Placing robber on RED's Wood hex (already accomplished)
2. Stealing a resource (already happened)
3. Trading wheat for resources if needed (our current decision point)
4. Building toward node 0 to get Wood(6) production
5. Upgrading settlement at node 15 to city

For step 4 to work, we need Wood and Brick for roads. For step 5, we need 3 Ore and 2 Wheat.

## Action Analysis
- [0] Ending turn wastes our trading opportunity when we have 4 Wheat to use
- [1] Getting Ore will help toward city upgrade (need 3 Ore total)
- [2] Getting Brick will help road building (we already have 1 Brick)
- [3] Getting Sheep isn't highly valuable right now
- [4] Getting Wood would help road building

Looking at expansion options:
- To build toward node 0, we need Wood + Brick for roads
- To upgrade a settlement to city, we need 3 Ore + 2 Wheat

Our Wheat production is strong (4 cards already), so consolidating our development through a city upgrade seems wisest long-term. Getting Ore makes the most sense to advance toward a city, which would give us more resources per turn and 1 additional VP.

<plan>
1. Trade for Ore now to begin accumulating resources for city upgrade
2. Continue blocking RED's Wood production with the robber
3. Prioritize upgrading settlement at node 15 to city (need 2 more Ore)
4. Then focus on roads toward node 0 to secure Wood(6) production
5. Keep an eye on RED's development and adjust strategy accordingly
</plan>

Therefore, I'll trade 4 Wheat for 1 Ore.

PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist whose primary goal is to defeat the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (HIGHEST PRIORITY):
- Target 6 & 8 numbered hexes at all costs - these are the most productive numbers
- Prioritize ore and wheat hexes for your settlements - they enable cities and development cards
- Position yourself on at least one good brick and wood hex to enable early expansion
- Aim to cover ALL five resources with your two settlements combined
- Try to place on intersections with 3 productive hexes rather than 2
- Evaluate probability dots (not just numbers) - more dots mean more frequent production
- Place settlements with clear expansion paths that won't be easily blocked
- Avoid placing where you'll be immediately cut off by the opponent
- Position roads toward your next planned settlement location
- Consider distance to valuable ports (especially 2:1 ports matching your abundant resources)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-8):
- Build at least one new road and one new settlement ASAP
- Focus on securing access to any missing resources through expansion
- Establish access to a port if you're lacking a key resource
- Prevent the opponent from cutting off your expansion path
- Only purchase development cards if excess resources available or for immediate victory
- Expand toward high-value hexes the opponent doesn't yet control

MID-GAME RESOURCE MANAGEMENT (TURNS 9-20):
- Target 3 cities minimum (worth 6 VP) - upgrade most productive settlements first
- Maintain 1 road per every 2 settlements for flexible expansion
- Always build a settlement when you have the resources (more production points)
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each build (cities give best long-term return)
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1 or better) to maintain resource balance
- Keep at least one viable road-building path open at all times
- If blocked from expansion, shift to city upgrades and development cards

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Development cards should supplement your expansion, not replace it
- Prioritize using Knight cards to protect your best hexes from the robber
- Save Knights when you're ahead to counter the opponent's robber placements
- Only buy development cards when you:
  1. Have excess sheep/wheat/ore but lack wood/brick for expansion
  2. Are close to securing largest army
  3. Need a specific card type (Road Building to break through a blockade)
- Use Road Building cards to save brick/wood and create surprise expansion paths
- Time Monopoly cards to capture opponent's stockpile after high-producing rolls
- Use Year of Plenty to complete crucial builds when short on specific resources

ROBBER PLACEMENT:
- Always target the opponent's highest-producing hex (high number + settlement/city)

  Path 3: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 victory point card
- Always track your direct path to 10 VP and focus on those builds
- Prioritize visible points (settlements/cities) over speculative development cards
- Switch paths if the opponent blocks your primary victory path
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

# Game Analysis for Turn 15

I need to analyze my current position and available options carefully to plot the best path to victory.

## Game State Assessment
- I have 2 victory points (2 settlements)
- Resources: 1 🧱BRICK, 2 🐑SHEEP, 1 🌾WHEAT, 1 ⛏️ORE
- The robber is currently blocking RED's Wood(6) hex
- My production sources:
  - Settlement at node 15: 🧱3, 🌾8
  - Settlement at node 1: 🐑4, 🌾10, ⛏️5
- RED has 6 hidden resources and 2 settlements in strong positions

## Available Options
I only have two options:
1. Buy a development card (costs 1 🐑SHEEP, 1 🌾WHEAT, 1 ⛏️ORE)
2. End my turn

## Strategic Evaluation

If I buy a development card:
- Pros:
  - Could get a Victory Point card (immediate hidden progress)
  - Could get a Knight to maintain control of the robber position
  - Could get Year of Plenty or Monopoly to help gather resources
  - Could get Road Building to expand faster
  - Removes resources from my hand, reducing robbery risk
- Cons:
  - Uses up my Ore which I need for city upgrades
  - May get a card that doesn't immediately help
  - Delays my city upgrade strategy

If I end my turn:
- Pros:
  - Preserve resources for future builds
  - Maintain flexibility for next turn options
- Cons:
  - Risk losing resources to robber if RED rolls a 7
  - Not making progress this turn

## Decision Logic
I currently have 5 resources, so I'm not at immediate risk for the robber. My plan involves upgrading a settlement to a city, which requires 3 ore and 2 wheat. I currently have only 1 ore, so buying a development card would use my only ore and delay this plan.

<plan>
1. End turn now to preserve resources
2. Continue blocking RED's Wood production with the robber if possible
3. Focus on collecting more ORE (need 2 more) and WHEAT (need 1 more) for upgrading settlement at node 15 to city
4. Build roads toward node 0 after city upgrade to secure Wood(6) production
5. Consider development cards only after securing city upgrade
</plan>

Given my current resources and strategic goals, ending my turn is the prudent choice to stay on track for my city upgrade strategy.

# Game Analysis for Turn 17

I need to carefully analyze my current position and available options to make the optimal decision against the AlphaBeta algorithm.

## Current Game State Assessment
- I have 2 VP from my 2 settlements
- Resources: 1 BRICK, 2 SHEEP, 3 WHEAT, 1 ORE
- Robber is on the Wood(6) hex, currently blocking RED's most productive hex
- RED has 6 hidden cards, likely stockpiling resources

## My Resource Production
- Settlement at node 15: BRICK(3), WHEAT(8)
- Settlement at node 1: SHEEP(4), WHEAT(10), ORE(5)
- I have decent WHEAT production but limited access to ORE and BRICK

## Available Actions
- [0] End turn
- [1] Buy a development card (1 SHEEP, 1 WHEAT, 1 ORE)

## Strategic Analysis

For the development card option:
- Benefits: Could get a Victory Point card, Road Building, or Knight
- Risk: It could be a less useful Monopoly or Year of Plenty given my current situation
- Cost: I would spend 1 SHEEP, 1 WHEAT, 1 ORE, leaving me with 1 BRICK, 1 SHEEP, 2 WHEAT, 0 ORE

My current plan is to upgrade my settlement at node 15 to a city, which requires 3 ORE and 2 WHEAT. I currently have 1 ORE and 3 WHEAT, so I'm close on WHEAT but need 2 more ORE.

If I buy a development card now:
- I would spend my only ORE
- This would significantly delay my city upgrade plan
- The probability of getting an immediately useful card isn't high enough to justify this risk

If I end my turn:
- I preserve my resources for future builds
- I keep the robber on RED's Wood production, limiting their expansion potential
- I maintain flexibility to either build a city or roads on my next turn depending on what resources I roll

<plan>
1. End turn now to preserve resources for city upgrade
2. Continue blocking RED's Wood production with the robber
3. Focus on collecting more ORE (need 2 more) and maintain WHEAT reserves for upgrading settlement at node 15 to city
4. After city upgrade, build roads toward node 0 to secure Wood(6) production
5. Consider development cards only after securing the city upgrade
</plan>

Considering my resource needs and strategic goals, the optimal decision is to end my turn and preserve resources for my city upgrade plan.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist whose primary goal is to defeat the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (HIGHEST PRIORITY):
- Target 6 & 8 numbered hexes at all costs - these are the most productive numbers
- Prioritize ore and wheat hexes for your settlements - they enable cities and development cards
- Position yourself on at least one good brick and wood hex to enable early expansion
- Aim to cover ALL five resources with your two settlements combined
- Try to place on intersections with 3 productive hexes rather than 2
- Evaluate probability dots (not just numbers) - more dots mean more frequent production
- Place settlements with clear expansion paths that won't be easily blocked
- Avoid placing where you'll be immediately cut off by the opponent
- Position roads toward your next planned settlement location
- Consider distance to valuable ports (especially 2:1 ports matching your abundant resources)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-8):
- Build at least one new road and one new settlement ASAP
- Focus on securing access to any missing resources through expansion
- Establish access to a port if you're lacking a key resource
- Prevent the opponent from cutting off your expansion path
- Only purchase development cards if excess resources available or for immediate victory
- Expand toward high-value hexes the opponent doesn't yet control

MID-GAME RESOURCE MANAGEMENT (TURNS 9-20):
- Target 3 cities minimum (worth 6 VP) - upgrade most productive settlements first
- Maintain 1 road per every 2 settlements for flexible expansion
- Always build a settlement when you have the resources (more production points)
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each build (cities give best long-term return)
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1 or better) to maintain resource balance
- Keep at least one viable road-building path open at all times
- If blocked from expansion, shift to city upgrades and development cards

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Development cards should supplement your expansion, not replace it
- Prioritize using Knight cards to protect your best hexes from the robber
- Save Knights when you're ahead to counter the opponent's robber placements
- Only buy development cards when you:
  1. Have excess sheep/wheat/ore but lack wood/brick for expansion
  2. Are close to securing largest army
  3. Need a specific card type (Road Building to break through a blockade)
- Use Road Building cards to save brick/wood and create surprise expansion paths
- Time Monopoly cards to capture opponent's stockpile after high-producing rolls
- Use Year of Plenty to complete crucial builds when short on specific resources

ROBBER PLACEMENT:
- Always target the opponent's highest-producing hex (high number + settlement/city)
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat hexes to slow city development
- If opponent relies heavily on one resource, target that resource's hexes
- Never place the robber on your own high-production hexes
- When stealing, target resources you immediately need for your next build

VICTORY PATH PLANNING:
- Target resource independence with at least one settlement/city on each resource
- Minimum viable infrastructure: 3-4 settlements total, with 2-3 upgraded to cities
- Calculate multiple paths to 10 VP and pursue the fastest:
  Path 1: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP)
  Path 2: 4 cities (8 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP)
  Path 3: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 victory point card
- Always track your direct path to 10 VP and focus on those builds
- Prioritize visible points (settlements/cities) over speculative development cards
- Switch paths if the opponent blocks your primary victory path
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Accept trades only when they enable an immediate, crucial build
- Never make trades that allow opponent to build a settlement or city immediately
- Trade away excess resources when at risk for robber (7+ cards)
- Calculate the production value of each settlement location before deciding to build
- When trading with ports, plan sequences that convert unwanted resources into needed ones

DETAILED DECISION FRAMEWORK:
1. Does this move bring me closer to 10 victory points?
2. Does this move increase my production capacity more than alternative builds?
3. Does this move protect me from being blocked or cut off?
4. Does this move position me for strongest expansion in next 2-3 turns?
5. Is this the most efficient use of my current resources?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 19 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. End turn now to preserve resources for city upgrade
2. Continue blocking RED's Wood production with the robber
3. Focus on collecting more ORE (need 2 more) and maintain WHEAT reserves for upgrading settlement at node 15 to city
4. After city upgrade, build roads toward node 0 to secure Wood(6) production
5. Consider development cards only after securing the city upgrade
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.

RESPONSE:
# Game Analysis for Turn 19

I'll carefully analyze the current game state and my available options to determine the optimal move.

## Resource Assessment
I currently have:
- 1 🧱 BRICK
- 2 🐑 SHEEP
- 3 🌾 WHEAT
- 2 ⛏️ ORE
- No WOOD

## Available Actions
I have only two options:
[0] End Turn
[1] Buy Development Card (costs 1 SHEEP, 1 WHEAT, 1 ORE)

## Strategic Considerations

1. **Current Victory Points**: I have 2 VPs from my 2 settlements. Red also has 2 VPs.

2. **Resource Production**:
   - My settlements produce BRICK, SHEEP, WHEAT, and ORE
   - I don't have access to WOOD production
   - Red has access to all resources including WOOD(6), which I'm currently blocking

3. **Path to Victory Assessment**:
   - I need cities (worth 2 VP each) but require 3 ORE + 2 WHEAT per city
   - I have 2 ORE + 3 WHEAT, so I'm 1 ORE short of a city upgrade
   - Development cards could provide Knights (for Largest Army = 2 VP) or direct VP cards

4. **Development Card Consideration**:
   - Buying a development card now would cost 1 SHEEP, 1 WHEAT, 1 ORE
   - This would leave me with 1 BRICK, 1 SHEEP, 2 WHEAT, 1 ORE
   - If I draw a Knight, I would have 2 Knights total, putting me closer to Largest Army
   - If I draw a Victory Point card, I immediately gain 1 VP
   - If I draw Road Building, I could expand toward wood production
   - Year of Plenty or Monopoly could help get resources I need

5. **Looking ahead**:
   - I'm currently 1 ORE short of upgrading to a city
   - Preserving resources now means I'd need to roll ORE production (on a 5) to complete a city
   - Buying a development card reduces my ability to immediately build a city if I produce ORE

## Decision

Buying a development card (option 1) is the better strategic move because:

1. It uses resources I have in surplus (SHEEP) while still preserving most of my WHEAT
2. It provides multiple potential benefits:
   - Possible Victory Point card (immediate VP gain)
   - Knight card would help me maintain robber control and progress toward Largest Army
   - Utility cards could help with resource acquisition
3. I'll still be positioned to build a city soon with just one more ORE production
4. Red has 7 cards which suggests they may be saving for a significant build - a Knight card could help disrupt their plans

<plan>
1. Buy development card to potentially get Knight/VP/utility card
2. Continue blocking RED's Wood production with the robber
3. Focus on collecting more ORE (need 1-3 more depending on card drawn) and maintain WHEAT reserves for upgrading settlement to city
4. After city upgrade, build roads toward node 0 to secure Wood(6) production
5. Work toward Largest Army advantage if I draw more Knights
</plan>

# Game Analysis for Catan Turn 19

I'll analyze the current game state and determine the optimal action for BLUE.

## Current Resources
- I have: 1 🧱BRICK, 1 🐑SHEEP, 2 🌾WHEAT, 1 ⛏️ORE
- I already possess 1 KNIGHT card and have played 1 KNIGHT previously
- I have 2 victory points from my 2 settlements

## Opponent Status
- RED has 2 VP from settlements
- RED has 7 hidden resource cards - they're at the robber limit
- The robber is currently on Wood(6), blocking RED's high-producing hex

## Available Options
- [0] End Turn - Keep my current resources
- [1] Buy Development Card - Cost: 1 SHEEP, 1 WHEAT, 1 ORE

## Strategic Analysis

If I buy a development card:
1. Benefits:
   - Could get a Victory Point card (immediate hidden VP)
   - Could get another Knight (moving toward Largest Army = 2 VP)
   - Could get Road Building, Year of Plenty, or Monopoly (all valuable utility)
   - Will reduce my hand size, protecting against potential robber
   
2. Costs:
   - Would use up my ORE and one WHEAT, which delays city building
   - City upgrade requires 3 ORE + 2 WHEAT, so I'd need 2 more ORE and still have 1 WHEAT

If I end my turn:
1. Benefits:
   - Preserve resources for future builds
   - Still have flexibility in my next turn
   
2. Drawbacks:
   - No immediate progress toward victory
   - Vulnerable to losing resources if RED rolls a 7

Given the probability distribution of development cards and my current position, buying a development card is the better strategic choice because:
1. I already have one played Knight, so getting another would put me closer to Largest Army
2. A Victory Point card would instantly bring me to 3 VP without RED knowing
3. I'm not close to building a city anyway (need 2 more ORE)
4. RED has 7 cards and might target me with the robber if they roll a 7

<plan>
1. Buy development card to potentially get Knight/VP/utility card
2. Continue blocking RED's Wood production with the robber
3. Focus on collecting ORE (need 2-3 more depending on card drawn) and maintain WHEAT reserves for upgrading settlement to city
4. After city upgrade, build roads toward node 0 to secure Wood(6) production
5. Work toward Largest Army advantage with my Knights

- Expand toward high-value hexes the opponent doesn't yet control

MID-GAME RESOURCE MANAGEMENT (TURNS 9-20):
- Target 3 cities minimum (worth 6 VP) - upgrade most productive settlements first
- Maintain 1 road per every 2 settlements for flexible expansion
- Always build a settlement when you have the resources (more production points)
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each build (cities give best long-term return)
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1 or better) to maintain resource balance
- Keep at least one viable road-building path open at all times
- If blocked from expansion, shift to city upgrades and development cards

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Development cards should supplement your expansion, not replace it
- Prioritize using Knight cards to protect your best hexes from the robber
- Save Knights when you're ahead to counter the opponent's robber placements
- Only buy development cards when you:
  1. Have excess sheep/wheat/ore but lack wood/brick for expansion
  2. Are close to securing largest army
  3. Need a specific card type (Road Building to break through a blockade)
- Use Road Building cards to save brick/wood and create surprise expansion paths
- Time Monopoly cards to capture opponent's stockpile after high-producing rolls
- Use Year of Plenty to complete crucial builds when short on specific resources

ROBBER PLACEMENT:
- Always target the opponent's highest-producing hex (high number + settlement/city)
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat hexes to slow city development
- If opponent relies heavily on one resource, target that resource's hexes
- Never place the robber on your own high-production hexes
- When stealing, target resources you immediately need for your next build

VICTORY PATH PLANNING:
- Target resource independence with at least one settlement/city on each resource
- Minimum viable infrastructure: 3-4 settlements total, with 2-3 upgraded to cities
- Calculate multiple paths to 10 VP and pursue the fastest:
  Path 1: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP)
  Path 2: 4 cities (8 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP)
  Path 3: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 victory point card
- Always track your direct path to 10 VP and focus on those builds
- Prioritize visible points (settlements/cities) over speculative development cards
- Switch paths if the opponent blocks your primary victory path
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Accept trades only when they enable an immediate, crucial build
- Never make trades that allow opponent to build a settlement or city immediately
- Trade away excess resources when at risk for robber (7+ cards)
- Calculate the production value of each settlement location before deciding to build
- When trading with ports, plan sequences that convert unwanted resources into needed ones

DETAILED DECISION FRAMEWORK:
1. Does this move bring me closer to 10 victory points?
2. Does this move increase my production capacity more than alternative builds?
3. Does this move protect me from being blocked or cut off?
4. Does this move position me for strongest expansion in next 2-3 turns?
5. Is this the most efficient use of my current resources?

- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 21 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Buy development card to potentially get Knight/VP/utility card
2. Continue blocking RED's Wood production with the robber
3. Focus on collecting ORE (need 2-3 more depending on card drawn) and maintain WHEAT reserves for upgrading settlement to city
4. After city upgrade, build roads toward node 0 to secure Wood(6) production
5. Work toward Largest Army advantage with my Knights

# Game Analysis for Turn 21

Let me analyze my current position and available actions to make the optimal strategic decision.

## Current Game State Assessment
- I have 2/10 victory points from 2 settlements
- I have 1 Brick, 1 Wheat, and 1 Ore resource
- I possess 2 unplayed Knight cards and have played 1 Knight already
- The robber is currently on the Wood(6) hex, blocking RED's valuable production
- RED has 3 victory points (1 settlement + 1 city) and 3 hidden resource cards

## Available Actions
0. Play Knight card - Move the robber and steal a resource
1. Roll the dice

## Strategic Analysis

Let me consider the implications of each action:

### Option 0: Play Knight Card
Benefits:
- I can reposition the robber to continue disrupting RED's production
- I can steal one of RED's 3 resource cards
- I'll be at 2 played Knights, making progress toward Largest Army (need 3)

Downsides:
- Playing the Knight now doesn't enable me to build anything immediately
- If I roll a 7 after playing the Knight, I'd waste the opportunity to move the robber twice

### Option 1: Roll the Dice
Benefits:
- I could gain more resources to potentially build something right away
- There's a chance I roll a 7 myself and can move the robber without using my Knight
- I preserve my Knight card for when it might have greater strategic value

Downsides:
- If I don't roll resources I need, I'll still be short of making a significant build
- The robber is already on a good position (RED's Wood hex)

## Decision Logic

Since I already have 1 Brick, 1 Wheat, and 1 Ore, a good roll could potentially give me:
- More Ore (from a 5) to get closer to a city upgrade (need 3 Ore total)
- Wood (from a 6) if the robber is moved
- Additional resources to possibly build a road (need Wood)

The Knight card can be most valuable when:
1. I need to move the robber from blocking my resources
2. I need a specific resource from my opponent that would enable a build
3. I'm close to securing Largest Army

Currently:
- The robber is already in a good position blocking RED
- I don't know if RED has a critical resource I need
- I'm still one Knight away from Largest Army even after playing this one

My best move is to roll first, then evaluate using the Knight based on what resources I gain and what RED might be collecting.

<plan>
1. Roll the dice to potentially gain resources
2. Use Knight strategically after the roll if needed
3. Continue focusing on gaining resources for a city upgrade (need more Ore)
4. Work toward expansion toward node 0 for Wood(6) access
5. Build toward Largest Army advantage with my Knights at the right time
</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist whose primary goal is to defeat the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (HIGHEST PRIORITY):
- Target 6 & 8 numbered hexes at all costs - these are the most productive numbers
- Prioritize ore and wheat hexes for your settlements - they enable cities and development cards
- Position yourself on at least one good brick and wood hex to enable early expansion
- Aim to cover ALL five resources with your two settlements combined
- Try to place on intersections with 3 productive hexes rather than 2
- Evaluate probability dots (not just numbers) - more dots mean more frequent production
- Place settlements with clear expansion paths that won't be easily blocked
- Avoid placing where you'll be immediately cut off by the opponent
- Position roads toward your next planned settlement location
- Consider distance to valuable ports (especially 2:1 ports matching your abundant resources)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-8):
- Build at least one new road and one new settlement ASAP
- Focus on securing access to any missing resources through expansion
- Establish access to a port if you're lacking a key resource
- Prevent the opponent from cutting off your expansion path
- Only purchase development cards if excess resources available or for immediate victory
- Expand toward high-value hexes the opponent doesn't yet control

MID-GAME RESOURCE MANAGEMENT (TURNS 9-20):
- Target 3 cities minimum (worth 6 VP) - upgrade most productive settlements first
- Maintain 1 road per every 2 settlements for flexible expansion
- Always build a settlement when you have the resources (more production points)
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each build (cities give best long-term return)
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1 or better) to maintain resource balance
- Keep at least one viable road-building path open at all times
- If blocked from expansion, shift to city upgrades and development cards

# Game State Analysis

I'll analyze the current game state carefully to make the best decision.

## Current Resources
I have: 1 🧱BRICK, 1 🌾WHEAT, 2 ⛏️ORE
My opponent has: 4 cards (hidden)

## Victory Points Status
- RED: 3 VP (1 settlement, 1 city, no longest road/largest army)
- BLUE (me): 2 VP (2 settlements, no city, no longest road/largest army)
I'm behind by 1 VP.

## Development Cards
I have 2 KNIGHT cards in hand and have already played 1 KNIGHT. If I play another, I'll have 2 played Knights vs. 0 for my opponent, getting closer to Largest Army (3 knights needed).

## The Robber
Currently on the Wood(6) hex, which is:
- Used by RED's city and settlement (very productive for them)
- Not used by me

## Available Actions
0. Play Knight card - Move robber and steal
1. End my turn

## Decision Analysis

If I play my Knight:
1. I can move the robber from the Wood(6) hex to another productive hex for RED
2. I can steal a card from RED (they have 4)
3. I'll be at 2 played Knights, needing only 1 more for Largest Army (2 VP)

If I end my turn:
1. I don't make immediate progress
2. I keep my Knight for future use
3. The robber stays blocking wood production which hurts RED but not me

Since I lack wood resources and need more resources in general to advance my position, playing the Knight could help me:
- Get a needed resource through stealing
- Move the robber from a hex that doesn't affect me
- Progress toward Largest Army

<plan>
1. Play Knight card to move the robber to RED's Wheat(8) hex
2. Steal a resource from RED
3. Continue saving resources to upgrade a settlement to a city (need more ore)
4. Purchase more development cards when possible to secure Largest Army
5. Work toward expansion when brick and wood become available
</plan>

The optimal play is to use my Knight card now, as it gives me immediate gain through resource stealing and positions me closer to Largest Army.

# Analyzing the Game State and Robber Placement Options

I need to decide where to place the robber for maximum strategic advantage. Let me analyze each option:

## Current Game Status
- I (BLUE) have 2 VP, 2 knights played
- RED has 3 VP (1 settlement, 1 city)
- My resources: 1 Brick, 1 Wheat, 2 Ore
- I have 1 Knight card available

## Robber Placement Options Analysis
[0] Move to (0, 0, 0) - Sheep hex with production value 4 (1 dot)
- RED has a city that produces from this hex
- Low production value (4 is uncommon)

[1] Move to (1, -1, 0) - Wheat hex with production value 10 (1 dot)
- My settlement produces from this hex
- Would hurt my own production
- Very low probability hex (10 is rare)

[2] Move to (0, -1, 1) - Desert hex
- No production here anyway
- Completely wasted move

[3] Move to (-1, 0, 1) - Brick hex with production value 3 (1 dot)
- My settlement produces from this hex
- Would hurt my own production
- Very low probability (3 is rare)

[4] Move to (-1, 1, 0) - Wheat hex with production value 8 (3 dots)
- Both RED and I have settlements that produce from this
- High probability hex (8 is common - 3 dots)
- Wheat is crucial for cities and development cards

[5] Move to (1, 0, -1) - Ore hex with production value 5 (2 dots)
- Both RED and I have settlements that produce from this
- Medium probability hex (5 is average - 2 dots)
- Ore is crucial for cities and development cards

## Strategic Decision
Looking at RED's production:
- RED's city at node 5 produces from Sheep(4), Wheat(8), and Wood(6) - all high value
- RED's settlement at node 20 produces from Wood(6) and Ore(5)

The most strategic move is to target RED's highest production hex that doesn't significantly harm my own production. Option [4] would block Wheat(8) which is a powerful production hex with value 8, but it also affects my own settlement. Option [5] would block Ore(5) which affects both RED and me equally.

Since RED has a city (likely aiming to build more), blocking their access to wheat (option [4]) or ore (option [5]) would slow their city building. Between these options, option [4] blocks the more productive hex (8 has higher probability than 5), but it also impacts my own settlement at node 15.

<plan>
1. Move the robber to RED's Wheat(8) hex to block their high-value city production
2. Steal a resource from RED
3. Save resources to build a city (need more ore)
4. Purchase more development cards when possible to secure Largest Army
5. Use brick efficiently for expansion when wood becomes available
</plan>

After careful consideration, I'll place the robber on the Wheat hex with value 8, as it will most significantly impact RED's high-production city while I can still get wheat from my other settlement at node 1.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist whose primary goal is to defeat the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (HIGHEST PRIORITY):
- Target 6 & 8 numbered hexes at all costs - these are the most productive numbers
- Prioritize ore and wheat hexes for your settlements - they enable cities and development cards
- Position yourself on at least one good brick and wood hex to enable early expansion
- Aim to cover ALL five resources with your two settlements combined
- Try to place on intersections with 3 productive hexes rather than 2
- Evaluate probability dots (not just numbers) - more dots mean more frequent production
- Place settlements with clear expansion paths that won't be easily blocked
- Avoid placing where you'll be immediately cut off by the opponent
- Position roads toward your next planned settlement location
- Consider distance to valuable ports (especially 2:1 ports matching your abundant resources)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-8):
- Build at least one new road and one new settlement ASAP
- Focus on securing access to any missing resources through expansion
- Establish access to a port if you're lacking a key resource
- Prevent the opponent from cutting off your expansion path
- Only purchase development cards if excess resources available or for immediate victory
- Expand toward high-value hexes the opponent doesn't yet control

MID-GAME RESOURCE MANAGEMENT (TURNS 9-20):
- Target 3 cities minimum (worth 6 VP) - upgrade most productive settlements first
- Maintain 1 road per every 2 settlements for flexible expansion
- Always build a settlement when you have the resources (more production points)
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each build (cities give best long-term return)
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1 or better) to maintain resource balance
- Keep at least one viable road-building path open at all times
- If blocked from expansion, shift to city upgrades and development cards

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Development cards should supplement your expansion, not replace it
- Prioritize using Knight cards to protect your best hexes from the robber
- Save Knights when you're ahead to counter the opponent's robber placements
- Only buy development cards when you:
  1. Have excess sheep/wheat/ore but lack wood/brick for expansion
  2. Are close to securing largest army
  3. Need a specific card type (Road Building to break through a blockade)
- Use Road Building cards to save brick/wood and create surprise expansion paths
- Time Monopoly cards to capture opponent's stockpile after high-producing rolls
- Use Year of Plenty to complete crucial builds when short on specific resources

ROBBER PLACEMENT:
- Always target the opponent's highest-producing hex (high number + settlement/city)
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat hexes to slow city development
- If opponent relies heavily on one resource, target that resource's hexes
- Never place the robber on your own high-production hexes
- When stealing, target resources you immediately need for your next build

VICTORY PATH PLANNING:
- Target resource independence with at least one settlement/city on each resource
- Minimum viable infrastructure: 3-4 settlements total, with 2-3 upgraded to cities
- Calculate multiple paths to 10 VP and pursue the fastest:
  Path 1: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP)
  Path 2: 4 cities (8 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP)
  Path 3: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 victory point card
- Always track your direct path to 10 VP and focus on those builds
- Prioritize visible points (settlements/cities) over speculative development cards
- Switch paths if the opponent blocks your primary victory path
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Accept trades only when they enable an immediate, crucial build
- Never make trades that allow opponent to build a settlement or city immediately
- Trade away excess resources when at risk for robber (7+ cards)
- Calculate the production value of each settlement location before deciding to build
- When trading with ports, plan sequences that convert unwanted resources into needed ones

DETAILED DECISION FRAMEWORK:
1. Does this move bring me closer to 10 victory points?
2. Does this move increase my production capacity more than alternative builds?
3. Does this move protect me from being blocked or cut off?
4. Does this move position me for strongest expansion in next 2-3 turns?
5. Is this the most efficient use of my current resources?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 21 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Move the robber to RED's Wheat(8) hex to block their high-value city production
2. Steal a resource from RED
3. Save resources to build a city (need more ore)
4. Purchase more development cards when possible to secure Largest Army
5. Use brick efficiently for expansion when wood becomes available

# Game Analysis for Turn 21

I'll analyze the current game state and determine the optimal action to maximize my chances of winning against the AlphaBeta algorithm.

## Current Game State Assessment
- I have 2 VP (2 settlements)
- Red has 3 VP (1 settlement, 1 city)
- I have 2 Knights played, close to securing Largest Army (need 1 more Knight)
- Resources: 1 🧱BRICK, 1 🐑SHEEP, 1 🌾WHEAT, 2 ⛏️ORE
- I have 1 KNIGHT development card already

## Resource Production Analysis
- My settlements produce: 🧱3[⭐], 🌾8[⭐⭐⭐], 🐑4[⭐], 🌾10[⭐], ⛏️5[⭐⭐]
- I have good ore and wheat production (key for cities and development cards)
- The robber is currently on Red's wheat hex (8), which is also my wheat hex

## Available Actions
1. Buy a development card (1 🐑SHEEP, 1 🌾WHEAT, 1 ⛏️ORE)
2. End my turn

## Strategic Considerations
- Buying a development card would use most of my resources
- I already have a Knight card - if I draw another and play both, I'll secure Largest Army (2 VP)
- Even if I don't draw a Knight, other development cards (Victory Point, Road Building, Year of Plenty, Monopoly) are all valuable
- If I end my turn, I'll accumulate more resources but won't make immediate progress

<plan>
1. Buy a development card to maximize chances of securing Largest Army
2. If I get a Knight, play it next turn to get Largest Army (2 VP)
3. Save remaining resources toward city upgrade (especially collecting ore)
4. Continue blocking Red's wheat production with robber
5. Look for settlement expansion opportunities when wood becomes available
</plan>

Buying a development card is clearly the best move here:
- It gives me a chance to secure Largest Army next turn
- Even non-Knight cards help my position
- I'll still have some resources left (1 brick, 1 ore)

Therefore, I'll choose to buy a development card.

# Game Analysis - Turn 23

I need to decide whether to play a Knight card now or roll the dice. Let me analyze my options carefully.

## Current Situation:
- I have 2 settlements (2 VP)
- I have already played 2 Knights
- I have 2 more Knight cards available to play
- I have 1 brick and 1 ore in hand
- The robber is currently on hex (-1, 1, 0), which is the wheat hex with a value of 8

## Option 0: Play Knight Card
Advantages:
- I would move the robber from the wheat 8 hex, potentially allowing me to produce wheat on a roll of 8
- I could place the robber on another of Red's productive hexes
- I could steal a card from Red (who has 3 cards)
- I would have played 3 Knights total, which would give me Largest Army (2 VP)

Disadvantages:
- I would use a Knight before rolling, which might be unnecessary if I roll something other than 7
- I wouldn't get the benefit of immediately producing resources this turn

## Option 1: Roll the Dice
Advantages:
- I could potentially gain more resources before making decisions
- If I roll a 7, I can still play a Knight card afterward to avoid losing resources
- I preserve the Knight card for potential use after seeing my roll

Disadvantages:
- If I roll an 8, I won't produce wheat since the robber is there
- If I roll a 7, I would need to move the robber anyway (but I could play Knight to avoid this)

## Strategic Analysis:
Playing the Knight now would immediately give me Largest Army (2 VP), boosting me to 4 VP total. This is a major advantage. Additionally, moving the robber off the wheat 8 hex could help my production on future turns.

Given that I already have 2 Knight cards played, playing another would secure Largest Army before Red has a chance to compete for it. This is a significant strategic advantage.

<plan>
1. Play Knight now to secure Largest Army (2 VP)
2. Move robber to Red's sheep 4 or brick 6 hex to disrupt their production
3. Save resources toward city upgrade, focusing on collecting ore and wheat
4. Look for settlement expansion opportunities when wood becomes available
</plan>

The optimal move is to play the Knight card now to secure the immediate 2 VP from Largest Army.

- Maintain 1 road per every 2 settlements for flexible expansion
- Always build a settlement when you have the resources (more production points)
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each build (cities give best long-term return)
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1 or better) to maintain resource balance
- Keep at least one viable road-building path open at all times
- If blocked from expansion, shift to city upgrades and development cards

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Development cards should supplement your expansion, not replace it
- Prioritize using Knight cards to protect your best hexes from the robber
- Save Knights when you're ahead to counter the opponent's robber placements
- Only buy development cards when you:
  1. Have excess sheep/wheat/ore but lack wood/brick for expansion
  2. Are close to securing largest army
  3. Need a specific card type (Road Building to break through a blockade)
- Use Road Building cards to save brick/wood and create surprise expansion paths
- Time Monopoly cards to capture opponent's stockpile after high-producing rolls
- Use Year of Plenty to complete crucial builds when short on specific resources

ROBBER PLACEMENT:
- Always target the opponent's highest-producing hex (high number + settlement/city)
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat hexes to slow city development
- If opponent relies heavily on one resource, target that resource's hexes
- Never place the robber on your own high-production hexes
- When stealing, target resources you immediately need for your next build

VICTORY PATH PLANNING:
- Target resource independence with at least one settlement/city on each resource
- Minimum viable infrastructure: 3-4 settlements total, with 2-3 upgraded to cities
- Calculate multiple paths to 10 VP and pursue the fastest:
  Path 1: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP)
  Path 2: 4 cities (8 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP)
  Path 3: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 victory point card
- Always track your direct path to 10 VP and focus on those builds
- Prioritize visible points (settlements/cities) over speculative development cards
- Switch paths if the opponent blocks your primary victory path
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Accept trades only when they enable an immediate, crucial build
- Never make trades that allow opponent to build a settlement or city immediately
- Trade away excess resources when at risk for robber (7+ cards)
- Calculate the production value of each settlement location before deciding to build
- When trading with ports, plan sequences that convert unwanted resources into needed ones

DETAILED DECISION FRAMEWORK:
1. Does this move bring me closer to 10 victory points?
2. Does this move increase my production capacity more than alternative builds?
3. Does this move protect me from being blocked or cut off?
4. Does this move position me for strongest expansion in next 2-3 turns?
5. Is this the most efficient use of my current resources?

# Analyzing Move Robber Options

Let me think through each option for moving the robber:

**Option 0**: Move to sheep hex (0, 0, 0) and steal from RED
- This sheep hex produces on a roll of 4 (1 dot)
- RED has a city at node 5 connected to this hex
- Would disrupt one of RED's resources

**Option 1**: Move to wheat hex (1, -1, 0)
- This wheat hex produces on a roll of 10 (1 dot)
- My own settlement at node 1 is connected to this hex
- Would hurt my own production and no opponent is here

**Option 2**: Move to desert hex (0, -1, 1)
- This is a desert hex which produces no resources
- Wasting the robber placement

**Option 3**: Move to brick hex (-1, 0, 1)
- This brick hex produces on a roll of 3 (1 dot)
- My settlement at node 15 is connected to this hex
- Would hurt my own production and no opponent is here

**Option 4**: Move to wood hex (0, 1, -1) and steal from RED
- This wood hex produces on a roll of 6 (3 dots)
- RED's settlement at node 20 is connected to this hex
- High production value (3 dots) that I'd be blocking

**Option 5**: Move to ore hex (1, 0, -1) and steal from RED
- This ore hex produces on a roll of 5 (2 dots)
- RED's settlement at node 20 is connected to this hex
- My settlement at node 1 is also connected
- Would hurt both my production and RED's

## Strategy Assessment

RED has two productive buildings:
1. A city at node 5 that produces sheep(4), wheat(8), and wood(6)
2. A settlement at node 20 that produces wood(6) and ore(5)

The most disruptive moves would be:
- Option 4: Block wood(6) - This disrupts RED's high-value wood production (3 dots) which they get from both buildings
- Option 0: Block sheep(4) - This disrupts RED's city production but only on a low probability roll (1 dot)

Since I need to build and expand, interfering with RED's wood production is most strategic, as wood is essential for roads and settlements. This would slow their expansion while I try to build up.

<plan>
1. Move robber to wood hex to block RED's high-production resource
2. Save resources toward city upgrade, continuing to collect ore and wheat
3. Use my Knight card as needed if the robber is placed on my important hexes
4. Look for settlement expansion opportunities when I acquire wood
</plan>

The optimal choice is to move the robber to the wood hex (0, 1, -1) and steal from RED.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist whose primary goal is to defeat the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (HIGHEST PRIORITY):
- Target 6 & 8 numbered hexes at all costs - these are the most productive numbers
- Prioritize ore and wheat hexes for your settlements - they enable cities and development cards
- Position yourself on at least one good brick and wood hex to enable early expansion
- Aim to cover ALL five resources with your two settlements combined
- Try to place on intersections with 3 productive hexes rather than 2
- Evaluate probability dots (not just numbers) - more dots mean more frequent production
- Place settlements with clear expansion paths that won't be easily blocked
- Avoid placing where you'll be immediately cut off by the opponent
- Position roads toward your next planned settlement location
- Consider distance to valuable ports (especially 2:1 ports matching your abundant resources)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-8):
- Build at least one new road and one new settlement ASAP
- Focus on securing access to any missing resources through expansion
- Establish access to a port if you're lacking a key resource
- Prevent the opponent from cutting off your expansion path
- Only purchase development cards if excess resources available or for immediate victory
- Expand toward high-value hexes the opponent doesn't yet control

❓ Select action by number (0-1):


Based on this information, which action number do you choose? Think step by step about your options, then put the final action number in a box like \boxed{1}.
RESPONSE:
I'll analyze the current game state and determine the optimal action for this turn.

## Current Situation Analysis
- I (BLUE) have 4/10 victory points (2 settlements + 2 from largest army)
- Resources: 1 brick, 1 sheep, 2 ore
- I have 1 unplayed knight card
- The robber is currently on the wood hex (0, 1, -1), which is blocking RED's high-production resource
- RED has 3/10 victory points (1 settlement + 1 city)
- RED has 4 hidden resource cards

## Options Analysis

Option 0: Play Knight card
- Would move the robber to another hex
- Could steal a resource from RED (who has 4 cards)
- Would strengthen my largest army lead (going from 3 to 4 knights)

Option 1: Roll the dice
- Could generate more resources based on my settlements
- My settlements produce on 3, 4, 5, 8, and 10
- Risks a 7 roll which would activate the robber

## Strategic Considerations
1. The robber is already on a good position for me (RED's wood hex with number 6)
2. Playing a knight now would move the robber from an already advantageous position
3. I need more resources to progress toward building a city (need 3 ore + 2 wheat)
4. My knight card can be saved for when the robber is moved against me

<plan>
1. Keep collecting resources to upgrade one of my settlements to a city
2. Save my knight card for defensive purposes when the robber targets my high-production hexes
3. Focus on gathering ore and wheat for city upgrade (need 1 more ore and 2 wheat)
4. Once I have a city, look for settlement expansion opportunities
</plan>

Given this analysis, the optimal action is to roll the dice to collect more resources while the robber is already in a good position blocking RED's high-production wood hex. Playing the knight would require moving the robber from this advantageous position.

# Game Analysis

Let me analyze my current position and available actions:

## Current Game State Assessment
- I have 4 VPs (2 from settlements, 2 from largest army)
- I have 1 brick, 1 sheep, 2 ore, and 0 wood, 0 wheat
- I have 1 Knight card I could play
- The robber is on a forest hex (wood, 6) that my opponent uses but I don't
- My opponent has 3 VPs (1 settlement, 1 city, worth 3 points total)
- My opponent has 4 hidden cards

## Resource Analysis
- I need 2 wheat + 3 ore to upgrade a settlement to a city (+1 VP)
- I'm currently missing wheat completely
- I have 2 ore already, so I need only 1 more ore for a city upgrade

## Available Actions
0. Play Knight card - Move robber and steal a resource
1. End turn

## Action 0: Play Knight Card
- Benefits: I could target a hex my opponent uses (like wheat 8 or ore 5) and potentially steal a needed resource
- Downside: I'd use up my defensive Knight card that I was saving for when the robber targets my own production
- The robber is already on a hex that doesn't affect me (wood 6), so defensively there's limited value in moving it

## Action 1: End Turn
- I can't build anything with my current resources
- I'd keep my Knight card for defense
- I'd hope for favorable rolls next turn to gain more resources

<plan>
1. End my turn to preserve my Knight card for defense
2. Continue collecting resources for city upgrade (need 1 more ore, 2 wheat)
3. If the opponent doesn't place the robber on my hexes, I'll reassess using my Knight card offensively next turn
4. After upgrading a settlement to a city, I'll focus on building roads and a new settlement toward valuable resources
</plan>

Since I can't build anything useful this turn and the robber is already not affecting my production, there's no urgent reason to play the Knight card. I should save it for when I really need it defensively or when I'm closer to having the resources for a city.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist whose primary goal is to defeat the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (HIGHEST PRIORITY):
- Target 6 & 8 numbered hexes at all costs - these are the most productive numbers
- Prioritize ore and wheat hexes for your settlements - they enable cities and development cards
- Position yourself on at least one good brick and wood hex to enable early expansion
- Aim to cover ALL five resources with your two settlements combined
- Try to place on intersections with 3 productive hexes rather than 2
- Evaluate probability dots (not just numbers) - more dots mean more frequent production
- Place settlements with clear expansion paths that won't be easily blocked
- Avoid placing where you'll be immediately cut off by the opponent
- Position roads toward your next planned settlement location
- Consider distance to valuable ports (especially 2:1 ports matching your abundant resources)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-8):
- Build at least one new road and one new settlement ASAP
- Focus on securing access to any missing resources through expansion
- Establish access to a port if you're lacking a key resource
- Prevent the opponent from cutting off your expansion path
- Only purchase development cards if excess resources available or for immediate victory
- Expand toward high-value hexes the opponent doesn't yet control

MID-GAME RESOURCE MANAGEMENT (TURNS 9-20):
- Target 3 cities minimum (worth 6 VP) - upgrade most productive settlements first
- Maintain 1 road per every 2 settlements for flexible expansion
- Always build a settlement when you have the resources (more production points)
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each build (cities give best long-term return)
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1 or better) to maintain resource balance
- Keep at least one viable road-building path open at all times
- If blocked from expansion, shift to city upgrades and development cards

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Development cards should supplement your expansion, not replace it
- Prioritize using Knight cards to protect your best hexes from the robber
- Save Knights when you're ahead to counter the opponent's robber placements
- Only buy development cards when you:
  1. Have excess sheep/wheat/ore but lack wood/brick for expansion
  2. Are close to securing largest army
  3. Need a specific card type (Road Building to break through a blockade)
- Use Road Building cards to save brick/wood and create surprise expansion paths
- Time Monopoly cards to capture opponent's stockpile after high-producing rolls
- Use Year of Plenty to complete crucial builds when short on specific resources

ROBBER PLACEMENT:
- Always target the opponent's highest-producing hex (high number + settlement/city)
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat hexes to slow city development
- If opponent relies heavily on one resource, target that resource's hexes
- Never place the robber on your own high-production hexes
- When stealing, target resources you immediately need for your next build

VICTORY PATH PLANNING:
- Target resource independence with at least one settlement/city on each resource
- Minimum viable infrastructure: 3-4 settlements total, with 2-3 upgraded to cities
- Calculate multiple paths to 10 VP and pursue the fastest:
  Path 1: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP)
  Path 2: 4 cities (8 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP)
  Path 3: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 victory point card
- Always track your direct path to 10 VP and focus on those builds
- Prioritize visible points (settlements/cities) over speculative development cards
- Switch paths if the opponent blocks your primary victory path
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Accept trades only when they enable an immediate, crucial build
- Never make trades that allow opponent to build a settlement or city immediately
- Trade away excess resources when at risk for robber (7+ cards)
- Calculate the production value of each settlement location before deciding to build
- When trading with ports, plan sequences that convert unwanted resources into needed ones

DETAILED DECISION FRAMEWORK:
1. Does this move bring me closer to 10 victory points?
2. Does this move increase my production capacity more than alternative builds?
3. Does this move protect me from being blocked or cut off?
4. Does this move position me for strongest expansion in next 2-3 turns?
5. Is this the most efficient use of my current resources?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

4. After upgrading a settlement to a city, I'll focus on building roads and a new settlement toward valuable resources

Based on this information, which action number do you choose? Think step by step about your options, then put the final action number in a box like \boxed{1}.
RESPONSE:
I need to decide between playing my Knight card or rolling the dice. Let me analyze the game state and my options carefully.

Current game state:
- I have 4 VP (2 settlements + 2 for largest army)
- I have 1 brick, 1 sheep, and 2 ore
- I need 3 ore and 2 wheat for a city upgrade
- I have 1 Knight card in hand
- The robber is currently on the wood hex (0,1,-1) with value 6

Option 0: Play Knight card
- Advantages:
  * Can move the robber off the valuable wood hex (which is producing for both RED and me)
  * Could place it on RED's wheat hex (8) to block their strong production
  * Could steal a resource from RED (who has 4 cards)
  * Increases my lead in knights (from 3 to 4)
- Disadvantages:
  * I already have the largest army bonus
  * Knight card could be more valuable as defense if RED rolls a 7
  * I don't have any immediate build I can complete with one more resource

Option 1: Roll dice
- Advantages:
  * Could collect resources to get closer to my city upgrade
  * Preserves my Knight card for defensive purposes
  * More aligned with my current plan
- Disadvantages:
  * If I roll a 7, I'll lose the opportunity to use the Knight card offensively
  * RED will get to roll next and potentially block my production

Strategic considerations:
1. My path to victory requires upgrading at least one settlement to a city
2. I'm still missing key resources (especially wheat) for my city upgrade
3. The robber is currently on wood which hurts both RED and me
4. Playing my Knight now doesn't enable any immediate builds

<plan>
1. Roll the dice to collect resources toward my city upgrade
2. Continue preserving my Knight card for defense against RED's robber placement
3. Focus on getting wheat and additional ore for my city upgrade
4. After city upgrade, look to expand with roads and settlements
</plan>

Based on this analysis, rolling the dice is the better option. I don't have an immediate build that playing the Knight would enable, and I want to preserve the Knight for defensive purposes. I'll stick with my original plan.

# Game Analysis for Turn 27

I'll evaluate my current position and available actions to determine the optimal move:

## Current Game State Assessment:
- I have 4 VP (2 settlements + 2 VP from largest army)
- Resources: 1 🧱Brick, 2 🐑Sheep, 2 ⛏️Ore
- 1 Knight card in hand, already played 3 (have largest army)
- The robber is on the 🌲6 hex, which is affecting RED (not me)

## Available Actions Analysis:
[0] Play Knight card - This would let me move the robber and steal from RED
[1] End my turn

## Strategic Considerations:

1. **Resource Needs**: 
   - To upgrade a settlement to a city: 3 ore + 2 wheat
   - I have 2 ore but no wheat, so I can't build a city this turn

2. **Robber Position**:
   - Currently on a 🌲6 hex that affects RED but not me
   - Moving it would be primarily to steal a resource, not to remove it from my hex

3. **Knight Card Usage**:
   - Using the Knight would maintain my largest army but doesn't grow it
   - RED has no knights played, so my largest army (2VP) is not threatened
   - Saving the Knight provides defense against future robber placements

4. **Resource Stealing Potential**:
   - RED has 6 cards, giving reasonable odds of stealing something useful
   - I particularly need wheat for my city upgrade

## Decision Logic:
Since I'm not in immediate danger of losing largest army, and the robber isn't affecting my production, the main benefit of playing the Knight would be the potential resource steal from RED. With 6 cards in their hand, there's a good chance I might get wheat, which I need.

However, saving the Knight for defense when I really need it (if RED places the robber on my valuable 8-wheat hex) is also valuable.

<plan>
1. End my turn and roll dice next turn to collect resources
2. Continue preserving Knight card for defense against RED's robber placement
3. Focus on getting wheat and additional ore for city upgrade
4. After city upgrade, look to expand with roads and settlements toward valuable nodes
</plan>

The optimal play is to save resources and the Knight card for when they provide more strategic value. Ending my turn is the better option.

- Target resource independence with at least one settlement/city on each resource
- Minimum viable infrastructure: 3-4 settlements total, with 2-3 upgraded to cities
- Calculate multiple paths to 10 VP and pursue the fastest:
  Path 1: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP)
  Path 2: 4 cities (8 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP)
  Path 3: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 victory point card
- Always track your direct path to 10 VP and focus on those builds
- Prioritize visible points (settlements/cities) over speculative development cards
- Switch paths if the opponent blocks your primary victory path
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Accept trades only when they enable an immediate, crucial build
- Never make trades that allow opponent to build a settlement or city immediately
- Trade away excess resources when at risk for robber (7+ cards)
- Calculate the production value of each settlement location before deciding to build
- When trading with ports, plan sequences that convert unwanted resources into needed ones

DETAILED DECISION FRAMEWORK:
1. Does this move bring me closer to 10 victory points?
2. Does this move increase my production capacity more than alternative builds?
3. Does this move protect me from being blocked or cut off?
4. Does this move position me for strongest expansion in next 2-3 turns?
5. Is this the most efficient use of my current resources?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 29 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. End my turn and roll dice next turn to collect resources
2. Continue preserving Knight card for defense against RED's robber placement
3. Focus on getting wheat and additional ore for city upgrade
4. After city upgrade, look to expand with roads and settlements toward valuable nodes

# Game Analysis - Turn 29

Let me analyze the current game state and available actions:

## Game State Overview
- I have 4/10 victory points (2 settlements + 2 VP from largest army)
- RED has 3/10 victory points (1 settlement + 1 city)
- I have resources: 1 🧱BRICK, 2 🐑SHEEP, 1 🌾WHEAT, 2 ⛏️ORE
- I have 1 unplayed KNIGHT card
- The robber is currently on the 🌲6 hex (0, 1, -1), which is blocking a productive hex

## Decision Analysis
I have two options:
1. Play my Knight card to move the robber and steal a resource
2. Roll the dice to collect resources

### Option 1: Play Knight Card
Advantages:
- Could move the robber from the Wood hex to block RED's high-producing hex (likely the 8 Wheat)
- Would steal a resource from RED (potentially useful)

Disadvantages:
- I don't urgently need to move the robber as it's not on any of my producing hexes
- I should save the Knight card for defense or when I really need a specific resource
- Using it now without an immediate need reduces my defensive capability

### Option 2: Roll Dice
Advantages:
- Chance to gain additional resources to build my next strategic objective
- Preserves my Knight card for when I really need it
- With my current resources, I'm close to having enough for a city (need 3 ore + 2 wheat total)
- I'm not immediately threatened by RED player's moves

Looking at my current resources (1 brick, 2 sheep, 1 wheat, 2 ore), I need just 1 more ore and 1 more wheat to build a city. Rolling has a good chance of giving me these resources, especially if an 8 is rolled (my wheat hex).

## Strategic Plan Update
<plan>
1. Roll the dice to collect resources
2. Save my Knight card for defensive purposes or critical situations
3. Focus on upgrading one of my settlements to a city (need 1 more ore + 1 more wheat)
4. After city upgrade, build roads toward new settlement locations
5. Continue maintaining largest army advantage
</plan>

## Decision
Rolling the dice is the optimal move at this point. I should save the Knight card for a more strategic moment, such as when:
- RED places the robber on one of my critical hexes
- I desperately need a specific resource that I can steal
- I need to block RED from getting a crucial resource

Therefore, I choose option 1: Roll the dice.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist whose primary goal is to defeat the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (HIGHEST PRIORITY):
- Target 6 & 8 numbered hexes at all costs - these are the most productive numbers
- Prioritize ore and wheat hexes for your settlements - they enable cities and development cards
- Position yourself on at least one good brick and wood hex to enable early expansion
- Aim to cover ALL five resources with your two settlements combined
- Try to place on intersections with 3 productive hexes rather than 2
- Evaluate probability dots (not just numbers) - more dots mean more frequent production
- Place settlements with clear expansion paths that won't be easily blocked
- Avoid placing where you'll be immediately cut off by the opponent
- Position roads toward your next planned settlement location
- Consider distance to valuable ports (especially 2:1 ports matching your abundant resources)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-8):
- Build at least one new road and one new settlement ASAP
- Focus on securing access to any missing resources through expansion
- Establish access to a port if you're lacking a key resource
- Prevent the opponent from cutting off your expansion path
- Only purchase development cards if excess resources available or for immediate victory
- Expand toward high-value hexes the opponent doesn't yet control

MID-GAME RESOURCE MANAGEMENT (TURNS 9-20):
- Target 3 cities minimum (worth 6 VP) - upgrade most productive settlements first
- Maintain 1 road per every 2 settlements for flexible expansion
- Always build a settlement when you have the resources (more production points)
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each build (cities give best long-term return)
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1 or better) to maintain resource balance
- Keep at least one viable road-building path open at all times
- If blocked from expansion, shift to city upgrades and development cards

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Development cards should supplement your expansion, not replace it
- Prioritize using Knight cards to protect your best hexes from the robber
- Save Knights when you're ahead to counter the opponent's robber placements
- Only buy development cards when you:
  1. Have excess sheep/wheat/ore but lack wood/brick for expansion
  2. Are close to securing largest army
  3. Need a specific card type (Road Building to break through a blockade)
- Use Road Building cards to save brick/wood and create surprise expansion paths
- Time Monopoly cards to capture opponent's stockpile after high-producing rolls
- Use Year of Plenty to complete crucial builds when short on specific resources

ROBBER PLACEMENT:
- Always target the opponent's highest-producing hex (high number + settlement/city)
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat hexes to slow city development
- If opponent relies heavily on one resource, target that resource's hexes
- Never place the robber on your own high-production hexes
- When stealing, target resources you immediately need for your next build

VICTORY PATH PLANNING:
- Target resource independence with at least one settlement/city on each resource
- Minimum viable infrastructure: 3-4 settlements total, with 2-3 upgraded to cities
- Calculate multiple paths to 10 VP and pursue the fastest:
  Path 1: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP)
  Path 2: 4 cities (8 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP)
  Path 3: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 victory point card
- Always track your direct path to 10 VP and focus on those builds
- Prioritize visible points (settlements/cities) over speculative development cards
- Switch paths if the opponent blocks your primary victory path
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Accept trades only when they enable an immediate, crucial build
- Never make trades that allow opponent to build a settlement or city immediately
- Trade away excess resources when at risk for robber (7+ cards)
- Calculate the production value of each settlement location before deciding to build

# Game Analysis for Turn 29

Let me analyze the current game state and consider my options carefully.

## Current Game Status
- I (BLUE) have 4/10 victory points (2 VP from settlements, 2 VP from largest army)
- I have resources: 1 🧱BRICK, 2 🐑SHEEP, 2 🌾WHEAT, 2 ⛏️ORE
- I have 1 KNIGHT development card in hand
- RED has 3/10 victory points (1 from settlement, 2 from city)
- The robber is on the 🌲6 hex, which is blocking a high-production tile that affects both RED and me

## Available Actions
- [0] Play Knight card - Move the robber and steal from RED
- [1] End my turn
- [2] Buy a development card (costs 1 🐑SHEEP, 1 🌾WHEAT, 1 ⛏️ORE)

## Resource Analysis
With my current resources, I'm just short of upgrading a settlement to a city (need 3 ORE + 2 WHEAT, have 2 ORE + 2 WHEAT). I could buy a development card (have the exact resources needed).

## Strategic Considerations
1. **City Upgrade Path**: I need 1 more ORE to upgrade one settlement to city. This would give me +1 VP and better production.
2. **Development Card Strategy**: Buying a dev card could:
   - Potentially get another VP card (immediate benefit)
   - Get Road Building to expand faster
   - Get another Knight to strengthen my Largest Army lead
   - Get Monopoly/Year of Plenty for resource advantage
3. **Knight Card Usage**: I already have one Knight in hand. Playing it now would:
   - Move the robber from the 🌲6 tile (which affects both RED and me)
   - Let me steal a resource from RED who has 5 cards
   - Increase my Largest Army lead to 4 Knights (RED has none)

## Decision Logic
Given that:
- I need just 1 more ORE to upgrade to a city
- Buying a development card uses up ORE I need for the city upgrade
- RED has 5 cards, increasing my chances of stealing something useful
- Moving the robber could free up the 🌲6 tile which would benefit future production

The best strategic move is to play my Knight card [0]. This gives me the chance to steal potentially the ORE I need for a city upgrade while also improving my production by moving the robber from a tile that affects me.

<plan>
1. Play Knight card to move the robber to a hex that only affects RED player
2. Target stealing ORE from RED if possible
3. If I get the ORE I need, upgrade a settlement to a city on next turn
4. If not, continue collecting resources while maintaining largest army advantage
5. Consider buying a development card in future turns if I have excess resources
</plan>

# Game Analysis for Robber Placement

I need to carefully consider where to place the robber to maximize my advantage against the RED player while progressing toward my victory condition.

## Analyzing the Options

Let me evaluate each robber placement option:

**[0] Move robber to (0, 0, 0) and steal from RED**
- This targets the sheep hex with value 4 (1 dot)
- RED's city at node 5 produces from this hex
- Relatively low impact as sheep is not the most critical resource

**[1] Move robber to (1, -1, 0)**
- This targets the wheat hex with value 10 (1 dot)
- Only affects my own settlement at node 1
- Self-destructive choice that blocks my own production

**[2] Move robber to (0, -1, 1)**
- This targets the desert hex
- No production occurs here anyway
- Completely ineffective choice

**[3] Move robber to (-1, 0, 1)**
- This targets the brick hex with value 3 (1 dot)
- Only affects my settlement at node 15
- Self-destructive choice that blocks my own production

**[4] Move robber to (-1, 1, 0) and steal from RED**
- This targets the wheat hex with value 8 (3 dots)
- Affects both RED's city at node 5 and my settlement at node 15
- High impact but also hurts my own wheat production

**[5] Move robber to (1, 0, -1) and steal from RED**
- This targets the ore hex with value 5 (2 dots)
- Affects RED's settlement at node 20 and my settlement at node 1
- Blocks ore which is critical for city upgrades

## Strategic Considerations

1. RED's city at node 5 is very productive (on 8 wheat, 6 wood, 4 sheep)
2. I have 2 ore and 2 wheat currently - I need 3 ore and 2 wheat for a city upgrade
3. RED likely has ore in their 5 hidden cards since their settlement at node 20 produces it
4. Blocking RED's wheat production from their city would significantly slow them down

## Best Action Selection

Option [4] targeting the wheat hex with value 8 has the highest impact on RED's production capacity as it's connected to their city. While it also hurts my own wheat production, the tradeoff is worth it for three reasons:
1. It blocks RED's most productive hex (8 wheat with 3 dots)
2. I get to steal a card from RED which could be ore (exactly what I need)
3. This significantly slows down RED's ability to upgrade or expand

<plan>
1. Move robber to the wheat hex (-1, 1, 0) and steal from RED, hopefully getting ore
2. If I get ore, I'll have 3 ore and can upgrade one of my settlements to a city next turn
3. If I don't get ore, save resources for either a development card or continue toward city upgrade
4. Maintain largest army advantage while working toward 3 cities (6 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP)
</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist whose primary goal is to defeat the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (HIGHEST PRIORITY):
- Target 6 & 8 numbered hexes at all costs - these are the most productive numbers
- Prioritize ore and wheat hexes for your settlements - they enable cities and development cards
- Position yourself on at least one good brick and wood hex to enable early expansion
- Aim to cover ALL five resources with your two settlements combined
- Try to place on intersections with 3 productive hexes rather than 2
- Evaluate probability dots (not just numbers) - more dots mean more frequent production
- Place settlements with clear expansion paths that won't be easily blocked
- Avoid placing where you'll be immediately cut off by the opponent
- Position roads toward your next planned settlement location
- Consider distance to valuable ports (especially 2:1 ports matching your abundant resources)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-8):
- Build at least one new road and one new settlement ASAP
- Focus on securing access to any missing resources through expansion
- Establish access to a port if you're lacking a key resource
- Prevent the opponent from cutting off your expansion path
- Only purchase development cards if excess resources available or for immediate victory
- Expand toward high-value hexes the opponent doesn't yet control

MID-GAME RESOURCE MANAGEMENT (TURNS 9-20):
- Target 3 cities minimum (worth 6 VP) - upgrade most productive settlements first
- Maintain 1 road per every 2 settlements for flexible expansion
- Always build a settlement when you have the resources (more production points)
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each build (cities give best long-term return)
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1 or better) to maintain resource balance
- Keep at least one viable road-building path open at all times
- If blocked from expansion, shift to city upgrades and development cards

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Development cards should supplement your expansion, not replace it
- Prioritize using Knight cards to protect your best hexes from the robber
- Save Knights when you're ahead to counter the opponent's robber placements
- Only buy development cards when you:
  1. Have excess sheep/wheat/ore but lack wood/brick for expansion
  2. Are close to securing largest army
  3. Need a specific card type (Road Building to break through a blockade)
- Use Road Building cards to save brick/wood and create surprise expansion paths
- Time Monopoly cards to capture opponent's stockpile after high-producing rolls
- Use Year of Plenty to complete crucial builds when short on specific resources

ROBBER PLACEMENT:
- Always target the opponent's highest-producing hex (high number + settlement/city)
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat hexes to slow city development
- If opponent relies heavily on one resource, target that resource's hexes
- Never place the robber on your own high-production hexes
- When stealing, target resources you immediately need for your next build

VICTORY PATH PLANNING:
- Target resource independence with at least one settlement/city on each resource
- Minimum viable infrastructure: 3-4 settlements total, with 2-3 upgraded to cities
- Calculate multiple paths to 10 VP and pursue the fastest:
  Path 1: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP)
  Path 2: 4 cities (8 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP)
  Path 3: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 victory point card
- Always track your direct path to 10 VP and focus on those builds
- Prioritize visible points (settlements/cities) over speculative development cards
- Switch paths if the opponent blocks your primary victory path
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Accept trades only when they enable an immediate, crucial build
- Never make trades that allow opponent to build a settlement or city immediately
- Trade away excess resources when at risk for robber (7+ cards)
- Calculate the production value of each settlement location before deciding to build
- When trading with ports, plan sequences that convert unwanted resources into needed ones

DETAILED DECISION FRAMEWORK:
1. Does this move bring me closer to 10 victory points?
2. Does this move increase my production capacity more than alternative builds?
3. Does this move protect me from being blocked or cut off?
4. Does this move position me for strongest expansion in next 2-3 turns?
5. Is this the most efficient use of my current resources?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 29 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Move robber to the wheat hex (-1, 1, 0) and steal from RED, hopefully getting ore
2. If I get ore, I'll have 3 ore and can upgrade one of my settlements to a city next turn
3. If I don't get ore, save resources for either a development card or continue toward city upgrade
4. Maintain largest army advantage while working toward 3 cities (6 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP)

❓ Select action by number (0-8):


Based on this information, which action number do you choose? Think step by step about your options, then put the final action number in a box like \boxed{1}.
RESPONSE:
I'll analyze the current game state and available options to determine the best move:

## Game State Analysis
- I have 4 VP (2 settlements + 2 for largest army)
- Resources: 1 Wood, 1 Brick, 2 Sheep, 2 Wheat, 2 Ore
- Red has 3 VP (1 settlement + 1 city)
- The robber is on wheat hex (-1, 1, 0), which is one of my production hexes
- I need 6 more VP to win, likely through city upgrades + settlements

## Options Evaluation

1. End Turn (Action 0)
   - No benefit, would waste my current resources

2. Build Road (Actions 1-7)
   - Would use my wood and brick
   - Could enable future settlement construction
   - Most strategic options:
     - Edge (1, 2): Move toward settlement at node 2 near wheat
     - Edge (17, 18): Expand from my settlement at node 15

3. Buy Development Card (Action 8)
   - Costs 1 Sheep, 1 Wheat, 1 Ore
   - Possibilities:
     - Knight: Strengthen largest army (already at 4)
     - Victory Point: Direct progress toward winning
     - Road Building: Save resources later
     - Year of Plenty/Monopoly: Resource advantages

## Strategic Decision
Building a road doesn't immediately increase my victory points and uses resources needed for future settlements. 

Buying a development card is more strategic because:
1. I already have largest army, so less risk of losing that 2 VP
2. Any card type would be useful (VP, Knight, or resource cards)
3. I'll still have 1 Wheat and 1 Ore remaining toward a city upgrade
4. Increased chance of securing additional victory points

<plan>
1. Buy a development card this turn, hoping for a Victory Point card or Knight to further secure largest army
2. Focus on gaining resources for city upgrades (need 3 ore + 2 wheat for each)
3. Work toward 3 cities (6 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP)
4. If development card is Road Building, use it to expand toward new settlement locations
</plan>

Therefore, I choose to buy a development card:

❓ Select action by number (0-8):


Based on this information, which action number do you choose? Think step by step about your options, then put the final action number in a box like \boxed{1}.
RESPONSE:
I'll analyze the current game state and my options step by step to make the optimal decision:

## Game State Analysis
- I have 4 victory points (2 settlements + largest army)
- My resources: 1 Wood, 1 Brick, 1 Sheep, 1 Wheat, 1 Ore
- I already have 4 knights played (largest army)
- I have 1 unplayed knight card
- RED has 3 VP (1 settlement, 1 city)

## Resource Production
- My settlements produce: 
  - Settlement at 15: Brick(3), Wheat(8) - but wheat is currently blocked by robber
  - Settlement at 1: Sheep(4), Wheat(10), Ore(5)

## Options Evaluation

1. End Turn [0]: Not optimal as I can use my resources for progress.

2. Build Road Options [1-7]:
   - Using my only wood and brick would leave me with sheep, wheat, and ore.
   - These remaining resources would be insufficient for any significant build next turn.
   - Road building doesn't immediately increase VP or production.
   - However, it could set up future settlement locations if placed strategically.

3. Buy Development Card [8]:
   - Costs my sheep, wheat, and ore.
   - Possibilities include: Victory Point card (immediate hidden VP), Knight (strengthen largest army), Road Building (free expansion), Year of Plenty or Monopoly (resource advantage).
   - Even a Knight would be valuable to maintain my largest army advantage (RED might be collecting knights).
   - A Victory Point card would put me at 5 VP (half way to winning).

## Path to Victory Analysis
Based on my current position, my optimal path to 10 VP would be:
- Current: 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 4 VP
- Target: Upgrade settlements to cities (2 more VP) + 1-2 new settlements (1-2 VP) + maintain largest army (2 VP) + potential VP cards (1-2 VP) = 10 VP

## Decision
Buying a development card offers the best immediate value. It could give me an immediate VP or another knight to secure my largest army. I can use wood and brick next turn for expansion.

<plan>
1. Buy development card now (potential VP or knight)
2. Use wood and brick next turn to expand toward new settlement locations
3. Target upgrading settlements to cities when I collect enough ore/wheat
4. Maintain largest army advantage
5. Aim for victory through: 2 cities (4 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2-3 settlements (2-3 VP) + 1-2 VP cards

4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (HIGHEST PRIORITY):
- Target 6 & 8 numbered hexes at all costs - these are the most productive numbers
- Prioritize ore and wheat hexes for your settlements - they enable cities and development cards
- Position yourself on at least one good brick and wood hex to enable early expansion
- Aim to cover ALL five resources with your two settlements combined
- Try to place on intersections with 3 productive hexes rather than 2
- Evaluate probability dots (not just numbers) - more dots mean more frequent production
- Place settlements with clear expansion paths that won't be easily blocked
- Avoid placing where you'll be immediately cut off by the opponent
- Position roads toward your next planned settlement location
- Consider distance to valuable ports (especially 2:1 ports matching your abundant resources)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-8):
- Build at least one new road and one new settlement ASAP
- Focus on securing access to any missing resources through expansion
- Establish access to a port if you're lacking a key resource
- Prevent the opponent from cutting off your expansion path
- Only purchase development cards if excess resources available or for immediate victory
- Expand toward high-value hexes the opponent doesn't yet control

MID-GAME RESOURCE MANAGEMENT (TURNS 9-20):
- Target 3 cities minimum (worth 6 VP) - upgrade most productive settlements first
- Maintain 1 road per every 2 settlements for flexible expansion
- Always build a settlement when you have the resources (more production points)
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each build (cities give best long-term return)
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1 or better) to maintain resource balance
- Keep at least one viable road-building path open at all times
- If blocked from expansion, shift to city upgrades and development cards

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Development cards should supplement your expansion, not replace it
- Prioritize using Knight cards to protect your best hexes from the robber
- Save Knights when you're ahead to counter the opponent's robber placements
- Only buy development cards when you:
  1. Have excess sheep/wheat/ore but lack wood/brick for expansion
  2. Are close to securing largest army
  3. Need a specific card type (Road Building to break through a blockade)
- Use Road Building cards to save brick/wood and create surprise expansion paths
- Time Monopoly cards to capture opponent's stockpile after high-producing rolls
- Use Year of Plenty to complete crucial builds when short on specific resources

ROBBER PLACEMENT:
- Always target the opponent's highest-producing hex (high number + settlement/city)
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat hexes to slow city development
- If opponent relies heavily on one resource, target that resource's hexes
- Never place the robber on your own high-production hexes
- When stealing, target resources you immediately need for your next build

VICTORY PATH PLANNING:
- Target resource independence with at least one settlement/city on each resource
- Minimum viable infrastructure: 3-4 settlements total, with 2-3 upgraded to cities
- Calculate multiple paths to 10 VP and pursue the fastest:
  Path 1: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP)
  Path 2: 4 cities (8 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP)
  Path 3: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 victory point card
- Always track your direct path to 10 VP and focus on those builds
- Prioritize visible points (settlements/cities) over speculative development cards
- Switch paths if the opponent blocks your primary victory path
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Accept trades only when they enable an immediate, crucial build
- Never make trades that allow opponent to build a settlement or city immediately
- Trade away excess resources when at risk for robber (7+ cards)
- Calculate the production value of each settlement location before deciding to build
- When trading with ports, plan sequences that convert unwanted resources into needed ones

DETAILED DECISION FRAMEWORK:
1. Does this move bring me closer to 10 victory points?
2. Does this move increase my production capacity more than alternative builds?
3. Does this move protect me from being blocked or cut off?
4. Does this move position me for strongest expansion in next 2-3 turns?
5. Is this the most efficient use of my current resources?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 29 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Buy development card now (potential VP or knight)
2. Use wood and brick next turn to expand toward new settlement locations
3. Target upgrading settlements to cities when I collect enough ore/wheat
4. Maintain largest army advantage
5. Aim for victory through: 2 cities (4 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2-3 settlements (2-3 VP) + 1-2 VP cards

# Game Analysis for Turn 29

I need to carefully evaluate all my options and determine the optimal move to maximize my chances of winning.

## Current Game State Assessment
- I have 4/10 VP (2 settlements + largest army bonus)
- Resources: 1 wood, 1 brick
- Development cards: 1 knight, 1 year of plenty
- My opponent has 3/10 VP (1 settlement + 1 city)
- Robber is on wheat hex (-1, 1, 0)

## Available Actions Analysis
I can either end my turn or build a road. Since I have exactly 1 wood and 1 brick, I can build one road. Let me evaluate each road placement option:

1. Edge (1, 2): Connects from my settlement at node 1 towards wheat hex
2. Edge (0, 20): Connects from center hex towards opponent's settlement
3. Edge (4, 15): Connects to my settlement at node 15
4. Edge (0, 5): Connects center hex to node near opponent's city
5. Edge (1, 6): Connects my settlement at node 1 towards ore hex direction
6. Edge (17, 18): Extends from my road at node 17
7. Edge (14, 15): Connects to my settlement at node 15 from another direction

## Strategic Evaluation
Looking at my expansion opportunities:
- Building roads from node 1 (options 1 and 5) could help me expand into better resource areas
- Building from node 15 (options 3 and 7) could help expand in that region
- Option 6 extends my existing path from node 17, potentially working toward longest road

My current plan focuses on development cards, city upgrades, and maintaining largest army. However, I also need to consider expansion opportunities, especially since I currently only have 2 settlements.

## Road Placement Decision
Road placement option 1 (edge 1, 2) seems most strategic as:
- It expands from my settlement at node 1 toward the wheat hex
- Wheat is crucial for both settlements and development cards
- This path could eventually connect to better building spots
- It begins to create a longer road network that could contribute to longest road

<plan>
1. Build road at edge (1, 2) to start expanding toward wheat hex
2. Continue targeting development cards when I collect sheep/wheat/ore
3. Work toward city upgrades when I collect enough ore/wheat
4. Maintain largest army advantage with my knight cards
5. Aim for victory through: 2 cities (4 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2-3 settlements (2-3 VP) + 1-2 VP cards
</plan>

Based on my analysis, I'll build a road at edge (1, 2) to expand my network toward valuable resources.

# Game Analysis for Settlers of Catan Turn 31

I'll assess the current game state and evaluate my options strategically.

## Current Game State Analysis:
- I have 4/10 VP (2 settlements + 2 VP from largest army)
- I currently have only 1 ore resource
- Resources on my settlements: 🌾8, 🧱3, 🐑4, 🌾10, ⛏️5
- I have 1 KNIGHT and 1 YEAR_OF_PLENTY development card
- Robber is on 🌾8 hex, which directly impacts my production
- RED has 3 VP (1 settlement + 1 city)
- RED has 5 hidden resources

## Action Options:
1. Play Year of Plenty - Get specific resource combinations
2. Play Knight - Move robber and steal a resource
3. Roll the dice

## Strategic Decision Process:

First, I need to assess my immediate goals:
- The robber is on my wheat hex (8), which is my highest producing hex
- Moving the robber would improve my production chances 
- Getting additional resources through Year of Plenty could enable builds
- Rolling the dice is risky with the robber on my best hex

Looking at my Year of Plenty options, I could target resources for:
- Building a road (wood + brick)
- Working toward a city (ore + wheat)
- Working toward a settlement (wood + brick + wheat + sheep)

Since the robber is currently on my 8-wheat hex, which is one of my most productive hexes, playing the Knight card to move it seems highly strategic. This would both clear my production hex and potentially steal a resource from RED, who has 5 cards.

Playing the Knight also maintains my largest army advantage, which is currently worth 2 VP.

<plan>
1. Play Knight to remove robber from my wheat hex and steal a resource
2. Try to collect resources for a city upgrade (need 2 more ore, 3 wheat)
3. Continue working toward building another settlement (need wood + brick)
4. Save Year of Plenty for a critical build moment when I'm one resource short
5. Aim for victory through: 1-2 cities (2-4 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2-3 settlements (2-3 VP) + development cards (1+ VP)
</plan>

Based on this analysis, my optimal move is to play the Knight card to move the robber off my wheat hex and potentially gain a resource.

- Never make trades that allow opponent to build a settlement or city immediately
- Trade away excess resources when at risk for robber (7+ cards)
- Calculate the production value of each settlement location before deciding to build
- When trading with ports, plan sequences that convert unwanted resources into needed ones

DETAILED DECISION FRAMEWORK:
1. Does this move bring me closer to 10 victory points?
2. Does this move increase my production capacity more than alternative builds?
3. Does this move protect me from being blocked or cut off?
4. Does this move position me for strongest expansion in next 2-3 turns?
5. Is this the most efficient use of my current resources?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game Analysis for Robber Placement Decision

I need to choose the optimal hex to place my robber. Let me analyze each option carefully, considering both the immediate impact and strategic consequences.

## Current Situation
- I have 4/10 VP with Largest Army bonus
- RED has 3/10 VP with 1 settlement and 1 city
- The robber is currently on my wheat hex (-1, 1, 0), blocking one of my main production sources
- I have just 1 ore resource and a Year of Plenty development card

## Robber Placement Options Analysis

### Option 0: Move robber to (0, 0, 0) - Sheep hex with "4" and steal from RED
- This is a sheep hex with value 4 (moderate production)
- RED has a city at node 5 that produces from this sheep hex
- Blocks a moderate production hex for RED (1 dot)
- I don't produce from this hex myself, so no self-harm

### Option 1: Move robber to (1, -1, 0) - Wheat hex with "10"
- This wheat hex produces for both me and RED
- Value 10 is less productive (1 dot)
- Would block my own production at node 1
- Can't steal because RED doesn't have a building here

### Option 2: Move robber to (0, -1, 1) - Desert hex
- This is already non-productive desert
- Placing robber here has zero impact
- Completely wasted move

### Option 3: Move robber to (-1, 0, 1) - Brick hex with "3"
- Brick hex with value 3 (low production - 1 dot)
- I have a settlement at node 15 that produces from this brick hex
- Would block my own production
- Can't steal because RED doesn't have a building here

### Option 4: Move robber to (0, 1, -1) - Wood hex with "6" and steal from RED
- This is a highly productive wood hex (value 6 - 3 dots)
- RED has settlements at nodes 5 and 20 that produce from this wood hex
- This would block a key resource for RED
- Can steal a resource from RED
- I don't produce from this hex, so no self-harm

### Option 5: Move robber to (1, 0, -1) - Ore hex with "5" and steal from RED
- This is a moderately productive ore hex (value 5 - 2 dots)
- RED has a settlement at node 20 that produces from this ore hex
- I also have a settlement at node 1 that produces from this hex
- Can steal from RED, but would block my own ore production
- Ore is critical for my city upgrades

## Strategic Decision Making

My current plan involves upgrading to cities (need ore and wheat) and building more settlements (need wood and brick). The robber is currently on my wheat hex, which I want to free up.

Option 4 is clearly the strongest choice because:
1. It blocks a highly productive wood hex (6) that RED uses for two settlements
2. Wood is critical for RED's expansion with roads and settlements
3. I don't use this hex myself, so no negative impact on my production
4. I can steal a resource from RED
5. It removes the robber from my wheat hex, enabling my wheat production again

<plan>
1. Move robber to wood hex (0, 1, -1) to block RED's key resource and steal from them
2. Wait for wheat production to resume from my unblocked wheat hex
3. Use my Year of Plenty card when I'm close to building a city (need 3 ore + 2 wheat)
4. Continue expanding toward another settlement while working on a city upgrade
5. Aim for victory through: 1-2 cities (2-4 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2-3 settlements (2-3 VP) + development cards (1+ VP)
</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist whose primary goal is to defeat the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (HIGHEST PRIORITY):
- Target 6 & 8 numbered hexes at all costs - these are the most productive numbers
- Prioritize ore and wheat hexes for your settlements - they enable cities and development cards
- Position yourself on at least one good brick and wood hex to enable early expansion
- Aim to cover ALL five resources with your two settlements combined
- Try to place on intersections with 3 productive hexes rather than 2
- Evaluate probability dots (not just numbers) - more dots mean more frequent production
- Place settlements with clear expansion paths that won't be easily blocked
- Avoid placing where you'll be immediately cut off by the opponent
- Position roads toward your next planned settlement location
- Consider distance to valuable ports (especially 2:1 ports matching your abundant resources)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-8):
- Build at least one new road and one new settlement ASAP
- Focus on securing access to any missing resources through expansion
- Establish access to a port if you're lacking a key resource
- Prevent the opponent from cutting off your expansion path
- Only purchase development cards if excess resources available or for immediate victory
- Expand toward high-value hexes the opponent doesn't yet control

MID-GAME RESOURCE MANAGEMENT (TURNS 9-20):
- Target 3 cities minimum (worth 6 VP) - upgrade most productive settlements first
- Maintain 1 road per every 2 settlements for flexible expansion
- Always build a settlement when you have the resources (more production points)
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each build (cities give best long-term return)
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1 or better) to maintain resource balance
- Keep at least one viable road-building path open at all times
- If blocked from expansion, shift to city upgrades and development cards

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Development cards should supplement your expansion, not replace it
- Prioritize using Knight cards to protect your best hexes from the robber
- Save Knights when you're ahead to counter the opponent's robber placements
- Only buy development cards when you:
  1. Have excess sheep/wheat/ore but lack wood/brick for expansion
  2. Are close to securing largest army
  3. Need a specific card type (Road Building to break through a blockade)
- Use Road Building cards to save brick/wood and create surprise expansion paths
- Time Monopoly cards to capture opponent's stockpile after high-producing rolls
- Use Year of Plenty to complete crucial builds when short on specific resources

ROBBER PLACEMENT:
- Always target the opponent's highest-producing hex (high number + settlement/city)
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat hexes to slow city development
- If opponent relies heavily on one resource, target that resource's hexes
- Never place the robber on your own high-production hexes
- When stealing, target resources you immediately need for your next build

VICTORY PATH PLANNING:
- Target resource independence with at least one settlement/city on each resource
- Minimum viable infrastructure: 3-4 settlements total, with 2-3 upgraded to cities
- Calculate multiple paths to 10 VP and pursue the fastest:
  Path 1: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP)
  Path 2: 4 cities (8 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP)
  Path 3: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 victory point card
- Always track your direct path to 10 VP and focus on those builds
- Prioritize visible points (settlements/cities) over speculative development cards
- Switch paths if the opponent blocks your primary victory path
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Accept trades only when they enable an immediate, crucial build
- Never make trades that allow opponent to build a settlement or city immediately
- Trade away excess resources when at risk for robber (7+ cards)
- Calculate the production value of each settlement location before deciding to build
- When trading with ports, plan sequences that convert unwanted resources into needed ones

DETAILED DECISION FRAMEWORK:
1. Does this move bring me closer to 10 victory points?

# Game Analysis for Turn 33

I'll analyze the current game state and determine the optimal move.

## Current Game Status
- I have 4/10 victory points (2 settlements + 2 VP for largest army)
- Resources: 1 wheat, 2 ore
- Development cards: 1 Year of Plenty
- The robber is currently on the wood hex (0, 1, -1)

## Resource Needs Assessment
To progress toward victory, I need to:
1. Build a city (3 ore + 2 wheat) - I have 2 ore and 1 wheat currently
2. Build more settlements (1 brick + 1 wood + 1 wheat + 1 sheep)
3. Maintain my largest army advantage

## Available Options
- Play Year of Plenty to acquire various resource combinations
- Roll the dice

## Option Evaluation

### Year of Plenty Options
The best choices would be ones that help me build key infrastructure:

- Option [13] - Take wheat + ore: This would give me 3 ore total and 2 wheat total, exactly what I need for a city upgrade.
- Option [5] - Take ore + ore: This would give me 4 ore total, only needing 1 more wheat for a city.
- Option [2] - Take wheat + wheat: This would give me 3 wheat total, only needing 1 more ore for a city.

### Roll Dice Option
- Rolling gives me a chance to get more resources but with uncertainty
- I could lose resources if a 7 is rolled
- Red might build something important before my next turn

## Decision Logic
The most efficient path to 10 VP is to upgrade my settlements to cities. A city is worth an additional VP and doubles production. Given my current resources (2 ore, 1 wheat), playing Year of Plenty for wheat + ore [13] would immediately give me exactly what I need for a city upgrade (3 ore, 2 wheat total).

This is clearly the most efficient use of the Year of Plenty card, as it directly enables a high-value build that increases both my VP count and my future production capacity.

<plan>
1. Use Year of Plenty to get wheat + ore, allowing me to build a city immediately
2. Upgrade my settlement at node 15 (on 8-wheat) to a city to increase wheat production
3. Roll for resources on next turn and work toward either another city or a new settlement
4. Continue protecting my largest army advantage
5. Path to victory: 2 cities (4 VP) + 1-2 settlements (1-2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + possibly dev cards (1+ VP)
</plan>

The optimal action is to select option [13] - Play Year of Plenty card for wheat and ore.

# Analyzing the Robber Placement Options

I need to analyze where to place the robber to maximize my chances of winning while hindering my opponent's progress.

## Current Game State
- I have 4/10 VP: 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP)
- RED has 3/10 VP: 1 settlement (1 VP) + 1 city (2 VP)
- I have 2 wheat and 3 ore, which means I can build a city on my next turn
- RED has 5 hidden resource cards
- The robber is currently on the 6-wood hex (0,1,-1)

## Analyzing Each Robber Option
Let me evaluate each option:

**[0] Move robber to (0, 0, 0) and steal from RED**
- This blocks RED's city on node 5 from getting sheep
- It blocks my settlement on node 1 from getting sheep
- Sheep is not currently critical for my city-building strategy
- Can steal from RED

**[1] Move robber to (1, -1, 0)**
- This is a 10-wheat hex
- It blocks my settlement on node 1 from getting wheat
- Wheat is critical for building cities
- Cannot steal from RED (not adjacent)

**[2] Move robber to (0, -1, 1)**
- This is a desert hex
- No production occurs here anyway
- Poor choice for robber placement
- Cannot steal from RED (not adjacent)

**[3] Move robber to (-1, 0, 1)**
- This is a 3-brick hex
- It blocks my settlement on node 15 from getting brick
- Brick is not currently critical for my city-building strategy
- Cannot steal from RED (not adjacent)

**[4] Move robber to (-1, 1, 0) and steal from RED**
- This is an 8-wheat hex
- It blocks RED's city on node 5 from getting wheat
- It blocks my settlement on node 15 from getting wheat
- Wheat is critical for city-building
- Can steal from RED

**[5] Move robber to (1, 0, -1) and steal from RED**
- This is a 5-ore hex
- It blocks RED's settlement on node 20 from getting ore
- It blocks my settlement on node 1 from getting ore
- Ore is critical for city-building
- Can steal from RED

## Strategic Assessment
My immediate goal is to build a city, for which I already have the resources (3 ore + 2 wheat).

1. I should avoid blocking my own wheat and ore production
2. I should block RED's most valuable resources
3. I should prioritize stealing from RED
4. I should focus on blocking RED's potential to build cities

Options [4] and [5] both let me steal from RED but have different impacts:

Option [4] blocks the 8-wheat hex, which is RED's most productive resource (3 dots) and is critical for city building. However, it also blocks my own wheat production at node 15.

Option [5] blocks the 5-ore hex, which is important for RED's city building. This hurts RED's ore production while also blocking my own node 1 from ore.

Since I already have the resources for my next city, and RED has 5 cards (possibly saving up for a city), I should focus on blocking RED's most critical resource for city building and development cards - which is ore.

<plan>
1. Block RED's ore production with the robber to slow down their city development
2. Use my existing wheat and ore to build a city at node 15
3. Continue developing toward additional settlements and cities
4. Maintain my largest army advantage
5. Path to victory: 1 city (2 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 more cities (4 VP)
</plan>

Therefore, I'll choose option [5] to move the robber to the ore hex and steal from RED.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist whose primary goal is to defeat the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (HIGHEST PRIORITY):
- Target 6 & 8 numbered hexes at all costs - these are the most productive numbers
- Prioritize ore and wheat hexes for your settlements - they enable cities and development cards
- Position yourself on at least one good brick and wood hex to enable early expansion
- Aim to cover ALL five resources with your two settlements combined
- Try to place on intersections with 3 productive hexes rather than 2
- Evaluate probability dots (not just numbers) - more dots mean more frequent production
- Place settlements with clear expansion paths that won't be easily blocked
- Avoid placing where you'll be immediately cut off by the opponent
- Position roads toward your next planned settlement location
- Consider distance to valuable ports (especially 2:1 ports matching your abundant resources)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-8):
- Build at least one new road and one new settlement ASAP
- Focus on securing access to any missing resources through expansion
- Establish access to a port if you're lacking a key resource
- Prevent the opponent from cutting off your expansion path
- Only purchase development cards if excess resources available or for immediate victory
- Expand toward high-value hexes the opponent doesn't yet control

MID-GAME RESOURCE MANAGEMENT (TURNS 9-20):
- Target 3 cities minimum (worth 6 VP) - upgrade most productive settlements first
- Maintain 1 road per every 2 settlements for flexible expansion
- Always build a settlement when you have the resources (more production points)
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each build (cities give best long-term return)
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1 or better) to maintain resource balance
- Keep at least one viable road-building path open at all times
- If blocked from expansion, shift to city upgrades and development cards

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Development cards should supplement your expansion, not replace it
- Prioritize using Knight cards to protect your best hexes from the robber
- Save Knights when you're ahead to counter the opponent's robber placements
- Only buy development cards when you:
  1. Have excess sheep/wheat/ore but lack wood/brick for expansion
  2. Are close to securing largest army
  3. Need a specific card type (Road Building to break through a blockade)
- Use Road Building cards to save brick/wood and create surprise expansion paths
- Time Monopoly cards to capture opponent's stockpile after high-producing rolls
- Use Year of Plenty to complete crucial builds when short on specific resources

ROBBER PLACEMENT:
- Always target the opponent's highest-producing hex (high number + settlement/city)
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat hexes to slow city development
- If opponent relies heavily on one resource, target that resource's hexes
- Never place the robber on your own high-production hexes
- When stealing, target resources you immediately need for your next build

VICTORY PATH PLANNING:
- Target resource independence with at least one settlement/city on each resource
- Minimum viable infrastructure: 3-4 settlements total, with 2-3 upgraded to cities
- Calculate multiple paths to 10 VP and pursue the fastest:
  Path 1: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP)
  Path 2: 4 cities (8 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP)
  Path 3: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 victory point card
- Always track your direct path to 10 VP and focus on those builds
- Prioritize visible points (settlements/cities) over speculative development cards
- Switch paths if the opponent blocks your primary victory path
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Accept trades only when they enable an immediate, crucial build
- Never make trades that allow opponent to build a settlement or city immediately
- Trade away excess resources when at risk for robber (7+ cards)
- Calculate the production value of each settlement location before deciding to build
- When trading with ports, plan sequences that convert unwanted resources into needed ones

DETAILED DECISION FRAMEWORK:
1. Does this move bring me closer to 10 victory points?
2. Does this move increase my production capacity more than alternative builds?
3. Does this move protect me from being blocked or cut off?
4. Does this move position me for strongest expansion in next 2-3 turns?
5. Is this the most efficient use of my current resources?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 33 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Block RED's ore production with the robber to slow down their city development
2. Use my existing wheat and ore to build a city at node 15
3. Continue developing toward additional settlements and cities
4. Maintain my largest army advantage
5. Path to victory: 1 city (2 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 more cities (4 VP)
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.

# Game State Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state and determine the best action:

## Victory Points Status
- I have 4/10 VP: 2 settlements (2 VP) + Largest Army bonus (2 VP)
- Red has 3/10 VP: 1 settlement (1 VP) + 1 city (2 VP)
- I'm leading by 1 VP

## Resources Analysis
- I have: 1 sheep, 2 wheat, 3 ore
- This is exactly enough for either upgrading a settlement to a city OR buying a development card

## Production Assessment
- My settlement at node 15 produces: brick(3)[⭐] and wheat(8)[⭐⭐⭐]
- My settlement at node 1 produces: sheep(4)[⭐], wheat(10)[⭐], ore(5)[⭐⭐]
- Node 15 has better wheat production (high-frequency 8)
- Node 1 has more diverse resources (sheep, wheat, ore)

## Available Actions
1. End turn (not recommended as I can make a productive build)
2. Upgrade settlement at node 15 to a city (2 wheat, 3 ore)
3. Upgrade settlement at node 1 to a city (2 wheat, 3 ore)
4. Buy a development card (1 sheep, 1 wheat, 1 ore)

## Strategic Decision

Upgrading to a city is the most resource-efficient action. Each city:
- Provides an immediate +1 VP (bringing me to 5/10 VP)
- Doubles resource production at that location
- Costs 5 resources and gives 1 VP (5:1 ratio, very efficient)

Between nodes 15 and 1:
- Node 15 has the highly productive wheat(8) hex, and upgrading it would double wheat production
- Node 15 also produces brick, which I need for expansion
- Doubling production on a high-frequency number (8) is more valuable than on mixed resources

A development card is less certain - it could be a victory point, knight, or utility card. With my largest army already secured, the immediate value is less clear.

<plan>
1. Upgrade settlement at node 15 to city for immediate VP and doubled production on valuable wheat hex
2. Use future increased wheat production to fund additional development cards and buildings
3. Look to establish another settlement to secure better access to sheep
4. Continue to maintain largest army advantage
5. Path to victory: 2 cities (4 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + at least 1 more city and 2 more settlements or VP cards (3 VP)
</plan>

Based on my analysis, the optimal move is to upgrade my settlement at node 15 to a city. This gives immediate VP progress and improves my wheat production significantly on a high-frequency number.

# Game Analysis: Robber Placement Decision

I need to analyze the best hex to place the robber to maximize my advantage while minimizing my opponent's production.

## Evaluating Each Option:

**[0] Move robber to (0, 0, 0) and steal from RED**
- This is the sheep hex with value 4 (⭐)
- RED has a city adjacent to this hex, so blocking it would reduce their sheep production
- Sheep is moderately valuable for development cards
- I can steal from RED here

**[1] Move robber to (1, -1, 0)**
- This is the wheat hex with value 10 (⭐)
- My settlement is adjacent to this hex
- Blocking this would hurt my own wheat production when I need wheat
- Not a good option for me

**[2] Move robber to (0, -1, 1)**
- This is a desert hex
- Desert produces no resources
- Placing the robber here is essentially wasting the robber
- Very poor option

**[3] Move robber to (-1, 0, 1)**
- This is a brick hex with value 3 (⭐)
- My city is adjacent to this hex
- Placing here would block my own brick production
- Poor option

**[4] Move robber to (-1, 1, 0) and steal from RED**
- This is a wheat hex with value 8 (⭐⭐⭐)
- BOTH RED (city) and BLUE (city) have buildings here
- This is highly productive (3 dots)
- Would block my own wheat production from my city
- Can steal from RED here
- This would be suboptimal as I'm hurting my own valuable production

**[5] Move robber to (0, 1, -1) and steal from RED**
- This is a wood hex with value 6 (⭐⭐⭐)
- RED has both a settlement and city adjacent to this hex
- This is highly productive (3 dots)
- I have no buildings here, so I'm not blocking my own production
- Can steal from RED
- This blocks a critical resource (wood) that RED likely needs for expansion

## Strategic Decision:

Looking at the options, I should place the robber where it:
1. Blocks my opponent's most valuable production
2. Doesn't block my own production
3. Allows me to steal a resource

Option [5] is clearly the best choice. It blocks RED's highly productive wood hex (6 ⭐⭐⭐) that they have TWO buildings adjacent to, while not affecting my own production at all. Additionally, I can steal a resource from RED.

<plan>
1. Block RED's wood production with robber on (0, 1, -1)
2. Continue with upgrading settlement at node 15 to city when I get ore
3. Look to establish another settlement to secure better access to sheep and wood
4. Maintain largest army advantage
5. Path to victory: 2 cities (4 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + at least 1 more city and 2 more settlements or VP cards (3 VP)
</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist whose primary goal is to defeat the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (HIGHEST PRIORITY):
- Target 6 & 8 numbered hexes at all costs - these are the most productive numbers
- Prioritize ore and wheat hexes for your settlements - they enable cities and development cards
- Position yourself on at least one good brick and wood hex to enable early expansion
- Aim to cover ALL five resources with your two settlements combined
- Try to place on intersections with 3 productive hexes rather than 2
- Evaluate probability dots (not just numbers) - more dots mean more frequent production
- Place settlements with clear expansion paths that won't be easily blocked
- Avoid placing where you'll be immediately cut off by the opponent
- Position roads toward your next planned settlement location
- Consider distance to valuable ports (especially 2:1 ports matching your abundant resources)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-8):
- Build at least one new road and one new settlement ASAP
- Focus on securing access to any missing resources through expansion
- Establish access to a port if you're lacking a key resource
- Prevent the opponent from cutting off your expansion path
- Only purchase development cards if excess resources available or for immediate victory
- Expand toward high-value hexes the opponent doesn't yet control

MID-GAME RESOURCE MANAGEMENT (TURNS 9-20):
- Target 3 cities minimum (worth 6 VP) - upgrade most productive settlements first
- Maintain 1 road per every 2 settlements for flexible expansion
- Always build a settlement when you have the resources (more production points)
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each build (cities give best long-term return)
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1 or better) to maintain resource balance
- Keep at least one viable road-building path open at all times
- If blocked from expansion, shift to city upgrades and development cards

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Development cards should supplement your expansion, not replace it
- Prioritize using Knight cards to protect your best hexes from the robber
- Save Knights when you're ahead to counter the opponent's robber placements
- Only buy development cards when you:
  1. Have excess sheep/wheat/ore but lack wood/brick for expansion
  2. Are close to securing largest army
  3. Need a specific card type (Road Building to break through a blockade)
- Use Road Building cards to save brick/wood and create surprise expansion paths
- Time Monopoly cards to capture opponent's stockpile after high-producing rolls
- Use Year of Plenty to complete crucial builds when short on specific resources

ROBBER PLACEMENT:
- Always target the opponent's highest-producing hex (high number + settlement/city)
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat hexes to slow city development
- If opponent relies heavily on one resource, target that resource's hexes
- Never place the robber on your own high-production hexes
- When stealing, target resources you immediately need for your next build

VICTORY PATH PLANNING:
- Target resource independence with at least one settlement/city on each resource
- Minimum viable infrastructure: 3-4 settlements total, with 2-3 upgraded to cities
- Calculate multiple paths to 10 VP and pursue the fastest:
  Path 1: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP)
  Path 2: 4 cities (8 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP)
  Path 3: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 victory point card
- Always track your direct path to 10 VP and focus on those builds
- Prioritize visible points (settlements/cities) over speculative development cards
- Switch paths if the opponent blocks your primary victory path
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Accept trades only when they enable an immediate, crucial build
- Never make trades that allow opponent to build a settlement or city immediately
- Trade away excess resources when at risk for robber (7+ cards)
- Calculate the production value of each settlement location before deciding to build
- When trading with ports, plan sequences that convert unwanted resources into needed ones

DETAILED DECISION FRAMEWORK:
1. Does this move bring me closer to 10 victory points?
2. Does this move increase my production capacity more than alternative builds?
3. Does this move protect me from being blocked or cut off?
4. Does this move position me for strongest expansion in next 2-3 turns?
5. Is this the most efficient use of my current resources?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 43 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Block RED's wood production with robber on (0, 1, -1)
2. Continue with upgrading settlement at node 15 to city when I get ore
3. Look to establish another settlement to secure better access to sheep and wood
4. Maintain largest army advantage
5. Path to victory: 2 cities (4 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + at least 1 more city and 2 more settlements or VP cards (3 VP)

# Game Analysis for Turn 43

Let me carefully assess the current game state and my available options:

## Current Game State
- I have 5/10 VP (1 settlement, 1 city, largest army bonus)
- RED has 5/10 VP (1 settlement, 1 city, longest road bonus)
- Resources: 1 wood, 1 sheep, 1 wheat, 1 ore
- Available actions: End turn or Buy development card

## Resource Analysis
I have exactly the resources needed for a development card (1 sheep, 1 wheat, 1 ore), which is one of my two options.

## Strategic Considerations
1. **Development Card Value**: A new card could be:
   - Victory Point card (immediate +1 VP hidden from opponent)
   - Knight (strengthen my largest army lead and protect key hexes)
   - Year of Plenty (resource flexibility later)
   - Monopoly (potential resource swings)
   - Road Building (expansion option without brick)

2. **Alternative of Ending Turn**: If I end my turn, I preserve resources but don't make progress.

3. **Resource Production**: My settlements are on decent producing hexes (8, 5, 4, 10, 3). But I'm weak on wood and brick access.

4. **Path to Victory**: I need 5 more VP, which could come from upgrading my settlement (+1), building 2 more settlements (+2), and possibly VP cards.

## Decision Logic
- The development card is an efficient use of my current resources
- It maintains my advantage in the largest army category
- There's a chance (~20%) for an immediate hidden VP
- Even non-VP cards provide strategic options for future turns
- I have no good immediate builds with my current resources anyway
- Worst case, I get a card I can't use immediately, but I'm no worse off than ending my turn without buying anything

<plan>
1. Buy a development card now
2. Continue focusing on upgrading settlement at node 1 to city when I get enough ore
3. Use road building cards (if obtained) to establish another settlement to improve wood access
4. Maintain/strengthen largest army advantage
5. Path to victory: 2 cities (4 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + combination of VP cards and additional settlements (3 VP)
</plan>

Given these considerations, I should purchase a development card, which could provide immediate hidden VP or strategic options for future turns.

# Game Analysis for Turn 45

I need to decide between two actions: playing my Road Building development card now or rolling the dice first.

## Current Situation
- I have 5/10 victory points (1 settlement, 1 city, largest army)
- I have only 1 wood resource card
- I'm tied with RED at 5 VP each
- RED has longest road (+2 VP) and 7 hidden resource cards
- I have the largest army (+2 VP)
- I have 1 Road Building card that lets me build 2 roads for free

## Option Analysis

### Option 0: Play Road Building
- Advantages:
  - Can extend my network without needing brick and wood
  - Could potentially block RED's expansion
  - Secures paths for future settlements
- Disadvantages:
  - I currently lack resources to follow up with a settlement (need brick, wood, sheep, wheat)
  - Using it now doesn't provide immediate scoring benefit
  - May be more valuable after rolling if I obtain more resources

### Option 1: Roll Dice
- Advantages:
  - Could gain resources needed for development
  - Preserves Road Building card for when I have resources to build a settlement
  - RED has 7 cards - a roll of 7 would force them to discard
- Disadvantages:
  - Risk of rolling 7 and having to move the robber with little benefit
  - No guarantee of getting useful resources

## Strategic Calculation
Rolling first is better because:
1. I need more resources before road expansion is useful
2. RED has 7 cards - a roll of 7 would hurt them
3. The Road Building card will be more effective when I'm closer to having settlement resources
4. I can still play the Road Building card after rolling if that makes sense

<plan>
1. Roll dice to gather more resources
2. Play Road Building card when I have enough resources to follow up with a settlement
3. Continue focusing on upgrading settlement at node 1 to city 
4. Target expanding toward productive wood hexes
5. Path to victory: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2-3 settlements (2-3 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + potential VP cards
</plan>

  Path 1: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP)
  Path 2: 4 cities (8 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP)
  Path 3: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 victory point card
- Always track your direct path to 10 VP and focus on those builds
- Prioritize visible points (settlements/cities) over speculative development cards
- Switch paths if the opponent blocks your primary victory path
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Accept trades only when they enable an immediate, crucial build
- Never make trades that allow opponent to build a settlement or city immediately
- Trade away excess resources when at risk for robber (7+ cards)
- Calculate the production value of each settlement location before deciding to build
- When trading with ports, plan sequences that convert unwanted resources into needed ones

DETAILED DECISION FRAMEWORK:
1. Does this move bring me closer to 10 victory points?
2. Does this move increase my production capacity more than alternative builds?
3. Does this move protect me from being blocked or cut off?
4. Does this move position me for strongest expansion in next 2-3 turns?
5. Is this the most efficient use of my current resources?

- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Analyzing the Game State and Options

I'll carefully analyze my current situation and available options to decide whether to play the Road Building card now or end my turn.

## Current Game Status
- I have 5 Victory Points (VP): 1 settlement (1 VP), 1 city (2 VP), Largest Army (2 VP)
- RED also has 5 VP: 1 settlement (1 VP), 1 city (2 VP), Longest Road (2 VP)
- My resources: Only 1 wood, nothing else
- I have 1 Road Building development card available

## Option Analysis

**Option 0: Play Road Building card**
- Pros:
  - Could place roads strategically to prepare for future settlement expansion
  - Use the card now rather than potentially losing resources to a 7 roll later
- Cons:
  - I have no resources to build a settlement after placing the roads
  - Without brick, wheat, and sheep, I can't immediately capitalize on the road placement
  - The card might be more valuable later when I have resources to follow up with a settlement

**Option 1: End Turn**
- Pros:
  - Roll the dice next turn and potentially gain more resources
  - Save the Road Building card for when I have sufficient resources to immediately build a settlement
  - Allow for more strategic placement when I have clearer expansion options
- Cons:
  - Risk delaying expansion
  - Opponent might block potential paths while I wait

## Strategic Analysis

Currently, I only have 1 wood card and no other resources. Even if I place two roads now, I would need brick, wheat, and sheep to build a settlement. Without these resources, placing roads now doesn't provide immediate benefit.

Additionally, the board state shows the robber is on a brick hex (🧱3), which means I'll have more difficulty getting brick. It's more strategic to wait until I have more resources before using the Road Building card, so I can immediately follow up with a settlement placement.

<plan>
1. Roll dice to gather more resources
2. Save Road Building card until I have enough resources to follow with settlement building
3. Continue focusing on upgrading settlement at node 1 to city
4. Target expanding toward productive wood/brick hexes once I have more resources
5. Path to victory: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2-3 settlements (2-3 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + potential VP cards
</plan>

The optimal decision is to end my turn and wait for more resources before playing the Road Building card.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist whose primary goal is to defeat the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (HIGHEST PRIORITY):
- Target 6 & 8 numbered hexes at all costs - these are the most productive numbers
- Prioritize ore and wheat hexes for your settlements - they enable cities and development cards
- Position yourself on at least one good brick and wood hex to enable early expansion
- Aim to cover ALL five resources with your two settlements combined
- Try to place on intersections with 3 productive hexes rather than 2
- Evaluate probability dots (not just numbers) - more dots mean more frequent production
- Place settlements with clear expansion paths that won't be easily blocked
- Avoid placing where you'll be immediately cut off by the opponent
- Position roads toward your next planned settlement location
- Consider distance to valuable ports (especially 2:1 ports matching your abundant resources)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-8):
- Build at least one new road and one new settlement ASAP
- Focus on securing access to any missing resources through expansion
- Establish access to a port if you're lacking a key resource
- Prevent the opponent from cutting off your expansion path
- Only purchase development cards if excess resources available or for immediate victory
- Expand toward high-value hexes the opponent doesn't yet control

MID-GAME RESOURCE MANAGEMENT (TURNS 9-20):
- Target 3 cities minimum (worth 6 VP) - upgrade most productive settlements first
- Maintain 1 road per every 2 settlements for flexible expansion
- Always build a settlement when you have the resources (more production points)
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each build (cities give best long-term return)
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1 or better) to maintain resource balance
- Keep at least one viable road-building path open at all times
- If blocked from expansion, shift to city upgrades and development cards

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Development cards should supplement your expansion, not replace it
- Prioritize using Knight cards to protect your best hexes from the robber
- Save Knights when you're ahead to counter the opponent's robber placements
- Only buy development cards when you:
  1. Have excess sheep/wheat/ore but lack wood/brick for expansion
  2. Are close to securing largest army
  3. Need a specific card type (Road Building to break through a blockade)
- Use Road Building cards to save brick/wood and create surprise expansion paths
- Time Monopoly cards to capture opponent's stockpile after high-producing rolls
- Use Year of Plenty to complete crucial builds when short on specific resources

ROBBER PLACEMENT:
- Always target the opponent's highest-producing hex (high number + settlement/city)
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat hexes to slow city development
- If opponent relies heavily on one resource, target that resource's hexes
- Never place the robber on your own high-production hexes
- When stealing, target resources you immediately need for your next build

VICTORY PATH PLANNING:
- Target resource independence with at least one settlement/city on each resource
- Minimum viable infrastructure: 3-4 settlements total, with 2-3 upgraded to cities
- Calculate multiple paths to 10 VP and pursue the fastest:
  Path 1: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP)
  Path 2: 4 cities (8 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP)
  Path 3: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 victory point card
- Always track your direct path to 10 VP and focus on those builds
- Prioritize visible points (settlements/cities) over speculative development cards
- Switch paths if the opponent blocks your primary victory path
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Accept trades only when they enable an immediate, crucial build
- Never make trades that allow opponent to build a settlement or city immediately
- Trade away excess resources when at risk for robber (7+ cards)
- Calculate the production value of each settlement location before deciding to build
- When trading with ports, plan sequences that convert unwanted resources into needed ones

# Game State Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state and my options carefully:

## Victory Point Status:
- I have 5 VPs: 1 settlement (1 VP), 1 city (2 VP), and Largest Army (2 VP)
- Red has 6 VPs: 0 settlements (0 VP), 2 cities (4 VP), and Longest Road (2 VP)

## Available Resources:
- I have 1 🌲WOOD and 2 🌾WHEAT
- I only have one development card: ROAD_BUILDING

## Current Action Options:
- [0] Play Road Building card - Build two roads for free
- [1] Roll the dice

## Strategic Evaluation:

**Option 0: Play Road Building**
- Pros: Guaranteed placement of 2 free roads without needing brick or wood
- Cons: 
  - I currently don't have enough resources to immediately follow up with a settlement (need 1 brick, 1 wood, 1 sheep, 1 wheat)
  - I already have 1 wood, but would need to roll to get brick, sheep (and more wood)
  - Using this card now doesn't immediately improve my position

**Option 1: Roll the Dice**
- Pros: 
  - Could gather more resources needed for a city upgrade (need 3 ore, 2 wheat; I already have 2 wheat)
  - Could gather resources for a new settlement
  - Might get the brick I need to make the Road Building card more valuable
- Cons:
  - Roll outcomes are uncertain; might not get what I need

## Optimal Road Building Usage:
The Road Building card is most valuable when:
1. I have enough resources to immediately build a settlement after placing roads
2. I need to quickly secure a critical expansion path
3. I'm competing for longest road

Currently, none of these conditions are met. I need more resources first.

## Decision Logic:
I should roll the dice first to gather more resources. This gives me flexibility to:
1. Potentially upgrade my settlement at node 1 to a city if I get ore
2. Build a settlement if I get brick, sheep (and more wood)
3. Use the Road Building card more effectively after I have supporting resources

<plan>
1. Roll dice to gather resources (immediate need)
2. Save Road Building card until I have enough resources for settlement building
3. Priority build order:
   - Upgrade settlement at node 1 to city (need 3 ore, 2 wheat - already have 2 wheat)
   - Build new settlement (need to determine optimal location)
4. Path to victory: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2-3 settlements (2-3 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + future VP cards
</plan>

Given my analysis, the optimal action is to roll the dice:

# Game Analysis for Settlers of Catan Turn 47

I'll analyze the current game state carefully to make the optimal decision between playing my Road Building card now or ending my turn.

## Current Resources and Victory Points
- I have 1 wood, 2 wheat
- I have 5/10 VP (1 settlement + 1 city + largest army bonus)
- Red has 6/10 VP (2 cities + longest road bonus)

## Game State Assessment
- I am 1 VP behind Red (5 vs 6)
- I have a Road Building development card available
- I don't have enough resources to build a settlement (need brick + wood + wheat + sheep)
- I can't upgrade my settlement to a city (need 3 ore, 2 wheat - I have the wheat but no ore)
- The robber is currently on a brick hex (-1,0,1), blocking my brick production

## Evaluating Action Options
**Option 0: Play Road Building**
- Pros:
  - Would allow me to build 2 roads for free
  - Could help position for future settlement expansion
  - Could potentially challenge for longest road (though Red has 5 segments and I only have 3)
- Cons:
  - Without brick and sheep, I can't immediately follow up with a settlement
  - My expansion options appear limited from the board state
  - Using the card now might waste its potential if I can't capitalize on the roads soon

**Option 1: End Turn**
- Pros:
  - Roll the dice next turn for more resources
  - Potentially save Road Building for when I have complementary resources
  - More strategic flexibility on next turn
- Cons:
  - Allows Red another turn to extend their lead

## Strategic Decision
Given that:
1. I don't have the resources to build a settlement immediately after placing roads
2. I don't know where optimal road placements would be without seeing the full board layout
3. I can't make immediate progress toward victory points with just roads

The optimal play is to end my turn and hope for better resource rolls next turn. The Road Building card will have more value when I have other resources to complement it for a settlement build.

<plan>
1. Roll dice to gather more resources next turn
2. Save Road Building card until I have sheep and brick to build a settlement
3. Priority build order:
   - Upgrade settlement at node 1 to city (need 3 ore, 2 wheat - already have 2 wheat)
   - Use Road Building strategically once I have supporting resources
4. Path to victory: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2-3 settlements (2-3 VP) + largest army (2 VP)
</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist whose primary goal is to defeat the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (HIGHEST PRIORITY):
- Target 6 & 8 numbered hexes at all costs - these are the most productive numbers
- Prioritize ore and wheat hexes for your settlements - they enable cities and development cards
- Position yourself on at least one good brick and wood hex to enable early expansion
- Aim to cover ALL five resources with your two settlements combined
- Try to place on intersections with 3 productive hexes rather than 2
- Evaluate probability dots (not just numbers) - more dots mean more frequent production
- Place settlements with clear expansion paths that won't be easily blocked
- Avoid placing where you'll be immediately cut off by the opponent
- Position roads toward your next planned settlement location
- Consider distance to valuable ports (especially 2:1 ports matching your abundant resources)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-8):
- Build at least one new road and one new settlement ASAP
- Focus on securing access to any missing resources through expansion
- Establish access to a port if you're lacking a key resource
- Prevent the opponent from cutting off your expansion path
- Only purchase development cards if excess resources available or for immediate victory
- Expand toward high-value hexes the opponent doesn't yet control

MID-GAME RESOURCE MANAGEMENT (TURNS 9-20):
- Target 3 cities minimum (worth 6 VP) - upgrade most productive settlements first
- Maintain 1 road per every 2 settlements for flexible expansion
- Always build a settlement when you have the resources (more production points)
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each build (cities give best long-term return)
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1 or better) to maintain resource balance
- Keep at least one viable road-building path open at all times
- If blocked from expansion, shift to city upgrades and development cards

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Development cards should supplement your expansion, not replace it
- Prioritize using Knight cards to protect your best hexes from the robber
- Save Knights when you're ahead to counter the opponent's robber placements
- Only buy development cards when you:
  1. Have excess sheep/wheat/ore but lack wood/brick for expansion
  2. Are close to securing largest army
  3. Need a specific card type (Road Building to break through a blockade)
- Use Road Building cards to save brick/wood and create surprise expansion paths
- Time Monopoly cards to capture opponent's stockpile after high-producing rolls
- Use Year of Plenty to complete crucial builds when short on specific resources

ROBBER PLACEMENT:
- Always target the opponent's highest-producing hex (high number + settlement/city)
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat hexes to slow city development
- If opponent relies heavily on one resource, target that resource's hexes
- Never place the robber on your own high-production hexes
- When stealing, target resources you immediately need for your next build

VICTORY PATH PLANNING:
- Target resource independence with at least one settlement/city on each resource
- Minimum viable infrastructure: 3-4 settlements total, with 2-3 upgraded to cities
- Calculate multiple paths to 10 VP and pursue the fastest:
  Path 1: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP)
  Path 2: 4 cities (8 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP)
  Path 3: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 victory point card
- Always track your direct path to 10 VP and focus on those builds
- Prioritize visible points (settlements/cities) over speculative development cards
- Switch paths if the opponent blocks your primary victory path
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Accept trades only when they enable an immediate, crucial build
- Never make trades that allow opponent to build a settlement or city immediately
- Trade away excess resources when at risk for robber (7+ cards)
- Calculate the production value of each settlement location before deciding to build
- When trading with ports, plan sequences that convert unwanted resources into needed ones

DETAILED DECISION FRAMEWORK:
1. Does this move bring me closer to 10 victory points?
2. Does this move increase my production capacity more than alternative builds?
3. Does this move protect me from being blocked or cut off?
4. Does this move position me for strongest expansion in next 2-3 turns?
5. Is this the most efficient use of my current resources?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 49 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Roll dice to gather more resources next turn
2. Save Road Building card until I have sheep and brick to build a settlement

# Game Analysis

Let me examine my current situation and the best strategic move:

## Current State
- I have 5/10 victory points: 1 settlement (1 VP) + 1 city (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP)
- Resources: 1 wood, 2 wheat
- Development cards: 1 Road Building card
- RED has 6 VP (2 cities + longest road)

## Resources Evaluation
- My limited resources (just 1 wood, 2 wheat) don't allow for any immediate builds
- I need 3 ore, 2 wheat for upgrading settlement at node 1 to a city
- I already have 2 wheat for that upgrade, but missing the ore

## Road Building Card Analysis
If I play the Road Building card now:
1. I'd build 2 free roads, but couldn't follow up with a settlement since I lack sheep and brick
2. The roads alone wouldn't immediately increase my VP count
3. I'd be using my strategic card without maximizing its benefit

## Roll Dice Analysis
If I roll the dice:
1. I could potentially get more resources before making decisions
2. I might get ore needed for my city upgrade
3. I'd preserve my Road Building card for optimal use when I have sheep and brick

## Strategic Considerations
- My planned path to victory requires more resources than I currently have
- Playing Road Building now doesn't enable an immediate build completion
- Rolling first gives me a chance to gather resources before using my development card

<plan>
1. Roll dice to gather resources
2. If I collect enough ore (3) and have my 2 wheat, upgrade settlement at node 1 to city
3. Save Road Building card for when I have sheep and brick to immediately follow with a settlement
4. Path to victory: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP)
</plan>

The optimal action is to roll the dice and gather more resources, maintaining flexibility for my next move.

# Game Analysis for Turn 49

I'll analyze my current situation and determine the best action to take.

## Current Game State
- I have 5/10 victory points: 1 settlement (1 VP), 1 city (2 VP), largest army (2 VP)
- Resources: 1 wood, 2 wheat
- Development cards: 1 Road Building card
- Red has 6/10 VP with longest road bonus
- I'm only 1 road segment away from potentially challenging longest road

## Resource Analysis
- I need 3 ore + 2 wheat to upgrade my settlement at node 1 to a city
- I currently have 2 wheat but no ore
- I can't build a settlement now (need brick + wood + sheep + wheat)
- My only development card is Road Building

## Strategic Options

Option 0: Play Road Building card
- Pros:
  - Can build 2 free roads without needing brick/wood
  - Could position myself to build a settlement later
  - Might challenge longest road with proper placement
- Cons:
  - No immediate victory points gain
  - Without settlement resources, roads alone don't advance my victory path
  - Exposing my expansion strategy without immediate benefit

Option 1: End Turn
- Pros:
  - Save Road Building for when I can immediately follow with a settlement
  - Might collect more resources on next roll to upgrade to city
- Cons:
  - No immediate progress this turn

## Decision Logic
Looking at my current plan's step 3: "Save Road Building card for when I have sheep and brick to immediately follow with a settlement"

I currently lack sheep and brick, so playing Road Building now would deviate from my optimal plan. I should hold onto the Road Building card until I can use it more effectively with additional resources to build a settlement.

<plan>
1. Roll dice to gather resources
2. If I collect enough ore (3) and have my 2 wheat, upgrade settlement at node 1 to city
3. Save Road Building card for when I have sheep and brick to immediately follow with a settlement
4. Path to victory: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP)
</plan>

Since I can't make meaningful progress toward victory points this turn and should save my Road Building card for optimal use, I'll end my turn.

- Trade away excess resources when at risk for robber (7+ cards)
- Calculate the production value of each settlement location before deciding to build
- When trading with ports, plan sequences that convert unwanted resources into needed ones

DETAILED DECISION FRAMEWORK:
1. Does this move bring me closer to 10 victory points?
2. Does this move increase my production capacity more than alternative builds?
3. Does this move protect me from being blocked or cut off?
4. Does this move position me for strongest expansion in next 2-3 turns?
5. Is this the most efficient use of my current resources?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 51 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Roll dice to gather resources
2. If I collect enough ore (3) and have my 2 wheat, upgrade settlement at node 1 to city
3. Save Road Building card for when I have sheep and brick to immediately follow with a settlement
4. Path to victory: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP)

# Game Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state and determine the optimal action.

## Current Game Status
- I'm BLUE with 5/10 victory points (1 settlement, 1 city, largest army bonus)
- RED has 6/10 victory points (2 cities, longest road bonus)
- I have 1 Wood, 2 Wheat, and a Road Building development card
- Current plan is to upgrade my settlement at node 1 to a city when I get 3 ore

## Available Actions
[0] Play Road Building card - Build two roads for free
[1] Roll the dice

## Decision Process

1. **Victory Path Analysis**:
   - I need 5 more points to win
   - My settlement at node 1 could be upgraded to city (+1 VP)
   - I could build 2 more settlements (+2 VP)
   - I'm already holding largest army (+2 VP)
   - This gives me a clear path to 10 VP

2. **Resource Consideration**:
   - I currently have 1 Wood and 2 Wheat
   - For city upgrade at node 1: I need 3 Ore, already have 2 Wheat
   - For a new settlement: I need Brick, Wood, Wheat, Sheep (missing Brick and Sheep)

3. **Road Building Card Strategic Value**:
   - The Road Building card gives 2 free roads
   - Using it now would not directly lead to a settlement as I'm missing resources
   - Saving it until I have or am close to having settlement resources is more efficient
   
4. **Roll Benefits**:
   - Rolling could give me the ore I need for city upgrade
   - Rolling could give me sheep/brick to complement my Road Building card
   - Even if I don't get exactly what I need, any resources help my position

<plan>
1. Roll dice to gather resources
2. If I collect ore, work toward upgrading settlement at node 1 to a city
3. If I collect sheep/brick, prepare to use Road Building card to expand
4. Path to victory: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP)
</plan>

Given my current resources and the game state, I should roll the dice first to gather more resources. Playing the Road Building card now would be premature since I don't have the resources to follow up with a settlement.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist whose primary goal is to defeat the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (HIGHEST PRIORITY):
- Target 6 & 8 numbered hexes at all costs - these are the most productive numbers
- Prioritize ore and wheat hexes for your settlements - they enable cities and development cards
- Position yourself on at least one good brick and wood hex to enable early expansion
- Aim to cover ALL five resources with your two settlements combined
- Try to place on intersections with 3 productive hexes rather than 2
- Evaluate probability dots (not just numbers) - more dots mean more frequent production
- Place settlements with clear expansion paths that won't be easily blocked
- Avoid placing where you'll be immediately cut off by the opponent
- Position roads toward your next planned settlement location
- Consider distance to valuable ports (especially 2:1 ports matching your abundant resources)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-8):
- Build at least one new road and one new settlement ASAP
- Focus on securing access to any missing resources through expansion
- Establish access to a port if you're lacking a key resource
- Prevent the opponent from cutting off your expansion path
- Only purchase development cards if excess resources available or for immediate victory
- Expand toward high-value hexes the opponent doesn't yet control

MID-GAME RESOURCE MANAGEMENT (TURNS 9-20):
- Target 3 cities minimum (worth 6 VP) - upgrade most productive settlements first
- Maintain 1 road per every 2 settlements for flexible expansion
- Always build a settlement when you have the resources (more production points)
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each build (cities give best long-term return)
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1 or better) to maintain resource balance
- Keep at least one viable road-building path open at all times
- If blocked from expansion, shift to city upgrades and development cards

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Development cards should supplement your expansion, not replace it
- Prioritize using Knight cards to protect your best hexes from the robber
- Save Knights when you're ahead to counter the opponent's robber placements
- Only buy development cards when you:
  1. Have excess sheep/wheat/ore but lack wood/brick for expansion
  2. Are close to securing largest army
  3. Need a specific card type (Road Building to break through a blockade)
- Use Road Building cards to save brick/wood and create surprise expansion paths
- Time Monopoly cards to capture opponent's stockpile after high-producing rolls
- Use Year of Plenty to complete crucial builds when short on specific resources

ROBBER PLACEMENT:
- Always target the opponent's highest-producing hex (high number + settlement/city)
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat hexes to slow city development
- If opponent relies heavily on one resource, target that resource's hexes
- Never place the robber on your own high-production hexes
- When stealing, target resources you immediately need for your next build

VICTORY PATH PLANNING:
- Target resource independence with at least one settlement/city on each resource
- Minimum viable infrastructure: 3-4 settlements total, with 2-3 upgraded to cities
- Calculate multiple paths to 10 VP and pursue the fastest:
  Path 1: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP)
  Path 2: 4 cities (8 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP)
  Path 3: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 victory point card
- Always track your direct path to 10 VP and focus on those builds
- Prioritize visible points (settlements/cities) over speculative development cards
- Switch paths if the opponent blocks your primary victory path
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Accept trades only when they enable an immediate, crucial build
- Never make trades that allow opponent to build a settlement or city immediately
- Trade away excess resources when at risk for robber (7+ cards)
- Calculate the production value of each settlement location before deciding to build
- When trading with ports, plan sequences that convert unwanted resources into needed ones

DETAILED DECISION FRAMEWORK:
1. Does this move bring me closer to 10 victory points?
2. Does this move increase my production capacity more than alternative builds?
3. Does this move protect me from being blocked or cut off?
4. Does this move position me for strongest expansion in next 2-3 turns?

# Game State Analysis

I need to carefully analyze my options to maximize my chances of winning against the AlphaBeta algorithm.

## Current Victory Point Situation
- I (BLUE) have 5 VP: 1 settlement (1 VP) + 1 city (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP)
- RED has 6 VP: 2 cities (4 VP) + longest road (2 VP)
- I need 5 more VP to win

## Resource Analysis
I currently have:
- 1 🌲 WOOD
- 2 🌾 WHEAT
- 1 ⛏️ ORE
- No BRICK or SHEEP

## Development Card Analysis
- I have 1 ROAD_BUILDING card
- I've already played 5 KNIGHT cards to secure largest army

## Available Actions
0. Play Road Building card - Build two roads for free
1. End my turn

## Strategic Considerations

1. **Path to victory**: I need 5 more VP. The most efficient ways would be:
   - Building more settlements (each worth 1 VP)
   - Upgrading my settlement to a city (worth +1 VP)
   - Buying development cards for possible VP cards
   - Taking longest road from RED (worth 2 VP)

2. **Road Building card value**: This card would let me build two roads for free, which could help:
   - Expand to new settlement locations
   - Work towards taking longest road from RED

3. **Current resources**: I don't have enough resources to build a settlement (need WOOD, BRICK, WHEAT, SHEEP) or upgrade to a city (need 3 ORE, 2 WHEAT) immediately after my turn.

## Decision Analysis

Playing the Road Building card would give me two free roads, which is extremely valuable since:
1. I can expand toward potential settlement locations
2. I can start working toward challenging RED for longest road
3. I currently have only 3 roads built, so this would nearly double my road network
4. I don't have BRICK, which makes road building difficult otherwise

The question is: where would I build these roads? Looking at my current positions:
- I have a city at node 15 with a road at (15, 17)
- I have a settlement at node 1 with roads at (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 2)

Building from my settlement at node 1 would likely be most advantageous to expand my network.

<plan>
1. Play Road Building card to expand my road network
2. Build toward potential settlement locations, especially if any have ore production
3. Work toward taking longest road from RED (need 6+ connected roads)
4. Next goals: build new settlement(s) and upgrade settlement at node 1 to a city
5. Path to victory: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + possibly longest road (2 VP)
</plan>

Given these considerations, I should play my Road Building card now to expand my network, rather than ending my turn with no action.

# Analysis of Current Game State

First, let's examine my current position and resources:
- I have 5 VPs: 1 settlement (1 VP), 1 city (2 VP), and largest army (2 VP)
- Resources: 1 🌲WOOD, 2 🌾WHEAT, 1 ⛏️ORE
- I need to build more settlements and/or cities to reach 10 VPs
- RED has longest road with 5 segments (giving them 2 VPs)
- I have limited resources, so I need to make a strategic road placement

## Road Placement Options

Looking at each road option:
- [0] Build at edge (0, 20): Connects toward RED's city at node 20
- [1] Build at edge (2, 3): Expands from my settlement at node 1
- [2] Build at edge (2, 9): Moves toward wheat resources
- [3] Build at edge (4, 15): Connects to my city at node 15
- [4] Build at edge (0, 5): Could block RED's expansion
- [5] Build at edge (1, 6): Moves toward ore resources
- [6] Build at edge (17, 18): Extends from my city at node 15
- [7] Build at edge (14, 15): Connects to my city at node 15

## Strategic Considerations

I need to:
1. Expand my network to build new settlements
2. Increase my road length to potentially claim longest road (need 6+ segments)
3. Target good settlement spots with ore/wheat for city upgrades
4. Consider blocking RED's expansion

Looking at my current roads and buildings, I notice I have a settlement at node 1 and a city at node 15. I need to connect these settlements or expand from them to optimal locations.

## Decision Making

The most strategic move is to connect my two main structures and work toward longest road. Option [3] to build at edge (4, 15) connects toward my city at node 15 from the direction of my settlement area. This contributes to potentially claiming longest road while providing expansion opportunities.

<plan>
1. Build road at edge (4, 15) to start connecting my settlement and city areas
2. Continue building roads to create the longest connected network (6+ segments)
3. Look for settlement opportunities along this path, especially ones with ore/wheat
4. Save resources for city upgrade at node 1 (needs 3 ore, 2 wheat)
5. Path to victory: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2-3 settlements (2-3 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + possibly longest road (2 VP)
</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist whose primary goal is to defeat the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (HIGHEST PRIORITY):
- Target 6 & 8 numbered hexes at all costs - these are the most productive numbers
- Prioritize ore and wheat hexes for your settlements - they enable cities and development cards
- Position yourself on at least one good brick and wood hex to enable early expansion
- Aim to cover ALL five resources with your two settlements combined
- Try to place on intersections with 3 productive hexes rather than 2
- Evaluate probability dots (not just numbers) - more dots mean more frequent production
- Place settlements with clear expansion paths that won't be easily blocked
- Avoid placing where you'll be immediately cut off by the opponent
- Position roads toward your next planned settlement location
- Consider distance to valuable ports (especially 2:1 ports matching your abundant resources)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-8):
- Build at least one new road and one new settlement ASAP
- Focus on securing access to any missing resources through expansion
- Establish access to a port if you're lacking a key resource
- Prevent the opponent from cutting off your expansion path
- Only purchase development cards if excess resources available or for immediate victory
- Expand toward high-value hexes the opponent doesn't yet control

MID-GAME RESOURCE MANAGEMENT (TURNS 9-20):
- Target 3 cities minimum (worth 6 VP) - upgrade most productive settlements first
- Maintain 1 road per every 2 settlements for flexible expansion
- Always build a settlement when you have the resources (more production points)
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each build (cities give best long-term return)
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1 or better) to maintain resource balance
- Keep at least one viable road-building path open at all times
- If blocked from expansion, shift to city upgrades and development cards

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Development cards should supplement your expansion, not replace it
- Prioritize using Knight cards to protect your best hexes from the robber
- Save Knights when you're ahead to counter the opponent's robber placements
- Only buy development cards when you:
  1. Have excess sheep/wheat/ore but lack wood/brick for expansion
  2. Are close to securing largest army
  3. Need a specific card type (Road Building to break through a blockade)
- Use Road Building cards to save brick/wood and create surprise expansion paths
- Time Monopoly cards to capture opponent's stockpile after high-producing rolls
- Use Year of Plenty to complete crucial builds when short on specific resources

ROBBER PLACEMENT:
- Always target the opponent's highest-producing hex (high number + settlement/city)
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat hexes to slow city development
- If opponent relies heavily on one resource, target that resource's hexes
- Never place the robber on your own high-production hexes
- When stealing, target resources you immediately need for your next build

VICTORY PATH PLANNING:
- Target resource independence with at least one settlement/city on each resource
- Minimum viable infrastructure: 3-4 settlements total, with 2-3 upgraded to cities
- Calculate multiple paths to 10 VP and pursue the fastest:
  Path 1: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP)
  Path 2: 4 cities (8 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP)
  Path 3: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 victory point card
- Always track your direct path to 10 VP and focus on those builds
- Prioritize visible points (settlements/cities) over speculative development cards
- Switch paths if the opponent blocks your primary victory path
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Accept trades only when they enable an immediate, crucial build
- Never make trades that allow opponent to build a settlement or city immediately
- Trade away excess resources when at risk for robber (7+ cards)
- Calculate the production value of each settlement location before deciding to build
- When trading with ports, plan sequences that convert unwanted resources into needed ones

DETAILED DECISION FRAMEWORK:
1. Does this move bring me closer to 10 victory points?
2. Does this move increase my production capacity more than alternative builds?
3. Does this move protect me from being blocked or cut off?
4. Does this move position me for strongest expansion in next 2-3 turns?
5. Is this the most efficient use of my current resources?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game Analysis & Decision

I need to carefully analyze the current game state and make a strategic decision about which road to build.

## Current Game State Assessment:
- I have 5 VP (1 settlement + 1 city + largest army bonus)
- RED has 6 VP (2 cities + longest road bonus)
- My resources: 1 wood, 2 wheat, 1 ore (not enough for a settlement or city)
- I have the largest army (5 knights)
- RED has the longest road (5 segments)
- My settlement areas are disconnected (one at node 15, one at node 1)

## Road Building Options Analysis:
Let me analyze each option based on strategic value:

[0] Road at edge (0, 20): 
- Connects toward node 20 where RED already has a city
- Does not advance my position toward new settlement locations
- Low strategic value

[1] Road at edge (2, 3):
- Extends from my settlement at node 1
- Could lead toward connecting my two separate networks
- Potential medium strategic value

[2] Road at edge (2, 9):
- Extends from my settlement at node 1
- Points toward a potential new settlement location
- Medium strategic value

[3] Road at edge (0, 5):
- Connects toward node 5 where RED already has a city
- Low strategic value

[4] Road at edge (1, 6):
- Extends from my settlement at node 1
- Points toward potential new settlement locations
- Medium strategic value

[5] Road at edge (17, 18):
- Extends from my city at node 15
- Could open up settlement opportunities
- Medium strategic value

[6] Road at edge (14, 15):
- Connects to my city at node 15
- Could help connect my two building areas
- Medium-high strategic value

## Strategic Decision:
I need to focus on two key objectives:
1. Challenge RED for longest road to take away their 2 VP bonus
2. Create paths for new settlements to increase my VP

Looking at the board connectivity, I need to work on connecting my two building clusters while creating opportunities for new settlements.

<plan>
1. Focus on roads that can help connect my two building clusters (around nodes 1 and 15)
2. Work toward building a continuous network of 6+ roads to take longest road from RED
3. Look for settlement opportunities along this path
4. Save resources for city upgrade at node 1 when possible (needs 3 ore, 2 wheat)
5. Path to victory: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2-3 settlements (2-3 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + longest road (2 VP)
</plan>

Based on this analysis, I should build a road that helps connect my two clusters. Option [6] (edge 14, 15) extends from my city at node 15 and could potentially help create a path toward my settlement at node 1. This road is a strategic step toward connecting my network and challenging RED for the longest road bonus.

# Robber Placement Analysis

Let me analyze the game state and determine the optimal robber placement to maximize my chances of winning.

## Current Game State
- I'm at 5/10 VP: 1 city (2 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + largest army (2 VP)
- RED is at 6/10 VP: 2 cities (4 VP) + longest road (2 VP)
- I have 1 wood, 2 wheat, 1 ore
- I need to block RED's most productive hexes and potentially steal a useful resource

## Examining Robber Placement Options

**[0] Move robber to (0, 0, 0) and steal from RED**
- This is the sheep (🐑4) hex
- Blocks RED's city at node 5 (which produces sheep)
- But sheep is not as critical as other resources for city building

**[1] Move robber to (1, -1, 0)**
- This is the wheat (🌾10) hex
- Would block my own settlement at node 1, hurting my own production
- Not a good choice

**[2] Move robber to (0, -1, 1)**
- This is a desert tile, which produces nothing
- Completely wasteful move since it blocks no production

**[3] Move robber to (-1, 1, 0) and steal from RED**
- This is the wheat (🌾8) hex
- Blocks RED's city at node 5 (which produces wheat)
- Also blocks my own city at node 15 (which produces wheat)
- Wheat is critical for settlements and cities, but blocking my own production is suboptimal

**[4] Move robber to (0, 1, -1) and steal from RED**
- This is the wood (🌲6) hex
- Blocks RED's city at both node 5 and node 20 (both produce wood)
- Wood is crucial for building roads and settlements
- Doesn't block any of my production

**[5] Move robber to (1, 0, -1) and steal from RED**
- This is the ore (⛏️5) hex
- Blocks RED's city at node 20 (which produces ore)
- But also blocks my settlement at node 1 (which produces ore)
- Ore is crucial for city upgrades, but blocking my own production is suboptimal

## Strategic Decision
Option [4] is clearly the strongest move because:
1. It blocks wood production for RED's TWO cities (double impact)
2. Wood is essential for RED to extend their road network and maintain longest road
3. I don't hurt my own production
4. I get to steal a resource from RED which could be useful
5. This slows RED's expansion and gives me time to catch up

This action aligns with my strategic plan of working toward longest road while preventing RED from expanding further.

<plan>
1. Focus on roads to connect my building clusters and work toward longest road
2. Block RED's wood production to slow their expansion
3. Build more roads to take longest road from RED (need 6+ connected roads)
4. Look for settlement opportunities along my road path
5. Save resources for city upgrade at node 1 when possible (needs 3 ore, 2 wheat)
6. Path to victory: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2-3 settlements (2-3 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + longest road (2 VP)
</plan>

1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (HIGHEST PRIORITY):
- Target 6 & 8 numbered hexes at all costs - these are the most productive numbers
- Prioritize ore and wheat hexes for your settlements - they enable cities and development cards
- Position yourself on at least one good brick and wood hex to enable early expansion
- Aim to cover ALL five resources with your two settlements combined
- Try to place on intersections with 3 productive hexes rather than 2
- Evaluate probability dots (not just numbers) - more dots mean more frequent production
- Place settlements with clear expansion paths that won't be easily blocked
- Avoid placing where you'll be immediately cut off by the opponent
- Position roads toward your next planned settlement location
- Consider distance to valuable ports (especially 2:1 ports matching your abundant resources)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-8):
- Build at least one new road and one new settlement ASAP
- Focus on securing access to any missing resources through expansion
- Establish access to a port if you're lacking a key resource
- Prevent the opponent from cutting off your expansion path
- Only purchase development cards if excess resources available or for immediate victory
- Expand toward high-value hexes the opponent doesn't yet control

MID-GAME RESOURCE MANAGEMENT (TURNS 9-20):
- Target 3 cities minimum (worth 6 VP) - upgrade most productive settlements first
- Maintain 1 road per every 2 settlements for flexible expansion
- Always build a settlement when you have the resources (more production points)
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each build (cities give best long-term return)
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1 or better) to maintain resource balance
- Keep at least one viable road-building path open at all times
- If blocked from expansion, shift to city upgrades and development cards

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Development cards should supplement your expansion, not replace it
- Prioritize using Knight cards to protect your best hexes from the robber
- Save Knights when you're ahead to counter the opponent's robber placements
- Only buy development cards when you:
  1. Have excess sheep/wheat/ore but lack wood/brick for expansion
  2. Are close to securing largest army
  3. Need a specific card type (Road Building to break through a blockade)
- Use Road Building cards to save brick/wood and create surprise expansion paths
- Time Monopoly cards to capture opponent's stockpile after high-producing rolls
- Use Year of Plenty to complete crucial builds when short on specific resources

ROBBER PLACEMENT:
- Always target the opponent's highest-producing hex (high number + settlement/city)
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat hexes to slow city development
- If opponent relies heavily on one resource, target that resource's hexes
- Never place the robber on your own high-production hexes
- When stealing, target resources you immediately need for your next build

VICTORY PATH PLANNING:
- Target resource independence with at least one settlement/city on each resource
- Minimum viable infrastructure: 3-4 settlements total, with 2-3 upgraded to cities
- Calculate multiple paths to 10 VP and pursue the fastest:
  Path 1: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP)
  Path 2: 4 cities (8 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP)
  Path 3: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 victory point card
- Always track your direct path to 10 VP and focus on those builds
- Prioritize visible points (settlements/cities) over speculative development cards
- Switch paths if the opponent blocks your primary victory path
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Accept trades only when they enable an immediate, crucial build
- Never make trades that allow opponent to build a settlement or city immediately
- Trade away excess resources when at risk for robber (7+ cards)
- Calculate the production value of each settlement location before deciding to build
- When trading with ports, plan sequences that convert unwanted resources into needed ones

DETAILED DECISION FRAMEWORK:
1. Does this move bring me closer to 10 victory points?
2. Does this move increase my production capacity more than alternative builds?
3. Does this move protect me from being blocked or cut off?
4. Does this move position me for strongest expansion in next 2-3 turns?
5. Is this the most efficient use of my current resources?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 55 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Focus on roads to connect my building clusters and work toward longest road
2. Block RED's wood production to slow their expansion
3. Build more roads to take longest road from RED (need 6+ connected roads)
4. Look for settlement opportunities along my road path
5. Save resources for city upgrade at node 1 when possible (needs 3 ore, 2 wheat)
6. Path to victory: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2-3 settlements (2-3 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + longest road (2 VP)
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.

# Game Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state and my available actions to determine the optimal move.

## Current Game State
- I have 5 VP (1 settlement, 1 city, largest army)
- RED has 6 VP (2 cities, longest road)
- My resources: 1 🌲WOOD, 4 🌾WHEAT, 3 ⛏️ORE
- Robber is on the wood hex (0, 1, -1)

## Available Actions
0. End turn
1. Upgrade settlement at node 1 to a city (Cost: 2 🌾WHEAT, 3 ⛏️ORE)
2-5. Various maritime trades with wheat

## Action Analysis

### Option 1: Upgrade Settlement to City
- This would cost me 2 WHEAT and 3 ORE, which I have exactly
- It increases my VP from 5 to 6, tying with RED
- It improves production at node 1 (🐑4, 🌾10, ⛏️5) - doubling dice values 4, 10, and 5
- This is a strong settlement that would benefit from upgrade (especially the ore production)

### Option 0: End Turn
- This preserves my resources but doesn't advance my position
- Not recommended when I can make a productive build

### Options 2-5: Maritime Trading
- None of these trades help me make an immediate build
- Trading wheat for wood could potentially help with future road building, but I already have 1 wood

## Strategic Considerations

Looking at my current plan:
- I need to work toward longest road (need 6+ connected roads)
- Upgrading to a city at node 1 will increase my VPs immediately
- The city upgrade will also increase my resource production, especially ore which is crucial for future city upgrades and development cards
- After upgrading to a city, I'll be at 6 VP, tied with RED

## Decision

The clear optimal move is to upgrade my settlement at node 1 to a city. This:
1. Immediately gains me 1 VP (to 6 VP total)
2. Increases my production capacity, particularly for ore on a 5 hex
3. Uses my current resources optimally
4. Advances my path to victory

<plan>
1. Upgrade settlement at node 1 to a city (done after this action)
2. Continue focusing on roads to build toward longest road (need 6+ connected roads)
3. Look for settlement opportunities along my road path
4. Save resources for development cards to maintain largest army advantage
5. Path to victory: 2 cities (4 VP) + 1-2 settlements (1-2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + longest road (2 VP)
</plan>

# Game State Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state and available options:

## Current Victory Points
- BLUE (me): 6/10 (2 cities = 4 VP + largest army = 2 VP)
- RED: 6/10 (2 cities = 4 VP + longest road = 2 VP)

## My Resources
- 1 🌲 WOOD
- 2 🐑 SHEEP
- 4 🌾 WHEAT
- Missing: 🧱 BRICK and ⛏️ ORE

## Available Actions
- [0] End turn
- [1-4] Maritime trades (4:1) to get ORE, BRICK, SHEEP, or WOOD

## Strategic Assessment

1. **Victory Path Analysis**: My current plan is focused on maintaining largest army (2 VP) while trying to get longest road (2 VP). However, with RED already having 5 connected roads compared to my longest of 2, this will be challenging.

2. **Resource Analysis**: I have 4 wheat but no ore or brick. In this situation:
   - I can't build roads (need wood + brick)
   - I can't build settlements (need wood + brick + sheep + wheat)
   - I can't upgrade to cities (need ore + wheat)
   - I can't buy development cards (need ore + sheep + wheat)

3. **Trading Options**: The only viable trades are 4:1, which are highly inefficient. Trading 4 wheat would leave me with just 1 sheep, 1 wood, and whatever resource I get in return.

4. **Immediate Build Options**: None, as I don't have the right resource combinations.

Given this situation, I need to adjust my plan:

<plan>
1. Focus on getting ore to upgrade my settlement at node 1 to a city
2. Work toward getting brick to build more roads and potentially challenge for longest road
3. Try to establish a settlement at a port for better trading options
4. Path to victory: 3 cities (6 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 more VP from settlements or development cards
</plan>

Right now, the most urgent need is to get ORE for upgrading to a city, since I already have the WHEAT component. However, trading 4 wheat for 1 ore is highly inefficient. Since I don't have enough resources to make any meaningful play this turn, and making an inefficient trade would deplete my resources without enabling me to build anything immediately, I should end my turn and hope for better resource production on the next roll.

# Game Analysis

I need to analyze my current position and available actions to make the optimal decision.

## Current Game State
- I have 6 VP (2 cities = 4 VP + Largest Army = 2 VP)
- RED also has 6 VP (2 cities = 4 VP + Longest Road = 2 VP)
- I have: 1 🌲WOOD, 2 🐑SHEEP, 4 🌾WHEAT, but 0 ⛏️ORE, 0 🧱BRICK
- Robber is on the wood hex (0, 1, -1) with value 6, blocking wood production

## Available Actions
- [0] End Turn
- [1-4] Maritime Trade options with 4:1 ratio (wheat for ore/brick/sheep/wood)

## Strategic Assessment

Based on my current resources and plan, I need to consider my next build priority:

1. For a city upgrade, I need: 3 ORE + 2 WHEAT
   - I have 4 WHEAT but 0 ORE
   - Trading for ORE could help me progress toward a city

2. For a new settlement, I need: 1 BRICK + 1 WOOD + 1 SHEEP + 1 WHEAT
   - I have 1 WOOD, 2 SHEEP, and 4 WHEAT, but 0 BRICK
   - Trading for BRICK could help me build more roads and eventually settlements

Since I have excess WHEAT (4), and my next priority is either getting ORE for city upgrades or BRICK for expansion, I should consider trading.

The most efficient move here would be to trade for a resource I immediately need. According to my plan, I wanted to focus on getting ore to upgrade a settlement to a city, which would increase my VP to 7.

<plan>
1. Focus on getting ore to upgrade my settlements to cities 
2. After getting one ore via trading, I'll need two more for a city upgrade
3. Build more roads when I get brick to potentially challenge for longest road
4. Path to victory: 3 cities (6 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 more VP from settlements
</plan>

Given my current resources and available actions, I should trade 4 WHEAT for 1 ORE to progress toward my city upgrade goal.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist whose primary goal is to defeat the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (HIGHEST PRIORITY):
- Target 6 & 8 numbered hexes at all costs - these are the most productive numbers
- Prioritize ore and wheat hexes for your settlements - they enable cities and development cards
- Position yourself on at least one good brick and wood hex to enable early expansion
- Aim to cover ALL five resources with your two settlements combined
- Try to place on intersections with 3 productive hexes rather than 2
- Evaluate probability dots (not just numbers) - more dots mean more frequent production
- Place settlements with clear expansion paths that won't be easily blocked
- Avoid placing where you'll be immediately cut off by the opponent
- Position roads toward your next planned settlement location
- Consider distance to valuable ports (especially 2:1 ports matching your abundant resources)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-8):
- Build at least one new road and one new settlement ASAP
- Focus on securing access to any missing resources through expansion
- Establish access to a port if you're lacking a key resource
- Prevent the opponent from cutting off your expansion path
- Only purchase development cards if excess resources available or for immediate victory
- Expand toward high-value hexes the opponent doesn't yet control

MID-GAME RESOURCE MANAGEMENT (TURNS 9-20):
- Target 3 cities minimum (worth 6 VP) - upgrade most productive settlements first
- Maintain 1 road per every 2 settlements for flexible expansion
- Always build a settlement when you have the resources (more production points)
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each build (cities give best long-term return)
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1 or better) to maintain resource balance
- Keep at least one viable road-building path open at all times
- If blocked from expansion, shift to city upgrades and development cards

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Development cards should supplement your expansion, not replace it
- Prioritize using Knight cards to protect your best hexes from the robber
- Save Knights when you're ahead to counter the opponent's robber placements
- Only buy development cards when you:
  1. Have excess sheep/wheat/ore but lack wood/brick for expansion
  2. Are close to securing largest army
  3. Need a specific card type (Road Building to break through a blockade)
- Use Road Building cards to save brick/wood and create surprise expansion paths
- Time Monopoly cards to capture opponent's stockpile after high-producing rolls
- Use Year of Plenty to complete crucial builds when short on specific resources

ROBBER PLACEMENT:
- Always target the opponent's highest-producing hex (high number + settlement/city)
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat hexes to slow city development
- If opponent relies heavily on one resource, target that resource's hexes
- Never place the robber on your own high-production hexes
- When stealing, target resources you immediately need for your next build

VICTORY PATH PLANNING:
- Target resource independence with at least one settlement/city on each resource
- Minimum viable infrastructure: 3-4 settlements total, with 2-3 upgraded to cities
- Calculate multiple paths to 10 VP and pursue the fastest:
  Path 1: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP)
  Path 2: 4 cities (8 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP)
  Path 3: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 victory point card
- Always track your direct path to 10 VP and focus on those builds
- Prioritize visible points (settlements/cities) over speculative development cards
- Switch paths if the opponent blocks your primary victory path
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Accept trades only when they enable an immediate, crucial build
- Never make trades that allow opponent to build a settlement or city immediately
- Trade away excess resources when at risk for robber (7+ cards)
- Calculate the production value of each settlement location before deciding to build
- When trading with ports, plan sequences that convert unwanted resources into needed ones

DETAILED DECISION FRAMEWORK:
1. Does this move bring me closer to 10 victory points?
2. Does this move increase my production capacity more than alternative builds?
3. Does this move protect me from being blocked or cut off?
4. Does this move position me for strongest expansion in next 2-3 turns?
5. Is this the most efficient use of my current resources?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game State Analysis

I'll analyze the current game state and my options thoroughly:

## Current Position:
- **Victory Points**: 6/10 (2 cities = 4VP + largest army = 2VP)
- **Resources**: 1 🌲WOOD, 2 🐑SHEEP, 2 🌾WHEAT, 1 ⛏️ORE
- **Opponent**: 6/10 VP (2 cities = 4VP + longest road = 2VP)

## Resources & Production:
- I have production of: 🧱3, 🐑4, 🌾8, 🌾10, ⛏️5
- The robber is on a 🌲6 hex, blocking a potentially high-producing resource
- I need more ore for city upgrades

## Available Actions:
1. **Buy a Development Card** (1 🐑, 1 🌾, 1 ⛏️) - Would this help me win?
2. **End Turn** - Save resources for future builds

## Decision Analysis:

If I buy a development card:
- **Pros**: 
  - Could get a Victory Point card (25% chance) for immediate VP
  - Could get a Knight to reinforce largest army advantage
  - Could get utility cards (Monopoly, Year of Plenty, Road Building) for strategic advantage
- **Cons**: 
  - Uses my only ore, which delays city upgrades
  - Not guaranteed to get a useful card

If I end my turn:
- **Pros**:
  - Save ore for future city upgrade
  - Maybe get better resources next turn
- **Cons**:
  - Holding 6 resources puts me at risk for robber (7 roll)
  - Not making progress this turn

Since I'm at 6 cards total, I'm at risk for the robber. Getting closer to the victory condition is more important than saving resources at this stage. A development card could potentially give me an immediate victory point or another knight to strengthen my largest army advantage against the opponent.

<plan>
1. Buy a development card now to potentially get closer to victory
2. If I get a VP card, I'll be at 7/10 points
3. If I get a Knight, I'll strengthen my largest army advantage
4. Next turns: focus on getting more ore for city upgrades 
5. Path to victory: 3 cities (6 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 1-2 VP from development cards
</plan>

# Game Analysis for Settlers of Catan

Let me analyze the current game state and make the optimal decision.

## Current Situation
- I (BLUE) have 6/10 victory points
- RED has 6/10 victory points
- I have resources: 1 Wood, 1 Sheep, 1 Wheat
- I have 1 Knight card in hand
- The robber is currently on a Wood hex (0, 1, -1) with number 6

## Options Analysis
I have two options:
1. Play Knight card - Move the robber and steal a resource
2. Roll the dice

### Option 0: Play Knight Card
**Benefits:**
- I can move the robber from the Wood hex to block RED's production
- I can potentially steal a valuable resource from RED
- RED has 6 cards, so there's a good chance to get something useful
- Knight card strengthens my Largest Army advantage (would be 6 knights)

**Drawbacks:**
- If I roll well after playing the knight, I'd be in an even better position
- The robber is currently on a Wood hex that produces on a 6, which is a strong production value

### Option 1: Roll Dice First
**Benefits:**
- I could gain more resources before playing the Knight
- If I roll a 7, I would get the robber advantage without using my Knight
- Keeping the Knight card means I have it available for defense if needed

**Drawbacks:**
- If I roll a 7, I would have to place the robber without getting the benefit of playing the Knight
- RED might get valuable resources if I roll their numbers first

## Strategic Considerations
- RED is tied with me at 6 VP, so slowing them down is crucial
- I have limited resources right now, so getting more production is important
- My current plan focuses on development cards, which requires resources

<plan>
1. Roll first to collect resources
2. Save the Knight card for when I really need it (defense or offense)
3. Continue working toward city upgrades when I get enough ore
4. Maintain my largest army advantage
5. Path to victory: 3 cities (6 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 1-2 VP from development cards
</plan>

## Final Decision
Rolling first makes the most sense because:
1. It can potentially give me more resources before making further decisions
2. If I roll a 7, I'd effectively get the knight benefit without using the card
3. I should save the Knight for when I really need it strategically

Therefore, I'll choose to roll the dice.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist whose primary goal is to defeat the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (HIGHEST PRIORITY):
- Target 6 & 8 numbered hexes at all costs - these are the most productive numbers
- Prioritize ore and wheat hexes for your settlements - they enable cities and development cards
- Position yourself on at least one good brick and wood hex to enable early expansion
- Aim to cover ALL five resources with your two settlements combined
- Try to place on intersections with 3 productive hexes rather than 2
- Evaluate probability dots (not just numbers) - more dots mean more frequent production
- Place settlements with clear expansion paths that won't be easily blocked
- Avoid placing where you'll be immediately cut off by the opponent
- Position roads toward your next planned settlement location
- Consider distance to valuable ports (especially 2:1 ports matching your abundant resources)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-8):
- Build at least one new road and one new settlement ASAP
- Focus on securing access to any missing resources through expansion
- Establish access to a port if you're lacking a key resource
- Prevent the opponent from cutting off your expansion path
- Only purchase development cards if excess resources available or for immediate victory
- Expand toward high-value hexes the opponent doesn't yet control

MID-GAME RESOURCE MANAGEMENT (TURNS 9-20):
- Target 3 cities minimum (worth 6 VP) - upgrade most productive settlements first
- Maintain 1 road per every 2 settlements for flexible expansion
- Always build a settlement when you have the resources (more production points)
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each build (cities give best long-term return)
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1 or better) to maintain resource balance
- Keep at least one viable road-building path open at all times
- If blocked from expansion, shift to city upgrades and development cards

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Development cards should supplement your expansion, not replace it
- Prioritize using Knight cards to protect your best hexes from the robber
- Save Knights when you're ahead to counter the opponent's robber placements
- Only buy development cards when you:
  1. Have excess sheep/wheat/ore but lack wood/brick for expansion
  2. Are close to securing largest army
  3. Need a specific card type (Road Building to break through a blockade)
- Use Road Building cards to save brick/wood and create surprise expansion paths
- Time Monopoly cards to capture opponent's stockpile after high-producing rolls
- Use Year of Plenty to complete crucial builds when short on specific resources

ROBBER PLACEMENT:
- Always target the opponent's highest-producing hex (high number + settlement/city)
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat hexes to slow city development
- If opponent relies heavily on one resource, target that resource's hexes
- Never place the robber on your own high-production hexes
- When stealing, target resources you immediately need for your next build

VICTORY PATH PLANNING:
- Target resource independence with at least one settlement/city on each resource
- Minimum viable infrastructure: 3-4 settlements total, with 2-3 upgraded to cities
- Calculate multiple paths to 10 VP and pursue the fastest:
  Path 1: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP)
  Path 2: 4 cities (8 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP)
  Path 3: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 victory point card
- Always track your direct path to 10 VP and focus on those builds
- Prioritize visible points (settlements/cities) over speculative development cards
- Switch paths if the opponent blocks your primary victory path
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Accept trades only when they enable an immediate, crucial build
- Never make trades that allow opponent to build a settlement or city immediately
- Trade away excess resources when at risk for robber (7+ cards)
- Calculate the production value of each settlement location before deciding to build
- When trading with ports, plan sequences that convert unwanted resources into needed ones

DETAILED DECISION FRAMEWORK:
1. Does this move bring me closer to 10 victory points?
2. Does this move increase my production capacity more than alternative builds?
3. Does this move protect me from being blocked or cut off?
4. Does this move position me for strongest expansion in next 2-3 turns?
5. Is this the most efficient use of my current resources?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 63 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Roll first to collect resources
2. Save the Knight card for when I really need it (defense or offense)
3. Continue working toward city upgrades when I get enough ore
4. Maintain my largest army advantage
5. Path to victory: 3 cities (6 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 1-2 VP from development cards

# Game Analysis for Turn 63

I need to analyze my current situation and decide between playing my Knight card or ending my turn.

## Current Game State Assessment:
- I have 6 VP (2 cities = 4 VP + largest army = 2 VP)
- Red has 6 VP (2 cities = 4 VP + longest road = 2 VP)
- I have limited resources: 1 wood, 1 sheep, 1 wheat
- I have 1 Knight card available to play
- I already have the Largest Army bonus with 5 knights played

## Options Analysis:

**Option 0: Play Knight card**
- Benefits:
  - Could move the robber off the wood hex (0,1,-1) where it's currently placed
  - Could steal a resource from Red who has 6 cards
  - Could potentially block Red's most productive hex (either the 8 wheat or 6 wood)
- Drawbacks:
  - I wouldn't be able to build anything with my current resources anyway
  - Playing the Knight now doesn't increase my lead in the Largest Army (I already have it)
  - I may need the Knight later for defense if Red places the robber on one of my productive hexes

**Option 1: End Turn**
- Benefits:
  - Save Knight card for when I really need it (defense or a more critical moment)
  - I'll get to roll for resources on my next turn, hopefully collecting more to build with
- Drawbacks:
  - Miss opportunity to disrupt Red's production and potentially steal a valuable resource

## Strategic Considerations:
1. My current resources (1 wood, 1 sheep, 1 wheat) aren't close to any useful build
2. Red has a significant number of cards (6) that I could potentially steal from
3. The robber is currently on a wood hex that produces for Red but not for me
4. Playing the Knight now doesn't advance my victory path directly

<plan>
1. End my turn now to roll for new resources
2. Save the Knight card for defensive purposes or to use when it can directly contribute to building something
3. Continue working toward city upgrades when I get enough ore
4. Maintain my largest army advantage
5. Path to victory: 3 cities (6 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 1-2 VP from development cards
</plan>

While playing the Knight could be tempting to disrupt Red and potentially get a useful resource, strategically it makes more sense to save it for when I really need it. My current resources don't allow me to build anything significant, so ending my turn to get a resource roll is the better option.

# Game Analysis: Settlers of Catan - Turn 65

Let me analyze the current game state and my available options to make the optimal decision.

## Current Game State
- I have 6 victory points (4 from 2 cities + 2 from largest army)
- RED has 7 victory points (4 from 2 cities + 1 from 1 settlement + 2 from longest road)
- I have 5 resources: 1 wood, 1 sheep, 1 wheat, 2 ore
- I have 1 Knight card in hand
- The robber is currently on a wood hex (0, 1, -1)

## Options Analysis

**Option 0: Play Knight Card**
- Benefits:
  - Move robber from wood hex to block RED player's production
  - Steal a resource from RED
  - Strengthen my largest army advantage (would go to 6 knights)
- Drawbacks:
  - I don't have immediate building plans that would benefit from using this card now
  - I only have 5 resources, so I'm not at risk of losing resources to a 7 roll
  - The knight could be more valuable saved for later when I need a specific resource

**Option 1: Roll the Dice**
- Benefits:
  - Potentially collect more resources for building
  - I'm not at resource limit, so no risk from rolling a 7
  - With 2 cities, my production potential is good
- Drawbacks:
  - If I roll a 7, I'll have to move the robber without stealing (since I'd have 5 cards)

## Strategic Considerations
1. I'm 4 points away from victory (need to reach 10)
2. RED is 3 points away from victory
3. My current plan is city-focused + maintaining largest army

Looking at my resources, I currently have 2 ore, which is a good start towards a city (needs 3 ore + 2 wheat), but I need more resources. My best path forward is to continue accumulating resources for a city upgrade or new settlement.

<plan>
1. Roll for resources to continue accumulating what I need
2. Save the Knight card for when it provides more strategic value:
   - When RED is close to winning and I need to disrupt their production
   - When I need a specific resource from RED
   - When I'm at risk of losing largest army
3. Work towards my third city (would give me 8 VP)
4. Look for opportunities to build settlements and extend roads
5. Path to victory: 3 cities (6 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + settlement/VP cards for the remaining 2 VP
</plan>

The knight card is more valuable as a strategic reserve at this moment, and rolling gives me the chance to collect more resources. Since RED is ahead by 1 VP, I need to focus on resource collection to catch up and surpass them.

# Game State Analysis

Let me carefully analyze the current game state to make the optimal decision:

## Victory Point Status
- RED: 7/10 VP (2 cities = 4 VP, 1 settlement = 1 VP, longest road = 2 VP)
- BLUE (me): 6/10 VP (2 cities = 4 VP, largest army = 2 VP)
- I need 4 more VP to win

## My Resources
- 1 🌲WOOD, 1 🐑SHEEP, 1 🌾WHEAT, 2 ⛏️ORE
- 1 KNIGHT card in hand
- I'm 1 ORE away from building a city (costs 3 ORE, 2 WHEAT)

## Board Position
- I have strong production of ORE (from node 1)
- RED controls a very productive hex with the 6 number (wood)
- RED is only 3 VP away from winning

## Available Actions
0. Play Knight card to move the robber and steal a resource
1. End my turn
2. Buy a development card (costs 1 🐑SHEEP, 1 🌾WHEAT, 1 ⛏️ORE)

## Decision Analysis

**Option 0: Play Knight**
- Advantages: Could disrupt RED's production by moving robber to their 6-wood hex, potentially stealing a useful resource
- Disadvantages: I already have largest army, so no immediate VP gain; I'd use up my Knight that could be saved for when RED is closer to winning

**Option 1: End Turn**
- Advantages: Preserves all my resources for future builds
- Disadvantages: Makes no progress toward victory, no immediate benefit

**Option 2: Buy Development Card**
- Advantages: Could get a Victory Point card (immediate +1 VP); Road Building could help me contest longest road; Knight could strengthen largest army lead
- Disadvantages: Uses resources that could go toward a city if I get one more ORE

Looking at my current situation:
- I'm close to building a city (just need 1 more ORE)
- RED is ahead by 1 VP and they might be working toward their third city
- Development cards provide a hidden strategy element and could give me a VP

<plan>
1. Buy a development card now - hoping for VP card or Knight to secure largest army
2. If I get a VP card, I'll be at 7 VP; if Knight, I strengthen largest army position
3. Continue working toward third city (need 1 more ORE)
4. Save the original Knight card to disrupt RED if they get close to winning
5. Path to victory: 3 cities (6 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + development cards (2 VP)
</plan>

Given RED is ahead, I should make progress toward victory. Buying a development card offers the best chance of immediate VP gain and creates uncertainty for my opponent.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist whose primary goal is to defeat the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (HIGHEST PRIORITY):
- Target 6 & 8 numbered hexes at all costs - these are the most productive numbers
- Prioritize ore and wheat hexes for your settlements - they enable cities and development cards
- Position yourself on at least one good brick and wood hex to enable early expansion
- Aim to cover ALL five resources with your two settlements combined
- Try to place on intersections with 3 productive hexes rather than 2
- Evaluate probability dots (not just numbers) - more dots mean more frequent production
- Place settlements with clear expansion paths that won't be easily blocked
- Avoid placing where you'll be immediately cut off by the opponent
- Position roads toward your next planned settlement location
- Consider distance to valuable ports (especially 2:1 ports matching your abundant resources)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-8):
- Build at least one new road and one new settlement ASAP
- Focus on securing access to any missing resources through expansion
- Establish access to a port if you're lacking a key resource
- Prevent the opponent from cutting off your expansion path
- Only purchase development cards if excess resources available or for immediate victory
- Expand toward high-value hexes the opponent doesn't yet control

MID-GAME RESOURCE MANAGEMENT (TURNS 9-20):
- Target 3 cities minimum (worth 6 VP) - upgrade most productive settlements first
- Maintain 1 road per every 2 settlements for flexible expansion
- Always build a settlement when you have the resources (more production points)
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each build (cities give best long-term return)
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1 or better) to maintain resource balance
- Keep at least one viable road-building path open at all times
- If blocked from expansion, shift to city upgrades and development cards

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Development cards should supplement your expansion, not replace it
- Prioritize using Knight cards to protect your best hexes from the robber
- Save Knights when you're ahead to counter the opponent's robber placements
- Only buy development cards when you:
  1. Have excess sheep/wheat/ore but lack wood/brick for expansion
  2. Are close to securing largest army
  3. Need a specific card type (Road Building to break through a blockade)
- Use Road Building cards to save brick/wood and create surprise expansion paths
- Time Monopoly cards to capture opponent's stockpile after high-producing rolls
- Use Year of Plenty to complete crucial builds when short on specific resources

ROBBER PLACEMENT:
- Always target the opponent's highest-producing hex (high number + settlement/city)
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat hexes to slow city development
- If opponent relies heavily on one resource, target that resource's hexes
- Never place the robber on your own high-production hexes
- When stealing, target resources you immediately need for your next build

VICTORY PATH PLANNING:
- Target resource independence with at least one settlement/city on each resource
- Minimum viable infrastructure: 3-4 settlements total, with 2-3 upgraded to cities
- Calculate multiple paths to 10 VP and pursue the fastest:
  Path 1: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP)
  Path 2: 4 cities (8 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP)
  Path 3: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 victory point card
- Always track your direct path to 10 VP and focus on those builds
- Prioritize visible points (settlements/cities) over speculative development cards
- Switch paths if the opponent blocks your primary victory path
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Accept trades only when they enable an immediate, crucial build
- Never make trades that allow opponent to build a settlement or city immediately
- Trade away excess resources when at risk for robber (7+ cards)
- Calculate the production value of each settlement location before deciding to build
- When trading with ports, plan sequences that convert unwanted resources into needed ones

DETAILED DECISION FRAMEWORK:
1. Does this move bring me closer to 10 victory points?
2. Does this move increase my production capacity more than alternative builds?
3. Does this move protect me from being blocked or cut off?
4. Does this move position me for strongest expansion in next 2-3 turns?
5. Is this the most efficient use of my current resources?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 65 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Buy a development card now - hoping for VP card or Knight to secure largest army
2. If I get a VP card, I'll be at 7 VP; if Knight, I strengthen largest army position
3. Continue working toward third city (need 1 more ORE)
4. Save the original Knight card to disrupt RED if they get close to winning
5. Path to victory: 3 cities (6 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + development cards (2 VP)

# Game Analysis

Let me assess the current game state and my options:

## Victory Points
- RED: 7 VP (2 cities = 4 VP, 1 settlement = 1 VP, Longest Road = 2 VP)
- BLUE (me): 6 VP (2 cities = 4 VP, Largest Army = 2 VP)

## My Resources
- 1 Wood, 1 Ore
- 2 Knight development cards

## Available Actions
- [0] Play Knight card - Move the robber and steal a resource
- [1] End turn

## Strategic Considerations

1. RED is at 7 VP, only 3 away from winning. This is concerning.
2. I cannot build anything with my current resources (1 Wood, 1 Ore).
3. I have 2 Knight cards in hand.
4. Playing a Knight now would:
   - Let me move the robber to disrupt RED's production
   - Allow me to steal a resource from RED
   - Strengthen my hold on Largest Army (increasing from 5 to 6 knights)

5. The robber is currently on the Wood hex (0,1,-1) with value 6, which is one of the most productive numbers. This is currently affecting both RED players' settlements.

6. If I end my turn without playing a Knight, I'm essentially passing without taking any action that could help my position.

<plan>
1. Play a Knight card now to disrupt RED and steal a resource
2. Move the robber to one of RED's most productive hexes - the 8 wheat hex (-1,1,0)
3. This will slow RED down while potentially giving me a useful resource
4. Continue working toward my third city (need 2 more ore, 3 wheat)
5. Path to victory: 3 cities (6 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + development cards (2 VP)
</plan>

Playing the Knight card is clearly the optimal move here, as it:
1. Disrupts RED's production on a high-value hex
2. Gives me a chance to steal a needed resource
3. Strengthens my hold on Largest Army
4. Is better than simply ending my turn without taking any action

Therefore, I choose:

# Game Analysis for Move Robber Decision

I need to place the robber on one of RED's most productive hexes to hinder their progress while potentially gaining a useful resource.

## Resource Production Analysis
- RED has cities on nodes 5 and 20, plus a settlement on node 3
- RED's highest-producing hexes:
  * Node 5 city: 🌾8 (3 dots), 🌲6 (2 dots)
  * Node 20 city: 🌲6 (2 dots)
  * Settlement at node 3: No high-value hexes

## Robber Options Evaluation:
[0] Move robber to (0, 0, 0) - Sheep 4 hex
- Blocks a 1-dot hex (low value)
- RED has this connected to node 5 (city) and node 3 (settlement)
- Moderate impact

[1] Move robber to (1, -1, 0) - Wheat 10 hex
- Blocks a 1-dot hex (low value)
- I have a city here, would hurt me
- Poor choice

[2] Move robber to (0, -1, 1) - Desert
- Already non-productive
- Waste of a robber move
- Poor choice

[3] Move robber to (-1, 0, 1) - Brick 3 hex
- Blocks a 1-dot hex (low value)
- RED has a settlement here
- Low impact

[4] Move robber to (-1, 1, 0) - Wheat 8 hex
- Blocks a 3-dot hex (high value)
- RED has a city connected to this (node 5)
- BLUE has a city here too (would hurt me as well)
- High impact on RED but also hurts me

[5] Move robber to (1, 0, -1) - Ore 5 hex
- Blocks a 2-dot hex (medium value)
- RED has a city connected to this (node 20)
- Could steal ore which I need for my city upgrade
- Good impact, doesn't hurt me

## Strategic Considerations:
1. I need ore to continue my city-building strategy
2. RED is ahead with 7 VP vs my 6 VP
3. I should disrupt their highest production while not affecting mine
4. I'm looking to steal a resource that's useful for me (ore preferred)

<plan>
1. Move the robber to RED's ore hex (1, 0, -1) to block a 2-dot resource from their city
2. Potentially steal ore which I need for my third city upgrade
3. Continue saving for my third city (need 2 more ore, 3 wheat)
4. If I get an ore from this steal, I'll only need 1 more ore + 3 wheat
5. Work toward victory through: 3 cities (6 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + development cards (2 VP)
</plan>

Option [5] is my best choice because:
- It blocks a medium-value resource (2 dots) from RED's city
- Has potential to give me ore which I need
- Doesn't affect my own production
- Targets RED's city, not just a settlement

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist whose primary goal is to defeat the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (HIGHEST PRIORITY):
- Target 6 & 8 numbered hexes at all costs - these are the most productive numbers
- Prioritize ore and wheat hexes for your settlements - they enable cities and development cards
- Position yourself on at least one good brick and wood hex to enable early expansion
- Aim to cover ALL five resources with your two settlements combined
- Try to place on intersections with 3 productive hexes rather than 2
- Evaluate probability dots (not just numbers) - more dots mean more frequent production
- Place settlements with clear expansion paths that won't be easily blocked
- Avoid placing where you'll be immediately cut off by the opponent
- Position roads toward your next planned settlement location
- Consider distance to valuable ports (especially 2:1 ports matching your abundant resources)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-8):
- Build at least one new road and one new settlement ASAP
- Focus on securing access to any missing resources through expansion
- Establish access to a port if you're lacking a key resource
- Prevent the opponent from cutting off your expansion path
- Only purchase development cards if excess resources available or for immediate victory
- Expand toward high-value hexes the opponent doesn't yet control

MID-GAME RESOURCE MANAGEMENT (TURNS 9-20):
- Target 3 cities minimum (worth 6 VP) - upgrade most productive settlements first
- Maintain 1 road per every 2 settlements for flexible expansion
- Always build a settlement when you have the resources (more production points)
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each build (cities give best long-term return)
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1 or better) to maintain resource balance
- Keep at least one viable road-building path open at all times
- If blocked from expansion, shift to city upgrades and development cards

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Development cards should supplement your expansion, not replace it
- Prioritize using Knight cards to protect your best hexes from the robber
- Save Knights when you're ahead to counter the opponent's robber placements
- Only buy development cards when you:
  1. Have excess sheep/wheat/ore but lack wood/brick for expansion
  2. Are close to securing largest army
  3. Need a specific card type (Road Building to break through a blockade)
- Use Road Building cards to save brick/wood and create surprise expansion paths
- Time Monopoly cards to capture opponent's stockpile after high-producing rolls
- Use Year of Plenty to complete crucial builds when short on specific resources

ROBBER PLACEMENT:
- Always target the opponent's highest-producing hex (high number + settlement/city)
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat hexes to slow city development
- If opponent relies heavily on one resource, target that resource's hexes
- Never place the robber on your own high-production hexes
- When stealing, target resources you immediately need for your next build

VICTORY PATH PLANNING:
- Target resource independence with at least one settlement/city on each resource
- Minimum viable infrastructure: 3-4 settlements total, with 2-3 upgraded to cities
- Calculate multiple paths to 10 VP and pursue the fastest:
  Path 1: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP)
  Path 2: 4 cities (8 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP)
  Path 3: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 victory point card
- Always track your direct path to 10 VP and focus on those builds
- Prioritize visible points (settlements/cities) over speculative development cards
- Switch paths if the opponent blocks your primary victory path
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Accept trades only when they enable an immediate, crucial build
- Never make trades that allow opponent to build a settlement or city immediately
- Trade away excess resources when at risk for robber (7+ cards)
- Calculate the production value of each settlement location before deciding to build
- When trading with ports, plan sequences that convert unwanted resources into needed ones

DETAILED DECISION FRAMEWORK:
1. Does this move bring me closer to 10 victory points?
2. Does this move increase my production capacity more than alternative builds?
3. Does this move protect me from being blocked or cut off?
4. Does this move position me for strongest expansion in next 2-3 turns?
5. Is this the most efficient use of my current resources?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 67 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Move the robber to RED's ore hex (1, 0, -1) to block a 2-dot resource from their city
2. Potentially steal ore which I need for my third city upgrade
3. Continue saving for my third city (need 2 more ore, 3 wheat)
4. If I get an ore from this steal, I'll only need 1 more ore + 3 wheat
5. Work toward victory through: 3 cities (6 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + development cards (2 VP)
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.

# Game Analysis for Current Turn

I need to make a strategic choice between rolling the dice or playing my Knight card. Let's analyze both options:

## Knight Card Analysis
- Playing the Knight card would allow me to:
  - Move the robber from its current position (1, 0, -1), which is RED's ore hex with a roll of 5 (2 dots)
  - I'd need to put it somewhere else, potentially disrupting RED's production
  - Steal a resource from RED
  - Increase my knight count from 6 to 7, though I already have Largest Army

## Roll Analysis
- Rolling the dice would:
  - Potentially gain me more resources (I have 2 productive cities)
  - Allow me to save my Knight card for defense if the robber is placed on my hexes later

## Resource Assessment
- I currently have 1 Wood, 2 Sheep, 1 Wheat, 1 Ore
- For my third city upgrade, I need 2 more ore and 3 more wheat
- The robber is currently on RED's ore hex (1, 0, -1)

## Strategic Considerations
1. If I play the Knight card, I can move the robber but would just place it back on RED's ore hex or another productive hex
2. If I roll, I might get the resources I need for my city upgrade
3. Saving the Knight allows me to defend against future robber placements

<plan>
1. Roll the dice to try gaining more resources toward my city upgrade
2. Save the Knight card for defense in case RED places the robber on my high-production hexes
3. Continue saving for my third city (need 2 more ore, 3 wheat)
4. Work toward victory through: 3 cities (6 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + development cards (2 VP)
</plan>

Since I already have the largest army bonus and the robber is already placed on one of RED's productive hexes, playing my Knight card now offers limited advantage. Rolling has more upside potential to gain resources I need for my city upgrade.

# Analysis of Game State and Available Options

Let me analyze the current game state and my available options:

## Current Victory Points
- I have 6 VP: 2 cities (4 VP) + Largest Army (2 VP)
- RED has 7 VP: 2 cities (4 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + Longest Road (2 VP)
- I need 4 more VP to win

## Resources in Hand
- 1 🌲WOOD, 2 🐑SHEEP, 3 🌾WHEAT, 1 ⛏️ORE
- I also have 1 KNIGHT development card

## Available Actions
0. Play Knight card - Move robber and steal a resource
1. End turn
2. Buy a development card (costs 1 🐑SHEEP, 1 🌾WHEAT, 1 ⛏️ORE)

## Victory Path Assessment
To reach 10 VP, I need 4 more points. Possible paths:
- Upgrade to a 3rd city (+2 VP) and get 2 VP development cards (+2 VP)
- Build 2 new settlements (+2 VP) and get 2 VP development cards (+2 VP)

## Resource Analysis
For a city upgrade, I need 3 ORE and 2 WHEAT. I currently have 1 ORE and 3 WHEAT, so I'm short 2 ORE.

## Strategic Considerations:
1. The robber is currently on my ore hex (5), blocking a critical resource I need for city upgrades
2. RED is ahead by 1 VP, making this a critical turn
3. I could use my Knight to move the robber off my ore hex and potentially steal an ore from RED
4. Buying a development card could potentially get me a VP card or another Knight to strengthen my Largest Army

## Decision Analysis:

**Option 0: Play Knight**
- Pros: Move the robber off my ore hex, allowing production on future rolls
- Pros: Potentially steal a needed ore from RED
- Pros: Strengthens my Largest Army lead (though I already have it)
- Cons: Uses my defensive Knight that could be saved for later protection

**Option 1: End Turn**
- Pros: Preserves my Knight card for defense
- Cons: Does nothing to advance my position
- Cons: Leaves the robber on my ore hex

**Option 2: Buy Development Card**
- Pros: Could get a Victory Point card (immediate gain)
- Pros: Could get another Knight to further secure Largest Army
- Pros: Could get a utility card (Monopoly, Year of Plenty, Road Building)
- Cons: Uses my ore which I need for city upgrades
- Cons: Leaves the robber on my ore hex
- Cons: Gambling on getting a useful card

<plan>
1. Use Knight to move robber off my ore hex and hopefully steal ORE from RED
2. Roll dice next turn to try getting more resources for my city upgrade (need 2 more ore)
3. Continue working toward my third city (6 VP) plus development cards for victory points
4. Keep an eye on RED's expansion and consider blocking if needed
</plan>

Since I need ore for my city upgrade strategy, and the robber is currently blocking my ore hex, playing the Knight card to move the robber and potentially steal an ore resource is the most strategic move. This directly addresses my resource bottleneck.

- Accept trades only when they enable an immediate, crucial build
- Never make trades that allow opponent to build a settlement or city immediately
- Trade away excess resources when at risk for robber (7+ cards)
- Calculate the production value of each settlement location before deciding to build
- When trading with ports, plan sequences that convert unwanted resources into needed ones

DETAILED DECISION FRAMEWORK:
1. Does this move bring me closer to 10 victory points?
2. Does this move increase my production capacity more than alternative builds?
3. Does this move protect me from being blocked or cut off?
4. Does this move position me for strongest expansion in next 2-3 turns?
5. Is this the most efficient use of my current resources?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 67 | Player: BLUE | Action: MOVE_ROBBER

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Use Knight to move robber off my ore hex and hopefully steal ORE from RED
2. Roll dice next turn to try getting more resources for my city upgrade (need 2 more ore)
3. Continue working toward my third city (6 VP) plus development cards for victory points
4. Keep an eye on RED's expansion and consider blocking if needed
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.

# Game Analysis for Optimal Robber Placement

I need to move the robber strategically to maximize my chances of winning. Let me analyze the available options:

## Current Game State
- I (BLUE) have 6 VP: 2 cities (4 VP) + Largest Army (2 VP)
- RED has 7 VP: 2 cities (4 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + Longest Road (2 VP)
- I need 4 more VP to win
- The robber is currently on hex (1, 0, -1), which is an ORE hex

## Resource Assessment
- I have 1 WOOD, 2 SHEEP, 3 WHEAT, 1 ORE
- I need more ORE to build my next city (need 3 ORE total, have only 1)
- RED has 5 hidden resource cards

## Robber Placement Options

Let me evaluate each option:

[0] Move to (0, 0, 0) - SHEEP hex - Connected to RED's settlement at node 3
- Blocks: SHEEP 4 (low production value)
- RED has a settlement here, so this affects their production
- I already have 2 SHEEP

[1] Move to (1, -1, 0) - WHEAT hex - Not connected to RED's buildings
- Blocks: WHEAT 10 (medium production value)
- Doesn't affect RED's production
- Would block one of my own WHEAT resources at node 1

[2] Move to (0, -1, 1) - DESERT hex
- No production to block
- No strategic value

[3] Move to (-1, 0, 1) - BRICK hex - Connected to RED's settlement at node 3
- Blocks: BRICK 3 (low production value)
- RED has a settlement here
- Could limit RED's expansion ability by restricting BRICK

[4] Move to (-1, 1, 0) - WHEAT hex - Connected to RED's city at node 5
- Blocks: WHEAT 8 (high production value)
- RED has a city here (triple production)
- Would also block my own WHEAT at node 15

[5] Move to (0, 1, -1) - WOOD hex - Connected to RED's city at node 20 and node 5
- Blocks: WOOD 6 (high production value)
- RED has a city connected to this hex
- This would limit RED's WOOD production significantly

## Strategic Decision

Looking at victory conditions:
- RED is ahead with 7 VP to my 6 VP
- I need to slow RED down while accelerating my own production
- My main need is ORE for city building

<plan>
1. Move robber to RED's highest-producing hex with a city to slow them down
2. Try to steal ORE from RED if possible to speed up my city upgrade
3. Roll dice next turn to get more resources
4. Upgrade to my third city (need 2 more ORE, 3 WHEAT) for 8 VP total
5. Use development cards to reach 10 VP (need 1 more VP card)
</plan>

Option [5] is optimal because:
- WOOD 6 is one of RED's highest-producing resources (connected to 2 settlements, one being a city)
- Placing the robber here would significantly slow RED's expansion capabilities
- By stealing from RED, I might get a valuable resource (possibly ORE)
- This doesn't block any of my own production

Option [4] would also be strong, but it would block my own WHEAT production at node 15.

Therefore, I choose option [5].

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist whose primary goal is to defeat the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (HIGHEST PRIORITY):
- Target 6 & 8 numbered hexes at all costs - these are the most productive numbers
- Prioritize ore and wheat hexes for your settlements - they enable cities and development cards
- Position yourself on at least one good brick and wood hex to enable early expansion
- Aim to cover ALL five resources with your two settlements combined
- Try to place on intersections with 3 productive hexes rather than 2
- Evaluate probability dots (not just numbers) - more dots mean more frequent production
- Place settlements with clear expansion paths that won't be easily blocked
- Avoid placing where you'll be immediately cut off by the opponent
- Position roads toward your next planned settlement location
- Consider distance to valuable ports (especially 2:1 ports matching your abundant resources)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-8):
- Build at least one new road and one new settlement ASAP
- Focus on securing access to any missing resources through expansion
- Establish access to a port if you're lacking a key resource
- Prevent the opponent from cutting off your expansion path
- Only purchase development cards if excess resources available or for immediate victory
- Expand toward high-value hexes the opponent doesn't yet control

MID-GAME RESOURCE MANAGEMENT (TURNS 9-20):
- Target 3 cities minimum (worth 6 VP) - upgrade most productive settlements first
- Maintain 1 road per every 2 settlements for flexible expansion
- Always build a settlement when you have the resources (more production points)
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each build (cities give best long-term return)
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1 or better) to maintain resource balance
- Keep at least one viable road-building path open at all times
- If blocked from expansion, shift to city upgrades and development cards

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Development cards should supplement your expansion, not replace it
- Prioritize using Knight cards to protect your best hexes from the robber
- Save Knights when you're ahead to counter the opponent's robber placements
- Only buy development cards when you:
  1. Have excess sheep/wheat/ore but lack wood/brick for expansion
  2. Are close to securing largest army
  3. Need a specific card type (Road Building to break through a blockade)
- Use Road Building cards to save brick/wood and create surprise expansion paths
- Time Monopoly cards to capture opponent's stockpile after high-producing rolls
- Use Year of Plenty to complete crucial builds when short on specific resources

ROBBER PLACEMENT:
- Always target the opponent's highest-producing hex (high number + settlement/city)
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat hexes to slow city development
- If opponent relies heavily on one resource, target that resource's hexes
- Never place the robber on your own high-production hexes
- When stealing, target resources you immediately need for your next build

VICTORY PATH PLANNING:
- Target resource independence with at least one settlement/city on each resource
- Minimum viable infrastructure: 3-4 settlements total, with 2-3 upgraded to cities
- Calculate multiple paths to 10 VP and pursue the fastest:
  Path 1: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP)
  Path 2: 4 cities (8 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP)
  Path 3: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 victory point card
- Always track your direct path to 10 VP and focus on those builds
- Prioritize visible points (settlements/cities) over speculative development cards
- Switch paths if the opponent blocks your primary victory path
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Accept trades only when they enable an immediate, crucial build
- Never make trades that allow opponent to build a settlement or city immediately
- Trade away excess resources when at risk for robber (7+ cards)
- Calculate the production value of each settlement location before deciding to build
- When trading with ports, plan sequences that convert unwanted resources into needed ones

# Game State Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state to make the optimal decision:

## Victory Point Status
- RED: 7/10 VP (2 cities + 1 settlement + longest road bonus)
- BLUE (me): 6/10 VP (2 cities + largest army bonus)

## My Resources
- 1 WOOD, 3 SHEEP, 3 WHEAT, 1 ORE
- No development cards in hand

## Available Actions
- [0] End turn
- [1] Buy a development card (1 SHEEP, 1 WHEAT, 1 ORE)

## Victory Path Analysis
I currently have 6 VP:
- 2 cities (4 VP)
- Largest army bonus (2 VP)

To get to 10 VP, I need 4 more points, which could come from:
- Building 2 more cities (+4 VP)
- Building settlements and getting victory point cards
- Taking the longest road from RED (+2 VP shift)

## Resource Evaluation
With my current resources, I can't build a city (need 3 ORE + 2 WHEAT) or a settlement (need WOOD + BRICK + WHEAT + SHEEP). The only thing I can afford is a development card.

## Development Card Value
Buying a development card could give me:
- Victory Point card (25% chance): Immediately get closer to winning
- Knight card (~50% chance): Strengthen my largest army lead
- Year of Plenty/Monopoly/Road Building: Utility for future turns

<plan>
1. Buy a development card now - it's the only productive use of my resources
2. Hope for a Victory Point card (would put me at 7 VP) or a utility card
3. Next turn, move the robber from RED's wood hex to their wheat hex at node 5
4. Focus on getting resources for my third city (need more ORE and WHEAT)
5. Continue building toward 10 VP through city upgrades and development cards
</plan>

Since I can't build anything else with my current resources, and I need to keep making progress toward 10 VP, buying a development card is clearly the optimal move. The card could directly give me a victory point or provide utility to help in future turns.

# Game Analysis for Turn 69

I'll analyze my current situation and available actions to determine the optimal move:

## Current Game State Overview:
- I (BLUE) have 6 VP: 2 cities (4 VP) + Largest Army (2 VP) + 1 hidden Victory Point card
- RED has 7 VP: 2 cities (4 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + Longest Road (2 VP)
- Resources: 1 Wood, 4 Sheep, 2 Wheat, 0 Brick, 0 Ore
- The robber is on RED's wood hex (0,1,-1), limiting their wood production

## Available Actions:
0. End turn (no build)
1-4. Maritime trades (4:1) using Sheep to get other resources

## Analysis of Options:

**Option 0: End Turn**
- I keep my current resources for next turn
- I make no progress this turn
- Risk: If I roll a 7, I'll lose resources (7 cards total)

**Option 1: Trade 4 Sheep for 1 Wood**
- Would give me 2 Wood total, not enough for anything useful
- Not an efficient trade

**Option 2: Trade 4 Sheep for 1 Ore**
- Would give me 1 Ore, which isn't enough for a city upgrade (need 3) or development card (need 1 Ore + 1 Sheep + 1 Wheat)
- Not an efficient trade

**Option 3: Trade 4 Sheep for 1 Wheat**
- Would give me 3 Wheat total, not enough for anything useful by itself
- Not an efficient trade

**Option 4: Trade 4 Sheep for 1 Brick**
- Would give me 1 Brick, not enough for any useful build
- Not an efficient trade

## Strategic Considerations:
1. I have 7 cards total, which puts me at risk if a 7 is rolled next turn
2. I cannot make any productive builds or purchases with my current resources or maritime trades
3. RED is winning at 7 VP vs my 6 VP (counting my hidden VP card)
4. I need to either reduce my hand size or make progress toward another VP

## Decision Logic:
- Since I can't build anything useful this turn
- And all maritime trades are inefficient (4:1 rate)
- And I'm at risk for resource loss with 7 cards
- The best move is to end my turn and hope for better resource rolls next turn

<plan>
1. End my turn to avoid inefficient trades
2. Next turn, focus on getting Ore and Wheat for my third city upgrade
3. Move the robber from RED's wood hex to their wheat hex to limit their city potential
4. Continue building toward 10 VP through city upgrades and development cards
5. Consider using maritime trades next turn if I get more sheep and need a specific resource
</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist whose primary goal is to defeat the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (HIGHEST PRIORITY):
- Target 6 & 8 numbered hexes at all costs - these are the most productive numbers
- Prioritize ore and wheat hexes for your settlements - they enable cities and development cards
- Position yourself on at least one good brick and wood hex to enable early expansion
- Aim to cover ALL five resources with your two settlements combined
- Try to place on intersections with 3 productive hexes rather than 2
- Evaluate probability dots (not just numbers) - more dots mean more frequent production
- Place settlements with clear expansion paths that won't be easily blocked
- Avoid placing where you'll be immediately cut off by the opponent
- Position roads toward your next planned settlement location
- Consider distance to valuable ports (especially 2:1 ports matching your abundant resources)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-8):
- Build at least one new road and one new settlement ASAP
- Focus on securing access to any missing resources through expansion
- Establish access to a port if you're lacking a key resource
- Prevent the opponent from cutting off your expansion path
- Only purchase development cards if excess resources available or for immediate victory
- Expand toward high-value hexes the opponent doesn't yet control

MID-GAME RESOURCE MANAGEMENT (TURNS 9-20):
- Target 3 cities minimum (worth 6 VP) - upgrade most productive settlements first
- Maintain 1 road per every 2 settlements for flexible expansion
- Always build a settlement when you have the resources (more production points)
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each build (cities give best long-term return)
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1 or better) to maintain resource balance
- Keep at least one viable road-building path open at all times
- If blocked from expansion, shift to city upgrades and development cards

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Development cards should supplement your expansion, not replace it
- Prioritize using Knight cards to protect your best hexes from the robber
- Save Knights when you're ahead to counter the opponent's robber placements
- Only buy development cards when you:
  1. Have excess sheep/wheat/ore but lack wood/brick for expansion
  2. Are close to securing largest army
  3. Need a specific card type (Road Building to break through a blockade)
- Use Road Building cards to save brick/wood and create surprise expansion paths
- Time Monopoly cards to capture opponent's stockpile after high-producing rolls
- Use Year of Plenty to complete crucial builds when short on specific resources

ROBBER PLACEMENT:
- Always target the opponent's highest-producing hex (high number + settlement/city)
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat hexes to slow city development
- If opponent relies heavily on one resource, target that resource's hexes
- Never place the robber on your own high-production hexes
- When stealing, target resources you immediately need for your next build

VICTORY PATH PLANNING:
- Target resource independence with at least one settlement/city on each resource
- Minimum viable infrastructure: 3-4 settlements total, with 2-3 upgraded to cities
- Calculate multiple paths to 10 VP and pursue the fastest:
  Path 1: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP)
  Path 2: 4 cities (8 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP)
  Path 3: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 victory point card
- Always track your direct path to 10 VP and focus on those builds
- Prioritize visible points (settlements/cities) over speculative development cards
- Switch paths if the opponent blocks your primary victory path
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Accept trades only when they enable an immediate, crucial build
- Never make trades that allow opponent to build a settlement or city immediately
- Trade away excess resources when at risk for robber (7+ cards)
- Calculate the production value of each settlement location before deciding to build
- When trading with ports, plan sequences that convert unwanted resources into needed ones

DETAILED DECISION FRAMEWORK:
1. Does this move bring me closer to 10 victory points?
2. Does this move increase my production capacity more than alternative builds?
3. Does this move protect me from being blocked or cut off?
4. Does this move position me for strongest expansion in next 2-3 turns?
5. Is this the most efficient use of my current resources?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 71 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. End my turn to avoid inefficient trades
2. Next turn, focus on getting Ore and Wheat for my third city upgrade
3. Move the robber from RED's wood hex to their wheat hex to limit their city potential
4. Continue building toward 10 VP through city upgrades and development cards
5. Consider using maritime trades next turn if I get more sheep and need a specific resource

# Game Analysis for Turn 71

Let me analyze my current situation and available options:

**Current Victory Points (6/10):**
- 2 Cities (4 VP)
- Largest Army (2 VP)
- 1 Victory Point card (hidden)

**Resources:**
- 1 Wood
- 6 Sheep
- 2 Wheat
- 0 Brick
- 0 Ore

**Options Analysis:**
1. End my turn
2. Trade 4 Sheep for 1 Wood
3. Trade 4 Sheep for 1 Ore
4. Trade 4 Sheep for 1 Wheat
5. Trade 4 Sheep for 1 Brick

## Strategic Assessment

To win, I need 4 more victory points. Potential paths:
- Convert my remaining Victory Point card (1 VP)
- Build settlements (1 VP each)
- Upgrade to a city (2 VP)
- Take longest road from RED (2 VP swing)

For city upgrades, I need 3 ore + 2 wheat per city. I currently have 2 wheat but no ore.
For new settlements, I need 1 wood + 1 brick + 1 wheat + 1 sheep per settlement.

I have an excess of sheep (6) which could be traded, but the 4:1 port rate is inefficient. However, I should consider whether any trade would enable a productive build this turn.

## Decision Logic

With my current resources, I cannot build any settlement (missing brick) or city (missing ore). Trading 4 sheep would only get me 1 resource, which still leaves me short of any meaningful build this turn.

Looking at my options:
- **Option 0 (End Turn)**: Preserves my resources for next turn when I might draw better resources.
- **Option 2 (Get Ore)**: Gets me 1 step closer to a city upgrade, but I'd still need 2 more ore.
- **Option 3 (Get Wheat)**: Would give me 3 wheat total, but I still lack ore for a city.
- **Options 1 & 4 (Wood/Brick)**: Not immediately useful as I'm still missing components for a settlement.

<plan>
1. End my turn to avoid inefficient trades
2. Next turn, focus on getting Ore for a city upgrade (I already have 2 wheat)
3. Consider development cards if I get ore but not enough for a city
4. Watch RED's expansion and be ready to contest longest road if opportunity arises
5. Move the robber from RED's wood hex to their wheat hex if I roll a 7 next turn
</plan>

Since I can't make any productive build this turn even with trading, the most efficient move is to end my turn and hope for better resource draws next turn. Trading 4 sheep for 1 resource would be inefficient when that single resource doesn't enable any build.

# Game Analysis for Settlers of Catan - Turn 73

I'll assess the current game state and available actions to determine the optimal move.

## Current Game State
- **Victory Points**: BLUE (me) has 6/10 VP, RED has 7/10 VP
- **My Resources**: 1 wood, 8 sheep, 2 wheat, 2 ore
- **My Development Cards**: 1 victory point card (hidden)
- **Buildings**: 2 cities (4 VP), largest army (2 VP), hidden VP card (1 VP)
- **RED's Buildings**: 2 cities, 1 settlement, longest road (7 VP total)

## Victory Point Analysis
I actually have 7 VP total when counting my hidden victory point card, so I'm only trailing by 0 points. I need 3 more points to win.

## Resource Assessment
- I have 8 sheep, which is excessive and puts me at risk for the robber
- I need 3 ore + 2 wheat for a city (I already have 2 wheat, 2 ore)
- I need 1 sheep + 1 wheat + 1 ore for a development card

## Possible Paths to Victory
1. Upgrade a settlement to city (+1 VP) + build a settlement (+1 VP) + maintain largest army (+2 VP) = 10 VP
2. Buy development cards hoping for victory point cards

## Action Analysis
- [0] End Turn: Would waste my opportunity to use excess sheep
- [1] Buy Development Card: Uses 1 sheep, 1 wheat, 1 ore - leaving me with 7 sheep, 1 wheat, 1 ore
- [2-5] Maritime Trade: Trade 4 sheep for another resource

Since I have 8 sheep and need only 1 for a development card, a trade could be beneficial. However, I should first consider if buying a development card is worthwhile.

## Development Card Analysis
- Could get a Victory Point card (immediate +1 VP)
- Could get a Knight to strengthen my Largest Army position
- Could get a Road Building to expand
- Could get Year of Plenty or Monopoly for resource advantage

Given my excess sheep and the fact that I'm only 3 VP away from winning, buying a development card is strategically sound. It gives me a chance at a VP card while maintaining largest army security.

## Decision
I should buy a development card to:
1. Use my excess sheep effectively
2. Maintain my largest army advantage
3. Possibly get a victory point card to move closer to winning
4. Reduce my hand size to minimize robber risk

<plan>
1. Buy a development card now using my excess sheep
2. Continue working toward a city upgrade by acquiring more ore
3. Look for settlement opportunities to expand my resource production
4. Maintain largest army advantage
5. Consider moving the robber to RED's wheat hex if I roll a 7

- Position roads toward your next planned settlement location
- Consider distance to valuable ports (especially 2:1 ports matching your abundant resources)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-8):
- Build at least one new road and one new settlement ASAP
- Focus on securing access to any missing resources through expansion
- Establish access to a port if you're lacking a key resource
- Prevent the opponent from cutting off your expansion path
- Only purchase development cards if excess resources available or for immediate victory
- Expand toward high-value hexes the opponent doesn't yet control

MID-GAME RESOURCE MANAGEMENT (TURNS 9-20):
- Target 3 cities minimum (worth 6 VP) - upgrade most productive settlements first
- Maintain 1 road per every 2 settlements for flexible expansion
- Always build a settlement when you have the resources (more production points)
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each build (cities give best long-term return)
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1 or better) to maintain resource balance
- Keep at least one viable road-building path open at all times
- If blocked from expansion, shift to city upgrades and development cards

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Development cards should supplement your expansion, not replace it
- Prioritize using Knight cards to protect your best hexes from the robber
- Save Knights when you're ahead to counter the opponent's robber placements
- Only buy development cards when you:
  1. Have excess sheep/wheat/ore but lack wood/brick for expansion
  2. Are close to securing largest army
  3. Need a specific card type (Road Building to break through a blockade)
- Use Road Building cards to save brick/wood and create surprise expansion paths
- Time Monopoly cards to capture opponent's stockpile after high-producing rolls
- Use Year of Plenty to complete crucial builds when short on specific resources

ROBBER PLACEMENT:
- Always target the opponent's highest-producing hex (high number + settlement/city)
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat hexes to slow city development
- If opponent relies heavily on one resource, target that resource's hexes
- Never place the robber on your own high-production hexes
- When stealing, target resources you immediately need for your next build

VICTORY PATH PLANNING:
- Target resource independence with at least one settlement/city on each resource
- Minimum viable infrastructure: 3-4 settlements total, with 2-3 upgraded to cities
- Calculate multiple paths to 10 VP and pursue the fastest:
  Path 1: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP)
  Path 2: 4 cities (8 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP)
  Path 3: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 victory point card
- Always track your direct path to 10 VP and focus on those builds
- Prioritize visible points (settlements/cities) over speculative development cards
- Switch paths if the opponent blocks your primary victory path
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Accept trades only when they enable an immediate, crucial build
- Never make trades that allow opponent to build a settlement or city immediately
- Trade away excess resources when at risk for robber (7+ cards)
- Calculate the production value of each settlement location before deciding to build
- When trading with ports, plan sequences that convert unwanted resources into needed ones

DETAILED DECISION FRAMEWORK:
1. Does this move bring me closer to 10 victory points?
2. Does this move increase my production capacity more than alternative builds?
3. Does this move protect me from being blocked or cut off?
4. Does this move position me for strongest expansion in next 2-3 turns?
5. Is this the most efficient use of my current resources?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 73 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Buy a development card now using my excess sheep
2. Continue working toward a city upgrade by acquiring more ore
3. Look for settlement opportunities to expand my resource production
4. Maintain largest army advantage
5. Consider moving the robber to RED's wheat hex if I roll a 7

# Game Analysis for Turn 73

Let me analyze the current game state and my options carefully:

## Victory Point Status
- I (BLUE) have 6 VP: 2 cities (4 VP) + Largest Army (2 VP)
- RED has 7 VP: 2 cities (4 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + Longest Road (2 VP)
- RED is ahead by 1 VP, so I need to catch up

## Resource Status
- I have: 1 wood, 7 sheep, 1 wheat, 1 ore
- I also have 1 knight card and 1 VP card in hand
- The VP card is already worth 1 VP (but hidden from RED)

## Production
- My cities are on good hexes (8 wheat, 3 brick, 4 sheep, 10 wheat, 5 ore)
- The robber is on a 6 wood hex, not affecting my production

## Available Actions
1. End turn
2. Buy development card (1 sheep, 1 wheat, 1 ore)
3-5. Maritime trades with sheep

## Decision Analysis

Looking at my current resources, I can afford to buy a development card, which could be:
- Knight (most common) - would strengthen my largest army advantage
- VP card - would put me at 8 VP (counting my hidden VP)
- Road Building - helpful for expansion
- Year of Plenty - helpful for getting specific resources
- Monopoly - potentially powerful depending on what RED has

Let me consider my path to 10 VP:
- Current: 6 VP (visible) + 1 VP (hidden) = 7 VP
- Need 3 more VP which could come from:
  - Another city (+2 VP): Need 3 ore, 2 wheat
  - Two settlements (+2 VP): Need 2 wood, 2 brick, 2 wheat, 2 sheep
  - More VP cards (+1-2 VP): Need sheep, wheat, ore
  
With 7 sheep, I'm at risk of losing half my hand if someone rolls a 7. Using some sheep now is wise. Given my resource balance and the fact that I'll need some combination of VP cards or buildings to win, buying a development card makes the most sense.

<plan>
1. Buy a development card this turn using excess sheep
2. Continue working toward city/settlement by collecting more ore/brick
3. Play knight cards to protect key resources and maintain largest army
4. Aim for 10 VP through: hidden VP card (1) + existing VPs (7) + either 1 more VP card + 1 city, or 2 settlements
</plan>

The development card could provide an immediate VP or help get resources I need for my next build. RED is ahead by 1 visible VP, so I need to keep pace.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist whose primary goal is to defeat the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (HIGHEST PRIORITY):
- Target 6 & 8 numbered hexes at all costs - these are the most productive numbers
- Prioritize ore and wheat hexes for your settlements - they enable cities and development cards
- Position yourself on at least one good brick and wood hex to enable early expansion
- Aim to cover ALL five resources with your two settlements combined
- Try to place on intersections with 3 productive hexes rather than 2
- Evaluate probability dots (not just numbers) - more dots mean more frequent production
- Place settlements with clear expansion paths that won't be easily blocked
- Avoid placing where you'll be immediately cut off by the opponent
- Position roads toward your next planned settlement location
- Consider distance to valuable ports (especially 2:1 ports matching your abundant resources)

# Analyzing the Current Game State

Let me carefully analyze my position in this game of Settlers of Catan:

## Current Victory Points (6/10)
- 2 Cities (4 VP)
- Largest Army (2 VP)
- 1 Hidden Victory Point card (not counted in my visible 6 VP)

## Resources and Cards
- 1 Wood, 6 Sheep
- Development Cards: 1 Knight, 1 Road Building, 1 Victory Point

## Considering Available Actions
My options are limited this turn:
1. End Turn (Action 0)
2. Trade 4 Sheep for 1 Wood (Action 1)
3. Trade 4 Sheep for 1 Ore (Action 2) 
4. Trade 4 Sheep for 1 Wheat (Action 3)
5. Trade 4 Sheep for 1 Brick (Action 4)

## Strategic Analysis

Red is at 7 VP (with longest road) and holds 7 cards. They're one city or 3 VP away from winning, which is concerning.

Looking at my path to victory:
- I currently have 7 VP including my hidden VP card
- I need 3 more VP, which could come from: 1 City (2 VP) + 1 Settlement (1 VP) or 3 Settlements

The robber is on the wood hex, which limits production but I'm not planning to rely heavily on wood.

My excess sheep could be used for development cards or traded for resources I need. Let's evaluate each option:

### Option 1: Buy a Development Card
With my 6 sheep, I can't afford it (needs ore and wheat too).

### Option 2: Trade for Resources
- Trading 4 sheep for wood: Not immediately useful unless I get more brick for roads
- Trading 4 sheep for ore: Could help toward city building
- Trading 4 sheep for wheat: Could help toward city building or development cards
- Trading 4 sheep for brick: Could help toward settlement expansion

## Decision Making

I need to get closer to 10 VP. I already have 7 VP (6 visible + 1 hidden). The fastest path is probably:
1. Get ore and wheat to build a city (+2 VP)
2. Get wood, brick, sheep, wheat to build a settlement (+1 VP)

With my current resources, I can trade for one resource. Ore is most critical for city building, which gives the best VP return (2 VP for 3 ore, 2 wheat). Getting the ore now positions me to build a city once I collect wheat.

<plan>
1. Trade sheep for ore this turn to prepare for city building
2. Collect wheat in future turns
3. Build a city as soon as possible (+2 VP)
4. Use Road Building card to expand to a new settlement location (+1 VP)
5. Aim for 10 VP through: cities (6 VP) + hidden VP card (1) + largest army (2) + settlement (1)
</plan>

Therefore, I should trade 4 sheep for 1 ore (Action 2).

Based on this information, which action number do you choose? Think step by step about your options, then put the final action number in a box like \boxed{1}.
RESPONSE:
I'll analyze the current game state and available actions to determine the optimal move.

## Game State Analysis
- I have 6/10 VP (2 Cities = 4 VP, Largest Army = 2 VP)
- I hold 1 hidden VP card (worth +1 VP)
- Resources: 1 Wood, 2 Sheep, 1 Ore
- Development cards: 1 Knight, 1 Road Building, 1 Victory Point
- Red has 7 VP and Longest Road bonus
- The robber is currently on the Wood hex (0,1,-1), blocking a productive 6 value

## Action Options
0. Play Knight - This would let me move the robber and steal a resource from Red
1. Play Road Building - Let me build two free roads
2. Roll the dice - Standard turn action, produce resources based on roll

## Strategic Considerations

Looking at my current resources (1 Wood, 2 Sheep, 1 Ore), I don't have enough to build anything meaningful after rolling. I need:
- City upgrade: 3 Ore + 2 Wheat (missing both)
- Settlement: 1 Wood + 1 Brick + 1 Sheep + 1 Wheat (missing brick and wheat)
- Road: 1 Wood + 1 Brick (missing brick)

My plan indicates I need ore for a city upgrade, but I only have 1 ore currently. Playing the Knight would allow me to:
1. Move the robber from the wood hex (unblocking a resource I could use)
2. Potentially steal a needed resource from Red (who has 7 cards)
3. Strengthen my Largest Army advantage (though I'm already ahead at 7 vs 0)

The Road Building card would let me build two roads for free, but this doesn't immediately advance my position since I don't have resources to follow up with a settlement.

<plan>
1. Play Knight to move robber from wood hex and attempt to steal ore/wheat from Red
2. Roll dice on next turn hoping for ore/wheat production
3. Build city as soon as possible (+2 VP)
4. Use Road Building card to expand toward a new settlement location (+1 VP)
5. Win with 10 VP: cities (6 VP) + hidden VP card (1) + largest army (2) + settlement (1)
</plan>

Given my resource constraints and the need to unblock resources and potentially steal something useful, playing the Knight card appears to be the optimal move.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist whose primary goal is to defeat the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (HIGHEST PRIORITY):
- Target 6 & 8 numbered hexes at all costs - these are the most productive numbers
- Prioritize ore and wheat hexes for your settlements - they enable cities and development cards
- Position yourself on at least one good brick and wood hex to enable early expansion
- Aim to cover ALL five resources with your two settlements combined
- Try to place on intersections with 3 productive hexes rather than 2
- Evaluate probability dots (not just numbers) - more dots mean more frequent production
- Place settlements with clear expansion paths that won't be easily blocked
- Avoid placing where you'll be immediately cut off by the opponent
- Position roads toward your next planned settlement location
- Consider distance to valuable ports (especially 2:1 ports matching your abundant resources)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-8):
- Build at least one new road and one new settlement ASAP
- Focus on securing access to any missing resources through expansion
- Establish access to a port if you're lacking a key resource
- Prevent the opponent from cutting off your expansion path
- Only purchase development cards if excess resources available or for immediate victory
- Expand toward high-value hexes the opponent doesn't yet control

MID-GAME RESOURCE MANAGEMENT (TURNS 9-20):
- Target 3 cities minimum (worth 6 VP) - upgrade most productive settlements first
- Maintain 1 road per every 2 settlements for flexible expansion
- Always build a settlement when you have the resources (more production points)
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each build (cities give best long-term return)
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1 or better) to maintain resource balance
- Keep at least one viable road-building path open at all times
- If blocked from expansion, shift to city upgrades and development cards

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Development cards should supplement your expansion, not replace it
- Prioritize using Knight cards to protect your best hexes from the robber
- Save Knights when you're ahead to counter the opponent's robber placements
- Only buy development cards when you:
  1. Have excess sheep/wheat/ore but lack wood/brick for expansion
  2. Are close to securing largest army
  3. Need a specific card type (Road Building to break through a blockade)
- Use Road Building cards to save brick/wood and create surprise expansion paths
- Time Monopoly cards to capture opponent's stockpile after high-producing rolls
- Use Year of Plenty to complete crucial builds when short on specific resources

ROBBER PLACEMENT:
- Always target the opponent's highest-producing hex (high number + settlement/city)
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat hexes to slow city development
- If opponent relies heavily on one resource, target that resource's hexes
- Never place the robber on your own high-production hexes
- When stealing, target resources you immediately need for your next build

VICTORY PATH PLANNING:
- Target resource independence with at least one settlement/city on each resource
- Minimum viable infrastructure: 3-4 settlements total, with 2-3 upgraded to cities
- Calculate multiple paths to 10 VP and pursue the fastest:
  Path 1: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP)
  Path 2: 4 cities (8 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP)
  Path 3: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 victory point card
- Always track your direct path to 10 VP and focus on those builds
- Prioritize visible points (settlements/cities) over speculative development cards
- Switch paths if the opponent blocks your primary victory path
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Accept trades only when they enable an immediate, crucial build
- Never make trades that allow opponent to build a settlement or city immediately
- Trade away excess resources when at risk for robber (7+ cards)
- Calculate the production value of each settlement location before deciding to build
- When trading with ports, plan sequences that convert unwanted resources into needed ones

DETAILED DECISION FRAMEWORK:
1. Does this move bring me closer to 10 victory points?
2. Does this move increase my production capacity more than alternative builds?
3. Does this move protect me from being blocked or cut off?
4. Does this move position me for strongest expansion in next 2-3 turns?
5. Is this the most efficient use of my current resources?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Analysis of Robber Placement Options

I need to move the robber and potentially steal a resource from the RED player. Let me evaluate each option strategically:

## Option 0: Move to (0, 0, 0) [Sheep-4]
- This is a sheep hex with value 4 (medium production)
- RED has a settlement here that produces sheep
- I also have a city that produces sheep here
- Blocking this would hurt both of us

## Option 1: Move to (1, -1, 0) [Wheat-10]
- This is a wheat hex with value 10 (low production)
- No stealing opportunity mentioned
- I have a city here that produces wheat
- This would block my own wheat production

## Option 2: Move to (0, -1, 1) [Desert]
- This is a desert tile which produces nothing
- Not strategic at all - wastes the robber placement

## Option 3: Move to (-1, 0, 1) [Brick-3]
- This is a brick hex with value 3 (low production)
- RED has a settlement here that produces brick
- I have a city that produces brick
- Would block both RED and my own brick production

## Option 4: Move to (-1, 1, 0) [Wheat-8]
- This is a wheat hex with value 8 (high production)
- RED has a city here that produces wheat (3 dots)
- I have a city here that produces wheat (3 dots)
- Would block a very productive hex for both of us

## Option 5: Move to (1, 0, -1) [Ore-5]
- This is an ore hex with value 5 (medium production)
- RED has a city here that produces ore (2 dots)
- I have a city here that produces ore (2 dots)
- Would block ore for both RED and me

## Strategic Decision:
I need to prioritize blocking RED's most valuable production while minimizing impact on my own. Looking at my resources, I have 1 wood, 2 sheep, and 1 ore. I need more ore and wheat for my planned city upgrade.

Looking at RED's settlements/cities:
- RED's city at node 5 produces sheep-4, wheat-8, and wood-6
- RED's city at node 20 produces wood-6 and ore-5
- RED's settlement at node 3 produces sheep-4 and brick-3

The robber is currently on the wood-6 hex, blocking production for both RED's cities. Moving it from there can be beneficial.

Option 4 (-1, 1, 0) would block RED's high-productivity wheat hex (value 8), which is a key resource for cities. Unfortunately, it would also block my own city's wheat production. However, since RED has 7 cards in hand and may have wheat, this could be the most impactful move.

<plan>
1. Move robber to wheat-8 hex to block RED's high-production hex and steal a potential ore/wheat
2. Roll dice on next turn hoping for ore/wheat production from remaining hexes
3. Build city as soon as I have enough resources (+2 VP)
4. Use Road Building card to expand toward a new settlement location (+1 VP)
5. Win with 10 VP: cities (6 VP) + hidden VP card (1) + largest army (2) + settlement (1)
</plan>

Based on my analysis, I'll choose option 4 to move the robber to (-1, 1, 0), the wheat-8 hex, which will block RED's high-productivity city and allow me to steal a resource from RED.

# Game Analysis: Settlers of Catan - Turn 77

I need to decide between playing my Road Building development card or rolling the dice. Let me analyze the current game state and strategic options.

## Current Game State
- I have 6/10 victory points (2 cities = 4 VP, Largest Army = 2 VP)
- I also have 1 hidden VP card, so effectively I'm at 7/10 VP
- Resources: 1 wood, 2 sheep, 2 ore
- Development cards: 1 Road Building, 1 Victory Point
- Robber is on wheat-8 hex (currently blocking one of our production sources)
- RED has 7 VP (2 cities = 4 VP, 1 settlement = 1 VP, Longest Road = 2 VP)

## Action Analysis

### Option 0: Play Road Building card
- Pros:
  * Could expand toward a potential settlement location
  * Use the card while I have it (never waste development cards)
  * Sets up for future expansion without needing brick/wood
- Cons:
  * No immediate VP gain
  * I can't actually build a settlement now (need brick, wood, sheep, wheat)
  * I'm not in immediate danger of being blocked in critical areas

### Option 1: Roll the dice
- Pros:
  * Could produce needed resources for city upgrade (need 3 ore + 2 wheat)
  * I currently have 2 ore, so I'm closer to a city than a settlement
  * Road Building card can be saved for a more strategic moment
- Cons:
  * Dice roll is uncertain
  * If I roll a 7, I'll need to move the robber (currently on opponent's wheat-8)
  * No guaranteed progress

## Victory Path Analysis
To reach 10 VP, I need 3 more points:
1. I already have a hidden VP card (+1)
2. Upgrading to another city would give me +1 VP (needs 3 ore, 2 wheat)
3. Building a new settlement would give +1 VP (needs 1 brick, 1 wood, 1 sheep, 1 wheat)

<plan>
1. Roll dice now to gather more resources
2. Build a city as soon as possible (+1 VP)
3. Use Road Building card strategically to position for a settlement location
4. Build settlement (+1 VP) 
5. Win with 10 VP: 3 cities (6 VP) + hidden VP card (1) + largest army (2) + settlement (1)
</plan>

## Decision
Rolling the dice is the better option since:
- I'm closer to building a city than a settlement
- The Road Building card doesn't provide immediate progress toward victory
- I need resources before expansion can be meaningful
- Saving the Road Building card for when I have resources for a settlement is more strategic

Therefore, I'll choose to roll the dice.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist whose primary goal is to defeat the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (HIGHEST PRIORITY):
- Target 6 & 8 numbered hexes at all costs - these are the most productive numbers
- Prioritize ore and wheat hexes for your settlements - they enable cities and development cards
- Position yourself on at least one good brick and wood hex to enable early expansion
- Aim to cover ALL five resources with your two settlements combined
- Try to place on intersections with 3 productive hexes rather than 2
- Evaluate probability dots (not just numbers) - more dots mean more frequent production
- Place settlements with clear expansion paths that won't be easily blocked
- Avoid placing where you'll be immediately cut off by the opponent
- Position roads toward your next planned settlement location
- Consider distance to valuable ports (especially 2:1 ports matching your abundant resources)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-8):
- Build at least one new road and one new settlement ASAP
- Focus on securing access to any missing resources through expansion
- Establish access to a port if you're lacking a key resource
- Prevent the opponent from cutting off your expansion path
- Only purchase development cards if excess resources available or for immediate victory
- Expand toward high-value hexes the opponent doesn't yet control

MID-GAME RESOURCE MANAGEMENT (TURNS 9-20):
- Target 3 cities minimum (worth 6 VP) - upgrade most productive settlements first
- Maintain 1 road per every 2 settlements for flexible expansion
- Always build a settlement when you have the resources (more production points)
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each build (cities give best long-term return)
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1 or better) to maintain resource balance
- Keep at least one viable road-building path open at all times
- If blocked from expansion, shift to city upgrades and development cards

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Development cards should supplement your expansion, not replace it
- Prioritize using Knight cards to protect your best hexes from the robber
- Save Knights when you're ahead to counter the opponent's robber placements
- Only buy development cards when you:
  1. Have excess sheep/wheat/ore but lack wood/brick for expansion
  2. Are close to securing largest army
  3. Need a specific card type (Road Building to break through a blockade)
- Use Road Building cards to save brick/wood and create surprise expansion paths
- Time Monopoly cards to capture opponent's stockpile after high-producing rolls
- Use Year of Plenty to complete crucial builds when short on specific resources

ROBBER PLACEMENT:
- Always target the opponent's highest-producing hex (high number + settlement/city)
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat hexes to slow city development
- If opponent relies heavily on one resource, target that resource's hexes
- Never place the robber on your own high-production hexes
- When stealing, target resources you immediately need for your next build

VICTORY PATH PLANNING:
- Target resource independence with at least one settlement/city on each resource
- Minimum viable infrastructure: 3-4 settlements total, with 2-3 upgraded to cities
- Calculate multiple paths to 10 VP and pursue the fastest:
  Path 1: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP)
  Path 2: 4 cities (8 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP)
  Path 3: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 victory point card
- Always track your direct path to 10 VP and focus on those builds
- Prioritize visible points (settlements/cities) over speculative development cards
- Switch paths if the opponent blocks your primary victory path
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Accept trades only when they enable an immediate, crucial build
- Never make trades that allow opponent to build a settlement or city immediately
- Trade away excess resources when at risk for robber (7+ cards)
- Calculate the production value of each settlement location before deciding to build
- When trading with ports, plan sequences that convert unwanted resources into needed ones

DETAILED DECISION FRAMEWORK:
1. Does this move bring me closer to 10 victory points?
2. Does this move increase my production capacity more than alternative builds?
3. Does this move protect me from being blocked or cut off?
4. Does this move position me for strongest expansion in next 2-3 turns?
5. Is this the most efficient use of my current resources?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

❓ Select action by number (0-5):


Based on this information, which action number do you choose? Think step by step about your options, then put the final action number in a box like \boxed{1}.
RESPONSE:
I'll analyze the current game state and determine the optimal action to maximize my chances of winning.

## Current Game State Analysis
- I have 6/10 VP (2 cities = 4 VP, largest army = 2 VP, hidden VP card = 1 VP but not counted yet)
- Resources: 1 wood, 2 sheep, 4 ore
- Development cards: 1 road building, 1 victory point
- My opponent has 7/10 VP (2 cities = 4 VP, 1 settlement = 1 VP, longest road = 2 VP)
- I need 4 more VP to win

## Victory Path Analysis
To reach 10 VP, I need 4 more points:
- Option 1: Build 2 more cities (4 VP) = 10 VP total
- Option 2: Build 1 city (2 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) = 10 VP total
- Option 3: Play VP card (1 VP) + build 1 city (2 VP) + build 1 settlement (1 VP) = 10 VP total

## Current Resources & Needs Assessment
- For a city: Need 3 ore + 2 wheat (I have 4 ore but no wheat)
- For a settlement: Need 1 wood + 1 brick + 1 sheep + 1 wheat (I have 1 wood, 2 sheep, but no brick or wheat)
- For a road: Need 1 wood + 1 brick (I have 1 wood but no brick)

## Available Actions Evaluation
[0] Play Road Building - This would allow me to build 2 roads for free, potentially positioning myself for future settlements
[1] End turn - Do nothing and wait for next turn
[2-5] Trade options - Trade my ore for other resources

Since I can't build any cities or settlements immediately (lack of wheat and brick), my best move is to use my Road Building card to position myself strategically for future expansion. I have 1 wood already, which could be used for another road after these 2 free roads.

<plan>
1. Play Road Building card now to position for settlement locations
2. On next turn, aim to gather wheat for city upgrade and/or wheat+brick for settlement 
3. Build settlement (+1 VP) and play hidden VP card (+1 VP) when ready
4. Continue toward 10 VP through strategic expansion
</plan>

Action [0] is the optimal choice as it makes progress toward my victory plan without requiring resources I don't have.

# Game Analysis and Decision Making

Let me analyze the current game state and the available actions to determine the optimal road building location.

## Current Game Status
- I have 6/10 VP: 2 cities (4 VP) + Largest Army (2 VP) + Hidden VP card (1 VP - when played)
- Resources: 1 Wood, 2 Sheep, 4 Ore (no brick or wheat)
- Red has 7/10 VP: 2 cities (4 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + Longest Road (2 VP)
- I need 4 more VP to win: Playing my VP card will give me 1, so I need 3 more

## Strategy Assessment
My current plan involves using a Road Building card to position for new settlements. However, I don't currently have a Road Building card available to play (only have a VP card). Given my resources and the board state, I need to:

1. Find the best road placement to enable future settlement building
2. Identify which road placement gives me the best chance at securing valuable future resource production
3. Consider blocking Red's expansion paths where needed

## Road Building Options Analysis:

**Option [0] - Edge (13, 14):**
This edge appears to be on the periphery of the board, likely connecting toward the brick hex. Since I already have brick production at node 15, this offers limited value.

**Option [1] - Edge (0, 20):**
This connects nodes 0 and 20. Node 20 is already occupied by Red's city, but building toward node 0 could position me toward sheep and wood resources.

**Option [2] - Edge (2, 3):**
Node 3 has a Red settlement, and node 2 connects to multiple resources. Building here seems less advantageous.

**Option [3] - Edge (2, 9):**
This road would likely connect toward the wheat hex with a 10 value. Wheat is a resource I need, and this could position me for future settlement building in an area with wheat production.

**Option [4] - Edge (0, 5):**
Node 5 has Red's city (sheep, wheat, wood). Building near here could allow me to compete for expansion routes.

**Option [5] - Edge (1, 6):**
I already have a city at node 1, and this would build toward node 6, which connects to the wheat hex, potentially allowing me to build a settlement with access to wheat.

**Option [6] - Edge (17, 18):**
This edge is likely near the wheat hex with value 8, where the robber currently sits. Building here could position me for future access to this high-value wheat hex once the robber moves.

## Decision Logic:
I need wheat for future city upgrades and settlements. Options [3], [5], and [6] all potentially connect me toward wheat hexes. Given that option [5] builds out from my existing city at node 1 toward node 6 (wheat hex), this appears to be the most strategic choice to improve my resource diversity.

<plan>
1. Build road toward wheat resources to enable settlement building with wheat access
2. Gather resources for a settlement (need brick and wheat)
3. Place settlement for +1 VP, then play VP card for another +1 VP
4. Focus on getting another city or settlement to reach 10 VP
</plan>

Based on my analysis, I'll build a road at edge (1, 6) to position myself toward wheat resources.

  1. Have excess sheep/wheat/ore but lack wood/brick for expansion
  2. Are close to securing largest army
  3. Need a specific card type (Road Building to break through a blockade)
- Use Road Building cards to save brick/wood and create surprise expansion paths
- Time Monopoly cards to capture opponent's stockpile after high-producing rolls
- Use Year of Plenty to complete crucial builds when short on specific resources

ROBBER PLACEMENT:
- Always target the opponent's highest-producing hex (high number + settlement/city)
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat hexes to slow city development
- If opponent relies heavily on one resource, target that resource's hexes
- Never place the robber on your own high-production hexes
- When stealing, target resources you immediately need for your next build

VICTORY PATH PLANNING:
- Target resource independence with at least one settlement/city on each resource
- Minimum viable infrastructure: 3-4 settlements total, with 2-3 upgraded to cities
- Calculate multiple paths to 10 VP and pursue the fastest:
  Path 1: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP)
  Path 2: 4 cities (8 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP)
  Path 3: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 victory point card
- Always track your direct path to 10 VP and focus on those builds
- Prioritize visible points (settlements/cities) over speculative development cards
- Switch paths if the opponent blocks your primary victory path
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Accept trades only when they enable an immediate, crucial build
- Never make trades that allow opponent to build a settlement or city immediately
- Trade away excess resources when at risk for robber (7+ cards)
- Calculate the production value of each settlement location before deciding to build
- When trading with ports, plan sequences that convert unwanted resources into needed ones

DETAILED DECISION FRAMEWORK:
1. Does this move bring me closer to 10 victory points?
2. Does this move increase my production capacity more than alternative builds?
3. Does this move protect me from being blocked or cut off?
4. Does this move position me for strongest expansion in next 2-3 turns?
5. Is this the most efficient use of my current resources?

TURN 77 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Build road toward wheat resources to enable settlement building with wheat access
2. Gather resources for a settlement (need brick and wheat)
3. Place settlement for +1 VP, then play VP card for another +1 VP
4. Focus on getting another city or settlement to reach 10 VP

# Strategic Analysis for Catan Turn 77

Let me analyze the current game state and available options to make the optimal decision.

## Game Status Assessment
- I have 6 VP: 2 cities (4 VP) + largest army (2 VP)
- I need 4 more VP to win
- I have a VP card that will give me +1 VP when played, so I actually need 3 more visible VP
- Resources: 1 🌲WOOD, 2 🐑SHEEP, 4 ⛏️ORE (but no 🧱BRICK or 🌾WHEAT)
- Red has 7 VP and is ahead by 1 point

## Victory Path Analysis
To reach 10 VP, I need:
- Play my VP card (+1)
- Build 1 more city (+1) and 1 more settlement (+1), OR
- Build 3 more settlements (+3)

## Resource Assessment
- I'm rich in ORE (4) which is good for city upgrades
- I have WOOD (1) which I need for roads or settlements
- I'm missing BRICK which I need for roads and settlements
- I'm missing WHEAT which I need for cities, settlements, and development cards

## Current Limitations
- I cannot build settlements or cities right now due to lack of resources
- I cannot build roads due to lack of BRICK
- I cannot trade at standard port rates as I don't have 4 of any resource

## Road Building Options Analysis
All road building options require 1 WOOD and 1 BRICK. Since I lack BRICK, I cannot build any roads this turn.

## Strategic Considerations
1. My current plan mentions building roads toward wheat resources, but I lack BRICK
2. I should focus on acquiring BRICK and WHEAT through trades or rolls
3. I should protect my ORE from the robber as I have a substantial amount

## Decision Logic
Since I cannot build anything this turn due to resource limitations, my best option is to end the turn and wait for better resources on future rolls.

However, I don't see an option to end the turn in the available actions. This suggests I must choose one of the road locations for future building when I acquire BRICK.

Looking at the board structure:
- Edge (2, 9) would connect toward the 🌾10 hex, which aligns with my plan to access wheat
- Edge (6, 7) would also be in the direction of wheat resources

<plan>
1. Focus on acquiring BRICK and WHEAT through future resource rolls
2. Build a road toward wheat resources when BRICK is available
3. Build a settlement at a wheat-producing location
4. Play VP card at strategic moment
5. Either upgrade a settlement to city or build another settlement to reach 10 VP
</plan>

Since I must select a road location option (even though I can't build it now), I'll choose option [3] - Build a road at edge (2, 9), as this appears to move toward the wheat-producing 🌾10 hex which aligns with my plan.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist whose primary goal is to defeat the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (HIGHEST PRIORITY):
- Target 6 & 8 numbered hexes at all costs - these are the most productive numbers
- Prioritize ore and wheat hexes for your settlements - they enable cities and development cards
- Position yourself on at least one good brick and wood hex to enable early expansion
- Aim to cover ALL five resources with your two settlements combined
- Try to place on intersections with 3 productive hexes rather than 2
- Evaluate probability dots (not just numbers) - more dots mean more frequent production
- Place settlements with clear expansion paths that won't be easily blocked
- Avoid placing where you'll be immediately cut off by the opponent
- Position roads toward your next planned settlement location
- Consider distance to valuable ports (especially 2:1 ports matching your abundant resources)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-8):
- Build at least one new road and one new settlement ASAP
- Focus on securing access to any missing resources through expansion
- Establish access to a port if you're lacking a key resource
- Prevent the opponent from cutting off your expansion path
- Only purchase development cards if excess resources available or for immediate victory
- Expand toward high-value hexes the opponent doesn't yet control

MID-GAME RESOURCE MANAGEMENT (TURNS 9-20):
- Target 3 cities minimum (worth 6 VP) - upgrade most productive settlements first
- Maintain 1 road per every 2 settlements for flexible expansion
- Always build a settlement when you have the resources (more production points)
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each build (cities give best long-term return)
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1 or better) to maintain resource balance
- Keep at least one viable road-building path open at all times
- If blocked from expansion, shift to city upgrades and development cards

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Development cards should supplement your expansion, not replace it
- Prioritize using Knight cards to protect your best hexes from the robber
- Save Knights when you're ahead to counter the opponent's robber placements
- Only buy development cards when you:
  1. Have excess sheep/wheat/ore but lack wood/brick for expansion
  2. Are close to securing largest army
  3. Need a specific card type (Road Building to break through a blockade)
- Use Road Building cards to save brick/wood and create surprise expansion paths
- Time Monopoly cards to capture opponent's stockpile after high-producing rolls
- Use Year of Plenty to complete crucial builds when short on specific resources

# Game Analysis for Turn 77

## Current Game State Assessment
- I have 6/10 VP (2 cities = 4 VP + Largest Army = 2 VP)
- I have 1 Victory Point card in hand (worth 1 VP)
- Current resources: 1 Wood, 2 Sheep, 4 Ore
- Opponent has 7/10 VP (2 cities + 1 settlement + Longest Road)
- I need 4 more VP to win

## Victory Path Analysis
To reach 10 VP, I need 3 more visible points beyond my VP card:
1. Building 3 settlements (3 VP)
2. Building 1 city + 1 settlement (3 VP) 
3. Building a settlement + stealing Longest Road (3 VP)

## Resource Assessment
- For a settlement, I need: Brick + Wood + Wheat + Sheep
- I have Wood (1) and Sheep (2) but lack Brick and Wheat
- For a city, I need: 3 Ore + 2 Wheat
- I have 4 Ore but no Wheat
- To build a road, I need: Brick + Wood
- I have Wood (1) but no Brick

## Action Analysis
1. Option 1: Trade 4 Ore for Wood - I already have Wood
2. Option 2: Trade 4 Ore for Wheat - Enables city upgrades, but I have no settlements to upgrade
3. Option 3: Trade 4 Ore for Brick - Would give me Brick + Wood to build a road
4. Option 4: Trade 4 Ore for Sheep - I already have Sheep and don't need more
5. Option 0: End Turn - Conserve resources for future builds

I need both Brick and Wheat urgently. Trading for Brick allows me to build a road immediately, advancing my position toward a settlement location. This aligns with my plan to build roads toward wheat resources.

<plan>
1. Trade for Brick and build a road toward a potential settlement location
2. Work toward acquiring Wheat through future resource rolls
3. Build a settlement at a wheat-producing location when resources allow
4. Continue advancing toward 10 VP through either:
   a) Building settlements (need 3 more)
   b) Building 1 more city + 1 settlement
5. Play VP card at final moment to surprise opponent
</plan>

Since building roads is crucial for expansion and I currently have Wood but no Brick, trading for Brick is the optimal choice to progress my position.

# Game State Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state carefully:

**My Position:**
- I have 6 VP (2 cities = 4 VP + Largest Army = 2 VP + 1 hidden VP card)
- Resources: 1 Wood, 1 Brick, 2 Sheep
- I have the Largest Army (8 knights)
- I need 4 more VP to win

**Opponent (RED) Position:**
- 7 VP (2 cities = 4 VP + 1 settlement = 1 VP + Longest Road = 2 VP)
- They have 8 hidden cards
- They have 1 hidden development card

**Building Options:**
- I have exactly enough resources (1 Wood, 1 Brick) to build 1 road
- I cannot build settlements or cities right now
- I cannot buy development cards right now

## Road Building Strategy Analysis

I need to determine which road location provides the best strategic value. I should build toward:
1. Potential settlement locations that give me access to resources I need (especially wheat)
2. Locations that may help me get Longest Road (currently RED has it with 5 segments)
3. Positions that block RED's expansion

Let me evaluate each road option:

**Edge 9-10:** Connects to wheat hex (10), but I need to check if this leads to a viable settlement location
**Edge 13-14:** Near my city at 15, but need to verify expansion potential
**Edge 0-20:** Creates connection between my settlements
**Edge 2-3:** Near opponent's settlement
**Edge 6-7:** Near wheat hex (10) 
**Edge 6-23:** Near ore hex (5)
**Edge 8-9:** Near wheat hex (10)
**Edge 0-5:** Connects toward RED's city at node 5
**Edge 17-18:** Near my city at 15

The most strategic path would be to build toward available settlement locations where I can access wheat (which I don't see in my current resources) and create a path to potentially contest longest road.

Looking at these options, I need to prioritize:
1. Building toward viable settlement locations
2. Connecting my network to potentially contest longest road in the future
3. Accessing important resources, especially wheat

<plan>
1. Build a road to position myself for a future settlement that will give me access to wheat
2. Work toward acquiring more resources through production
3. Build 2 more settlements (2 VP) and use my VP card (1 VP) to reach 10 VP
4. Consider the path toward contesting longest road if needed
</plan>

Edge 9-10 or Edge 8-9 appear most promising as they lead toward potential wheat production. Based on the node and resource layout, Edge 8-9 seems to provide the best strategic value, connecting toward the wheat hex with production value 10.

I choose to build a road at edge 8-9:

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist whose primary goal is to defeat the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (HIGHEST PRIORITY):
- Target 6 & 8 numbered hexes at all costs - these are the most productive numbers
- Prioritize ore and wheat hexes for your settlements - they enable cities and development cards
- Position yourself on at least one good brick and wood hex to enable early expansion
- Aim to cover ALL five resources with your two settlements combined
- Try to place on intersections with 3 productive hexes rather than 2
- Evaluate probability dots (not just numbers) - more dots mean more frequent production
- Place settlements with clear expansion paths that won't be easily blocked
- Avoid placing where you'll be immediately cut off by the opponent
- Position roads toward your next planned settlement location
- Consider distance to valuable ports (especially 2:1 ports matching your abundant resources)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-8):
- Build at least one new road and one new settlement ASAP
- Focus on securing access to any missing resources through expansion
- Establish access to a port if you're lacking a key resource
- Prevent the opponent from cutting off your expansion path
- Only purchase development cards if excess resources available or for immediate victory
- Expand toward high-value hexes the opponent doesn't yet control

MID-GAME RESOURCE MANAGEMENT (TURNS 9-20):
- Target 3 cities minimum (worth 6 VP) - upgrade most productive settlements first
- Maintain 1 road per every 2 settlements for flexible expansion
- Always build a settlement when you have the resources (more production points)
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each build (cities give best long-term return)
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1 or better) to maintain resource balance
- Keep at least one viable road-building path open at all times
- If blocked from expansion, shift to city upgrades and development cards

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Development cards should supplement your expansion, not replace it
- Prioritize using Knight cards to protect your best hexes from the robber
- Save Knights when you're ahead to counter the opponent's robber placements
- Only buy development cards when you:
  1. Have excess sheep/wheat/ore but lack wood/brick for expansion
  2. Are close to securing largest army
  3. Need a specific card type (Road Building to break through a blockade)
- Use Road Building cards to save brick/wood and create surprise expansion paths
- Time Monopoly cards to capture opponent's stockpile after high-producing rolls
- Use Year of Plenty to complete crucial builds when short on specific resources

ROBBER PLACEMENT:
- Always target the opponent's highest-producing hex (high number + settlement/city)
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat hexes to slow city development
- If opponent relies heavily on one resource, target that resource's hexes
- Never place the robber on your own high-production hexes
- When stealing, target resources you immediately need for your next build

VICTORY PATH PLANNING:
- Target resource independence with at least one settlement/city on each resource
- Minimum viable infrastructure: 3-4 settlements total, with 2-3 upgraded to cities
- Calculate multiple paths to 10 VP and pursue the fastest:
  Path 1: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP)
  Path 2: 4 cities (8 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP)
  Path 3: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 victory point card
- Always track your direct path to 10 VP and focus on those builds
- Prioritize visible points (settlements/cities) over speculative development cards
- Switch paths if the opponent blocks your primary victory path
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Accept trades only when they enable an immediate, crucial build
- Never make trades that allow opponent to build a settlement or city immediately
- Trade away excess resources when at risk for robber (7+ cards)
- Calculate the production value of each settlement location before deciding to build
- When trading with ports, plan sequences that convert unwanted resources into needed ones

DETAILED DECISION FRAMEWORK:
1. Does this move bring me closer to 10 victory points?
2. Does this move increase my production capacity more than alternative builds?
3. Does this move protect me from being blocked or cut off?
4. Does this move position me for strongest expansion in next 2-3 turns?
5. Is this the most efficient use of my current resources?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 79 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Build a road to position myself for a future settlement that will give me access to wheat
2. Work toward acquiring more resources through production
3. Build 2 more settlements (2 VP) and use my VP card (1 VP) to reach 10 VP
4. Consider the path toward contesting longest road if needed
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.

# Game Analysis for Turn 79

Let me analyze my current position and available options carefully:

## Current Victory Point Situation
- I have 6 VP: 2 Cities (4 VP) + Largest Army (2 VP)
- I have a VP card that will give me +1 VP when played
- To win, I need 4 more VP

## Resource Analysis
- I currently have 4 sheep only
- I need to convert these to more useful resources

## My Current Production
- City at node 15: brick(3★) and wheat(8★★★)
- City at node 1: sheep(4★), wheat(10★), ore(5★★) 
- Good wheat and ore production for cities/development cards
- Limited wood supply is a bottleneck

## Available Actions
My only options are to trade or end turn:
- [0] End my turn
- [1-4] Trade 4 sheep for 1 of wood/ore/wheat/brick

## Strategic Assessment

Looking at my current plan and resources:
1. I need to work toward 4 more VP (I have 6 VP currently)
2. I have 1 VP card (revealed), so I need 3 more VP
3. Building settlements (1 VP each) is the most logical path, requiring wood/brick/sheep/wheat
4. I currently only have sheep

<plan>
1. Trade sheep for wood to enable future road/settlement building
2. Continue collecting resources for settlements (3 more VP needed)
3. Play my VP card at the right moment to reach 10 VP
4. Keep maintaining largest army advantage
</plan>

The most strategic move is to trade my sheep for wood, as wood is:
1. Essential for roads and settlements
2. Not currently being produced effectively by my settlements
3. Necessary for my expansion path

Therefore, I should select option 1 to trade 4 sheep for 1 wood.

# Game Analysis for Turn 85

I need to assess the current game state and make the optimal decision to move toward victory.

## Current Game Status
- RED: 8/10 VP (3 cities = 6 VP + Longest Road = 2 VP)
- BLUE (me): 6/10 VP (2 cities = 4 VP + Largest Army = 2 VP + holding 1 Victory Point card)
- I need 3 more VP to win (since I have a VP card that will give me 1 VP when played)

## Resource Inventory
- 1 🌲WOOD
- 2 🧱BRICK  
- 2 🌾WHEAT
- 3 ⛏️ORE
- No 🐑SHEEP

## Victory Path Assessment

The fastest path to 10 VP appears to be:
- Current: 6 VP (2 cities + largest army)
- Hidden VP card: +1 VP = 7 VP
- Need 3 more VP from: settlements (1 VP each) or cities (2 VP each)

Building 3 settlements would give me 10 VP, but I don't currently have enough sheep to build any settlements. Building 1 new city (upgrading a settlement) and 1 new settlement would also give me 10 VP, but I don't have settlements to upgrade.

## Action Analysis

I see the following options:
1. End turn - Conserve resources for a future build
2. Build a road - Use wood and brick to position for future settlement placement

Since I need to build settlements to gain more VPs, and I have the wood and brick needed for a road, building a road toward a strategic location makes sense. This will position me for future settlement placement once I gather the missing resources (sheep).

Looking at the road options, I need to determine which one provides the best strategic advantage for future settlement placement. Without a detailed node map, I'll analyze based on surrounding resources and expansion potential.

Since RED is at 8 VP and getting close to winning, I need to block them where possible while setting myself up for expansion. I should build a road that:
1. Extends toward valuable resources 
2. Positions me for settlement building when I get sheep
3. Potentially blocks RED from critical expansion

<plan>
1. Build road to position for future settlement placement
2. Gather sheep (through trades or production) to build settlements
3. Build 3 settlements to reach 10 VP (along with my hidden VP card)
4. Maintain largest army advantage
</plan>

Without more information about the exact node connectivity and available settlement spots, the best strategy is to build a road to prepare for future settlement placement. End turn is not optimal as I have resources to use productively.

Since I need to make progress and have the resources for a road, I'll build one to position for future expansion.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist whose primary goal is to defeat the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (HIGHEST PRIORITY):
- Target 6 & 8 numbered hexes at all costs - these are the most productive numbers
- Prioritize ore and wheat hexes for your settlements - they enable cities and development cards
- Position yourself on at least one good brick and wood hex to enable early expansion
- Aim to cover ALL five resources with your two settlements combined
- Try to place on intersections with 3 productive hexes rather than 2
- Evaluate probability dots (not just numbers) - more dots mean more frequent production
- Place settlements with clear expansion paths that won't be easily blocked
- Avoid placing where you'll be immediately cut off by the opponent
- Position roads toward your next planned settlement location
- Consider distance to valuable ports (especially 2:1 ports matching your abundant resources)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-8):
- Build at least one new road and one new settlement ASAP
- Focus on securing access to any missing resources through expansion
- Establish access to a port if you're lacking a key resource
- Prevent the opponent from cutting off your expansion path
- Only purchase development cards if excess resources available or for immediate victory
- Expand toward high-value hexes the opponent doesn't yet control

MID-GAME RESOURCE MANAGEMENT (TURNS 9-20):
- Target 3 cities minimum (worth 6 VP) - upgrade most productive settlements first
- Maintain 1 road per every 2 settlements for flexible expansion
- Always build a settlement when you have the resources (more production points)
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each build (cities give best long-term return)
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1 or better) to maintain resource balance
- Keep at least one viable road-building path open at all times
- If blocked from expansion, shift to city upgrades and development cards

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Development cards should supplement your expansion, not replace it
- Prioritize using Knight cards to protect your best hexes from the robber
- Save Knights when you're ahead to counter the opponent's robber placements
- Only buy development cards when you:
  1. Have excess sheep/wheat/ore but lack wood/brick for expansion
  2. Are close to securing largest army
  3. Need a specific card type (Road Building to break through a blockade)
- Use Road Building cards to save brick/wood and create surprise expansion paths
- Time Monopoly cards to capture opponent's stockpile after high-producing rolls
- Use Year of Plenty to complete crucial builds when short on specific resources

ROBBER PLACEMENT:
- Always target the opponent's highest-producing hex (high number + settlement/city)
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat hexes to slow city development
- If opponent relies heavily on one resource, target that resource's hexes
- Never place the robber on your own high-production hexes
- When stealing, target resources you immediately need for your next build

VICTORY PATH PLANNING:
- Target resource independence with at least one settlement/city on each resource
- Minimum viable infrastructure: 3-4 settlements total, with 2-3 upgraded to cities
- Calculate multiple paths to 10 VP and pursue the fastest:
  Path 1: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP)
  Path 2: 4 cities (8 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP)
  Path 3: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 victory point card
- Always track your direct path to 10 VP and focus on those builds
- Prioritize visible points (settlements/cities) over speculative development cards
- Switch paths if the opponent blocks your primary victory path
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Accept trades only when they enable an immediate, crucial build
- Never make trades that allow opponent to build a settlement or city immediately
- Trade away excess resources when at risk for robber (7+ cards)
- Calculate the production value of each settlement location before deciding to build
- When trading with ports, plan sequences that convert unwanted resources into needed ones

DETAILED DECISION FRAMEWORK:
1. Does this move bring me closer to 10 victory points?
2. Does this move increase my production capacity more than alternative builds?
3. Does this move protect me from being blocked or cut off?
4. Does this move position me for strongest expansion in next 2-3 turns?
5. Is this the most efficient use of my current resources?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Initial Settlement Analysis

I need to analyze the board carefully for my first settlement placement. This is a critical decision that will shape the entire game.

## Analyzing Resource Hexes:
- 🌲8: Wood on (-1, 0, 1) - Very productive (5 dots), high value
- ⛏️6: Ore on (1, 0, -1) - Extremely productive (5 dots), high value
- 🌾10: Wheat on (0, 0, 0) - Good production (3 dots)
- 🌾3: Wheat on (-1, 1, 0) - Low production (2 dots)
- 🧱5: Brick on (0, 1, -1) - Good production (4 dots)
- 🐑4: Sheep on (1, -1, 0) - Good production (3 dots)
- 🏜️: Desert on (0, -1, 1) - No production, currently has robber

## Node Analysis:
Looking at the intersections where these hexes meet:

Node 12: Connects to 🌲8 and 🏜️ (Wood 8) - Only 2 resources, one is desert
Node 3: Connects to 🌲8, 🏜️, and 🌾10 (Wood 8, Wheat 10) - Productive but includes desert
Node 4: Connects to 🌲8, 🌾10, and 🌾3 (Wood 8, Wheat 10, Wheat 3) - Good but has duplicate resource
Node 13: Connects to 🌲8 only (Wood 8) - Only 1 resource, not optimal

Node 1: Connects to 🌾10, 🐑4, and ⛏️6 (Wheat 10, Sheep 4, Ore 6) - Excellent mix of 3 resources with high numbers!

## RED's Position:
RED already has node 0, which produces wheat, brick, and ore - they have high-value ore and brick but no access to sheep or wood.

## Decision Logic:
1. Node 1 appears optimal as it gives me:
   - Ore 6 (top tier production)
   - Wheat 10 (good production)
   - Sheep 4 (access to sheep which RED doesn't have)
   - Three different resources (maximizing resource diversity)
   - All high-probability numbers (6, 10, 4)

2. This settlement will complement my second placement where I can focus on getting brick and possibly more wood.

<plan>
1. Place first settlement at node 1 for ore, wheat, and sheep access
2. Place second settlement on a strong brick and wood location
3. Focus initial expansion on getting more settlements near high-producing wood hexes
4. Develop toward city upgrades of my best settlements once basic expansion is secure
</plan>

Node 1 gives me the best combination of high-probability numbers and diverse resources, setting me up well for the game.

# Initial Road Placement Analysis

I need to choose my first road placement after placing my initial settlement at node 2. This is a critical decision as it will guide my early expansion path.

Let me analyze my current position and the available road options:

## Current Position
- My first settlement is at node 2, connected to:
  - Wheat hex with value 10 (average productivity)
  - Sheep hex with value 4 (low productivity)
- I'm missing crucial resources: wood, brick, and ore

## Road Options
[0] Edge (2, 3): Moving toward the wood hex (value 8) and potentially ore
[1] Edge (2, 9): Moving toward the desert (no resources) and sheep
[2] Edge (1, 2): Moving toward the red player's settlement (node 0)

## Strategic Analysis

Option [0] - Edge (2, 3):
- Leads toward wood hex (8) which is excellent productivity
- Opens path to node 3 (connects to wood-8 and desert)
- Further connects to node 12 (wood-8 and desert) and node 13 (wood-8)
- Could eventually reach ore resources with further expansion
- Provides clear expansion without immediate competition

Option [1] - Edge (2, 9):
- Leads toward desert and sheep-4 (already have sheep)
- No productive hexes in this direction
- Poor expansion option

Option [2] - Edge (1, 2):
- Leads toward red player's settlement
- Dead end for expansion - can't build next to their settlement
- Wastes a critical early road

<plan>Place first road at edge (2, 3) to expand toward the productive wood-8 hex. For second settlement, target a location with brick and ore access. After initial placements, build roads from first settlement toward wood-8 hex to establish strong production base, then expand to secure missing resources.</plan>

The optimal choice is clearly option [0] - building a road at edge (2, 3). This sets up expansion toward the valuable wood-8 hex and provides a pathway to secure additional vital resources.

- Use Year of Plenty to complete crucial builds when short on specific resources

ROBBER PLACEMENT:
- Always target the opponent's highest-producing hex (high number + settlement/city)
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat hexes to slow city development
- If opponent relies heavily on one resource, target that resource's hexes
- Never place the robber on your own high-production hexes
- When stealing, target resources you immediately need for your next build

VICTORY PATH PLANNING:
- Target resource independence with at least one settlement/city on each resource
- Minimum viable infrastructure: 3-4 settlements total, with 2-3 upgraded to cities
- Calculate multiple paths to 10 VP and pursue the fastest:
  Path 1: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP)
  Path 2: 4 cities (8 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP)
  Path 3: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 victory point card
- Always track your direct path to 10 VP and focus on those builds
- Prioritize visible points (settlements/cities) over speculative development cards
- Switch paths if the opponent blocks your primary victory path
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Accept trades only when they enable an immediate, crucial build
- Never make trades that allow opponent to build a settlement or city immediately
- Trade away excess resources when at risk for robber (7+ cards)
- Calculate the production value of each settlement location before deciding to build
- When trading with ports, plan sequences that convert unwanted resources into needed ones

DETAILED DECISION FRAMEWORK:
1. Does this move bring me closer to 10 victory points?
2. Does this move increase my production capacity more than alternative builds?
3. Does this move protect me from being blocked or cut off?
4. Does this move position me for strongest expansion in next 2-3 turns?
5. Is this the most efficient use of my current resources?

# Initial Settlement Placement Analysis

I need to place my second settlement carefully as it will determine my early game production capabilities. Let's analyze the options systematically.

## Current Situation
- I already have one settlement at node 2, which produces:
  - Wheat on a 10 (average production)
  - Sheep on a 4 (below average production)
- I'm missing access to:
  - Wood (though I have a road extending toward the Wood-8 hex)
  - Brick
  - Ore
- RED player already has a settlement at node 0 with excellent resource diversity (wheat, brick, ore) and good numbers (10, 5, 6)

## Node Analysis for Second Settlement
Looking at high-value options based on resource diversity, number quality, and our needs:

1. **Node 12**: Connects to Wood-8 (excellent) and Desert (no production)
   - Only 2 resources, but includes the highly-valued Wood-8

2. **Node 13**: Connects to Wood-8 (excellent) and no other visible resources
   - Only 1 resource visible

3. **Node 15**: Connects to Wood-8 (excellent), Wheat-3 (poor)
   - 2 resources, but Wheat-3 is low probability

4. **Node 14**: Connects to Wood-8 (excellent)
   - Only 1 resource visible

5. **Node 4**: Connects to Wheat-10 (average), Wheat-3 (poor)
   - Only provides wheat which I already have

Looking at the grid structure, I notice:
- Node 12 connects to both wood-8 hex and desert (where the robber currently is)
- Nodes that connect to the brick-5 hex (like nodes 16, 19, 21) would be valuable

From the available options, node 12 stands out as it gives me access to the highly productive wood-8 hex. This aligns with my plan to expand toward the wood-8 hex and complements my first settlement.

<plan>Place second settlement at node 12 to secure the valuable wood-8 production. Then focus on expanding toward a brick/ore hex for resource diversity. After initial placements, build roads to establish a path toward ore or brick resources, which I'm currently missing.</plan>

Although node 12 only gives access to wood and the desert (currently with robber), the wood-8 is extremely valuable, and this location helps me execute my expansion plan toward other needed resources.

PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist whose primary goal is to defeat the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (HIGHEST PRIORITY):
- Target 6 & 8 numbered hexes at all costs - these are the most productive numbers
- Prioritize ore and wheat hexes for your settlements - they enable cities and development cards
- Position yourself on at least one good brick and wood hex to enable early expansion
- Aim to cover ALL five resources with your two settlements combined
- Try to place on intersections with 3 productive hexes rather than 2
- Evaluate probability dots (not just numbers) - more dots mean more frequent production
- Place settlements with clear expansion paths that won't be easily blocked
- Avoid placing where you'll be immediately cut off by the opponent
- Position roads toward your next planned settlement location
- Consider distance to valuable ports (especially 2:1 ports matching your abundant resources)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-8):
- Build at least one new road and one new settlement ASAP
- Focus on securing access to any missing resources through expansion
- Establish access to a port if you're lacking a key resource
- Prevent the opponent from cutting off your expansion path
- Only purchase development cards if excess resources available or for immediate victory
- Expand toward high-value hexes the opponent doesn't yet control

MID-GAME RESOURCE MANAGEMENT (TURNS 9-20):
- Target 3 cities minimum (worth 6 VP) - upgrade most productive settlements first
- Maintain 1 road per every 2 settlements for flexible expansion
- Always build a settlement when you have the resources (more production points)
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each build (cities give best long-term return)
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1 or better) to maintain resource balance
- Keep at least one viable road-building path open at all times
- If blocked from expansion, shift to city upgrades and development cards

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Development cards should supplement your expansion, not replace it
- Prioritize using Knight cards to protect your best hexes from the robber
- Save Knights when you're ahead to counter the opponent's robber placements
- Only buy development cards when you:
  1. Have excess sheep/wheat/ore but lack wood/brick for expansion
  2. Are close to securing largest army
  3. Need a specific card type (Road Building to break through a blockade)
- Use Road Building cards to save brick/wood and create surprise expansion paths
- Time Monopoly cards to capture opponent's stockpile after high-producing rolls
- Use Year of Plenty to complete crucial builds when short on specific resources

ROBBER PLACEMENT:
- Always target the opponent's highest-producing hex (high number + settlement/city)

# Initial Placement Road Analysis

I need to analyze the best location for my initial road from my settlement at node 12, which is positioned on the valuable wood-8 production hex.

Let me evaluate the three options:

## Option 0: Build road at edge (12, 13)
- Direction: This would extend toward node 13, which appears to be on the wood-8 hex and potentially another hex
- This extends toward the east/northeast of the board
- Would give me access to the wood-8 hex from another direction
- Could potentially lead toward ore resources which I'm currently lacking

## Option 1: Build road at edge (11, 12)
- Direction: This would extend toward node 11, which appears to be on the desert hex
- This extends toward the north/northwest of the board
- Desert hexes produce no resources, so this is not ideal for expansion
- Limited future value unless it connects to other valuable hexes beyond

## Option 2: Build road at edge (3, 12)
- Direction: This would extend toward node 3, connecting my two settlements
- This would create a path between my settlements at node 2 and node 12
- Could strengthen my position for longest road in the future
- Node 3 connects to the desert, wood-8, and wheat-10 hexes

<plan>
Build the road at edge (12, 13) to expand toward the east/northeast of the board, potentially gaining access to ore resources which I'm currently missing. After this, I'll aim to collect brick to continue expanding and build a settlement that gives me access to ore and/or brick resources.
</plan>

Looking at the options carefully, I want to expand toward resources I don't yet have access to, particularly ore and brick. Option 0 (edge 12, 13) seems to offer the best opportunity for expansion toward other valuable resource hexes, whereas Option 1 goes toward the desert (not useful) and Option 2 connects settlements I already own but doesn't open new expansion opportunities.

The road at (12, 13) gives me the most flexibility for future expansion, potentially toward ore resources that I'll need for cities later.

# Analyzing the Robber Placement Options

I need to carefully consider where to place the robber to maximize my advantage against RED while advancing my own strategy.

## Game State Assessment
- I have 2 VPs from my 2 settlements
- I have limited resources: just 1 wood and 1 sheep
- I'm missing ore entirely, which I need for city upgrades
- RED has 3 hidden resources and settlements on valuable production spaces

## Robber Placement Options Analysis

[0] Move robber to (0, 0, 0) and steal from RED
- This is wheat hex with value 10 (high production)
- Blocks RED's settlement at node 0 and node 4 (blocks 2 settlements)
- RED produces from this hex with 2 settlements, so this is high value

[1] Move robber to (1, -1, 0) 
- This is sheep hex with value 4 (low production)
- Can't steal from RED as they don't have a settlement here
- This doesn't impact RED much, so low value

[2] Move robber to (-1, 0, 1) and steal from RED
- This is wood hex with value 8 (high production)
- Blocks RED's settlement at node 4
- Also blocks my own settlement at node 12 (produces my only wood)
- This would hurt me as much as RED, so poor choice

[3] Move robber to (-1, 1, 0) and steal from RED
- This is wheat hex with value 3 (very low production)
- Blocks RED's settlement at node 4
- Low impact on RED due to low production value, so low value

[4] Move robber to (0, 1, -1) and steal from RED
- This is brick hex with value 5 (medium production)
- Blocks RED's settlement at node 0
- RED gets brick from this hex which is crucial for expansion

[5] Move robber to (1, 0, -1) and steal from RED
- This is ore hex with value 6 (high production)
- Blocks RED's settlement at node 0
- Ore is critical for city upgrades which give 2 VPs
- RED has access to ore while I don't have any ore access yet

## Strategic Decision

Looking at my options:
- Option [0] blocks a wheat hex with value 10 that RED has two settlements on
- Option [5] blocks ore which is a critical resource for city upgrades

Since I need to slow down RED's progress and ore is crucial for city building (and RED already has access while I don't), blocking RED's ore access is the best strategic move. This prevents them from upgrading to cities quickly and I might steal an ore card.

<plan>Place the robber on the ore hex to block RED's ore production. Continue working toward building a settlement with ore access. Trade for brick when possible to continue road expansion toward the east/northeast to access new resources.</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist whose primary goal is to defeat the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (HIGHEST PRIORITY):
- Target 6 & 8 numbered hexes at all costs - these are the most productive numbers
- Prioritize ore and wheat hexes for your settlements - they enable cities and development cards
- Position yourself on at least one good brick and wood hex to enable early expansion
- Aim to cover ALL five resources with your two settlements combined
- Try to place on intersections with 3 productive hexes rather than 2
- Evaluate probability dots (not just numbers) - more dots mean more frequent production
- Place settlements with clear expansion paths that won't be easily blocked
- Avoid placing where you'll be immediately cut off by the opponent
- Position roads toward your next planned settlement location
- Consider distance to valuable ports (especially 2:1 ports matching your abundant resources)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-8):
- Build at least one new road and one new settlement ASAP
- Focus on securing access to any missing resources through expansion
- Establish access to a port if you're lacking a key resource
- Prevent the opponent from cutting off your expansion path
- Only purchase development cards if excess resources available or for immediate victory
- Expand toward high-value hexes the opponent doesn't yet control

MID-GAME RESOURCE MANAGEMENT (TURNS 9-20):
- Target 3 cities minimum (worth 6 VP) - upgrade most productive settlements first
- Maintain 1 road per every 2 settlements for flexible expansion
- Always build a settlement when you have the resources (more production points)
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each build (cities give best long-term return)
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1 or better) to maintain resource balance
- Keep at least one viable road-building path open at all times
- If blocked from expansion, shift to city upgrades and development cards

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Development cards should supplement your expansion, not replace it
- Prioritize using Knight cards to protect your best hexes from the robber
- Save Knights when you're ahead to counter the opponent's robber placements
- Only buy development cards when you:
  1. Have excess sheep/wheat/ore but lack wood/brick for expansion
  2. Are close to securing largest army
  3. Need a specific card type (Road Building to break through a blockade)
- Use Road Building cards to save brick/wood and create surprise expansion paths
- Time Monopoly cards to capture opponent's stockpile after high-producing rolls
- Use Year of Plenty to complete crucial builds when short on specific resources

ROBBER PLACEMENT:
- Always target the opponent's highest-producing hex (high number + settlement/city)
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat hexes to slow city development
- If opponent relies heavily on one resource, target that resource's hexes
- Never place the robber on your own high-production hexes
- When stealing, target resources you immediately need for your next build

VICTORY PATH PLANNING:
- Target resource independence with at least one settlement/city on each resource
- Minimum viable infrastructure: 3-4 settlements total, with 2-3 upgraded to cities
- Calculate multiple paths to 10 VP and pursue the fastest:
  Path 1: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP)
  Path 2: 4 cities (8 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP)
  Path 3: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 victory point card
- Always track your direct path to 10 VP and focus on those builds
- Prioritize visible points (settlements/cities) over speculative development cards
- Switch paths if the opponent blocks your primary victory path
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Accept trades only when they enable an immediate, crucial build
- Never make trades that allow opponent to build a settlement or city immediately
- Trade away excess resources when at risk for robber (7+ cards)
- Calculate the production value of each settlement location before deciding to build
- When trading with ports, plan sequences that convert unwanted resources into needed ones

DETAILED DECISION FRAMEWORK:
1. Does this move bring me closer to 10 victory points?
2. Does this move increase my production capacity more than alternative builds?
3. Does this move protect me from being blocked or cut off?
4. Does this move position me for strongest expansion in next 2-3 turns?
5. Is this the most efficient use of my current resources?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 15 | Player: BLUE | Action: MOVE_ROBBER

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  Place the robber on the ore hex to block RED's ore production. Continue working toward building a settlement with ore access. Trade for brick when possible to continue road expansion toward the east/northeast to access new resources.
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.

# Game Analysis: Turn 15 - Robber Placement Decision

I need to choose the best hex to place the robber to maximize my strategic advantage while hampering RED's progress.

## Analyzing Current Game State:
- RED has settlements at nodes 0 and 4, accessing key resources: 
  * Node 0: Wheat 10, Brick 5, Ore 6
  * Node 4: Wheat 10, Wood 8, Wheat 3
- I (BLUE) have settlements at nodes 2 and 12:
  * Node 2: Wheat 10, Sheep 4
  * Node 12: Wood 8
- RED has 4 hidden resource cards
- I have 3 Wood, 1 Sheep, and 1 Wheat

## Evaluating Robber Placement Options:

**[0] Move robber to (0, 0, 0) - Wheat 10 hex - and steal from RED**
- Blocks RED's access to high-value wheat (10)
- Blocks my own wheat production at node 2
- Affects both players, but RED has two settlements on this hex

**[1] Move robber to (1, -1, 0) - Sheep 4 hex**
- Blocks my sheep production
- No RED settlements here
- Poor strategic choice as it hurts me without affecting RED

**[2] Move robber to (-1, 0, 1) - Wood 8 hex - and steal from RED**
- Blocks high-probability Wood 8 (3 dots)
- Affects both RED and me
- Wood is crucial for expansion

**[3] Move robber to (-1, 1, 0) - Wheat 3 hex - and steal from RED**
- Blocks RED's low-value wheat access
- Low impact choice (only 1 dot)

**[4] Move robber to (0, 1, -1) - Brick 5 hex - and steal from RED** 
- Blocks RED's access to medium-value brick
- RED needs brick for expansion
- 2 dots hex (medium probability)

**[5] Move robber to (1, 0, -1) - Ore 6 hex - and steal from RED**
- Blocks RED's access to high-value ore (6)
- High impact - 3 dots (high probability)
- Ore is critical for city upgrades and development cards
- I currently lack ore access

## Strategic Decision:
Option [5] provides the highest strategic value by:
1. Blocking RED's access to ore (6) - a high-probability resource with 3 dots
2. Preventing RED from upgrading to cities which require ore
3. Allowing me to steal from RED, possibly getting resources I need
4. Not impacting any of my own production

<plan>
Place the robber on the ore hex (1, 0, -1) to block RED's ore production. Continue working toward building a settlement with ore access. If I steal ore from RED, prioritize collecting brick to build roads toward valuable expansion locations. Target the northeast area to access new resources, especially looking to secure ore access for future city upgrades.

# Analyzing the Game State and Robber Placement Options

Let me analyze the available robber placement options to determine which offers the most strategic advantage.

## Current Game State Analysis
- I have 2 VP from my settlements at nodes 2 and 12
- RED also has 2 VP from settlements at nodes 0 and 4
- RED has strong resource production with access to ore (6), brick (5), and wheat (10, 3)
- I have wood (8) and limited wheat (10) and sheep (4) production
- I lack brick and ore access, which limits my expansion
- The robber is currently on the ore hex (1, 0, -1)

## Robber Placement Options Analysis:

**[0] Move robber to (0, 0, 0) and steal from RED**
- This blocks wheat (10) production
- Affects both me and RED (we both have settlements on this hex)
- RED has a settlement producing from this 10-wheat hex
- Would hurt my own wheat production at node 2

**[1] Move robber to (1, -1, 0)**
- This blocks sheep (4) production
- Would block my own sheep production at node 2
- RED doesn't have settlements on this hex
- Not a good strategic choice

**[2] Move robber to (0, -1, 1)**
- This is a desert hex with no production value
- Placing the robber here has no effect on resource production
- Completely wasted move

**[3] Move robber to (-1, 0, 1) and steal from RED**
- This blocks wood (8) production
- Would block my key wood production at node 12
- Affects RED's settlement at node 4
- Would hurt my own primary production source

**[4] Move robber to (-1, 1, 0) and steal from RED**
- This blocks wheat (3) production
- Affects only RED's settlement at node 4
- Blocks a low-probability number (3)
- Chance to steal from RED

**[5] Move robber to (0, 1, -1) and steal from RED**
- This blocks brick (5) production
- Affects only RED's settlement at node 0
- Blocks a medium-high probability number (5)
- Brick is critical for early game expansion
- Chance to steal from RED

## Strategic Considerations:
1. I need to avoid blocking my own resources, especially wood (8) which is my main production
2. RED has diverse resource access including ore, brick, and wheat which enables strong expansion
3. I should prioritize disrupting RED's expansion capabilities
4. Brick is critical for road building which is necessary for my expansion

<plan>
Block RED's brick production to slow their expansion while keeping my own production intact. Focus on building roads to gain access to ore which I currently lack. Look to expand toward the northern area of the board. Continue gathering resources for a new settlement that can access ore or brick.
</plan>

## Decision:
Option [5] is clearly the best choice as it:
- Blocks RED's brick (5) production which slows their expansion
- Doesn't affect any of my own production
- Gives me a chance to steal from RED, possibly acquiring brick or ore
- Targets a high-probability number (5)
- Disrupts RED's development path without hindering my own

\boxed{5}

1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (HIGHEST PRIORITY):
- Target 6 & 8 numbered hexes at all costs - these are the most productive numbers
- Prioritize ore and wheat hexes for your settlements - they enable cities and development cards
- Position yourself on at least one good brick and wood hex to enable early expansion
- Aim to cover ALL five resources with your two settlements combined
- Try to place on intersections with 3 productive hexes rather than 2
- Evaluate probability dots (not just numbers) - more dots mean more frequent production
- Place settlements with clear expansion paths that won't be easily blocked
- Avoid placing where you'll be immediately cut off by the opponent
- Position roads toward your next planned settlement location
- Consider distance to valuable ports (especially 2:1 ports matching your abundant resources)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-8):
- Build at least one new road and one new settlement ASAP
- Focus on securing access to any missing resources through expansion
- Establish access to a port if you're lacking a key resource
- Prevent the opponent from cutting off your expansion path
- Only purchase development cards if excess resources available or for immediate victory
- Expand toward high-value hexes the opponent doesn't yet control

MID-GAME RESOURCE MANAGEMENT (TURNS 9-20):
- Target 3 cities minimum (worth 6 VP) - upgrade most productive settlements first
- Maintain 1 road per every 2 settlements for flexible expansion
- Always build a settlement when you have the resources (more production points)
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each build (cities give best long-term return)
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1 or better) to maintain resource balance
- Keep at least one viable road-building path open at all times
- If blocked from expansion, shift to city upgrades and development cards

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Development cards should supplement your expansion, not replace it
- Prioritize using Knight cards to protect your best hexes from the robber
- Save Knights when you're ahead to counter the opponent's robber placements
- Only buy development cards when you:
  1. Have excess sheep/wheat/ore but lack wood/brick for expansion
  2. Are close to securing largest army
  3. Need a specific card type (Road Building to break through a blockade)
- Use Road Building cards to save brick/wood and create surprise expansion paths
- Time Monopoly cards to capture opponent's stockpile after high-producing rolls
- Use Year of Plenty to complete crucial builds when short on specific resources

ROBBER PLACEMENT:
- Always target the opponent's highest-producing hex (high number + settlement/city)
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat hexes to slow city development
- If opponent relies heavily on one resource, target that resource's hexes
- Never place the robber on your own high-production hexes
- When stealing, target resources you immediately need for your next build

VICTORY PATH PLANNING:
- Target resource independence with at least one settlement/city on each resource
- Minimum viable infrastructure: 3-4 settlements total, with 2-3 upgraded to cities
- Calculate multiple paths to 10 VP and pursue the fastest:
  Path 1: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP)
  Path 2: 4 cities (8 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP)
  Path 3: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 victory point card
- Always track your direct path to 10 VP and focus on those builds
- Prioritize visible points (settlements/cities) over speculative development cards
- Switch paths if the opponent blocks your primary victory path
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Accept trades only when they enable an immediate, crucial build
- Never make trades that allow opponent to build a settlement or city immediately
- Trade away excess resources when at risk for robber (7+ cards)
- Calculate the production value of each settlement location before deciding to build
- When trading with ports, plan sequences that convert unwanted resources into needed ones

DETAILED DECISION FRAMEWORK:
1. Does this move bring me closer to 10 victory points?
2. Does this move increase my production capacity more than alternative builds?
3. Does this move protect me from being blocked or cut off?
4. Does this move position me for strongest expansion in next 2-3 turns?
5. Is this the most efficient use of my current resources?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 23 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  Block RED's brick production to slow their expansion while keeping my own production intact. Focus on building roads to gain access to ore which I currently lack. Look to expand toward the northern area of the board. Continue gathering resources for a new settlement that can access ore or brick.
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.

# Game State Analysis

Let's analyze my current position and available options:

## Resources
I have:
- 4 🌲 WOOD
- 1 🐑 SHEEP
- 2 🌾 WHEAT
- 1 ⛏️ ORE

## Victory Points
- Current: 2/10 (2 settlements)
- RED also has 2/10

## Production
- Node 2: 🌾10[⭐], 🐑4[⭐] - decent wheat and sheep production
- Node 12: 🌲8[⭐⭐⭐] - excellent wood production
- I'm lacking reliable BRICK and ORE production

## Available Actions
1. Buy development card (costs 1 sheep, 1 wheat, 1 ore)
2. Trade 4 wood for 1 wheat
3. Trade 4 wood for 1 brick
4. Trade 4 wood for 1 sheep
5. Trade 4 wood for 1 ore
6. End turn

## Strategic Analysis

1. **Development Card Option**: 
   - Costs: 1 sheep, 1 wheat, 1 ore
   - This would use all my non-wood resources
   - Could get me a Victory Point card, Knight, Monopoly, Road Building, or Year of Plenty
   - Not a guaranteed immediate benefit

2. **Maritime Trade Options**:
   - I have excess wood (4)
   - Most critical resource I'm missing is brick for expansion
   - Trading for brick would allow me to build 1 road this turn

3. **Road Building Strategy**:
   - My current position is quite constrained
   - Need to expand to get access to ore and brick production
   - Building a road would help me work toward a new settlement

4. **End Turn**:
   - Conservative option to preserve resources
   - But I risk losing half on a 7 roll if I collect 3+ more resources next round

Looking at the board connectivity, if I trade for brick, I could build a road from node 3 toward node 4/15 to start competing with RED for expansion opportunities toward ore production.

<plan>
Trade my excess wood for brick to build a road and continue expanding eastward toward ore production. My immediate goal is to establish a third settlement at a location with brick and/or ore to diversify my resource production. I'll target node 14 or 15 to gain access to wood and ore.
</plan>

Given the analysis, my best option is to trade for brick to enable expansion toward better resource diversity. I need to compete with RED for expansion space and secure ore/brick access.

# Game Analysis - Turn 23

Let me carefully analyze the current state of the game and my available options:

## Current Resources
I have: 1 🧱BRICK, 1 🐑SHEEP, 2 🌾WHEAT, 1 ⛏️ORE

## Game State Analysis
- I have 2 VP from my two settlements
- RED also has 2 VP from their two settlements
- The robber is on the 🧱5 hex, blocking RED's brick production
- My settlement production is limited to:
  - Node 2: 🌾10[⭐], 🐑4[⭐] (moderate wheat and sheep)
  - Node 12: 🌲8[⭐⭐⭐] (strong wood, but only one resource)
- I lack reliable brick and ore production
- My roads extend from nodes 2→3 and 12→13, showing my expansion paths

## Available Actions
1. Buy a development card (1 🐑SHEEP, 1 🌾WHEAT, 1 ⛏️ORE)
2. End my turn

## Decision Analysis

Looking at the development card option:
- Pros: Could potentially get a Victory Point card, Knight, Road Building, Monopoly, or Year of Plenty
- Cons: It's a gamble and uses my only ore which could be saved for city upgrades
- I can't build anything else this turn (no roads, settlements or cities)

According to my current plan, I wanted to trade wood for brick to build a road, but I don't have enough wood to make that trade. My only ore is better saved for city development rather than spent on a development card with uncertain benefits.

Given my resource constraints and strategic goals, I should conserve my resources for future expansion. I'm not in immediate danger of losing to the robber (I have only 5 cards). A development card at this stage would delay my expansion strategy without a guaranteed benefit.

<plan>
Save resources for next turn. My priority remains expanding eastward with roads and a new settlement to reach ore production. I'll wait to collect more resources, particularly wood from my settlement on the 8 hex. Once I have enough wood, I can trade for brick to build roads toward node 14 or 15 to gain access to ore production. If I roll well next turn and get more wood, I'll be in position to make significant progress.

# Game State Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state and my available options:

## Resource Assessment
I currently have:
- 1 🌲WOOD, 1 🧱BRICK: Just enough for one road
- 1 🐑SHEEP, 2 🌾WHEAT, 1 ⛏️ORE: Could buy a development card

## Position Assessment
- I have settlements at nodes 2 and 12, producing 🌾10, 🐑4, and 🌲8
- The 🌲8 is my best producing hex (3 dots)
- RED has better positioning with access to 🧱5 and ⛏️6
- The robber is on 🧱5, blocking RED's brick production
- I need to expand toward ore production, which I currently lack reliable access to

## Available Actions
1. Build roads: Options 1-6 (all cost 1 wood, 1 brick)
2. Buy development card: Option 7 (costs 1 sheep, 1 wheat, 1 ore)
3. End turn: Option 0

## Strategic Evaluation

### Road Building Options:
- Edge (13, 14): Extends eastward from my settlement at 12, moving toward ore production
- Edge (1, 2): Connects my settlements but doesn't open new expansion paths
- Edge (3, 4): Moves toward RED's settlement, not useful
- Edge (11, 12): Builds west from settlement 12, away from resources
- Edge (2, 9): Extends north from settlement 2, no clear resource benefit
- Edge (3, 12): Connects my settlements but doesn't open expansion paths

### Development Card Option:
- Would cost sheep, wheat, and ore
- Could provide a knight (moving robber), victory point, road building, monopoly, or year of plenty
- Benefits would be uncertain until revealed

## Decision Making

The most strategic road option is (13, 14) as it:
1. Extends eastward toward the ore hex
2. Creates a path for future settlement placement
3. Follows my current plan of expanding toward ore production

Buying a development card is tempting, but:
1. I'd spend my only ore resource
2. The benefit is uncertain
3. Expanding production capacity is more urgent at this stage

End turn is suboptimal as I have the resources for a productive move.

<plan>Build the road at edge (13, 14) to continue my eastward expansion toward ore production. Next, I'll need to gather more wood and brick to extend further and establish a settlement at node 14 or 15 to access ore. This will give me resource diversification and better production capacity.</plan>

Based on this analysis, I should build the road at edge (13, 14).

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist whose primary goal is to defeat the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (HIGHEST PRIORITY):
- Target 6 & 8 numbered hexes at all costs - these are the most productive numbers
- Prioritize ore and wheat hexes for your settlements - they enable cities and development cards
- Position yourself on at least one good brick and wood hex to enable early expansion
- Aim to cover ALL five resources with your two settlements combined
- Try to place on intersections with 3 productive hexes rather than 2
- Evaluate probability dots (not just numbers) - more dots mean more frequent production
- Place settlements with clear expansion paths that won't be easily blocked
- Avoid placing where you'll be immediately cut off by the opponent
- Position roads toward your next planned settlement location
- Consider distance to valuable ports (especially 2:1 ports matching your abundant resources)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-8):
- Build at least one new road and one new settlement ASAP
- Focus on securing access to any missing resources through expansion
- Establish access to a port if you're lacking a key resource
- Prevent the opponent from cutting off your expansion path
- Only purchase development cards if excess resources available or for immediate victory
- Expand toward high-value hexes the opponent doesn't yet control

MID-GAME RESOURCE MANAGEMENT (TURNS 9-20):
- Target 3 cities minimum (worth 6 VP) - upgrade most productive settlements first
- Maintain 1 road per every 2 settlements for flexible expansion
- Always build a settlement when you have the resources (more production points)
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each build (cities give best long-term return)
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1 or better) to maintain resource balance
- Keep at least one viable road-building path open at all times
- If blocked from expansion, shift to city upgrades and development cards

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Development cards should supplement your expansion, not replace it
- Prioritize using Knight cards to protect your best hexes from the robber
- Save Knights when you're ahead to counter the opponent's robber placements
- Only buy development cards when you:
  1. Have excess sheep/wheat/ore but lack wood/brick for expansion
  2. Are close to securing largest army
  3. Need a specific card type (Road Building to break through a blockade)
- Use Road Building cards to save brick/wood and create surprise expansion paths
- Time Monopoly cards to capture opponent's stockpile after high-producing rolls
- Use Year of Plenty to complete crucial builds when short on specific resources

ROBBER PLACEMENT:
- Always target the opponent's highest-producing hex (high number + settlement/city)
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat hexes to slow city development
- If opponent relies heavily on one resource, target that resource's hexes
- Never place the robber on your own high-production hexes
- When stealing, target resources you immediately need for your next build

VICTORY PATH PLANNING:
- Target resource independence with at least one settlement/city on each resource
- Minimum viable infrastructure: 3-4 settlements total, with 2-3 upgraded to cities
- Calculate multiple paths to 10 VP and pursue the fastest:
  Path 1: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP)
  Path 2: 4 cities (8 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP)
  Path 3: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 victory point card
- Always track your direct path to 10 VP and focus on those builds
- Prioritize visible points (settlements/cities) over speculative development cards
- Switch paths if the opponent blocks your primary victory path
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Accept trades only when they enable an immediate, crucial build
- Never make trades that allow opponent to build a settlement or city immediately
- Trade away excess resources when at risk for robber (7+ cards)
- Calculate the production value of each settlement location before deciding to build
- When trading with ports, plan sequences that convert unwanted resources into needed ones

DETAILED DECISION FRAMEWORK:
1. Does this move bring me closer to 10 victory points?
2. Does this move increase my production capacity more than alternative builds?
3. Does this move protect me from being blocked or cut off?
4. Does this move position me for strongest expansion in next 2-3 turns?
5. Is this the most efficient use of my current resources?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game Analysis

I'll analyze my current position and available options:

## Current Resources
- 1 🐑 SHEEP
- 2 🌾 WHEAT
- 1 ⛏️ ORE

## Available Actions
- [0] End Turn
- [1] Buy Development Card (costs 1 🐑, 1 🌾, 1 ⛏️)

## Game Position Assessment
1. I have 2 VP from my 2 settlements
2. I have a road path building eastward (12-13-14)
3. My settlements produce wheat, sheep, and wood
4. I lack good brick production
5. Red has settlements on high-value hexes, especially at node 0 with ore(6)

## Strategic Considerations
Looking at my current resources, I have exactly what's needed to buy a development card. This would use all my current resources.

Development cards provide several potential benefits:
- Victory Point cards (immediate hidden VP)
- Knight cards (move robber, potentially get Largest Army)
- Progress cards (Year of Plenty, Monopoly, Road Building)

Given that I lack brick for expanding my road network and building settlements, and my current plan mentions eastward expansion toward ore production, a development card could be valuable:
- A Knight would let me move the robber off the brick hex at (0,1,-1)
- A Road Building card would let me expand without needing brick
- A VP card would bring me closer to victory

<plan>
Buy a development card now to potentially gain a VP or useful action card. Continue eastward expansion toward node 14/15 when I accumulate more wood and brick. Focus on gaining access to ore production which I currently lack.
</plan>

Since I don't have the resources to expand my road network this turn (lacking brick), and I have exactly the resources needed for a development card, purchasing one is the optimal move. This gives me a chance at immediate VP, Knights for defense/offense, or action cards that can accelerate my development.

# Game Analysis

I'm a Blue player with 2 victory points and need to analyze my options carefully.

## Current Resources:
- 1 Wood
- 4 Sheep
- 1 Wheat
- 1 VP card (hidden)

## Available Actions:
- End turn
- Maritime trade: 4 Sheep for 1 of any resource

## Game State Analysis:
- I have settlements at nodes 2 (produces wheat and sheep) and 12 (produces wood)
- I have roads heading eastward from node 12 toward node 14
- I completely lack ore production which is crucial for city upgrades
- I have 3 VP (2 visible + 1 hidden from VP development card)
- I already have a clear expansion path with my road network

## Strategic Considerations:

1. **Resource Assessment**: 
   - I have 4 sheep which is enough for a maritime trade
   - I'm lacking ore and brick for development

2. **Action Evaluation**:
   - Action 0 (End Turn): Not optimal as I have resources to use
   - Action 1 (Trade 4 sheep for wood): Gives me 2 wood total, but still not enough for a road (need brick)
   - Action 2 (Trade 4 sheep for ore): Gets me 1 ore, which I need for city upgrades or development cards
   - Action 3 (Trade 4 sheep for wheat): Gives me 2 wheat total, but not immediately useful
   - Action 4 (Trade 4 sheep for brick): Gets me 1 brick, which could help with road building later

3. **Strategic Direction**:
   - I need ore for both development cards and city upgrades
   - I need brick to continue my road network expansion
   - My current plan involves buying development cards, which require ore

After careful consideration, I should trade for ore to enable development card purchases or start collecting resources for city upgrades. This aligns with my plan of buying development cards while I work toward expansion.

<plan>
Trade my excess sheep for ore, then focus on collecting resources for either another development card or expansion toward node 14/15 when I get more wood and brick. When possible, I should place a settlement at a location that provides ore production since I'm completely lacking this resource.

You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist whose primary goal is to defeat the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (HIGHEST PRIORITY):
- Target 6 & 8 numbered hexes at all costs - these are the most productive numbers
- Prioritize ore and wheat hexes for your settlements - they enable cities and development cards
- Position yourself on at least one good brick and wood hex to enable early expansion
- Aim to cover ALL five resources with your two settlements combined
- Try to place on intersections with 3 productive hexes rather than 2
- Evaluate probability dots (not just numbers) - more dots mean more frequent production
- Place settlements with clear expansion paths that won't be easily blocked
- Avoid placing where you'll be immediately cut off by the opponent
- Position roads toward your next planned settlement location
- Consider distance to valuable ports (especially 2:1 ports matching your abundant resources)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-8):
- Build at least one new road and one new settlement ASAP
- Focus on securing access to any missing resources through expansion
- Establish access to a port if you're lacking a key resource
- Prevent the opponent from cutting off your expansion path
- Only purchase development cards if excess resources available or for immediate victory
- Expand toward high-value hexes the opponent doesn't yet control

MID-GAME RESOURCE MANAGEMENT (TURNS 9-20):
- Target 3 cities minimum (worth 6 VP) - upgrade most productive settlements first
- Maintain 1 road per every 2 settlements for flexible expansion
- Always build a settlement when you have the resources (more production points)
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each build (cities give best long-term return)
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1 or better) to maintain resource balance
- Keep at least one viable road-building path open at all times
- If blocked from expansion, shift to city upgrades and development cards

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Development cards should supplement your expansion, not replace it
- Prioritize using Knight cards to protect your best hexes from the robber
- Save Knights when you're ahead to counter the opponent's robber placements
- Only buy development cards when you:
  1. Have excess sheep/wheat/ore but lack wood/brick for expansion
  2. Are close to securing largest army
  3. Need a specific card type (Road Building to break through a blockade)
- Use Road Building cards to save brick/wood and create surprise expansion paths
- Time Monopoly cards to capture opponent's stockpile after high-producing rolls
- Use Year of Plenty to complete crucial builds when short on specific resources

ROBBER PLACEMENT:
- Always target the opponent's highest-producing hex (high number + settlement/city)
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat hexes to slow city development
- If opponent relies heavily on one resource, target that resource's hexes
- Never place the robber on your own high-production hexes
- When stealing, target resources you immediately need for your next build

VICTORY PATH PLANNING:
- Target resource independence with at least one settlement/city on each resource
- Minimum viable infrastructure: 3-4 settlements total, with 2-3 upgraded to cities
- Calculate multiple paths to 10 VP and pursue the fastest:
  Path 1: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP)
  Path 2: 4 cities (8 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP)
  Path 3: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 victory point card
- Always track your direct path to 10 VP and focus on those builds
- Prioritize visible points (settlements/cities) over speculative development cards
- Switch paths if the opponent blocks your primary victory path
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Accept trades only when they enable an immediate, crucial build
- Never make trades that allow opponent to build a settlement or city immediately
- Trade away excess resources when at risk for robber (7+ cards)
- Calculate the production value of each settlement location before deciding to build
- When trading with ports, plan sequences that convert unwanted resources into needed ones

DETAILED DECISION FRAMEWORK:
1. Does this move bring me closer to 10 victory points?
2. Does this move increase my production capacity more than alternative builds?
3. Does this move protect me from being blocked or cut off?
4. Does this move position me for strongest expansion in next 2-3 turns?
5. Is this the most efficient use of my current resources?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 35 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  Trade my excess sheep for ore, then focus on collecting resources for either another development card or expansion toward node 14/15 when I get more wood and brick. When possible, I should place a settlement at a location that provides ore production since I'm completely lacking this resource.

# Game Analysis: Turn 35

Let me carefully assess the current game state and my options.

## Current Game State
- I have 2 settlements (2 VP) + 1 hidden VP card = 3 VP total
- Resources in hand: 1 Wood, 1 Sheep, 3 Wheat, 1 Ore
- My settlements produce: Wood (from 8), Sheep (from 4), and Wheat (from 10)
- I'm completely lacking Ore production as neither of my settlements are on an Ore hex
- The robber is on the Brick (5) hex, blocking one of Red's key resources

## Available Actions
1. Buy a development card (costs 1 Sheep, 1 Wheat, 1 Ore)
2. End my turn

## Resource Analysis
- I have exactly the resources needed to buy a development card
- After buying a card, I'd have 1 Wood, 0 Sheep, 2 Wheat, 0 Ore
- I don't have resources to build anything else right now (road, settlement, or city)
- I cannot expand with my current resource set

## Development Card Value
- A development card could be:
  * Knight (most common) - Would allow me to move the robber and steal a resource
  * Victory Point - Would bring me to 4 VP total (hidden advantage)
  * Year of Plenty - Gain 2 resources of my choice (could get brick/ore for expansion)
  * Monopoly - Could steal all of one resource from opponent
  * Road Building - Would save me 2 brick and 2 wood (great value)

## Strategic Considerations
- I need to improve my resource production, especially Ore
- I'm competing with Red who has good Ore production (6 hex)
- Development cards offer flexibility and hidden points
- If I don't use my Ore now, I can't build anything else with it this turn

<plan>Buy a development card now to potentially get immediate value while maintaining my expansion plan. When I collect more wood and brick, I'll build toward node 14/15 for expansion, prioritizing locations with Ore production access. In the meantime, I'll try to maintain sufficient resources to capitalize on any opportunities that arise.</plan>

Given that I can't build anything else right now, and buying a development card is the only productive action available that uses my current resources, I'll purchase a development card. This could give me a knight to move the robber off Red's brick production, a VP card to get closer to victory, or another useful card.

# Game Analysis for Turn 37

Let me analyze the current game state and available options to determine the optimal move.

## Current Resources & Assets
- I have 1 Wood, 2 Wheat
- I possess 1 Knight card and 1 Victory Point card (hidden, worth 1 VP)
- I currently have 2 visible VP (2 settlements)
- Including my hidden VP card, I actually have 3/10 VP

## Available Actions
- [0] Play Knight card - Move the robber and steal a resource
- [1] Roll the dice

## Strategic Analysis

First, I need to consider the potential value of playing the Knight card now versus rolling:

**Option 0: Play Knight Card**
- Benefits:
  - Move the robber from the brick hex (0, 1, -1) to a more advantageous location (likely RED's 6 ore hex)
  - Potentially steal a resource from RED
  - Protect myself from losing resources if I roll a 7
  - Start accumulating knights toward Largest Army (2 VP)
- Drawbacks:
  - Knight cards can be more valuable when saved for emergencies or strategic moments
  - I might miss out on resources from a good dice roll

**Option 1: Roll Dice**
- Benefits:
  - Potential to gain resources based on my settlements (on 4, 8, and 10)
  - Save the Knight card for a more critical moment
- Drawbacks:
  - Risk rolling a 7 (would need to discard if I had more than 7 cards, but I only have 3)
  - The opponent could continue to benefit from their valuable ore hex

## Decision Reasoning

The robber is currently on a brick hex that doesn't affect either of us directly. RED has a settlement on a valuable 6 ore hex, which is giving them significant production advantage. 

Since I currently have only 3 cards, there's no risk of losing resources to a 7 roll. My settlements are on valuable numbers (8 and 10), so I would benefit from rolling.

The Knight card would be more valuable either:
1. When I'm at risk of losing resources to a 7
2. When I need to block a critical resource at a crucial moment
3. When I'm closer to getting Largest Army

<plan>I will roll the dice to potentially gain resources. If I roll a 7, I'll target RED's ore hex. If I collect enough resources from my roll, I'll focus on expanding my settlement network toward node 14/15, which could give me access to more resources. I'll save my Knight card for a more critical moment when it provides greater strategic advantage.</plan>

Given these considerations, the optimal action is to:

# Game Analysis: Turn 37

Let me analyze the current game state and my options carefully.

## Current Position:
- I have 2 VP from my 2 settlements
- I have 1 hidden VP from a Victory Point card (not counted in my visible 2 VP)
- Resources: 1 Wood, 2 Wheat
- Development cards: 1 Knight, 1 Victory Point

## Available Actions:
- [0] Play Knight card - Move the robber and steal a resource
- [1] End turn

## Strategic Assessment:

1. **Resource Analysis**: With only 3 resources (1 Wood, 2 Wheat), I don't have enough to build anything this turn. I need brick for roads or a combination of resources for other builds.

2. **Robber Position**: The robber is currently on the Brick (5) hex, which is only affecting RED. This is good for me as I don't produce from that hex.

3. **Knight Card Value**:
   - Using a Knight now would move the robber and let me steal 1 random card from RED
   - RED only has 2 cards, so there's a 50% chance I get something useful
   - Playing the Knight contributes to Largest Army (2 VP) but I need 3 Knights total

4. **Future Turns Planning**:
   - I should preserve my Knight for when it provides more strategic value
   - Using it when RED has more resources would be more beneficial
   - Saving it could let me protect my own hexes if RED moves the robber to my key production hexes
   - The Knight could be more valuable when I'm closer to achieving Largest Army

<plan>
Save my Knight for when RED has more resources or when I need to protect my production. Roll next turn to collect resources and focus on building roads toward expansion opportunities. Target getting a settlement at node 14 or node 15 to improve my resource diversity and production. Keep tracking the opportunity to achieve Largest Army with future Knight cards.
</plan>

Since I don't have enough resources to build anything meaningful this turn, and the Knight would have limited value when RED only has 2 cards, the most strategic move is to end my turn and wait for a better opportunity to use my Knight.

PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist whose primary goal is to defeat the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (HIGHEST PRIORITY):
- Target 6 & 8 numbered hexes at all costs - these are the most productive numbers
- Prioritize ore and wheat hexes for your settlements - they enable cities and development cards
- Position yourself on at least one good brick and wood hex to enable early expansion
- Aim to cover ALL five resources with your two settlements combined
- Try to place on intersections with 3 productive hexes rather than 2
- Evaluate probability dots (not just numbers) - more dots mean more frequent production
- Place settlements with clear expansion paths that won't be easily blocked
- Avoid placing where you'll be immediately cut off by the opponent
- Position roads toward your next planned settlement location
- Consider distance to valuable ports (especially 2:1 ports matching your abundant resources)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-8):
- Build at least one new road and one new settlement ASAP
- Focus on securing access to any missing resources through expansion
- Establish access to a port if you're lacking a key resource
- Prevent the opponent from cutting off your expansion path
- Only purchase development cards if excess resources available or for immediate victory
- Expand toward high-value hexes the opponent doesn't yet control

MID-GAME RESOURCE MANAGEMENT (TURNS 9-20):
- Target 3 cities minimum (worth 6 VP) - upgrade most productive settlements first
- Maintain 1 road per every 2 settlements for flexible expansion
- Always build a settlement when you have the resources (more production points)
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each build (cities give best long-term return)
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1 or better) to maintain resource balance
- Keep at least one viable road-building path open at all times
- If blocked from expansion, shift to city upgrades and development cards

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Development cards should supplement your expansion, not replace it
- Prioritize using Knight cards to protect your best hexes from the robber
- Save Knights when you're ahead to counter the opponent's robber placements
- Only buy development cards when you:
  1. Have excess sheep/wheat/ore but lack wood/brick for expansion
  2. Are close to securing largest army
  3. Need a specific card type (Road Building to break through a blockade)
- Use Road Building cards to save brick/wood and create surprise expansion paths
- Time Monopoly cards to capture opponent's stockpile after high-producing rolls
- Use Year of Plenty to complete crucial builds when short on specific resources

ROBBER PLACEMENT:
- Always target the opponent's highest-producing hex (high number + settlement/city)
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat hexes to slow city development
- If opponent relies heavily on one resource, target that resource's hexes
- Never place the robber on your own high-production hexes
- When stealing, target resources you immediately need for your next build

VICTORY PATH PLANNING:
- Target resource independence with at least one settlement/city on each resource
- Minimum viable infrastructure: 3-4 settlements total, with 2-3 upgraded to cities
- Calculate multiple paths to 10 VP and pursue the fastest:
  Path 1: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP)
  Path 2: 4 cities (8 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP)
  Path 3: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 victory point card
- Always track your direct path to 10 VP and focus on those builds
- Prioritize visible points (settlements/cities) over speculative development cards
- Switch paths if the opponent blocks your primary victory path
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Accept trades only when they enable an immediate, crucial build
- Never make trades that allow opponent to build a settlement or city immediately
- Trade away excess resources when at risk for robber (7+ cards)
- Calculate the production value of each settlement location before deciding to build
- When trading with ports, plan sequences that convert unwanted resources into needed ones

DETAILED DECISION FRAMEWORK:
1. Does this move bring me closer to 10 victory points?
2. Does this move increase my production capacity more than alternative builds?
3. Does this move protect me from being blocked or cut off?
4. Does this move position me for strongest expansion in next 2-3 turns?
5. Is this the most efficient use of my current resources?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game Analysis

Let me assess our current situation and available options:

## Current Resources and Assets
- I have 2 wood and 2 wheat
- I have 2 settlements (2 VP)
- I have 1 Knight card and 1 Victory Point card (giving me an invisible VP, making me effectively at 3/10)
- My settlements produce wood, wheat, and sheep

## Available Actions
- [0] Play Knight card
- [1] Roll the dice

## Strategic Considerations

If I play the Knight card:
- Benefits: I could move the robber from brick (where it's currently blocking RED's brick production) to RED's ore hex which produces on a 6, a high-value target
- I could steal a resource from RED
- I'd be one step toward Largest Army

If I roll:
- I have a chance to gain more resources based on the roll
- I can always play the Knight card later if needed
- Saving the Knight can be valuable for when RED has more resources or when I need to protect my own production

The robber is currently on a brick hex which is hurting RED, not me. This means the robber is actually in a good position from my perspective, since RED has more settlements than I do and this restrains their resource collection.

<plan>Continue with the original plan. Save my Knight for a more opportune time when RED has accumulated more resources or when the robber is placed on one of my productive hexes. Roll the dice to collect more resources and work toward my expansion goals at nodes 14 or 15.</plan>

The optimal move is to roll the dice (action [1]) rather than play the Knight card now. The robber is already in a position that's disadvantageous to my opponent, and I should save my Knight for when I can get maximum value from it.

# Game State Analysis

Let me analyze my current position and options:

## Current Resources
- 2 Wood
- 2 Wheat
- 1 Knight card
- 1 Victory Point card (secretly giving me 3 VP instead of 2)

## Current Board Position
- I have 2 settlements (2 VP)
- My settlements produce:
  * Settlement at node 2: Wheat (10) and Sheep (4)
  * Settlement at node 12: Wood (8) - a good production hex
- I have roads toward node 14, positioning for expansion

## Available Actions
- [0] Play Knight card - Move robber and steal a resource
- [1] End turn

## Decision Analysis

The robber is currently on the brick hex (0,1,-1) with roll number 5, which impacts RED's settlement at node 0. This settlement produces brick, wheat and ore for RED. The robber isn't affecting my production.

If I play my Knight card now:
- Pros:
  * I could steal one of RED's 4 resources
  * I could move the robber to a more productive hex for RED (like the ore 6 hex)
  * Start working toward Largest Army
- Cons:
  * I'd be using my Knight without getting immediate building advantage
  * I currently have no resources to lose to the robber (only 4 cards)
  * Knights are more valuable defensively when I have many resources or when the robber is on my productive hexes

If I end my turn:
- I'll roll next turn and potentially gain more resources
- I'll keep my Knight for when it's more strategically valuable
- I can continue with my plan to expand to nodes 14 or 15

<plan>Save Knight for defensive use when I have 7+ cards or when robber is placed on my productive hexes. Continue accumulating resources for expansion toward node 14. I need brick for my next road and settlement, so my priority is to get brick on future rolls or through trading.</plan>

Since I don't have enough resources to build anything this turn, and the robber isn't currently affecting my production, the most strategic choice is to end my turn and save my Knight card for when it provides greater advantage.

- Use Road Building cards to save brick/wood and create surprise expansion paths
- Time Monopoly cards to capture opponent's stockpile after high-producing rolls
- Use Year of Plenty to complete crucial builds when short on specific resources

ROBBER PLACEMENT:
- Always target the opponent's highest-producing hex (high number + settlement/city)
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat hexes to slow city development
- If opponent relies heavily on one resource, target that resource's hexes
- Never place the robber on your own high-production hexes
- When stealing, target resources you immediately need for your next build

VICTORY PATH PLANNING:
- Target resource independence with at least one settlement/city on each resource
- Minimum viable infrastructure: 3-4 settlements total, with 2-3 upgraded to cities
- Calculate multiple paths to 10 VP and pursue the fastest:
  Path 1: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP)
  Path 2: 4 cities (8 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP)
  Path 3: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 victory point card
- Always track your direct path to 10 VP and focus on those builds
- Prioritize visible points (settlements/cities) over speculative development cards
- Switch paths if the opponent blocks your primary victory path
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Accept trades only when they enable an immediate, crucial build
- Never make trades that allow opponent to build a settlement or city immediately
- Trade away excess resources when at risk for robber (7+ cards)
- Calculate the production value of each settlement location before deciding to build
- When trading with ports, plan sequences that convert unwanted resources into needed ones

DETAILED DECISION FRAMEWORK:
1. Does this move bring me closer to 10 victory points?
2. Does this move increase my production capacity more than alternative builds?
3. Does this move protect me from being blocked or cut off?
4. Does this move position me for strongest expansion in next 2-3 turns?
5. Is this the most efficient use of my current resources?

- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 41 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  Save Knight for defensive use when I have 7+ cards or when robber is placed on my productive hexes. Continue accumulating resources for expansion toward node 14. I need brick for my next road and settlement, so my priority is to get brick on future rolls or through trading.

# Game Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state:

## Current Resources
- 2 Wood 🌲
- 3 Wheat 🌾
- 1 Knight card
- 1 Victory Point card (hidden from opponent)

## Production Capabilities
- Settlement at node 2: produces Wheat (10) and Sheep (4)
- Settlement at node 12: produces Wood (8)
- I don't produce Brick 🧱 or Ore ⛏️, which limits my expansion options

## Victory Point Status
- I have 2 visible points from my 2 settlements
- I have 1 hidden point from my Victory Point development card
- So I'm actually at 3/10 points

## Options Analysis
I have two actions available:
1. [0] Play Knight card - Move the robber and steal a resource
2. [1] Roll the dice

### Option 0: Play Knight Card
- Benefits:
  - I would move the robber from the brick hex to one of RED's productive hexes
  - I could target RED's ore hex (6) which is highly productive (3 dots)
  - I could potentially steal a valuable resource from RED who has 6 cards
  - I would be one step closer to Largest Army (2 VP)

- Downsides:
  - I might need the Knight defensively later if the robber is placed on my productive hexes
  - Using it now doesn't enable any immediate build
  - RED might have resources I don't need

### Option 1: Roll Dice
- Benefits:
  - Potential to gain more resources based on my settlements
  - Keep the Knight card for defensive purposes or future optimal use
  - Let my current plan continue without change

- Downsides:
  - Risk of rolling a 7 and losing resources (though I only have 5 cards, so no risk)
  - The production from my current settlements may not give me what I need (brick)

## Strategic Decision
My current plan is to save the Knight for defensive use when I have 7+ cards or when the robber is placed on my productive hexes. I need to continue accumulating resources for expansion toward node 14, and I specifically need brick.

Playing the Knight right now would be an offensive move, but it doesn't align with my immediate needs. I should roll the dice first to see what resources I gain, and then reassess my options on future turns.

<plan>
Continue with current plan. Roll the dice to gain more resources. Save Knight for defensive use or when it can help secure Largest Army at a critical moment. Focus on acquiring brick through future rolls or trading to continue my expansion toward node 14. If I roll well and gain useful resources, work toward my third settlement.
</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist whose primary goal is to defeat the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (HIGHEST PRIORITY):
- Target 6 & 8 numbered hexes at all costs - these are the most productive numbers
- Prioritize ore and wheat hexes for your settlements - they enable cities and development cards
- Position yourself on at least one good brick and wood hex to enable early expansion
- Aim to cover ALL five resources with your two settlements combined
- Try to place on intersections with 3 productive hexes rather than 2
- Evaluate probability dots (not just numbers) - more dots mean more frequent production
- Place settlements with clear expansion paths that won't be easily blocked
- Avoid placing where you'll be immediately cut off by the opponent
- Position roads toward your next planned settlement location
- Consider distance to valuable ports (especially 2:1 ports matching your abundant resources)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-8):
- Build at least one new road and one new settlement ASAP
- Focus on securing access to any missing resources through expansion
- Establish access to a port if you're lacking a key resource
- Prevent the opponent from cutting off your expansion path
- Only purchase development cards if excess resources available or for immediate victory
- Expand toward high-value hexes the opponent doesn't yet control

MID-GAME RESOURCE MANAGEMENT (TURNS 9-20):
- Target 3 cities minimum (worth 6 VP) - upgrade most productive settlements first
- Maintain 1 road per every 2 settlements for flexible expansion
- Always build a settlement when you have the resources (more production points)
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each build (cities give best long-term return)
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1 or better) to maintain resource balance
- Keep at least one viable road-building path open at all times
- If blocked from expansion, shift to city upgrades and development cards

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Development cards should supplement your expansion, not replace it
- Prioritize using Knight cards to protect your best hexes from the robber
- Save Knights when you're ahead to counter the opponent's robber placements
- Only buy development cards when you:
  1. Have excess sheep/wheat/ore but lack wood/brick for expansion
  2. Are close to securing largest army
  3. Need a specific card type (Road Building to break through a blockade)
- Use Road Building cards to save brick/wood and create surprise expansion paths
- Time Monopoly cards to capture opponent's stockpile after high-producing rolls
- Use Year of Plenty to complete crucial builds when short on specific resources

# Game Analysis

Let me analyze my current position and available actions:

## Current Status
- I have 2 victory points from my 2 settlements
- I have 1 victory point development card (not played yet)
- I have 1 knight card
- Resources: 3 wood, 3 wheat
- I need brick to build more roads to expand

## Options Analysis
1. **Play Knight card**: This would allow me to move the robber from the brick hex (0, 1, -1) where it's currently located. This is significant because:
   - The brick hex is currently blocked by the robber
   - I need brick to continue my expansion toward node 14 as per my plan
   - I could steal a resource from RED who has 7 cards
   - This would be my first knight played, bringing me closer to largest army (need 3)

2. **End turn**: This would mean continuing to wait for rolls to hopefully get resources I need.
   - No immediate benefit
   - Leaves my knight card for future use
   - Doesn't address the blocked brick hex issue

## Decision Logic
Playing the knight card offers clear advantages:
- It unblocks the brick hex, which directly supports my expansion plan
- I can place the robber on one of RED's productive hexes (likely the ore 6 hex)
- I can steal a resource from RED which has many options to steal from
- I have plenty of wheat (3) so I won't miss the wheat production currently blocked

<plan>
Play the knight card now to unblock the brick hex (0, 1, -1) and place the robber on RED's ore hex (1, 0, -1). Then steal a resource from RED, hoping for brick or ore. Use future brick production to build roads toward node 14 and eventually place a third settlement. Save my victory point card until I'm close to winning.
</plan>

The optimal move is to play the knight card to unblock the brick hex, which aligns with my expansion strategy.

I need to decide where to place the robber now that I've played a knight card. This is an important tactical decision that can impact both my production and my opponent's.

## Current Game State Assessment
- I have 2 settlements: one on wheat/sheep and one on wood
- RED has 2 settlements with excellent production: 
  * Settlement at node 0: wheat(10), brick(5), ore(6) - very strong!
  * Settlement at node 4: wheat(10), wood(8), wheat(3)
- The robber is currently on the brick hex (0, 1, -1), which is hurting RED's production
- I have 3 wood and 3 wheat resources
- I'm trying to expand toward node 14 to build a third settlement

## Robber Placement Options Analysis

**Option 0**: Move to wheat hex (0, 0, 0) and steal from RED
- Blocks a 10-value wheat hex
- Impacts both RED and BLUE (my own production)
- BAD choice as it blocks my own wheat production

**Option 1**: Move to sheep hex (1, -1, 0)
- Blocks a 4-value sheep hex
- Doesn't impact either player directly
- Weak choice as it doesn't disrupt RED's production

**Option 2**: Move to desert hex (0, -1, 1)
- Desert produces nothing
- Completely ineffective move

**Option 3**: Move to wood hex (-1, 0, 1) and steal from RED
- Blocks an 8-value wood hex
- Impacts both RED and BLUE (my own production)
- BAD choice as it blocks my valuable 8-value wood production

**Option 4**: Move to wheat hex (-1, 1, 0) and steal from RED
- Blocks a 3-value wheat hex
- Impacts RED's settlement at node 4
- Low impact since it's only a 3-value hex

**Option 5**: Move to ore hex (1, 0, -1) and steal from RED
- Blocks a 6-value ore hex
- Impacts RED's settlement at node 0
- HIGH impact since:
  * Ore is crucial for city development
  * 6 is a high-probability number
  * RED's settlement at node 0 is very productive

<plan>
Move the robber to RED's ore hex (1, 0, -1) to block their 6-value ore production. This will significantly hinder their ability to build cities. I'll then steal a resource from RED, hoping for brick or ore. With my wood and wheat resources, I'll focus on building roads toward node 14 for my third settlement. I'll need to find ways to acquire brick and ore for future expansion through trading or future production.
</plan>

Looking at all options, placing the robber on RED's 6-value ore hex (Option 5) is clearly the strongest move:
- Blocks a high-probability resource (ore) that RED needs for cities
- Doesn't impact any of my own production
- Gives me a chance to steal a valuable resource from RED
- Continues to execute my strategic plan

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist whose primary goal is to defeat the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (HIGHEST PRIORITY):
- Target 6 & 8 numbered hexes at all costs - these are the most productive numbers
- Prioritize ore and wheat hexes for your settlements - they enable cities and development cards
- Position yourself on at least one good brick and wood hex to enable early expansion
- Aim to cover ALL five resources with your two settlements combined
- Try to place on intersections with 3 productive hexes rather than 2
- Evaluate probability dots (not just numbers) - more dots mean more frequent production
- Place settlements with clear expansion paths that won't be easily blocked
- Avoid placing where you'll be immediately cut off by the opponent
- Position roads toward your next planned settlement location
- Consider distance to valuable ports (especially 2:1 ports matching your abundant resources)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-8):
- Build at least one new road and one new settlement ASAP
- Focus on securing access to any missing resources through expansion
- Establish access to a port if you're lacking a key resource
- Prevent the opponent from cutting off your expansion path
- Only purchase development cards if excess resources available or for immediate victory
- Expand toward high-value hexes the opponent doesn't yet control

MID-GAME RESOURCE MANAGEMENT (TURNS 9-20):
- Target 3 cities minimum (worth 6 VP) - upgrade most productive settlements first
- Maintain 1 road per every 2 settlements for flexible expansion
- Always build a settlement when you have the resources (more production points)
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each build (cities give best long-term return)
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1 or better) to maintain resource balance
- Keep at least one viable road-building path open at all times
- If blocked from expansion, shift to city upgrades and development cards

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Development cards should supplement your expansion, not replace it
- Prioritize using Knight cards to protect your best hexes from the robber
- Save Knights when you're ahead to counter the opponent's robber placements
- Only buy development cards when you:
  1. Have excess sheep/wheat/ore but lack wood/brick for expansion
  2. Are close to securing largest army
  3. Need a specific card type (Road Building to break through a blockade)
- Use Road Building cards to save brick/wood and create surprise expansion paths
- Time Monopoly cards to capture opponent's stockpile after high-producing rolls
- Use Year of Plenty to complete crucial builds when short on specific resources

ROBBER PLACEMENT:
- Always target the opponent's highest-producing hex (high number + settlement/city)
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat hexes to slow city development
- If opponent relies heavily on one resource, target that resource's hexes
- Never place the robber on your own high-production hexes
- When stealing, target resources you immediately need for your next build

VICTORY PATH PLANNING:
- Target resource independence with at least one settlement/city on each resource
- Minimum viable infrastructure: 3-4 settlements total, with 2-3 upgraded to cities
- Calculate multiple paths to 10 VP and pursue the fastest:
  Path 1: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP)
  Path 2: 4 cities (8 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP)
  Path 3: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 victory point card
- Always track your direct path to 10 VP and focus on those builds
- Prioritize visible points (settlements/cities) over speculative development cards
- Switch paths if the opponent blocks your primary victory path
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Accept trades only when they enable an immediate, crucial build
- Never make trades that allow opponent to build a settlement or city immediately
- Trade away excess resources when at risk for robber (7+ cards)
- Calculate the production value of each settlement location before deciding to build
- When trading with ports, plan sequences that convert unwanted resources into needed ones

DETAILED DECISION FRAMEWORK:
1. Does this move bring me closer to 10 victory points?
2. Does this move increase my production capacity more than alternative builds?
3. Does this move protect me from being blocked or cut off?
4. Does this move position me for strongest expansion in next 2-3 turns?
5. Is this the most efficient use of my current resources?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 49 | Player: BLUE | Action: MOVE_ROBBER

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  Move the robber to RED's ore hex (1, 0, -1) to block their 6-value ore production. This will significantly hinder their ability to build cities. I'll then steal a resource from RED, hoping for brick or ore. With my wood and wheat resources, I'll focus on building roads toward node 14 for my third settlement. I'll need to find ways to acquire brick and ore for future expansion through trading or future production.

❓ Select action by number (0-5):


Based on this information, which action number do you choose? Think step by step about your options, then put the final action number in a box like \boxed{1}.
RESPONSE:
I need to carefully analyze where to place the robber for maximum strategic advantage.

First, let me understand what each option means:
- [0]: Move robber to wheat hex (0,0,0) with value 10 - RED has a city producing from this
- [1]: Move robber to desert hex (0,-1,1) - this produces nothing
- [2]: Move robber to wood hex (-1,0,1) with value 8 - RED has a settlement producing from this
- [3]: Move robber to wheat hex (-1,1,0) with value 3 - RED has a settlement producing from this
- [4]: Move robber to brick hex (0,1,-1) with value 5 - RED has a city producing from this
- [5]: Move robber to ore hex (1,0,-1) with value 6 - RED has a city producing from this

Strategic considerations:
1. RED's most valuable production comes from:
   - Ore (6) at their city - 3 dots, very valuable
   - Brick (5) at their city - 2 dots, moderately valuable
   - Wheat (10) at their city - 1 dot, less frequent but high value
   - Wood (8) at their settlement - 3 dots, very valuable

2. Blocking a city is more impactful than blocking a settlement due to doubled production.

3. Ore and wheat are critical resources for city development and development cards, which could be RED's path to victory.

4. Looking at my resources (2 wood, 2 wheat, 1 ore), I need brick to build roads and settlements to expand.

5. RED having access to ore (6) with a city is extremely powerful for city building.

Analyzing the best target:
- Option [5] blocks RED's ore production on a high-probability (6) hex where they have a city. Ore is vital for city upgrades, and this is likely their main ore source.
- Option [0] blocks RED's wheat production on a lower-probability (10) hex.
- Option [4] blocks RED's brick production on a medium-probability (5) hex.
- Option [2] blocks RED's wood production on a high-probability (8) hex.

This aligns with my current plan to block RED's ore hex. Blocking their ore will significantly slow down their city development, which is crucial since cities provide double resources and are worth 2 VP. When I steal from them, I'm hoping to get brick (which I need) or ore (to prevent them from having it).

<plan>I'll move the robber to RED's ore hex (1, 0, -1) to block their 6-value ore production from their city. This will significantly hinder their ability to build cities. After stealing, I'll focus on acquiring brick through trades or production to continue building roads toward node 14 for my next settlement.</plan>

# Game State Analysis

Let me analyze my current position and available actions:

**Victory Points:**
- I have 2 VP from settlements + 1 VP from a development card = 3 VP
- Red has 3 VP (1 settlement + 1 city)

**Resources:**
- I have 2 Wood, 1 Brick, 2 Wheat, 1 Ore
- Just enough to build a road (1 Wood, 1 Brick)

**Production:**
- My settlements produce Wood (good 8 value), Sheep (4 value), and Wheat (10 value)
- I lack guaranteed Brick and Ore production
- The robber is currently on Red's 6-value ore hex, which is good for me

**Available Options:**
I can either end my turn or build a road. Building a road would use my Wood and Brick, leaving me with 2 Wheat and 1 Ore.

**Expansion Opportunities:**
Let me evaluate each road option:
1. Edge (1, 2) - Moves toward node 1, which is adjacent to Red's city
2. Edge (3, 4) - Moves toward wheat and forest hexes
3. Edge (11, 12) - Connects to my settlement at node 12
4. Edge (2, 9) - Moves toward sheep production
5. Edge (3, 12) - Connects my two settlements
6. Edge (14, 15) - Continues my expansion from node 14 toward wheat/brick hexes

**Strategic Evaluation:**
Option #6 (road at edge 14-15) continues my expansion toward node 15, which is at the intersection of Wood (8), Wheat (3), and Brick (5) - giving me access to brick production which I currently lack. This is the most valuable expansion direction as it would give me access to all resources except ore.

<plan>
Build a road at edge (14, 15) to continue expansion toward node 15, which would give me access to brick production. Then focus on getting another settlement at node 15 (intersection of Wood 8, Wheat 3, and Brick 5). After that, I'll work on getting a city upgrade for one of my settlements.
</plan>

I should use my resources now rather than holding them and risking the robber on a roll of 7. Building this road advances my position and sets up my next settlement.

  1. Have excess sheep/wheat/ore but lack wood/brick for expansion
  2. Are close to securing largest army
  3. Need a specific card type (Road Building to break through a blockade)
- Use Road Building cards to save brick/wood and create surprise expansion paths
- Time Monopoly cards to capture opponent's stockpile after high-producing rolls
- Use Year of Plenty to complete crucial builds when short on specific resources

ROBBER PLACEMENT:
- Always target the opponent's highest-producing hex (high number + settlement/city)
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat hexes to slow city development
- If opponent relies heavily on one resource, target that resource's hexes
- Never place the robber on your own high-production hexes
- When stealing, target resources you immediately need for your next build

VICTORY PATH PLANNING:
- Target resource independence with at least one settlement/city on each resource
- Minimum viable infrastructure: 3-4 settlements total, with 2-3 upgraded to cities
- Calculate multiple paths to 10 VP and pursue the fastest:
  Path 1: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP)
  Path 2: 4 cities (8 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP)
  Path 3: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 victory point card
- Always track your direct path to 10 VP and focus on those builds
- Prioritize visible points (settlements/cities) over speculative development cards
- Switch paths if the opponent blocks your primary victory path
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Accept trades only when they enable an immediate, crucial build
- Never make trades that allow opponent to build a settlement or city immediately
- Trade away excess resources when at risk for robber (7+ cards)
- Calculate the production value of each settlement location before deciding to build
- When trading with ports, plan sequences that convert unwanted resources into needed ones

DETAILED DECISION FRAMEWORK:
1. Does this move bring me closer to 10 victory points?
2. Does this move increase my production capacity more than alternative builds?
3. Does this move protect me from being blocked or cut off?
4. Does this move position me for strongest expansion in next 2-3 turns?
5. Is this the most efficient use of my current resources?

TURN 57 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  Build a road at edge (14, 15) to continue expansion toward node 15, which would give me access to brick production. Then focus on getting another settlement at node 15 (intersection of Wood 8, Wheat 3, and Brick 5). After that, I'll work on getting a city upgrade for one of my settlements.

# Game Analysis - Turn 57

I'll carefully analyze my current game state and available actions to make the optimal decision.

## Current Game Situation
- I have 2 VP (2 settlements)
- I have 1 hidden Victory Point card (adds 1 VP)
- Resources: 2 Wood, 1 Sheep, 3 Wheat, 1 Ore
- Opponent has 5 VP (1 settlement, 1 city, longest road bonus)

## Available Actions
[0] End Turn
[1] Buy Development Card (costs: 1 Sheep, 1 Wheat, 1 Ore)

## Resource Assessment
My current resource collection (2 Wood, 1 Sheep, 3 Wheat, 1 Ore) is good, but I don't have enough resources to build any structures this turn:
- No brick for roads or settlements
- Need more ore for a city upgrade (need 3 ore total, have only 1)

## Strategic Considerations

1. **Development Card Option**:
   - Cost: 1 Sheep, 1 Wheat, 1 Ore
   - I have exactly these resources
   - Potential benefits:
     - Could get Knight (helps toward Largest Army)
     - Could get Victory Point card (hidden 1 VP)
     - Could get Road Building (saves resources)
     - Could get Year of Plenty or Monopoly (resource advantage)
   
2. **End Turn Option**:
   - I keep my resources for future builds
   - Risk of rolling a 7 and losing half my cards (I have 7 cards total)
   - Could potentially collect more resources on opponents' turns

3. **Current Plan Assessment**:
   My plan requires brick for road building, which I don't currently have. I can't make progress on my current plan this turn regardless of action.

## Decision Logic

Given that:
1. I have exactly 7 cards, which is the threshold for losing cards to the robber
2. I can't make progress on my planned build path without brick
3. A development card could provide immediate value or strategic options

The optimal choice is to buy a development card [1]:
- It reduces my hand size below 7 cards, protecting me from resource loss
- It could provide a Victory Point card, bringing me closer to winning
- It could provide a Knight, helping me work toward Largest Army
- It could provide utility cards that give me flexibility

<plan>
Buy a development card this turn to reduce hand size and gain strategic options. Continue working toward getting a road and settlement at node 15 when I acquire brick. Focus on city upgrades when additional ore is available. Watch for opportunities to break RED's longest road.
</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist whose primary goal is to defeat the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (HIGHEST PRIORITY):
- Target 6 & 8 numbered hexes at all costs - these are the most productive numbers
- Prioritize ore and wheat hexes for your settlements - they enable cities and development cards
- Position yourself on at least one good brick and wood hex to enable early expansion
- Aim to cover ALL five resources with your two settlements combined
- Try to place on intersections with 3 productive hexes rather than 2
- Evaluate probability dots (not just numbers) - more dots mean more frequent production
- Place settlements with clear expansion paths that won't be easily blocked
- Avoid placing where you'll be immediately cut off by the opponent
- Position roads toward your next planned settlement location
- Consider distance to valuable ports (especially 2:1 ports matching your abundant resources)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-8):
- Build at least one new road and one new settlement ASAP
- Focus on securing access to any missing resources through expansion
- Establish access to a port if you're lacking a key resource
- Prevent the opponent from cutting off your expansion path
- Only purchase development cards if excess resources available or for immediate victory
- Expand toward high-value hexes the opponent doesn't yet control

MID-GAME RESOURCE MANAGEMENT (TURNS 9-20):
- Target 3 cities minimum (worth 6 VP) - upgrade most productive settlements first
- Maintain 1 road per every 2 settlements for flexible expansion
- Always build a settlement when you have the resources (more production points)
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each build (cities give best long-term return)
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1 or better) to maintain resource balance
- Keep at least one viable road-building path open at all times
- If blocked from expansion, shift to city upgrades and development cards

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Development cards should supplement your expansion, not replace it
- Prioritize using Knight cards to protect your best hexes from the robber
- Save Knights when you're ahead to counter the opponent's robber placements
- Only buy development cards when you:
  1. Have excess sheep/wheat/ore but lack wood/brick for expansion
  2. Are close to securing largest army
  3. Need a specific card type (Road Building to break through a blockade)
- Use Road Building cards to save brick/wood and create surprise expansion paths
- Time Monopoly cards to capture opponent's stockpile after high-producing rolls
- Use Year of Plenty to complete crucial builds when short on specific resources

ROBBER PLACEMENT:
- Always target the opponent's highest-producing hex (high number + settlement/city)
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat hexes to slow city development
- If opponent relies heavily on one resource, target that resource's hexes
- Never place the robber on your own high-production hexes
- When stealing, target resources you immediately need for your next build

VICTORY PATH PLANNING:
- Target resource independence with at least one settlement/city on each resource
- Minimum viable infrastructure: 3-4 settlements total, with 2-3 upgraded to cities

  Path 1: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP)
  Path 2: 4 cities (8 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP)
  Path 3: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 victory point card
- Always track your direct path to 10 VP and focus on those builds
- Prioritize visible points (settlements/cities) over speculative development cards
- Switch paths if the opponent blocks your primary victory path
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Accept trades only when they enable an immediate, crucial build
- Never make trades that allow opponent to build a settlement or city immediately
- Trade away excess resources when at risk for robber (7+ cards)

# Game State Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state and my options carefully:

## Current Status
- I have 2 VP (2 settlements)
- RED has 5 VP (1 settlement, 1 city, longest road +2 VP)
- I have 2 wood, 2 wheat resources
- I have 1 MONOPOLY card and 1 VICTORY_POINT card (which means I actually have 3 VP)
- The robber is on ore hex (1, 0, -1), which might be blocking RED's city

## Resource Assessment
- I need brick to continue my road-building plan toward node 15
- RED has 2 hidden cards - unknown what they are
- Neither player has access to a port mentioned

## Action Options
I can either:
1. Play Monopoly card to collect a specific resource from opponents
2. Roll the dice to collect resources

## Monopoly Analysis
- If I use Monopoly, I should target a resource I need (brick) or one RED might have
- Brick would help me extend my road network
- Ore would help me upgrade to a city
- If RED has brick, using Monopoly for brick could both help me and hurt them

Let me evaluate each Monopoly option:
- Wood: I already have 2, likely not worth it
- Brick: Critical for my road-building plan, but no guarantee RED has any
- Sheep: Not immediately useful for my settlement/road plan
- Wheat: Already have 2, not worth it
- Ore: Valuable for city upgrades, but RED might not have any with robber on ore

Since I need to advance my position and cannot be certain what RED has, rolling the dice is likely the better option. It gives me a chance to naturally collect resources, particularly brick which I need for road building.

<plan>
Roll the dice to collect resources. If I get brick, build a road toward node 15. If I get ore and brick later, consider a settlement at node 15. Consider using the Monopoly card later when I can better predict what resources RED has accumulated or when I'm close to completing a critical build.
</plan>

The most strategic move at this point is to roll the dice.

# Game Analysis: Turn 59

I'll carefully analyze the current game state to determine the optimal action.

## Current Game State Assessment
- I (BLUE) have 2 VP from settlements, plus a hidden VP card = 3 total VP
- RED has 5 VP (3 from buildings + 2 from longest road)
- Resources: I have 2 wood, 3 wheat
- Development cards: 1 Monopoly card, 1 Victory Point card
- The robber is on RED's ore tile (1,0,-1)

## Resource Production Analysis
- My settlements produce: wood (8 - high value), wheat (10 - high value), sheep (4 - low value)
- I'm missing brick and ore production completely
- RED has a city producing ore, wheat, and brick, plus a settlement producing wood, wheat, and low-value wheat

## My Strategic Needs
1. I need brick to build roads and settlements
2. I need ore to build cities and development cards
3. RED likely has accumulated resources since I can see they have 5 hidden cards

## Monopoly Card Considerations
- Using Monopoly now could potentially give me needed resources
- The most valuable targets would be:
  - Brick: I need this for expansion and have none
  - Ore: I need this for city upgrades and have none
  - Wood: RED might have some, but I already have 2
  - Wheat: I already have 3, so less valuable to monopolize
  - Sheep: Not immediately useful for my plans

## Strategic Plan Evaluation
Looking at my current plan to build roads and expand to node 15, I need brick most immediately. RED has a city on a brick hex, so they likely have accumulated some brick. I don't have enough resources to build anything significant right now, so using the Monopoly card could give me what I need.

<plan>
1. Use Monopoly on brick to enable road building toward node 15
2. Build roads and expand to node 15 for increased production
3. Save my VP card until I'm close to winning
4. Focus on getting ore to upgrade settlements to cities
5. Work toward breaking RED's longest road by building more roads
</plan>

## Decision
The optimal play is to use my Monopoly card to take all brick from RED. This will enable me to build roads toward my expansion target at node 15, and potentially set me up for a settlement there if I roll well in future turns.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist whose primary goal is to defeat the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (HIGHEST PRIORITY):
- Target 6 & 8 numbered hexes at all costs - these are the most productive numbers
- Prioritize ore and wheat hexes for your settlements - they enable cities and development cards
- Position yourself on at least one good brick and wood hex to enable early expansion
- Aim to cover ALL five resources with your two settlements combined
- Try to place on intersections with 3 productive hexes rather than 2
- Evaluate probability dots (not just numbers) - more dots mean more frequent production
- Place settlements with clear expansion paths that won't be easily blocked
- Avoid placing where you'll be immediately cut off by the opponent
- Position roads toward your next planned settlement location
- Consider distance to valuable ports (especially 2:1 ports matching your abundant resources)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-8):
- Build at least one new road and one new settlement ASAP
- Focus on securing access to any missing resources through expansion
- Establish access to a port if you're lacking a key resource
- Prevent the opponent from cutting off your expansion path
- Only purchase development cards if excess resources available or for immediate victory
- Expand toward high-value hexes the opponent doesn't yet control

MID-GAME RESOURCE MANAGEMENT (TURNS 9-20):
- Target 3 cities minimum (worth 6 VP) - upgrade most productive settlements first
- Maintain 1 road per every 2 settlements for flexible expansion
- Always build a settlement when you have the resources (more production points)
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each build (cities give best long-term return)
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1 or better) to maintain resource balance
- Keep at least one viable road-building path open at all times
- If blocked from expansion, shift to city upgrades and development cards

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Development cards should supplement your expansion, not replace it
- Prioritize using Knight cards to protect your best hexes from the robber
- Save Knights when you're ahead to counter the opponent's robber placements
- Only buy development cards when you:
  1. Have excess sheep/wheat/ore but lack wood/brick for expansion
  2. Are close to securing largest army
  3. Need a specific card type (Road Building to break through a blockade)
- Use Road Building cards to save brick/wood and create surprise expansion paths
- Time Monopoly cards to capture opponent's stockpile after high-producing rolls
- Use Year of Plenty to complete crucial builds when short on specific resources

ROBBER PLACEMENT:
- Always target the opponent's highest-producing hex (high number + settlement/city)
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat hexes to slow city development
- If opponent relies heavily on one resource, target that resource's hexes
- Never place the robber on your own high-production hexes
- When stealing, target resources you immediately need for your next build

VICTORY PATH PLANNING:
- Target resource independence with at least one settlement/city on each resource
- Minimum viable infrastructure: 3-4 settlements total, with 2-3 upgraded to cities
- Calculate multiple paths to 10 VP and pursue the fastest:
  Path 1: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP)
  Path 2: 4 cities (8 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP)
  Path 3: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 victory point card
- Always track your direct path to 10 VP and focus on those builds
- Prioritize visible points (settlements/cities) over speculative development cards
- Switch paths if the opponent blocks your primary victory path
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Accept trades only when they enable an immediate, crucial build
- Never make trades that allow opponent to build a settlement or city immediately
- Trade away excess resources when at risk for robber (7+ cards)
- Calculate the production value of each settlement location before deciding to build
- When trading with ports, plan sequences that convert unwanted resources into needed ones

DETAILED DECISION FRAMEWORK:
1. Does this move bring me closer to 10 victory points?
2. Does this move increase my production capacity more than alternative builds?
3. Does this move protect me from being blocked or cut off?
4. Does this move position me for strongest expansion in next 2-3 turns?
5. Is this the most efficient use of my current resources?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 59 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Use Monopoly on brick to enable road building toward node 15
2. Build roads and expand to node 15 for increased production
3. Save my VP card until I'm close to winning
4. Focus on getting ore to upgrade settlements to cities
5. Work toward breaking RED's longest road by building more roads

# Game Analysis for Settlers of Catan

Let me think through the current game state and make the optimal decision as a Catan grandmaster.

## Current Situation
- I have 2 VP from my settlements and 1 hidden VP card = 3 VP total
- Resources: 2 wood, 1 brick, 3 wheat
- RED has 5 VP including longest road bonus
- The robber is on the ore hex, blocking production
- I have good wood production from the 8-value hex but limited access to other resources

## Available Actions
I can either end my turn or build one road with my 2 wood and 1 brick.

## Road Building Options Analysis
Let me evaluate each road option:

1. Road at edge (1, 2) - This seems to be heading toward RED's settlement and doesn't open much expansion
2. Road at edge (3, 4) - This connects toward RED's settlement at node 4, not ideal
3. Road at edge (15, 17) - This extends from my current road network toward new territory
4. Road at edge (11, 12) - This connects back to my settlement at node 12, creating a loop (not efficient)
5. Road at edge (2, 9) - This moves toward sheep production, potentially toward a port
6. Road at edge (3, 12) - This creates another connection between my two settlements (not needed)

## Strategic Considerations
1. I should build roads that lead to valuable future settlement locations
2. I need to improve my resource diversity through expansion
3. Building toward the ore hex might be valuable once the robber moves
4. I should work toward breaking RED's longest road

Looking at my options, road at edge (15, 17) seems most promising as it extends my reach toward new territory. Road at edge (2, 9) could be beneficial for sheep access and potential port access.

<plan>
1. Build roads to expand toward valuable new territory, prioritizing access to ore/brick
2. Target breaking RED's longest road by building more roads strategically
3. Save my VP card until close to winning
4. Aim to build a settlement at a good location with ore access when possible
5. Work toward city upgrades with ore/wheat once I secure those resources
</plan>

After analyzing the road options, I believe road at edge (15, 17) provides the best expansion path toward new territory while positioning me for future growth.

# Analyzing the Move Robber Options

Let me analyze each of the robber placement options carefully to determine the optimal move:

## Current Game State Assessment
- I'm significantly behind (2 VP vs 5 VP for RED)
- RED has longest road (9 segments)
- RED has a city at node 0 producing high-value resources:
  * 🌾10 (wheat)
  * 🧱5 (brick)
  * ⛏️6 (ore)
- RED also has a settlement at node 4 producing wheat, wood, and more wheat
- I have limited resources (3 wood, 1 sheep, 3 wheat)
- I'm missing ore and brick which are critical for expansion

## Robber Placement Options Analysis

[0] Move robber to (0, 0, 0) and steal from RED:
- This blocks the 🌾10 wheat hex
- Would disrupt both RED's city and settlement (both produce from this hex)
- High-value target (wheat is needed for settlements, cities, and development cards)

[1] Move robber to (1, -1, 0):
- This blocks the 🐑4 sheep hex
- Would disrupt my own settlement at node 2
- Lower strategic value since sheep is less critical

[2] Move robber to (0, -1, 1):
- This blocks the 🏜️ desert hex
- No production impact (desert doesn't produce)
- Completely wasted move

[3] Move robber to (-1, 0, 1) and steal from RED:
- This blocks the 🌲8 wood hex
- Affects both RED's settlement and my settlement
- High production value (8 is a frequent roll)
- But would hurt my own wood production which I need

[4] Move robber to (-1, 1, 0) and steal from RED:
- This blocks the 🌾3 wheat hex
- Only affects RED's settlement at node 4
- Low production value (3 is infrequent)

[5] Move robber to (0, 1, -1) and steal from RED:
- This blocks the 🧱5 brick hex
- Affects RED's city at node 0
- Good production value (5 is moderately frequent)
- Blocks a resource I don't currently have access to, but need

## Strategic Decision

Looking at RED's city at node 0, it's producing from three valuable hexes: wheat (10), brick (5), and ore (6). This is an extremely strong production point. The best strategic move would be to block one of these high-value resources.

Since RED needs brick to extend their road network (already at 9 segments), blocking their brick production at (0, 1, -1) would be highly effective in slowing down their expansion. Additionally, ore (6) is currently blocked by the robber at (1, 0, -1), so if I move the robber, RED would regain access to ore, which enables city building.

Therefore, I need to choose between blocking wheat (10) or brick (5). Given that RED needs brick to expand their road network further, and I could potentially steal a brick from them:

<plan>
1. Block RED's brick production to slow their road expansion
2. Focus on building roads toward hexes with ore/brick resources
3. Work toward breaking RED's longest road by building more roads strategically
4. Save my VP card until close to winning
5. Build a settlement at a good location with ore access when possible
</plan>

Based on this analysis, I'll move the robber to the brick hex at (0, 1, -1) and steal from RED.

- Establish access to a port if you're lacking a key resource
- Prevent the opponent from cutting off your expansion path
- Only purchase development cards if excess resources available or for immediate victory
- Expand toward high-value hexes the opponent doesn't yet control

MID-GAME RESOURCE MANAGEMENT (TURNS 9-20):
- Target 3 cities minimum (worth 6 VP) - upgrade most productive settlements first
- Maintain 1 road per every 2 settlements for flexible expansion
- Always build a settlement when you have the resources (more production points)
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each build (cities give best long-term return)
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1 or better) to maintain resource balance
- Keep at least one viable road-building path open at all times
- If blocked from expansion, shift to city upgrades and development cards

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Development cards should supplement your expansion, not replace it
- Prioritize using Knight cards to protect your best hexes from the robber
- Save Knights when you're ahead to counter the opponent's robber placements
- Only buy development cards when you:
  1. Have excess sheep/wheat/ore but lack wood/brick for expansion
  2. Are close to securing largest army
  3. Need a specific card type (Road Building to break through a blockade)
- Use Road Building cards to save brick/wood and create surprise expansion paths
- Time Monopoly cards to capture opponent's stockpile after high-producing rolls
- Use Year of Plenty to complete crucial builds when short on specific resources

ROBBER PLACEMENT:
- Always target the opponent's highest-producing hex (high number + settlement/city)
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat hexes to slow city development
- If opponent relies heavily on one resource, target that resource's hexes
- Never place the robber on your own high-production hexes
- When stealing, target resources you immediately need for your next build

VICTORY PATH PLANNING:
- Target resource independence with at least one settlement/city on each resource
- Minimum viable infrastructure: 3-4 settlements total, with 2-3 upgraded to cities
- Calculate multiple paths to 10 VP and pursue the fastest:
  Path 1: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP)
  Path 2: 4 cities (8 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP)
  Path 3: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 victory point card
- Always track your direct path to 10 VP and focus on those builds
- Prioritize visible points (settlements/cities) over speculative development cards
- Switch paths if the opponent blocks your primary victory path
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Accept trades only when they enable an immediate, crucial build
- Never make trades that allow opponent to build a settlement or city immediately
- Trade away excess resources when at risk for robber (7+ cards)
- Calculate the production value of each settlement location before deciding to build
- When trading with ports, plan sequences that convert unwanted resources into needed ones

DETAILED DECISION FRAMEWORK:
1. Does this move bring me closer to 10 victory points?
2. Does this move increase my production capacity more than alternative builds?
3. Does this move protect me from being blocked or cut off?
4. Does this move position me for strongest expansion in next 2-3 turns?
5. Is this the most efficient use of my current resources?

# Game Analysis for Turn 71

I'll analyze the current game state to determine the best action:

## Current Resources
- 3 🌲 Wood
- 1 🐑 Sheep
- 4 🌾 Wheat
- 0 ⛏️ Ore
- 0 🧱 Brick

## Victory Point Status
- RED: 5 VP (3 from settlements/cities + 2 from longest road)
- BLUE (me): 2 VP (2 from settlements + 1 hidden VP card)

## Key Observations
1. RED has the longest road (9 segments) giving them 2 VP
2. I lack brick and ore, which are critical for expansion
3. The robber is currently on the brick hex (0,1,-1), blocking brick production
4. I have excess wheat (4) that I could trade at a port for needed resources

## Strategic Options
1. **End turn without action**: Conserve resources and wait for better opportunities
2. **Trade for ore**: Could help toward city upgrading or development cards
3. **Trade for brick**: Would enable road building to continue expansion
4. **Trade for sheep**: Not highly valuable right now with my current resources
5. **Trade for wood**: Already have 3 wood, so not a priority

## Decision Analysis
I need to catch up to RED who has 5 VP to my 2 (3 including hidden VP). My highest priorities are:
1. Breaking RED's longest road or building my own
2. Expanding with new settlements
3. Upgrading to cities

For these goals, I need brick most urgently to build roads and settlements. While ore is important for cities and development cards, my immediate need is expansion to counter RED's position.

With 4 wheat, I can trade at 4:1 for a brick, which would give me 3 wood and 1 brick - not enough for a settlement but enough for a road. This would progress my expansion plan and potentially position me to break RED's longest road in future turns.

<plan>
1. Trade for brick to continue road expansion
2. Focus on building toward breaking RED's longest road
3. Continue targeting strategic settlement locations with ore access
4. Save VP card until close to winning
5. Work toward city upgrades once basic expansion is secured
</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist whose primary goal is to defeat the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (HIGHEST PRIORITY):
- Target 6 & 8 numbered hexes at all costs - these are the most productive numbers
- Prioritize ore and wheat hexes for your settlements - they enable cities and development cards
- Position yourself on at least one good brick and wood hex to enable early expansion
- Aim to cover ALL five resources with your two settlements combined
- Try to place on intersections with 3 productive hexes rather than 2
- Evaluate probability dots (not just numbers) - more dots mean more frequent production
- Place settlements with clear expansion paths that won't be easily blocked
- Avoid placing where you'll be immediately cut off by the opponent
- Position roads toward your next planned settlement location
- Consider distance to valuable ports (especially 2:1 ports matching your abundant resources)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-8):
- Build at least one new road and one new settlement ASAP
- Focus on securing access to any missing resources through expansion
- Establish access to a port if you're lacking a key resource
- Prevent the opponent from cutting off your expansion path
- Only purchase development cards if excess resources available or for immediate victory
- Expand toward high-value hexes the opponent doesn't yet control

- Only buy development cards when you:
  1. Have excess sheep/wheat/ore but lack wood/brick for expansion
  2. Are close to securing largest army
  3. Need a specific card type (Road Building to break through a blockade)
- Use Road Building cards to save brick/wood and create surprise expansion paths

# Game Analysis for Settlers of Catan

I'll analyze the current game state and available options to determine the best strategic move:

## Game State Assessment
- I'm at 2/10 victory points (plus 1 hidden VP from development card = 3/10)
- RED is ahead with 5/10 points (including 2 VP from longest road)
- I have 3 wood, 1 brick, 1 sheep resources
- I have roads and settlements, but am trailing RED significantly

## Road Building Options Analysis
I need to choose from 5 possible road placements:
1. Edge (1, 2) - This would build toward my settlement at node 2
2. Edge (3, 4) - This connects toward RED's settlement
3. Edge (11, 12) - This builds from my settlement at node 12
4. Edge (2, 9) - This extends from my settlement at node 2
5. Edge (3, 12) - This would connect my two settlements

Looking at the board connectivity, I need to evaluate which road:
- Creates the best expansion opportunities
- Could potentially challenge RED's longest road (currently 9 segments)
- Gives access to new resource types

## Strategic Considerations
1. I need to expand my production capacity urgently
2. Breaking RED's longest road would remove 2 VP from them
3. I need to secure access to brick and ore for further development
4. I should build toward high-value (6/8) hexes when possible

Looking at the options, edge (11, 12) from my settlement at node 12 seems most promising as it:
- Builds from my settlement that's on a valuable 8-value wood hex
- Could potentially expand my road network toward new settlements
- Will help me eventually build a longer road network

<plan>
1. Build roads strategically to expand toward new settlement locations
2. Focus on breaking RED's longest road to reduce their VP count
3. Secure access to ore and brick resources through new settlements
4. Save VP card until I'm close to winning
5. Work on city upgrades once my production base is secure
</plan>

Based on my analysis, I choose to build a road at edge (11, 12) to expand from my settlement on the valuable wood hex.

# Game State Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state and my available options:

## My Position
- I have 2 VP from my 2 settlements
- I have 1 VP from a development card (hidden)
- I have 4 wood, 1 sheep, 1 wheat, but no brick or ore
- I need 7 more VP to win (currently at 3 VP total including my VP card)

## Opponent's Position
- RED has 5 VP (3 from buildings + 2 from longest road)
- RED has 6 hidden cards
- RED has a strong position with a city on a valuable hex (produces ore on 6)

## Resource Analysis
- I have good wood production (8 on one of my settlements)
- I lack brick and ore production entirely
- My settlements are on nodes 2 and 12, producing wood, wheat, and sheep

## Available Actions
I can either end my turn or trade 4 wood for another resource using the 4:1 port trade.

## Decision Process
1. First, I need to consider if I should use my excess wood to acquire a needed resource
2. To build a road: I need 1 wood + 1 brick
3. To build a settlement: I need 1 wood + 1 brick + 1 wheat + 1 sheep
4. To build a city: I need 2 wheat + 3 ore
5. To buy a development card: I need 1 wheat + 1 sheep + 1 ore

Looking at my current resources (4 wood, 1 sheep, 1 wheat), trading 4 wood for 1 brick would allow me to build a road. However, I need to consider if this is the best use of my resources.

Given that:
- I already have 6 roads built (enough for expansion)
- Building another road alone doesn't get me closer to VP
- I'm severely lacking ore and brick production
- I need to expand to get access to missing resources

<plan>
1. Focus on acquiring brick to build roads toward new settlement locations
2. Target locations that give me access to ore and/or brick
3. Work on breaking RED's longest road by strategically placing settlements
4. Save my VP card until I'm close to winning
5. Consider upgrading to cities once I have secured ore production
</plan>

Since I have excess wood and need brick to expand, the best action is to trade for brick:

PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist whose primary goal is to defeat the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (HIGHEST PRIORITY):
- Target 6 & 8 numbered hexes at all costs - these are the most productive numbers
- Prioritize ore and wheat hexes for your settlements - they enable cities and development cards
- Position yourself on at least one good brick and wood hex to enable early expansion
- Aim to cover ALL five resources with your two settlements combined
- Try to place on intersections with 3 productive hexes rather than 2
- Evaluate probability dots (not just numbers) - more dots mean more frequent production
- Place settlements with clear expansion paths that won't be easily blocked
- Avoid placing where you'll be immediately cut off by the opponent
- Position roads toward your next planned settlement location
- Consider distance to valuable ports (especially 2:1 ports matching your abundant resources)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-8):
- Build at least one new road and one new settlement ASAP
- Focus on securing access to any missing resources through expansion
- Establish access to a port if you're lacking a key resource
- Prevent the opponent from cutting off your expansion path
- Only purchase development cards if excess resources available or for immediate victory
- Expand toward high-value hexes the opponent doesn't yet control

MID-GAME RESOURCE MANAGEMENT (TURNS 9-20):
- Target 3 cities minimum (worth 6 VP) - upgrade most productive settlements first
- Maintain 1 road per every 2 settlements for flexible expansion
- Always build a settlement when you have the resources (more production points)
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each build (cities give best long-term return)
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1 or better) to maintain resource balance
- Keep at least one viable road-building path open at all times
- If blocked from expansion, shift to city upgrades and development cards

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Development cards should supplement your expansion, not replace it
- Prioritize using Knight cards to protect your best hexes from the robber
- Save Knights when you're ahead to counter the opponent's robber placements
- Only buy development cards when you:
  1. Have excess sheep/wheat/ore but lack wood/brick for expansion
  2. Are close to securing largest army
  3. Need a specific card type (Road Building to break through a blockade)
- Use Road Building cards to save brick/wood and create surprise expansion paths
- Time Monopoly cards to capture opponent's stockpile after high-producing rolls
- Use Year of Plenty to complete crucial builds when short on specific resources

ROBBER PLACEMENT:
- Always target the opponent's highest-producing hex (high number + settlement/city)
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat hexes to slow city development
- If opponent relies heavily on one resource, target that resource's hexes
- Never place the robber on your own high-production hexes
- When stealing, target resources you immediately need for your next build

VICTORY PATH PLANNING:
- Target resource independence with at least one settlement/city on each resource
- Minimum viable infrastructure: 3-4 settlements total, with 2-3 upgraded to cities
- Calculate multiple paths to 10 VP and pursue the fastest:
  Path 1: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP)
  Path 2: 4 cities (8 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP)
  Path 3: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 victory point card
- Always track your direct path to 10 VP and focus on those builds
- Prioritize visible points (settlements/cities) over speculative development cards
- Switch paths if the opponent blocks your primary victory path
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Accept trades only when they enable an immediate, crucial build
- Never make trades that allow opponent to build a settlement or city immediately
- Trade away excess resources when at risk for robber (7+ cards)
- Calculate the production value of each settlement location before deciding to build
- When trading with ports, plan sequences that convert unwanted resources into needed ones

DETAILED DECISION FRAMEWORK:
1. Does this move bring me closer to 10 victory points?
2. Does this move increase my production capacity more than alternative builds?
3. Does this move protect me from being blocked or cut off?
4. Does this move position me for strongest expansion in next 2-3 turns?
5. Is this the most efficient use of my current resources?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game State Analysis

Let me analyze my current position and the available options:

## Current Resources
- 1 BRICK
- 3 SHEEP
- 4 WHEAT
- 1 VICTORY_POINT card (hidden)

## Victory Points
- Me (BLUE): 2 VP (settlements) + 1 VP (hidden card) = 3 VP
- RED: 7 VP (1 settlement + 2 cities + longest road)

## Production Capacity
- My settlements produce wheat, sheep, and wood (on 10, 4, and 8)
- I'm completely lacking ORE production
- My BRICK production is limited (no brick hexes connected to my settlements)

## Available Actions
- End turn
- Maritime trade options to convert 4 wheat into another resource

## Strategic Assessment

I'm in a challenging position with RED significantly ahead (7 VP vs my 3 VP). I need to increase my production capacity and find a path to victory. Looking at my current resources, I have 1 BRICK, 3 SHEEP, and 4 WHEAT. To build a settlement, I need BRICK + WOOD + SHEEP + WHEAT, so I'm only missing WOOD.

The priority is to continue expanding my settlement network to increase production. Looking at the options, I should trade my excess WHEAT for WOOD, which would give me the resources needed for a road (WOOD + BRICK).

<plan>
1. Trade 4 WHEAT for 1 WOOD
2. Build roads toward promising settlement locations that provide ore or brick
3. Focus on breaking RED's longest road by placing settlements strategically
4. Look for settlement locations near ore to enable city upgrades
5. Save VP card until I'm close to winning
</plan>

The most strategic move right now is to trade 4 WHEAT for 1 WOOD (option 4), which would allow me to build a road on my next turn and continue my expansion.

# Game Analysis

Let me analyze my current situation and the game state:

## Current Resources:
- 1 Wood
- 1 Brick
- 3 Sheep
- 0 Wheat
- 0 Ore

## Victory Point Status:
- Me (Blue): 2 VP from settlements + 1 hidden VP card = 3 VP
- Red: 7 VP (2 cities = 4 VP, 1 settlement = 1 VP, longest road = 2 VP)

## Production Capability:
- I have settlements on node 2 (wheat 10, sheep 4) and node 12 (wood 8)
- My production is limited, especially for ore (none) and brick (none)
- The robber is currently on desert, not affecting anyone's production

## Available Actions:
All my available actions are to build roads (requiring wood and brick) or end my turn. I have exactly enough resources to build one road.

## Strategic Considerations:

1. Road building options:
   - Edge (1, 2): Expands toward nodes with access to ore (essential for cities)
   - Edge (10, 11): Expands toward different area, but less strategic value
   - Edge (3, 4): Connects toward Red's territory
   - Edge (2, 9): Expands toward sheep hexes
   - Edge (3, 12): Would create a redundant road

2. Resource management:
   - I have limited production capabilities
   - No access to ore, which is crucial for city upgrades
   - Only one productive wood hex (8) and no brick sources

3. Long-term goals:
   - Need to establish settlements with better resource diversity
   - Need to break Red's longest road (10 segments) by placing settlements strategically
   - Should aim for ore access to build cities

Looking at all five road options, the most strategic choice would be edge (1, 2), as it brings me closer to node 1 which connects to an ore hex (hex 1,0,-1). This would give me access to the ore resource I currently lack.

<plan>
1. Build road at edge (1,2) to expand toward ore resource
2. Focus next on acquiring wood and brick for more expansion
3. Continue expanding toward ore (hex 1,0,-1) and aim to place a settlement at node 1
4. Save VP card until I'm closer to winning
5. Consider development card purchases if I get excess sheep/wheat/ore
</plan>

Based on this analysis, I should use my wood and brick to build a road at edge (1, 2).

- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1 or better) to maintain resource balance
- Keep at least one viable road-building path open at all times
- If blocked from expansion, shift to city upgrades and development cards

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Development cards should supplement your expansion, not replace it
- Prioritize using Knight cards to protect your best hexes from the robber
- Save Knights when you're ahead to counter the opponent's robber placements
- Only buy development cards when you:
  1. Have excess sheep/wheat/ore but lack wood/brick for expansion
  2. Are close to securing largest army
  3. Need a specific card type (Road Building to break through a blockade)
- Use Road Building cards to save brick/wood and create surprise expansion paths
- Time Monopoly cards to capture opponent's stockpile after high-producing rolls
- Use Year of Plenty to complete crucial builds when short on specific resources

ROBBER PLACEMENT:
- Always target the opponent's highest-producing hex (high number + settlement/city)
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat hexes to slow city development
- If opponent relies heavily on one resource, target that resource's hexes
- Never place the robber on your own high-production hexes
- When stealing, target resources you immediately need for your next build

VICTORY PATH PLANNING:
- Target resource independence with at least one settlement/city on each resource
- Minimum viable infrastructure: 3-4 settlements total, with 2-3 upgraded to cities
- Calculate multiple paths to 10 VP and pursue the fastest:
  Path 1: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP)
  Path 2: 4 cities (8 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP)
  Path 3: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 victory point card
- Always track your direct path to 10 VP and focus on those builds
- Prioritize visible points (settlements/cities) over speculative development cards
- Switch paths if the opponent blocks your primary victory path
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Accept trades only when they enable an immediate, crucial build
- Never make trades that allow opponent to build a settlement or city immediately
- Trade away excess resources when at risk for robber (7+ cards)
- Calculate the production value of each settlement location before deciding to build
- When trading with ports, plan sequences that convert unwanted resources into needed ones

DETAILED DECISION FRAMEWORK:
1. Does this move bring me closer to 10 victory points?
2. Does this move increase my production capacity more than alternative builds?
3. Does this move protect me from being blocked or cut off?
4. Does this move position me for strongest expansion in next 2-3 turns?
5. Is this the most efficient use of my current resources?

Board Understanding Guide:

- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 101 | Player: BLUE | Action: MOVE_ROBBER

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Build road at edge (1,2) to expand toward ore resource
2. Focus next on acquiring wood and brick for more expansion
3. Continue expanding toward ore (hex 1,0,-1) and aim to place a settlement at node 1
4. Save VP card until I'm closer to winning
5. Consider development card purchases if I get excess sheep/wheat/ore

# Robber Placement Analysis

Let me analyze the game state and choose the optimal robber placement to maximize my chances of winning against the RED player.

## Game State Assessment
- RED has 8/10 VP (already has Longest Road +2 VP)
- I (BLUE) have 2/10 VP plus a hidden Victory Point card (so actually 3/10 VP)
- RED has 4 hidden resources while I have 2 sheep and 1 wheat
- RED is far ahead with 2 cities and 2 settlements versus my 2 settlements
- The robber is currently on the sheep hex (1, -1, 0)

## RED Player's Production
For optimal robber placement, I need to identify RED's highest producing hexes:
- City at node 0: produces ore (6★★★), brick (5★★), wheat (10★)
- City at node 4: produces wheat (10★), wood (8★★★), wheat (3★)
- Settlement at node 6: produces sheep (4★), ore (6★★★)
- Settlement at node 16: produces wheat (3★), brick (5★★)

RED's most valuable hexes are:
1. Ore 6 (★★★) - connected to 2 of RED's buildings
2. Wood 8 (★★★) - connected to 1 city
3. Wheat 10 (★) - connected to 2 cities
4. Brick 5 (★★) - connected to 2 buildings

## My Production
- Settlement at node 2: produces wheat (10★), sheep (4★)
- Settlement at node 12: produces wood (8★★★)

## Best Robber Placement Options

Option 5: Move robber to (1, 0, -1) - ORE 6
- Blocks RED's highest value production (ore 6★★★) which is connected to 2 of RED's buildings
- Ore is crucial for city building and development cards
- This also blocks my access to ore in the future, but I don't have a settlement there yet
- I can steal from RED who might have ore saved up

Option 2: Move robber to (-1, 0, 1) - WOOD 8
- Blocks wood 8★★★ from RED's city
- Unfortunately, this would also block my own settlement at node 12, so this is not optimal

Option 0: Move robber to (0, 0, 0) - WHEAT 10
- Blocks wheat 10★ from two of RED's cities
- Also blocks my settlement at node 2, so not optimal

Option 4: Move robber to (0, 1, -1) - BRICK 5
- Blocks brick 5★★ from two of RED's buildings
- Brick is needed for roads and settlements, but less valuable than ore

<plan>
1. Target ore 6 hex with robber to slow RED's city development
2. Continue with previous plan to build road at edge (1,2) to expand toward ore resource
3. Focus on gathering wood and brick for expansion
4. Continue expanding toward ore (hex 1,0,-1) and aim to place a settlement at node 1
5. Save VP card until I'm closer to winning
</plan>

Looking at all options, blocking the ore 6 hex is clearly the best choice as it:
1. Disrupts RED's highest value production
2. Targets a resource critical for city building
3. Doesn't hurt my own production
4. Gives me a chance to steal a potentially valuable resource

Therefore, I choose option 5.

PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist whose primary goal is to defeat the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (HIGHEST PRIORITY):
- Target 6 & 8 numbered hexes at all costs - these are the most productive numbers
- Prioritize ore and wheat hexes for your settlements - they enable cities and development cards
- Position yourself on at least one good brick and wood hex to enable early expansion
- Aim to cover ALL five resources with your two settlements combined
- Try to place on intersections with 3 productive hexes rather than 2
- Evaluate probability dots (not just numbers) - more dots mean more frequent production
- Place settlements with clear expansion paths that won't be easily blocked
- Avoid placing where you'll be immediately cut off by the opponent
- Position roads toward your next planned settlement location
- Consider distance to valuable ports (especially 2:1 ports matching your abundant resources)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-8):
- Build at least one new road and one new settlement ASAP
- Focus on securing access to any missing resources through expansion
- Establish access to a port if you're lacking a key resource
- Prevent the opponent from cutting off your expansion path
- Only purchase development cards if excess resources available or for immediate victory
- Expand toward high-value hexes the opponent doesn't yet control

MID-GAME RESOURCE MANAGEMENT (TURNS 9-20):
- Target 3 cities minimum (worth 6 VP) - upgrade most productive settlements first
- Maintain 1 road per every 2 settlements for flexible expansion
- Always build a settlement when you have the resources (more production points)
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each build (cities give best long-term return)
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1 or better) to maintain resource balance

# Game Analysis: Robber Placement Decision

First, let me analyze the current game state:

- RED has 9 VP and is one point away from winning (3 cities + 1 settlement + longest road)
- I have only 2 VP (2 settlements) plus 1 hidden VP card
- RED appears to have a significant advantage in resource production with 3 cities
- I need to slow RED's progress as much as possible while improving my position

## Robber Placement Options Analysis

Let me evaluate each option:

**[0] Move robber to (0, 0, 0) and steal from RED**
- This blocks a wheat hex with value 10 (high production)
- Affects both RED and me (my settlement at node 2)
- RED has city at node 0 and 4, both producing from this hex
- Pros: Blocks a valuable resource for RED
- Cons: Also blocks my own wheat production

**[1] Move robber to (0, -1, 1)**
- This is the desert hex which produces nothing
- Pointless move as it doesn't block any production

**[2] Move robber to (-1, 0, 1) and steal from RED**
- This blocks a wood hex with value 8 (high production)
- Affects RED's city at node 4 and my settlement at node 12
- Pros: Blocks high-value wood 
- Cons: Blocks my own wood production, which I need for expansion

**[3] Move robber to (-1, 1, 0) and steal from RED**
- This blocks a wheat hex with value 3 (low production)
- Affects RED's city at node 4 and 16
- Low impact as 3 is a rare roll

**[4] Move robber to (0, 1, -1) and steal from RED**
- This blocks a brick hex with value 5 (moderate production)
- Affects RED's cities at node 0 and 16
- Good target as brick helps with road building

**[5] Move robber to (1, 0, -1) and steal from RED**
- This blocks an ore hex with value 6 (high production)
- Affects RED's city at node 0 and settlement at node 6
- Ore is critical for city upgrades
- One of RED's most valuable resources with 6 dots (⭐⭐⭐) on two settlements

## Decision Making

RED is at 9 VP and needs just one more point to win. To prevent their victory, I need to:
1. Block their most valuable resources
2. Target resources they need to complete their winning move
3. Steal a useful resource for myself

Looking at RED's buildings, they have strong production on:
- Ore 6 (⭐⭐⭐) at both node 0 and 6
- Brick 5 (⭐⭐) at nodes 0 and 16
- Wood 8 (⭐⭐⭐) at node 4

Since RED already has 3 cities and 1 settlement, they might be working toward:
- Another settlement (needs brick, wood, sheep, wheat)
- Development cards (needs ore, sheep, wheat) for potential VP card or Knights

Option [5] targeting the ore hex would:
- Block their high-value ore production (6 dots)
- Potentially slow their purchase of development cards
- Allow me to steal a resource from RED
- Align with my previous plan to target the ore hex

<plan>
1. Place robber on ore hex (1,0,-1) to block RED's ore production
2. Continue road building at edge (1,2) to expand toward ore resource
3. Focus on gathering wood and brick for expansion
4. Place settlement at node 1 to access ore hex when robber moves
5. Save VP card until I have at least 7-8 points
</plan>

# Game Analysis and Decision Making

Let me carefully analyze the current game state and available options:

## Current Game State Assessment
- RED is at 9/10 VP with longest road (likely to win on next turn)
- I (BLUE) have only 2/10 VP plus a hidden victory point card (3/10 total)
- Resources in hand: 1 🌲WOOD, 1 🧱BRICK, 2 🌾WHEAT
- Available actions: End Turn or Build one of 4 possible roads

## Strategic Situation
The situation is extremely dire. RED is one point away from victory and likely has resources to build on their next turn. I'm far behind with only 3 VP total (counting my hidden VP card).

## Road Building Analysis
I can build exactly one road with my current resources (1 wood, 1 brick). Let me analyze each road option:

1. **Edge (3, 12)** - This appears to extend toward a potential settlement location that might provide access to more resources.
2. **Edge (2, 9)** - This seems to build toward a potential settlement location near the sheep hex.
3. **Edge (10, 11)** - This road's strategic value is unclear without seeing more of the board connectivity.
4. **Edge (3, 4)** - This connects toward node 4, which is already occupied by RED's city.

Since RED is at 9/10 VP and has longest road, my best move would be to potentially break their longest road if possible, but none of these roads seem positioned to do that. 

## Plan Revision
<plan>
1. Build a road to position for potential settlements and resource access
2. Focus on gathering more resources for rapid development
3. Look for opportunities to break RED's longest road in coming turns
4. Aim to reach settlement locations that give access to ore
5. Continue development card strategy if resources allow
</plan>

## Final Decision
Since RED is almost certain to win on their next turn, I need to make the most strategic road placement to set up for future growth if the game somehow continues. Based on the information available, edge (3, 12) appears to be the best option as it likely extends toward a potential settlement location.
