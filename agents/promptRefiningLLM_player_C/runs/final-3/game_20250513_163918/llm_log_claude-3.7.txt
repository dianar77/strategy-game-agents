PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist focused on defeating the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRITICAL FOR SUCCESS):
- Above all else, target the highest probability numbers (6 & 8) - these produce resources 5/36 times each
- Strictly prioritize access to all five resources between your two settlements
- Aim for numerical diversity - try to cover 5-6 different dice numbers across your settlements
- Never place initial settlements without analyzing future expansion opportunities
- Prioritize placement on hexes with complementary resources: ore/wheat and brick/wood
- Position roads toward high-value unoccupied areas the opponent cannot easily block
- Choose second settlement to complement your first settlement's resource weaknesses
- Consider 3:1 ports if you can't access a specific resource through settlements
- Analyze opponent placement to avoid contested expansion paths
- ALWAYS calculate production value using probability dots (5-6-8-9 are top priority numbers)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-10):
- Build at least one new settlement by turn 10 - expansion is your TOP priority
- Calculate and build along the fastest path to your next settlement location
- Secure missing resources through strategic settlement placement
- Build roads that secure critical expansion paths before the opponent blocks them
- Avoid development cards completely until you have at least 3 total settlements
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1) to complete critical builds
- Target resource diversity through your expansion locations
- Create a minimum 2-turn expansion plan and stick to it

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT AND PRODUCTION (CORE STRATEGY):
- Early game: Focus on wood/brick to expand with roads and settlements
- Mid game: Transition to ore/wheat focus for cities and development cards
- Calculate the resource production value of every potential build
- Only make 4:1 trades when they enable an immediate important build
- Cycle through "build phases" - expansion phase, then city upgrade phase
- Plan resource collection 2 turns ahead to minimize wasteful trades
- Never accumulate 7+ cards before dice rolls
- Diversify production to minimize dependency on any single resource
- Target a minimum of 4 total settlements before prioritizing city upgrades

COUNTERING ALPHABETA ALGORITHM:
- AlphaBeta looks ahead only 2 steps, so plan your moves 3-4 steps ahead
- Create deceptive game states that appear less threatening than they are
- Block the opponent's highest-probability expansion paths immediately
- Play defensively during early game, then aggressively in mid-game
- When opponent has 7+ points, disrupt their highest-producing hex with the robber
- Track opponent's resources and block their most likely next build
- Secure resources that the opponent depends on heavily
- Place roads to cut off opponent from accessing high-value settlement locations
- Position settlements to deny opponent access to key resource hex intersections

ROBBER PLACEMENT AND KNIGHT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-producing hex of your opponent
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat in mid-game when cities are being built
- Target the specific resource the opponent needs for their next likely build
- Use knight cards reactively when the robber blocks your best production
- Save knight cards for the late game if pursuing largest army
- When stealing, select resources that complete your immediate build needs
- Keep track of opponent cards and target resources they've been collecting
- Balance robber placement between disruption and resource acquisition

DEVELOPMENT CARDS VS. BUILDING:
- Only buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and cannot build
- Buy development cards when you're 1-2 knights away from largest army
- Use knight cards immediately when advantageous (don't save unless close to largest army)
- Victory point cards should only supplement your main strategy, not replace it
- Road Building cards are most valuable when you're cut off or racing to a key location
- Monopoly is best used after high-probability dice rolls to collect opponent's stockpile
- Year of Plenty is ideal to complete a high-value build (settlement or city)
- NEVER delay settlement/city building to purchase development cards unless 1 VP from winning

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY FOCUS):
- Aim for 5 total settlements (2 upgraded to cities) = 9 VP
- Then secure largest army OR longest road for the final point
- Always calculate the fastest path to 10 VP in terms of resource costs
- For each potential build, calculate how many turns closer it gets you to victory
- Determine which victory paths are still viable based on board state
- Switch strategies when your primary path is blocked
- Plan for the end-game by turn 10 (know exactly how you will reach 10 points)
- Track opponent's path to victory and actively disrupt with roads or robber

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Trade at ports even at 4:1 ratio if it enables immediate critical build
- NEVER trade with opponent unless it enables an immediate settlement/city build
- Avoid trades that allow opponent to build immediately after you
- Calculate the net VP gain of each potential trade
- Use trades to dispose of resources when at risk from robber
- Combine multiple port trades to convert unwanted resources into needed ones
- Be willing to overpay through port trades to secure critical positional advantage

DECISION FRAMEWORK (APPLY TO EVERY TURN):
1. What is my immediate build priority? (settlement > city > longest road/largest army)
2. What resource do I need to complete my highest priority build?
3. What is the fastest way to acquire that resource? (production, trading, development cards)
4. How will this action position me for the next 3 turns?
5. Will this action disrupt my opponent's path to victory?
6. Is there a way to combine multiple actions this turn for greater efficiency?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Initial Settlement Placement Analysis

I need to analyze the board carefully to find the optimal placement for my first settlement. Since this is an initial settlement, I don't need resources to build it - this is the free placement phase.

## Resource and Number Analysis
Looking at the available hexes and their probabilities:
- 🌲 Wood (8) - High probability (5/36)
- 🧱 Brick (6) - High probability (5/36)
- 🌾 Wheat (10) - Medium probability (3/36)
- 🌾 Wheat (4) - Low probability (3/36)
- ⛏️ Ore (5) - Good probability (4/36)
- 🐑 Sheep (3) - Low probability (2/36)
- 🏜️ Desert (-) - No production

## Strategic Node Analysis
Let me analyze key nodes that would give access to the best resources:

Node 3: Connects to Wood(8), Ore(5), and Desert - Two high-value resources
Node 12: Connects to Wood(8), Ore(5) - Two high-value resources
Node 1: Connects to Sheep(3), Brick(6), Desert - One high-value resource
Node 6: Connects to Sheep(3), Brick(6) - One high-value resource
Node 15: Connects to Wood(8), Wheat(10) - One high-value and one medium-value resource

The most promising locations are nodes 3 and 12, as they both provide access to Wood(8) and Ore(5), which are high probability resources.

Node 3 gives access to three hexes (although one is desert), while node 12 gives access to only two hexes. However, node 12 is potentially better positioned for future expansion.

<plan>
1. First settlement at node 12 to secure Wood(8) and Ore(5) access
2. Plan second settlement to complement with Wheat and Brick/Sheep
3. Position for early road expansion toward unoccupied high-value areas
4. Target early city upgrades due to having Ore from the beginning
</plan>

Node 12 is the optimal choice because:
1. It secures access to Wood(8) - critical for early roads
2. It secures access to Ore(5) - critical for later city upgrades
3. It provides flexibility for future road placements
4. It gives me two high-probability resource hexes

Therefore, my optimal choice for the first settlement is:

\boxed{12}

# Initial Settlement Road Placement Analysis

I need to carefully consider my road placement for my first settlement at node 12, which gives me access to Wood(8) and Ore(5) - excellent high-probability resources for early game.

## Option Analysis:
Let me evaluate each of the three road options:

[0] Road at edge (11, 12):
- Direction: Toward node 11, connected to Ore(5) and Sheep(3)
- This would position me to expand toward the Sheep resource
- But I already have access to Ore from my current settlement

[1] Road at edge (12, 13):
- Direction: Toward node 13, connected to Wood(8)
- This continues along the Wood resource, which is already a high-probability (8) resource
- Leads toward unexplored territory that could have Wheat, Brick, or Sheep

[2] Road at edge (3, 12):
- Direction: Toward node 3, connected to Wood(8), Ore(5), and Desert
- This doubles down on resources I already have access to
- Less promising for finding complementary resources

## Strategic Considerations:
1. I need to position for my second settlement that should complement my first with Wheat, Brick, and/or Sheep
2. I should aim toward unexplored territory that likely has these missing resources
3. Option [1] leads toward unexplored territory while the others lead to known areas
4. Since my plan involves getting city upgrades (needing Ore and Wheat), I should position to find Wheat

## Decision:
Option [1] gives me the best opportunity to explore and potentially find the complementary resources I need. Building toward node 13 will allow me to continue expanding into unexplored territory, potentially finding Wheat and other missing resources.

<plan>
1. Place initial road toward node 13 to explore new territory
2. Target second settlement location with Wheat and Brick/Sheep access
3. After initial placements, focus on building 1-2 additional settlements early
4. Leverage my Ore(5) and Wood(8) for city upgrades in mid-game
</plan>

- Buy development cards when you're 1-2 knights away from largest army
- Use knight cards immediately when advantageous (don't save unless close to largest army)
- Victory point cards should only supplement your main strategy, not replace it
- Road Building cards are most valuable when you're cut off or racing to a key location
- Monopoly is best used after high-probability dice rolls to collect opponent's stockpile
- Year of Plenty is ideal to complete a high-value build (settlement or city)
- NEVER delay settlement/city building to purchase development cards unless 1 VP from winning

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY FOCUS):
- Aim for 5 total settlements (2 upgraded to cities) = 9 VP
- Then secure largest army OR longest road for the final point
- Always calculate the fastest path to 10 VP in terms of resource costs
- For each potential build, calculate how many turns closer it gets you to victory
- Determine which victory paths are still viable based on board state
- Switch strategies when your primary path is blocked
- Plan for the end-game by turn 10 (know exactly how you will reach 10 points)
- Track opponent's path to victory and actively disrupt with roads or robber

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Trade at ports even at 4:1 ratio if it enables immediate critical build
- NEVER trade with opponent unless it enables an immediate settlement/city build
- Avoid trades that allow opponent to build immediately after you
- Calculate the net VP gain of each potential trade
- Use trades to dispose of resources when at risk from robber
- Combine multiple port trades to convert unwanted resources into needed ones
- Be willing to overpay through port trades to secure critical positional advantage

DECISION FRAMEWORK (APPLY TO EVERY TURN):
1. What is my immediate build priority? (settlement > city > longest road/largest army)
2. What resource do I need to complete my highest priority build?
3. What is the fastest way to acquire that resource? (production, trading, development cards)
4. How will this action position me for the next 3 turns?
5. Will this action disrupt my opponent's path to victory?
6. Is there a way to combine multiple actions this turn for greater efficiency?

# Initial Settlement Analysis for Second Placement

I need to carefully choose my second initial settlement location based on several key criteria:

1. **Resource Complementarity:** My first settlement is at node 12, producing Ore(5) and Wood(8). I need to complement these with access to Wheat, Brick, and Sheep.

2. **Numerical Diversity:** I should cover different dice numbers than my 5 and 8.

3. **Production Value:** Higher probability numbers (5,6,8,9) are priority.

4. **Future Expansion:** Consider settlement locations that offer good expansion paths.

5. **Opponent Positioning:** RED already has settlements at nodes 20 (Wheat-4, Brick-6) and 9 (Sheep-3, Ore-5).

## Evaluating Options:

**Node 1:** Connects to Sheep(3), Brick(6), Desert(-). Has Brick(6) with high probability, but only 2 productive hexes.

**Node 4:** Connects to Wood(8), Desert(-), Wheat(10). Has Wood(8) which I already have, and Wheat(10) which is low probability.

**Node 5:** Connects to Desert(-), Wheat(10), Wheat(4). Two wheat hexes but both are low probability numbers (4,10).

**Node 6:** Connects to Sheep(3), Brick(6). Good materials but just 2 resources.

**Node 7:** Connects to Sheep(3) only. Poor choice with just 1 resource.

**Node 14:** Connects to Wood(8) only. Poor choice plus I already have Wood(8).

**Node 15:** Connects to Wood(8), Wheat(10). Has Wood I already have and low-probability Wheat.

**Node 16:** Connects to Wheat(10), Wheat(4). Two low-probability Wheat hexes.

**Node 17:** Connects to Wheat(10) only. Poor choice with just 1 resource.

**Node 18:** Connects to Wheat(10) only. Poor choice with just 1 resource.

**Node 21:** Connects to Wheat(4) only. Poor choice with just 1 resource.

**Node 23:** Connects to Brick(6) only. Has Brick(6) with high probability, but only 1 productive hex.

## Best Options Analysis:

**Node 1:** Gives me Brick(6★★★) and Sheep(3★), completing my resource diversity. Brick has high probability (6), Desert doesn't produce but might be adjacent to important nodes.

**Node 6:** Similar to Node 1 with Brick(6★★★) and Sheep(3★), but might have different expansion opportunities.

**Node 23:** Only gives Brick(6★★★) but is positioned at a different area of the board.

Based on this analysis, Node 1 or Node 6 seem to be the best choices for completing my resource diversity with at least one high-probability number (Brick-6).

Looking at Node 1's position, it connects to the desert, Sheep(3), and Brick(6) hexes, at the intersection of three territories. This may provide better expansion options than Node 6, which is only connected to two hexes.

<plan>
1. Place second settlement at Node 1 to secure Brick(6) and Sheep(3)
2. Focus on expanding toward wheat-producing areas for resource diversity
3. Leverage strong Wood(8) and Ore(5) production for city upgrades mid-game
4. Target building 1-2 additional settlements in early game
</plan>

Node 1 gives me the best combination of high-probability resources (Brick-6), completes my resource diversity with Sheep(3), and offers strategic position for future expansion.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist focused on defeating the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRITICAL FOR SUCCESS):
- Above all else, target the highest probability numbers (6 & 8) - these produce resources 5/36 times each
- Strictly prioritize access to all five resources between your two settlements
- Aim for numerical diversity - try to cover 5-6 different dice numbers across your settlements
- Never place initial settlements without analyzing future expansion opportunities
- Prioritize placement on hexes with complementary resources: ore/wheat and brick/wood
- Position roads toward high-value unoccupied areas the opponent cannot easily block
- Choose second settlement to complement your first settlement's resource weaknesses
- Consider 3:1 ports if you can't access a specific resource through settlements
- Analyze opponent placement to avoid contested expansion paths
- ALWAYS calculate production value using probability dots (5-6-8-9 are top priority numbers)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-10):
- Build at least one new settlement by turn 10 - expansion is your TOP priority
- Calculate and build along the fastest path to your next settlement location
- Secure missing resources through strategic settlement placement
- Build roads that secure critical expansion paths before the opponent blocks them
- Avoid development cards completely until you have at least 3 total settlements
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1) to complete critical builds
- Target resource diversity through your expansion locations
- Create a minimum 2-turn expansion plan and stick to it

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT AND PRODUCTION (CORE STRATEGY):
- Early game: Focus on wood/brick to expand with roads and settlements
- Mid game: Transition to ore/wheat focus for cities and development cards
- Calculate the resource production value of every potential build
- Only make 4:1 trades when they enable an immediate important build
- Cycle through "build phases" - expansion phase, then city upgrade phase
- Plan resource collection 2 turns ahead to minimize wasteful trades
- Never accumulate 7+ cards before dice rolls
- Diversify production to minimize dependency on any single resource
- Target a minimum of 4 total settlements before prioritizing city upgrades

COUNTERING ALPHABETA ALGORITHM:
- AlphaBeta looks ahead only 2 steps, so plan your moves 3-4 steps ahead
- Create deceptive game states that appear less threatening than they are
- Block the opponent's highest-probability expansion paths immediately
- Play defensively during early game, then aggressively in mid-game
- When opponent has 7+ points, disrupt their highest-producing hex with the robber
- Track opponent's resources and block their most likely next build
- Secure resources that the opponent depends on heavily
- Place roads to cut off opponent from accessing high-value settlement locations
- Position settlements to deny opponent access to key resource hex intersections

ROBBER PLACEMENT AND KNIGHT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-producing hex of your opponent
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat in mid-game when cities are being built
- Target the specific resource the opponent needs for their next likely build
- Use knight cards reactively when the robber blocks your best production
- Save knight cards for the late game if pursuing largest army
- When stealing, select resources that complete your immediate build needs
- Keep track of opponent cards and target resources they've been collecting
- Balance robber placement between disruption and resource acquisition

DEVELOPMENT CARDS VS. BUILDING:
- Only buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and cannot build
- Buy development cards when you're 1-2 knights away from largest army
- Use knight cards immediately when advantageous (don't save unless close to largest army)
- Victory point cards should only supplement your main strategy, not replace it
- Road Building cards are most valuable when you're cut off or racing to a key location

# Initial Road Placement Analysis

I need to carefully choose my first road placement during the initial setup phase, which will significantly impact my expansion options and overall strategy. Let me analyze the available options:

## Option [0]: Build a road at edge (0, 1)
This connects node 0 and 1. My settlement is already at node 1, and node 0 connects to the desert hex and brick(6) hex. This road would point me toward the wheat(4) hex but away from my other settlement.

## Option [1]: Build a road at edge (1, 2)
This connects node 1 and 2. My settlement is at node 1, and node 2 connects to sheep(3), ore(5), and desert hexes. This road would point me toward my other settlement and potentially connect my settlements.

## Option [2]: Build a road at edge (1, 6)
This connects node 1 and 6. My settlement is at node 1, and node 6 connects to brick(6) and sheep(3) hexes. This road would point me toward the brick port and away from my other settlement.

## Game State Assessment
- I have settlements at nodes 1 (brick(6), sheep(3)) and 12 (ore(5), wood(8))
- I currently have access to 4 resources: brick, sheep, ore, and wood
- I'm missing wheat, which is crucial for cities and development cards
- My settlements have good number diversity (3, 5, 6, 8) with strong production values

## Strategic Decision
Option [1] is optimal because:
1. It begins to create a path between my two settlements (which can help secure longest road later)
2. It moves toward node 2 which connects to ore(5) - I already have a settlement on ore, but having multiple production sources for key resources is valuable
3. It positions me to potentially expand toward wheat-producing areas in the future
4. This central position gives me more flexibility than the other options

<plan>
1. Build my initial road between nodes 1 and 2
2. Focus on expanding toward wheat-producing hexes (particularly the wheat(4) hex)
3. Use my strong wood(8) and brick(6) production to build roads quickly
4. Target building a settlement at a wheat-producing node early
5. Later transition to ore/wheat focus for city upgrades
</plan>

# Robber Placement Analysis

I need to analyze where to place the robber to maximally disrupt the RED player while minimizing impact on my own production.

## Analyzing the available hexes:
- [0] 🐑3 (1, -1, 0): Sheep hex with low production value (1 dot). Red has a settlement at node 9 that produces from this hex.
- [1] ⛏️5 (0, -1, 1): Ore hex with moderate production value (2 dots). Red has a settlement at node 9 that produces from this hex. I also have a settlement at node 12 that would be blocked.
- [2] 🌲8 (-1, 0, 1): Wood hex with high production value (3 dots). Only I produce from this hex at node 12, so placing here would hurt me significantly.
- [3] 🌾10 (-1, 1, 0): Wheat hex with low production value (1 dot). No settlements currently produce from this hex.
- [4] 🌾4 (0, 1, -1): Wheat hex with low production value (1 dot). Red has a settlement at node 20 that produces from this hex.
- [5] 🧱6 (1, 0, -1): Brick hex with high production value (3 dots). Both Red and I have settlements producing from this hex (Red at node 20, me at node 1).

## Strategic Considerations:
1. Avoid disrupting my own high-value production
2. Target Red's highest-value resources
3. Consider what resources Red likely needs next

Red's settlements produce:
- Sheep (3) - low value
- Ore (5) - moderate value
- Brick (6) - high value
- Wheat (4) - low value

Red has access to sheep, ore, brick, and wheat, suggesting they may be collecting for settlements (brick/wood) or development cards (ore/wheat/sheep).

## Decision Process:
- Option [2] and [3] don't affect Red at all, so these are suboptimal.
- Option [1] would block my own ore production, which I'll need later.
- Option [5] would block both Red's and my own brick production - not ideal.
- Option [0] only blocks Red's low-value sheep production.
- Option [4] blocks Red's wheat production, which they may need for development cards or cities.

Looking at resource access, Red has brick but might be missing wood for expansion. They have wheat and potentially collecting ore for cities. Blocking their wheat makes most sense strategically as it's a key resource they have limited access to.

<plan>
1. Block Red's wheat production to slow their city development
2. Continue expanding toward wheat-producing hexes 
3. Use my strong wood(8) and brick(6) production to build roads and settlements
4. Target a settlement at node 16 (near the wheat hexes) for my next expansion
5. Later transition to ore/wheat focus for city upgrades
</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist focused on defeating the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRITICAL FOR SUCCESS):
- Above all else, target the highest probability numbers (6 & 8) - these produce resources 5/36 times each
- Strictly prioritize access to all five resources between your two settlements
- Aim for numerical diversity - try to cover 5-6 different dice numbers across your settlements
- Never place initial settlements without analyzing future expansion opportunities
- Prioritize placement on hexes with complementary resources: ore/wheat and brick/wood
- Position roads toward high-value unoccupied areas the opponent cannot easily block
- Choose second settlement to complement your first settlement's resource weaknesses
- Consider 3:1 ports if you can't access a specific resource through settlements
- Analyze opponent placement to avoid contested expansion paths
- ALWAYS calculate production value using probability dots (5-6-8-9 are top priority numbers)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-10):
- Build at least one new settlement by turn 10 - expansion is your TOP priority
- Calculate and build along the fastest path to your next settlement location
- Secure missing resources through strategic settlement placement
- Build roads that secure critical expansion paths before the opponent blocks them
- Avoid development cards completely until you have at least 3 total settlements
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1) to complete critical builds
- Target resource diversity through your expansion locations
- Create a minimum 2-turn expansion plan and stick to it

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT AND PRODUCTION (CORE STRATEGY):
- Early game: Focus on wood/brick to expand with roads and settlements
- Mid game: Transition to ore/wheat focus for cities and development cards
- Calculate the resource production value of every potential build
- Only make 4:1 trades when they enable an immediate important build
- Cycle through "build phases" - expansion phase, then city upgrade phase
- Plan resource collection 2 turns ahead to minimize wasteful trades
- Never accumulate 7+ cards before dice rolls
- Diversify production to minimize dependency on any single resource
- Target a minimum of 4 total settlements before prioritizing city upgrades

COUNTERING ALPHABETA ALGORITHM:
- AlphaBeta looks ahead only 2 steps, so plan your moves 3-4 steps ahead
- Create deceptive game states that appear less threatening than they are
- Block the opponent's highest-probability expansion paths immediately
- Play defensively during early game, then aggressively in mid-game
- When opponent has 7+ points, disrupt their highest-producing hex with the robber
- Track opponent's resources and block their most likely next build
- Secure resources that the opponent depends on heavily
- Place roads to cut off opponent from accessing high-value settlement locations
- Position settlements to deny opponent access to key resource hex intersections

ROBBER PLACEMENT AND KNIGHT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-producing hex of your opponent
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat in mid-game when cities are being built
- Target the specific resource the opponent needs for their next likely build
- Use knight cards reactively when the robber blocks your best production
- Save knight cards for the late game if pursuing largest army
- When stealing, select resources that complete your immediate build needs
- Keep track of opponent cards and target resources they've been collecting
- Balance robber placement between disruption and resource acquisition

DEVELOPMENT CARDS VS. BUILDING:
- Only buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and cannot build
- Buy development cards when you're 1-2 knights away from largest army
- Use knight cards immediately when advantageous (don't save unless close to largest army)
- Victory point cards should only supplement your main strategy, not replace it
- Road Building cards are most valuable when you're cut off or racing to a key location
- Monopoly is best used after high-probability dice rolls to collect opponent's stockpile
- Year of Plenty is ideal to complete a high-value build (settlement or city)
- NEVER delay settlement/city building to purchase development cards unless 1 VP from winning

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY FOCUS):
- Aim for 5 total settlements (2 upgraded to cities) = 9 VP
- Then secure largest army OR longest road for the final point
- Always calculate the fastest path to 10 VP in terms of resource costs
- For each potential build, calculate how many turns closer it gets you to victory
- Determine which victory paths are still viable based on board state
- Switch strategies when your primary path is blocked
- Plan for the end-game by turn 10 (know exactly how you will reach 10 points)
- Track opponent's path to victory and actively disrupt with roads or robber

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Trade at ports even at 4:1 ratio if it enables immediate critical build
- NEVER trade with opponent unless it enables an immediate settlement/city build
- Avoid trades that allow opponent to build immediately after you
- Calculate the net VP gain of each potential trade
- Use trades to dispose of resources when at risk from robber
- Combine multiple port trades to convert unwanted resources into needed ones
- Be willing to overpay through port trades to secure critical positional advantage

DECISION FRAMEWORK (APPLY TO EVERY TURN):
1. What is my immediate build priority? (settlement > city > longest road/largest army)
2. What resource do I need to complete my highest priority build?
3. What is the fastest way to acquire that resource? (production, trading, development cards)
4. How will this action position me for the next 3 turns?
5. Will this action disrupt my opponent's path to victory?
6. Is there a way to combine multiple actions this turn for greater efficiency?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 6 | Player: BLUE | Action: MOVE_ROBBER

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Block Red's wheat production to slow their city development
2. Continue expanding toward wheat-producing hexes 
3. Use my strong wood(8) and brick(6) production to build roads and settlements
4. Target a settlement at node 16 (near the wheat hexes) for my next expansion
5. Later transition to ore/wheat focus for city upgrades
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.

RESPONSE:
# Robber Placement Analysis

I need to optimize my robber placement to disrupt RED's production while setting up my expansion strategy.

## Analysis of Options:
- [0] Move to (0, 0, 0): Desert hex - not useful as it already produces nothing
- [1] Move to (1, -1, 0): Sheep(3) - blocks RED's sheep production at node 9
- [2] Move to (0, -1, 1): Ore(5) - blocks RED's ore production at node 9
- [3] Move to (-1, 1, 0): Wheat(10) - doesn't block RED directly
- [4] Move to (0, 1, -1): Wheat(4) - blocks RED's wheat production at node 20
- [5] Move to (1, 0, -1): Brick(6) - blocks RED's valuable brick production at node 20

## Strategic Considerations:
1. Looking at RED's settlements:
   - Node 9: Produces sheep(3) and ore(5)
   - Node 20: Produces wheat(4) and brick(6)

2. Resource value assessment:
   - Brick(6) is highest probability number (5/36) RED has
   - Ore(5) and wheat are crucial for cities

3. My plan analysis:
   - I need to block RED's city development
   - I don't need to worry about RED's sheep as much
   - Brick(6) is RED's strongest production and will fuel their road/settlement expansion

4. Opponent analysis:
   - RED likely wants to build roads and settlements with their brick production
   - Blocking their brick is most disruptive to their early game expansion

<plan>
1. Block RED's brick(6) production to slow their expansion
2. Continue expanding toward wheat-producing hexes
3. Use my strong wood(8) and brick(6) production to build roads and settlements
4. Target a settlement at node 16 (near the wheat hex) for my next expansion
5. Later transition to ore/wheat focus for city upgrades
</plan>

Option 5 (blocking brick) provides the most disruption to RED's early game strategy while allowing me to maintain my expansion advantage with my own brick production.

# Robber Movement Analysis

I need to decide where to place the robber strategically to maximize my advantage while hindering my opponent RED.

## Evaluating All Options:

**[0] Move robber to (0, 0, 0)** - This is the desert tile which produces no resources. Moving the robber here would be completely ineffective since it wouldn't block any production.

**[1] Move robber to (1, -1, 0) and steal from RED** - This would block a sheep hex with number 3. RED has a settlement at node 9 that produces from this hex. Sheep is less critical in early game, and the production value is only ⭐ (low probability).

**[2] Move robber to (0, -1, 1) and steal from RED** - This would block an ore hex with number 5. RED has a settlement at node 9 that produces from this hex. Ore is important for cities, and the production value is ⭐⭐ (medium probability).

**[3] Move robber to (-1, 0, 1)** - This would block a wood hex with number 8. My own settlement at node 12 produces from this hex (⭐⭐⭐ high probability). This would hurt me significantly without affecting RED.

**[4] Move robber to (-1, 1, 0)** - This would block a wheat hex with number 10. Neither player has settlements on this hex yet, so this wouldn't affect current production.

**[5] Move robber to (0, 1, -1) and steal from RED** - This would block a wheat hex with number 4. RED has a settlement at node 20 that produces from this hex. Wheat is important for cities and settlements, but the production value is only ⭐ (low probability).

## Strategic Considerations:

1. My current plan focuses on blocking RED's brick production, but that hex is already blocked by the robber.
2. RED currently has settlements producing from brick(6), sheep(3), wheat(4), and ore(5).
3. Early game prioritizes wood/brick for expansion, and RED already has access to brick.
4. Option [2] would block RED's ore production, which could slow their transition to cities.

## Decision Logic:

Since the robber is already on RED's brick hex (highest production value at ⭐⭐⭐), my next best option is to block their next highest production value resource, which is ore(5) at ⭐⭐. This aligns with countering the AlphaBeta algorithm by disrupting their likely build path.

<plan>
1. Block RED's ore(5) production to slow their city development
2. Continue expanding toward wheat-producing hexes
3. Use my strong wood(8) and brick(6) production to build roads toward node 16
4. Target a settlement at node 16 (near the wheat hex) for my next expansion
5. Later transition to ore/wheat focus for city upgrades
</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist focused on defeating the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRITICAL FOR SUCCESS):
- Above all else, target the highest probability numbers (6 & 8) - these produce resources 5/36 times each
- Strictly prioritize access to all five resources between your two settlements
- Aim for numerical diversity - try to cover 5-6 different dice numbers across your settlements
- Never place initial settlements without analyzing future expansion opportunities
- Prioritize placement on hexes with complementary resources: ore/wheat and brick/wood
- Position roads toward high-value unoccupied areas the opponent cannot easily block
- Choose second settlement to complement your first settlement's resource weaknesses
- Consider 3:1 ports if you can't access a specific resource through settlements
- Analyze opponent placement to avoid contested expansion paths
- ALWAYS calculate production value using probability dots (5-6-8-9 are top priority numbers)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-10):
- Build at least one new settlement by turn 10 - expansion is your TOP priority
- Calculate and build along the fastest path to your next settlement location
- Secure missing resources through strategic settlement placement
- Build roads that secure critical expansion paths before the opponent blocks them
- Avoid development cards completely until you have at least 3 total settlements
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1) to complete critical builds
- Target resource diversity through your expansion locations
- Create a minimum 2-turn expansion plan and stick to it

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT AND PRODUCTION (CORE STRATEGY):
- Early game: Focus on wood/brick to expand with roads and settlements
- Mid game: Transition to ore/wheat focus for cities and development cards
- Calculate the resource production value of every potential build
- Only make 4:1 trades when they enable an immediate important build
- Cycle through "build phases" - expansion phase, then city upgrade phase
- Plan resource collection 2 turns ahead to minimize wasteful trades
- Never accumulate 7+ cards before dice rolls
- Diversify production to minimize dependency on any single resource
- Target a minimum of 4 total settlements before prioritizing city upgrades

COUNTERING ALPHABETA ALGORITHM:
- AlphaBeta looks ahead only 2 steps, so plan your moves 3-4 steps ahead
- Create deceptive game states that appear less threatening than they are
- Block the opponent's highest-probability expansion paths immediately
- Play defensively during early game, then aggressively in mid-game
- When opponent has 7+ points, disrupt their highest-producing hex with the robber
- Track opponent's resources and block their most likely next build
- Secure resources that the opponent depends on heavily
- Place roads to cut off opponent from accessing high-value settlement locations
- Position settlements to deny opponent access to key resource hex intersections

ROBBER PLACEMENT AND KNIGHT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-producing hex of your opponent
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat in mid-game when cities are being built
- Target the specific resource the opponent needs for their next likely build
- Use knight cards reactively when the robber blocks your best production
- Save knight cards for the late game if pursuing largest army
- When stealing, select resources that complete your immediate build needs
- Keep track of opponent cards and target resources they've been collecting
- Balance robber placement between disruption and resource acquisition

DEVELOPMENT CARDS VS. BUILDING:
- Only buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and cannot build
- Buy development cards when you're 1-2 knights away from largest army
- Use knight cards immediately when advantageous (don't save unless close to largest army)
- Victory point cards should only supplement your main strategy, not replace it
- Road Building cards are most valuable when you're cut off or racing to a key location
- Monopoly is best used after high-probability dice rolls to collect opponent's stockpile
- Year of Plenty is ideal to complete a high-value build (settlement or city)
- NEVER delay settlement/city building to purchase development cards unless 1 VP from winning

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY FOCUS):
- Aim for 5 total settlements (2 upgraded to cities) = 9 VP
- Then secure largest army OR longest road for the final point
- Always calculate the fastest path to 10 VP in terms of resource costs
- For each potential build, calculate how many turns closer it gets you to victory
- Determine which victory paths are still viable based on board state
- Switch strategies when your primary path is blocked
- Plan for the end-game by turn 10 (know exactly how you will reach 10 points)
- Track opponent's path to victory and actively disrupt with roads or robber

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Trade at ports even at 4:1 ratio if it enables immediate critical build
- NEVER trade with opponent unless it enables an immediate settlement/city build
- Avoid trades that allow opponent to build immediately after you
- Calculate the net VP gain of each potential trade
- Use trades to dispose of resources when at risk from robber
- Combine multiple port trades to convert unwanted resources into needed ones
- Be willing to overpay through port trades to secure critical positional advantage

DECISION FRAMEWORK (APPLY TO EVERY TURN):
1. What is my immediate build priority? (settlement > city > longest road/largest army)
2. What resource do I need to complete my highest priority build?
3. What is the fastest way to acquire that resource? (production, trading, development cards)
4. How will this action position me for the next 3 turns?
5. Will this action disrupt my opponent's path to victory?
6. Is there a way to combine multiple actions this turn for greater efficiency?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game Analysis for Settlers of Catan - Turn 16

I'll analyze the current game state and determine the optimal move based on my resources and strategic opportunities.

## Current Game State Analysis
- I have 2 settlements: node 12 (ore-5, wood-8) and node 1 (sheep-3, brick-6)
- My current resources: 1 wood, 1 brick, 1 sheep, 2 ore
- The opponent has 2 settlements and 6 hidden resources
- The robber is on the desert tile (0,0,0), so not blocking anyone's production

## Resource Production Assessment
- I have good wood (8) and brick (6) production - perfect for expansion
- My ore (5) production is decent, and I already have 2 ore in hand
- I'm lacking wheat production entirely - this is a critical weakness
- Looking at the map, there's a wheat-10 hex at (-1,1,0) and a wheat-4 hex at (0,1,-1)

## Expansion Opportunities
My available road options are:
1. Road at (0, 1) - Leads toward the center, less strategic
2. Road at (13, 14) - Leads toward wheat-10 hex
3. Road at (2, 3) - Leads toward ore-5 hex
4. Road at (2, 9) - Would move toward opponent territory, less strategic
5. Road at (11, 12) - Doesn't advance expansion plans
6. Road at (3, 12) - Doesn't advance my expansion plans
7. Road at (1, 6) - Leads toward brick-6 hex, which I already produce

Looking at the map, I want to continue with my plan to reach node 16 for access to the wheat hex. This will give me all five resources. The most efficient path appears to be through node 13 and 14 toward node 15 and 16.

## Decision Framework
1. Immediate build priority: Build roads toward wheat-producing hexes
2. Resources needed: I have the wood and brick needed for a road
3. Fastest way to achieve goal: Build road at edge (13, 14) to continue toward wheat
4. Position for next 3 turns: This puts me on track toward my wheat resource
5. Disruption to opponent: Not directly, but secures my expansion path

<plan>Continue expanding toward wheat at node 16 by building roads via nodes 13, 14, and 15. After securing wheat production, transition to building more settlements and eventually cities. Keep monitoring RED's resource collection to know when to block with the robber.</plan>

Based on this analysis, my optimal move is to build a road at edge (13, 14), which advances me toward the wheat-10 hex that I critically need for resource diversity.

# Robber Placement Analysis

I need to analyze where to place the robber to maximize my advantage and disrupt RED's strategy.

## Game State Analysis
- RED has 7 hidden resources
- RED's settlements are at nodes 9 and 20
- RED is producing from: 🐑3, ⛏️5, 🧱6, 🌾4
- I have 2 ORE cards

## Robber Options Analysis:
[0] Move to 🏜️(-) (0,0,0): This is wasteland so no production is blocked. Poor choice.

[1] Move to 🐑3 (1,-1,0) and steal from RED:
- Blocks RED's sheep at node 9
- Sheep is less critical in mid-game
- Probability: 2/36 (low value)

[2] Move to ⛏️5 (0,-1,1) and steal from RED:
- Blocks RED's ore at node 9
- Ore is critical for cities
- Probability: 4/36 (good value)
- Also blocks my own ore at node 12

[3] Move to 🌾10 (-1,1,0):
- No RED settlements adjacent
- Cannot steal
- Doesn't affect RED

[4] Move to 🌾4 (0,1,-1) and steal from RED:
- Blocks RED's wheat at node 20
- Wheat is critical for cities/development cards
- Probability: 3/36 (moderate value)

[5] Move to 🧱6 (1,0,-1) and steal from RED:
- Blocks RED's brick at node 20
- Brick is critical for early expansion
- Probability: 5/36 (high value)
- RED likely has brick since it's their highest-probability resource

## Strategic Considerations
1. RED has 7 cards - they're at risk from the 7 roll anyway
2. RED's highest probability resource is 🧱6 (5/36)
3. Blocking brick (option 5) will slow RED's expansion
4. RED already has enough for a road and is just 1 brick away from a settlement

<plan>Block RED's brick production and try to steal brick to help my expansion toward node 16. Continue building roads toward wheat via nodes 13, 14, and 15. After securing wheat production, transition to building settlements and eventually cities.</plan>

Based on this analysis, the optimal move is to place the robber on RED's brick hex and steal from them. This disrupts their highest probability resource and potentially gives me brick for my own expansion.

- Prioritize placement on hexes with complementary resources: ore/wheat and brick/wood
- Position roads toward high-value unoccupied areas the opponent cannot easily block
- Choose second settlement to complement your first settlement's resource weaknesses
- Consider 3:1 ports if you can't access a specific resource through settlements
- Analyze opponent placement to avoid contested expansion paths
- ALWAYS calculate production value using probability dots (5-6-8-9 are top priority numbers)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-10):
- Build at least one new settlement by turn 10 - expansion is your TOP priority
- Calculate and build along the fastest path to your next settlement location
- Secure missing resources through strategic settlement placement
- Build roads that secure critical expansion paths before the opponent blocks them
- Avoid development cards completely until you have at least 3 total settlements
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1) to complete critical builds
- Target resource diversity through your expansion locations
- Create a minimum 2-turn expansion plan and stick to it

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT AND PRODUCTION (CORE STRATEGY):
- Early game: Focus on wood/brick to expand with roads and settlements
- Mid game: Transition to ore/wheat focus for cities and development cards
- Calculate the resource production value of every potential build
- Only make 4:1 trades when they enable an immediate important build
- Cycle through "build phases" - expansion phase, then city upgrade phase
- Plan resource collection 2 turns ahead to minimize wasteful trades
- Never accumulate 7+ cards before dice rolls
- Diversify production to minimize dependency on any single resource
- Target a minimum of 4 total settlements before prioritizing city upgrades

COUNTERING ALPHABETA ALGORITHM:
- AlphaBeta looks ahead only 2 steps, so plan your moves 3-4 steps ahead
- Create deceptive game states that appear less threatening than they are
- Block the opponent's highest-probability expansion paths immediately
- Play defensively during early game, then aggressively in mid-game
- When opponent has 7+ points, disrupt their highest-producing hex with the robber
- Track opponent's resources and block their most likely next build
- Secure resources that the opponent depends on heavily
- Place roads to cut off opponent from accessing high-value settlement locations
- Position settlements to deny opponent access to key resource hex intersections

ROBBER PLACEMENT AND KNIGHT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-producing hex of your opponent
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat in mid-game when cities are being built
- Target the specific resource the opponent needs for their next likely build
- Use knight cards reactively when the robber blocks your best production
- Save knight cards for the late game if pursuing largest army
- When stealing, select resources that complete your immediate build needs
- Keep track of opponent cards and target resources they've been collecting
- Balance robber placement between disruption and resource acquisition

DEVELOPMENT CARDS VS. BUILDING:
- Only buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and cannot build
- Buy development cards when you're 1-2 knights away from largest army
- Use knight cards immediately when advantageous (don't save unless close to largest army)
- Victory point cards should only supplement your main strategy, not replace it
- Road Building cards are most valuable when you're cut off or racing to a key location
- Monopoly is best used after high-probability dice rolls to collect opponent's stockpile
- Year of Plenty is ideal to complete a high-value build (settlement or city)
- NEVER delay settlement/city building to purchase development cards unless 1 VP from winning

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY FOCUS):
- Aim for 5 total settlements (2 upgraded to cities) = 9 VP
- Then secure largest army OR longest road for the final point
- Always calculate the fastest path to 10 VP in terms of resource costs
- For each potential build, calculate how many turns closer it gets you to victory
- Determine which victory paths are still viable based on board state
- Switch strategies when your primary path is blocked
- Plan for the end-game by turn 10 (know exactly how you will reach 10 points)
- Track opponent's path to victory and actively disrupt with roads or robber

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Trade at ports even at 4:1 ratio if it enables immediate critical build
- NEVER trade with opponent unless it enables an immediate settlement/city build
- Avoid trades that allow opponent to build immediately after you
- Calculate the net VP gain of each potential trade
- Use trades to dispose of resources when at risk from robber
- Combine multiple port trades to convert unwanted resources into needed ones
- Be willing to overpay through port trades to secure critical positional advantage

DECISION FRAMEWORK (APPLY TO EVERY TURN):
1. What is my immediate build priority? (settlement > city > longest road/largest army)
2. What resource do I need to complete my highest priority build?
3. What is the fastest way to acquire that resource? (production, trading, development cards)
4. How will this action position me for the next 3 turns?
5. Will this action disrupt my opponent's path to victory?
6. Is there a way to combine multiple actions this turn for greater efficiency?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 34 | Player: BLUE | Action: MOVE_ROBBER

RESPONSE:
I'll analyze the board state and consider the optimal robber placement to maximize my chances of winning.

Let me start by understanding the game state:
- I'm BLUE with 2 VP (2 settlements)
- RED has 2 VP (2 settlements)
- I have 3 wood, 1 sheep, 2 ore
- RED has 6 hidden cards
- The robber is currently on (1, 0, -1) which is a brick hex with a 6 value (high production)

First, let me evaluate the robber placement options:
[0] Move to (0, 0, 0) - This is desert, no production blocked
[1] Move to (1, -1, 0) - This is sheep:3 (low value) and can steal from RED at node 9
[2] Move to (0, -1, 1) - This is ore:5 (medium value) and can steal from RED at node 9
[3] Move to (-1, 0, 1) - This is wood:8 (high value), would block my own production
[4] Move to (-1, 1, 0) - This is wheat:10 (low value), doesn't affect RED
[5] Move to (0, 1, -1) - This is wheat:4 (low value) and can steal from RED at node 20

My current plan is to expand toward node 16 and I need brick for that.

Looking at RED's settlements:
- Node 20 produces wheat:4 and brick:6
- Node 9 produces sheep:3 and ore:5

Since RED already has a settlement at node 20 producing brick:6, and they have 6 hidden cards, there's a good chance they have brick. Blocking their brick production while stealing from them would be beneficial for me.

I also notice that RED's node 20 is producing both wheat:4 and brick:6. While brick is more valuable, the robber is already on that hex. I should prioritize disrupting RED's most valuable resources. Since wheat is needed for settlements and cities, option [5] targeting the wheat:4 hex gives me a chance to steal a card and block RED's wheat production.

However, option [2] targeting the ore:5 hex is also strong, as ore is critical for cities in the mid-game and has a better production value (2 dots vs 1 dot for the wheat:4).

<plan>Block RED's ore production (5 value) and try to steal ore or brick from them. Continue building roads toward wheat via nodes 14, 15, and 16. After securing wheat production, transition to building settlements and then cities.</plan>

Option [2] gives me the best combination of disrupting RED's medium-value production while having a chance to steal a resource I might need. The ore:5 hex has higher production probability than the wheat:4 hex, making it more impactful to block.

# Game Analysis for Turn 34

I'll carefully analyze the current state of the game and determine the optimal action based on my strategic goals.

## Game State Assessment
- I have 2 VP (2 settlements) vs RED's 2 VP (2 settlements)
- Resources in hand: 3 wood, 1 brick, 1 sheep, 2 ore
- I need to continue expanding my presence on the board
- Current robber is on ore (5) hex, blocking one of my settlements

## Resource Analysis
- My production is reasonably balanced with access to wood (8), brick (6), sheep (3), and ore (5)
- I'm missing wheat production, which is critical for cities and development cards
- With 3 wood and 1 brick, I can build one more road

## Action Analysis

Looking at my road options:
1. Edge (0,1) - Doesn't align with expansion toward wheat
2. Edge (2,3) - Doesn't move toward high-value nodes
3. Edge (2,9) - Moves toward RED's settlement, not valuable
4. Edge (11,12) - Would be redundant as I already have a settlement at 12
5. Edge (3,12) - Would be redundant as I already have a settlement at 12
6. Edge (1,6) - Moves toward brick (6) but not wheat
7. Edge (14,15) - **Continues my expansion path toward wheat production**

Option 7 is clearly the best as it continues my path toward the wheat hex (10) while also potentially moving toward wheat hex (4). This follows my current plan to secure wheat production to balance my resource portfolio.

## Strategic Plan Update
<plan>
Continue building roads toward wheat via nodes 15 and 16. My immediate focus is expanding to settle at node 16 which would give me access to both wheat hexes (10 and 4). This would give me access to all 5 resources. After securing wheat production, I'll look to build more settlements and then upgrade to cities.
</plan>

Building the road at edge (14,15) is the clear optimal choice as it:
1. Follows my expansion plan toward wheat
2. Uses my available resources efficiently
3. Positions me for future settlement placement
4. Moves me toward completing my resource portfolio

TURN 36 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  Continue building roads toward wheat via nodes 15 and 16. My immediate focus is expanding to settle at node 16 which would give me access to both wheat hexes (10 and 4). This would give me access to all 5 resources. After securing wheat production, I'll look to build more settlements and then upgrade to cities.

# Game Analysis and Decision Making

I'll analyze the current game state and evaluate my options to determine the optimal move.

## Current Status Assessment
- I have 2 VP from my settlements
- I have 2 🌲WOOD, 1 🧱BRICK, 1 🐑SHEEP, 2 ⛏️ORE
- I'm building toward node 16 to get wheat access
- I have roads through nodes 12, 13, 14, 15 which is leading me towards the wheat hexes
- Opponent has 6 hidden resources which means they likely can make multiple builds on their turn

## Resource Production Analysis
Looking at my settlements:
- Node 12: produces ore (5) and wood (8) - both excellent numbers
- Node 1: produces sheep (3) and brick (6) - gives me brick and sheep access

I'm missing wheat production entirely, which aligns with my current plan to expand toward the wheat hexes.

## Action Evaluation

From the available road building options:
- Option [2] Build at edge (15, 17) - This continues my path toward the wheat hex with number 10, getting me closer to node 16 where I'd get access to both wheat hexes.
- Option [6] Build at edge (4, 15) - This also moves me toward wheat, but in a different direction.

Looking at the map, continuing from node 15 to 17 seems to align with my plan to reach node 16. By building this road, I'll be one edge away from node 16 where I can build a settlement to access both wheat hexes (10 and 4).

## Decision Logic
The most strategic move is to continue with option [2] to build a road at edge (15, 17). This:
1. Follows my expansion plan toward wheat production
2. Gets me closer to node 16 which would give access to both wheat hexes
3. Uses my available wood and brick resources effectively
4. Continues my longest continuous road (potentially setting up for longest road later)

<plan>Continue building roads toward wheat access, focusing on reaching node 16. After building the road at edge (15, 17), I'll need one more road to reach node 16. Once I build a settlement there, I'll have access to all five resources and two wheat hexes, positioning me for city upgrades. After securing wheat production, I'll accumulate ore/wheat for city upgrades and evaluate development cards as needed.</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist focused on defeating the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRITICAL FOR SUCCESS):
- Above all else, target the highest probability numbers (6 & 8) - these produce resources 5/36 times each
- Strictly prioritize access to all five resources between your two settlements
- Aim for numerical diversity - try to cover 5-6 different dice numbers across your settlements
- Never place initial settlements without analyzing future expansion opportunities
- Prioritize placement on hexes with complementary resources: ore/wheat and brick/wood
- Position roads toward high-value unoccupied areas the opponent cannot easily block
- Choose second settlement to complement your first settlement's resource weaknesses
- Consider 3:1 ports if you can't access a specific resource through settlements
- Analyze opponent placement to avoid contested expansion paths
- ALWAYS calculate production value using probability dots (5-6-8-9 are top priority numbers)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-10):
- Build at least one new settlement by turn 10 - expansion is your TOP priority
- Calculate and build along the fastest path to your next settlement location
- Secure missing resources through strategic settlement placement
- Build roads that secure critical expansion paths before the opponent blocks them
- Avoid development cards completely until you have at least 3 total settlements
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1) to complete critical builds
- Target resource diversity through your expansion locations
- Create a minimum 2-turn expansion plan and stick to it

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT AND PRODUCTION (CORE STRATEGY):
- Early game: Focus on wood/brick to expand with roads and settlements
- Mid game: Transition to ore/wheat focus for cities and development cards
- Calculate the resource production value of every potential build
- Only make 4:1 trades when they enable an immediate important build
- Cycle through "build phases" - expansion phase, then city upgrade phase
- Plan resource collection 2 turns ahead to minimize wasteful trades
- Never accumulate 7+ cards before dice rolls
- Diversify production to minimize dependency on any single resource
- Target a minimum of 4 total settlements before prioritizing city upgrades

COUNTERING ALPHABETA ALGORITHM:
- AlphaBeta looks ahead only 2 steps, so plan your moves 3-4 steps ahead
- Create deceptive game states that appear less threatening than they are
- Block the opponent's highest-probability expansion paths immediately
- Play defensively during early game, then aggressively in mid-game
- When opponent has 7+ points, disrupt their highest-producing hex with the robber
- Track opponent's resources and block their most likely next build
- Secure resources that the opponent depends on heavily
- Place roads to cut off opponent from accessing high-value settlement locations
- Position settlements to deny opponent access to key resource hex intersections

ROBBER PLACEMENT AND KNIGHT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-producing hex of your opponent
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat in mid-game when cities are being built
- Target the specific resource the opponent needs for their next likely build
- Use knight cards reactively when the robber blocks your best production
- Save knight cards for the late game if pursuing largest army
- When stealing, select resources that complete your immediate build needs
- Keep track of opponent cards and target resources they've been collecting
- Balance robber placement between disruption and resource acquisition

DEVELOPMENT CARDS VS. BUILDING:
- Only buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and cannot build
- Buy development cards when you're 1-2 knights away from largest army
- Use knight cards immediately when advantageous (don't save unless close to largest army)
- Victory point cards should only supplement your main strategy, not replace it
- Road Building cards are most valuable when you're cut off or racing to a key location
- Monopoly is best used after high-probability dice rolls to collect opponent's stockpile
- Year of Plenty is ideal to complete a high-value build (settlement or city)
- NEVER delay settlement/city building to purchase development cards unless 1 VP from winning

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY FOCUS):
- Aim for 5 total settlements (2 upgraded to cities) = 9 VP
- Then secure largest army OR longest road for the final point
- Always calculate the fastest path to 10 VP in terms of resource costs
- For each potential build, calculate how many turns closer it gets you to victory
- Determine which victory paths are still viable based on board state
- Switch strategies when your primary path is blocked
- Plan for the end-game by turn 10 (know exactly how you will reach 10 points)
- Track opponent's path to victory and actively disrupt with roads or robber

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Trade at ports even at 4:1 ratio if it enables immediate critical build
- NEVER trade with opponent unless it enables an immediate settlement/city build
- Avoid trades that allow opponent to build immediately after you
- Calculate the net VP gain of each potential trade
- Use trades to dispose of resources when at risk from robber
- Combine multiple port trades to convert unwanted resources into needed ones
- Be willing to overpay through port trades to secure critical positional advantage

DECISION FRAMEWORK (APPLY TO EVERY TURN):
1. What is my immediate build priority? (settlement > city > longest road/largest army)
2. What resource do I need to complete my highest priority build?
3. What is the fastest way to acquire that resource? (production, trading, development cards)
4. How will this action position me for the next 3 turns?

# Game Analysis and Decision Making

## Current Game State Assessment
- I'm BLUE with 2 VP from my 2 settlements
- My resources: 1 Wood, 1 Brick, 1 Sheep, 2 Ore
- I have settlements at nodes 12 (produces ore-5 and wood-8) and node 1 (produces sheep-3 and brick-6)
- I need access to wheat, which I currently don't have from either settlement
- RED has 7 hidden cards, likely at risk for the robber if a 7 is rolled

## Current Plan Review
My plan involves building roads toward node 16 to gain wheat access. This is a critical strategic goal as I'm missing wheat production completely. Looking at the board, wheat hexes are at coordinates (-1,1,0) with value 10 and (0,1,-1) with value 4.

## Analyzing Road Build Options
1. I need to evaluate which road gets me closer to wheat access efficiently:
   - Option [5] Build road at edge (4, 15) - This connects toward the wheat-10 hex
   - Option [8] Build road at edge (17, 18) - This is also near the wheat-10 hex

Looking at node connectivity and the existing road network:
- Node 4 connects to node 15, which is adjacent to the wheat-10 hex
- Node 15 is adjacent to nodes 4, 14, 16, 17
- Node 16 is adjacent to the wheat-10 and wheat-4 hexes

## Strategic Decision
Building at edge (4, 15) appears to be the most direct route toward establishing a settlement at or near node 16, which would give me access to wheat production. This continues my existing plan and is the most efficient path to acquiring my missing resource.

<plan>Continue building toward node 16 to gain wheat access. After building the road at edge (4, 15), I'll need to gather more wood and brick to extend to node 16. Once I build a settlement there, I'll have wheat production and can focus on city upgrades with my ore production.</plan>

Therefore, my optimal action is to build a road at edge (4, 15).

❓ Select action by number (0-5):


Based on this information, which action number do you choose? Think step by step about your options, then put the final action number in a box like \boxed{1}.
RESPONSE:
I need to make a strategic move with the robber to disrupt my opponent while advancing my position.

Let me analyze the available options for moving the robber:

1) First, let me understand the current game state:
   - I have 2 VP with two settlements (nodes 12 and 1)
   - RED also has 2 VP with two settlements (nodes 20 and 9)
   - RED has 7 hidden resources, which puts them at risk of losing half if a 7 is rolled
   - I have 1 wood, 1 sheep, and 2 ore

2) For each robber move option, I'll analyze:
   - What resource production I would block
   - What resource I could steal from RED (if applicable)
   - How this affects both my and RED's strategy

Option [0]: Move robber to (0, 0, 0) - Desert hex
- This is wasteful as the desert produces no resources
- No benefit to blocking this hex

Option [1]: Move robber to (1, -1, 0) and steal from RED
- This blocks sheep/3 production
- RED's settlement at node 9 produces from this hex
- I would steal a random resource from RED

Option [2]: Move robber to (-1, 0, 1)
- This blocks wood/8 production
- This hurts my own settlement at node 12, which is my best production hex (8 is high probability)
- This would be counterproductive

Option [3]: Move robber to (-1, 1, 0)
- This blocks wheat/10 production
- Neither of us has settlements on this hex
- This doesn't impact either player significantly

Option [4]: Move robber to (0, 1, -1) and steal from RED
- This blocks wheat/4 production
- RED's settlement at node 20 produces from this hex
- I would steal a random resource from RED

Option [5]: Move robber to (1, 0, -1) and steal from RED
- This blocks brick/6 production
- Both RED's settlements (nodes 20 and 9) produce from this hex
- RED has a strong brick production (two settlements on a 6)
- I would steal a random resource from RED
- This is RED's highest-producing hex (probability 5/36)

Decision analysis:
- Option [5] is clearly the strongest move as it blocks RED's best production hex (brick/6)
- Both of RED's settlements produce brick, so this is particularly disruptive
- I'll also get to steal a resource, potentially getting brick myself
- Since my plan involves expanding toward node 16, blocking RED's brick production will make it harder for them to expand and compete with me

<plan>Continue building toward node 16 to gain wheat access. By moving the robber to the brick/6 hex, I'm disrupting RED's production while maintaining my expansion plan. After receiving my resource theft, I'll work toward building the road at edge (4, 15) and continue gathering resources for my settlement at node 16.</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist focused on defeating the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRITICAL FOR SUCCESS):
- Above all else, target the highest probability numbers (6 & 8) - these produce resources 5/36 times each
- Strictly prioritize access to all five resources between your two settlements
- Aim for numerical diversity - try to cover 5-6 different dice numbers across your settlements
- Never place initial settlements without analyzing future expansion opportunities
- Prioritize placement on hexes with complementary resources: ore/wheat and brick/wood
- Position roads toward high-value unoccupied areas the opponent cannot easily block
- Choose second settlement to complement your first settlement's resource weaknesses
- Consider 3:1 ports if you can't access a specific resource through settlements
- Analyze opponent placement to avoid contested expansion paths
- ALWAYS calculate production value using probability dots (5-6-8-9 are top priority numbers)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-10):
- Build at least one new settlement by turn 10 - expansion is your TOP priority
- Calculate and build along the fastest path to your next settlement location
- Secure missing resources through strategic settlement placement
- Build roads that secure critical expansion paths before the opponent blocks them
- Avoid development cards completely until you have at least 3 total settlements
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1) to complete critical builds
- Target resource diversity through your expansion locations
- Create a minimum 2-turn expansion plan and stick to it

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT AND PRODUCTION (CORE STRATEGY):
- Early game: Focus on wood/brick to expand with roads and settlements
- Mid game: Transition to ore/wheat focus for cities and development cards
- Calculate the resource production value of every potential build
- Only make 4:1 trades when they enable an immediate important build
- Cycle through "build phases" - expansion phase, then city upgrade phase
- Plan resource collection 2 turns ahead to minimize wasteful trades
- Never accumulate 7+ cards before dice rolls
- Diversify production to minimize dependency on any single resource
- Target a minimum of 4 total settlements before prioritizing city upgrades

COUNTERING ALPHABETA ALGORITHM:
- AlphaBeta looks ahead only 2 steps, so plan your moves 3-4 steps ahead
- Create deceptive game states that appear less threatening than they are
- Block the opponent's highest-probability expansion paths immediately
- Play defensively during early game, then aggressively in mid-game
- When opponent has 7+ points, disrupt their highest-producing hex with the robber
- Track opponent's resources and block their most likely next build
- Secure resources that the opponent depends on heavily
- Place roads to cut off opponent from accessing high-value settlement locations
- Position settlements to deny opponent access to key resource hex intersections

ROBBER PLACEMENT AND KNIGHT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-producing hex of your opponent
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat in mid-game when cities are being built
- Target the specific resource the opponent needs for their next likely build
- Use knight cards reactively when the robber blocks your best production
- Save knight cards for the late game if pursuing largest army
- When stealing, select resources that complete your immediate build needs
- Keep track of opponent cards and target resources they've been collecting
- Balance robber placement between disruption and resource acquisition

DEVELOPMENT CARDS VS. BUILDING:
- Only buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and cannot build
- Buy development cards when you're 1-2 knights away from largest army
- Use knight cards immediately when advantageous (don't save unless close to largest army)
- Victory point cards should only supplement your main strategy, not replace it
- Road Building cards are most valuable when you're cut off or racing to a key location
- Monopoly is best used after high-probability dice rolls to collect opponent's stockpile
- Year of Plenty is ideal to complete a high-value build (settlement or city)
- NEVER delay settlement/city building to purchase development cards unless 1 VP from winning

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY FOCUS):
- Aim for 5 total settlements (2 upgraded to cities) = 9 VP
- Then secure largest army OR longest road for the final point
- Always calculate the fastest path to 10 VP in terms of resource costs
- For each potential build, calculate how many turns closer it gets you to victory
- Determine which victory paths are still viable based on board state
- Switch strategies when your primary path is blocked
- Plan for the end-game by turn 10 (know exactly how you will reach 10 points)
- Track opponent's path to victory and actively disrupt with roads or robber

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Trade at ports even at 4:1 ratio if it enables immediate critical build
- NEVER trade with opponent unless it enables an immediate settlement/city build
- Avoid trades that allow opponent to build immediately after you
- Calculate the net VP gain of each potential trade
- Use trades to dispose of resources when at risk from robber
- Combine multiple port trades to convert unwanted resources into needed ones
- Be willing to overpay through port trades to secure critical positional advantage

DECISION FRAMEWORK (APPLY TO EVERY TURN):
1. What is my immediate build priority? (settlement > city > longest road/largest army)
2. What resource do I need to complete my highest priority build?
3. What is the fastest way to acquire that resource? (production, trading, development cards)
4. How will this action position me for the next 3 turns?
5. Will this action disrupt my opponent's path to victory?
6. Is there a way to combine multiple actions this turn for greater efficiency?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 40 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  Continue building toward node 16 to gain wheat access. By moving the robber to the brick/6 hex, I'm disrupting RED's production while maintaining my expansion plan. After receiving my resource theft, I'll work toward building the road at edge (4, 15) and continue gathering resources for my settlement at node 16.
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.

RESPONSE:
# Game State Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state and my available options:

## Current Resources
- 1 wood, 1 brick, 1 sheep, 2 ore
- This is exactly enough to build one more road

## Board Position
- I have 2 settlements (nodes 12 and 1)
- My settlements produce wood(8), ore(5), sheep(3), and brick(6)
- I'm missing wheat production completely
- The robber is currently on the brick(6) hex, blocking both my and RED's brick production
- I have 6 roads built with a longest road of 4 segments
- RED has 2 settlements and 2 roads

## Strategic Considerations
1. Looking at the grid, I notice the wheat hexes are at coordinates (-1,1,0) with number 10 and (0,1,-1) with number 4
2. My previous plan mentioned building toward node 16, which connects to the wheat(10) hex
3. RED currently has 6 hidden resources, which is concerning as they may be able to build soon
4. I need to secure access to wheat to have all resources for future growth

## Road Building Options
Looking at my available road options, I need to determine which one advances me toward securing wheat access:

- Options [1], [3], [4], [6], [7], [8] don't help me toward wheat
- Option [2] (edge 3,4) moves toward the wheat(10) hex
- Option [5] (edge 4,5) moves toward the wheat(10) hex
- Option [9] (edge 17,18) doesn't connect to my current network

Examining the grid, nodes 15, 16, 17, and 18 are all adjacent to the wheat(10) hex. To reach node 16 (as per my previous plan), I need to build roads in that direction.

Looking at the coordinates, I see that edge (4,5) directly brings me toward node 16, which would give me wheat access. This aligns with my existing plan to secure wheat production.

<plan>Build road at edge (4,5) to continue expansion toward node 16 for wheat access. Next turn, aim to collect more wood and brick for another road. Once I reach node 16, I'll build a settlement there to gain wheat production, then focus on city upgrades to increase my production efficiency.</plan>

Therefore, I should build a road at edge (4,5) to continue my expansion toward gaining wheat access.

# Robber Placement Analysis

I need to strategically place the robber to maximize my advantage while disrupting RED's production.

## Step 1: Analyze all available robber placement options
- [0] Move to Desert (0,0,0): Wasteful as desert produces nothing
- [1] Move to Sheep-3 (1,-1,0): Blocks RED's settlement at node 9 and allows me to steal from RED
- [2] Move to Ore-5 (0,-1,1): Blocks RED's settlement at node 9, but also blocks my own settlement at node 12
- [3] Move to Wood-8 (-1,0,1): Blocks my own highly productive settlement at node 12 - extremely counterproductive
- [4] Move to Wheat-10 (-1,1,0): Blocks a wheat hex that I don't currently use
- [5] Move to Wheat-4 (0,1,-1): Blocks RED's settlement at node 20 and allows me to steal from RED

## Step 2: Consider opponent's current state
- RED has 7 cards (maximum hand size before robber risk)
- RED lacks wood production, meaning they likely traded for or accumulated other resources

## Step 3: Evaluate my strategic goals
- I need to expand toward node 16 for wheat access
- RED's brick production is a key threat as it produces on a high-value number (6)

## Step 4: Compare options 1 vs 5 (the best candidates)
- Option 1 (Sheep-3): Blocks a low-probability number (3) for RED
- Option 5 (Wheat-4): Blocks a low-probability number (4) but also blocks brick production on the same settlement
- The highest value target is actually RED's brick production at hex (1,0,-1) which is already blocked

Since the robber is already on RED's brick hex (highest value), I'll move it to hex (0,1,-1) to block RED's wheat production at node 20 and their access to both wheat and brick. This will significantly slow their expansion while allowing me to steal a valuable resource. I'll continue building roads toward node 16 for wheat access.
</plan>

## Final Decision
Considering all factors, I'll place the robber on RED's wheat hex (0,1,-1) which blocks their settlement at node 20, preventing both wheat and brick production while also allowing me to steal from them. This is the most disruptive move available.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist focused on defeating the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRITICAL FOR SUCCESS):
- Above all else, target the highest probability numbers (6 & 8) - these produce resources 5/36 times each
- Strictly prioritize access to all five resources between your two settlements
- Aim for numerical diversity - try to cover 5-6 different dice numbers across your settlements
- Never place initial settlements without analyzing future expansion opportunities
- Prioritize placement on hexes with complementary resources: ore/wheat and brick/wood
- Position roads toward high-value unoccupied areas the opponent cannot easily block
- Choose second settlement to complement your first settlement's resource weaknesses
- Consider 3:1 ports if you can't access a specific resource through settlements
- Analyze opponent placement to avoid contested expansion paths
- ALWAYS calculate production value using probability dots (5-6-8-9 are top priority numbers)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-10):
- Build at least one new settlement by turn 10 - expansion is your TOP priority
- Calculate and build along the fastest path to your next settlement location
- Secure missing resources through strategic settlement placement
- Build roads that secure critical expansion paths before the opponent blocks them
- Avoid development cards completely until you have at least 3 total settlements
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1) to complete critical builds
- Target resource diversity through your expansion locations
- Create a minimum 2-turn expansion plan and stick to it

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT AND PRODUCTION (CORE STRATEGY):
- Early game: Focus on wood/brick to expand with roads and settlements
- Mid game: Transition to ore/wheat focus for cities and development cards
- Calculate the resource production value of every potential build
- Only make 4:1 trades when they enable an immediate important build
- Cycle through "build phases" - expansion phase, then city upgrade phase
- Plan resource collection 2 turns ahead to minimize wasteful trades
- Never accumulate 7+ cards before dice rolls
- Diversify production to minimize dependency on any single resource
- Target a minimum of 4 total settlements before prioritizing city upgrades

COUNTERING ALPHABETA ALGORITHM:
- AlphaBeta looks ahead only 2 steps, so plan your moves 3-4 steps ahead
- Create deceptive game states that appear less threatening than they are
- Block the opponent's highest-probability expansion paths immediately
- Play defensively during early game, then aggressively in mid-game
- When opponent has 7+ points, disrupt their highest-producing hex with the robber
- Track opponent's resources and block their most likely next build
- Secure resources that the opponent depends on heavily
- Place roads to cut off opponent from accessing high-value settlement locations
- Position settlements to deny opponent access to key resource hex intersections

ROBBER PLACEMENT AND KNIGHT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-producing hex of your opponent
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat in mid-game when cities are being built
- Target the specific resource the opponent needs for their next likely build
- Use knight cards reactively when the robber blocks your best production
- Save knight cards for the late game if pursuing largest army
- When stealing, select resources that complete your immediate build needs
- Keep track of opponent cards and target resources they've been collecting
- Balance robber placement between disruption and resource acquisition

DEVELOPMENT CARDS VS. BUILDING:
- Only buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and cannot build
- Buy development cards when you're 1-2 knights away from largest army
- Use knight cards immediately when advantageous (don't save unless close to largest army)
- Victory point cards should only supplement your main strategy, not replace it
- Road Building cards are most valuable when you're cut off or racing to a key location
- Monopoly is best used after high-probability dice rolls to collect opponent's stockpile
- Year of Plenty is ideal to complete a high-value build (settlement or city)
- NEVER delay settlement/city building to purchase development cards unless 1 VP from winning

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY FOCUS):
- Aim for 5 total settlements (2 upgraded to cities) = 9 VP
- Then secure largest army OR longest road for the final point
- Always calculate the fastest path to 10 VP in terms of resource costs
- For each potential build, calculate how many turns closer it gets you to victory
- Determine which victory paths are still viable based on board state
- Switch strategies when your primary path is blocked
- Plan for the end-game by turn 10 (know exactly how you will reach 10 points)
- Track opponent's path to victory and actively disrupt with roads or robber

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Trade at ports even at 4:1 ratio if it enables immediate critical build
- NEVER trade with opponent unless it enables an immediate settlement/city build
- Avoid trades that allow opponent to build immediately after you
- Calculate the net VP gain of each potential trade
- Use trades to dispose of resources when at risk from robber
- Combine multiple port trades to convert unwanted resources into needed ones
- Be willing to overpay through port trades to secure critical positional advantage

DECISION FRAMEWORK (APPLY TO EVERY TURN):
1. What is my immediate build priority? (settlement > city > longest road/largest army)
2. What resource do I need to complete my highest priority build?
3. What is the fastest way to acquire that resource? (production, trading, development cards)
4. How will this action position me for the next 3 turns?
5. Will this action disrupt my opponent's path to victory?
6. Is there a way to combine multiple actions this turn for greater efficiency?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 42 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  Since the robber is already on RED's brick hex (highest value), I'll move it to hex (0,1,-1) to block RED's wheat production at node 20 and their access to both wheat and brick. This will significantly slow their expansion while allowing me to steal a valuable resource. I'll continue building roads toward node 16 for wheat access.

# Game Analysis and Decision Making

Let me analyze my current situation and options carefully:

## Current Game State
- I have 4 Victory Points (2 from settlements, 2 from longest road)
- Resources: 1 sheep, 4 ore
- No development cards
- The robber is already on RED's wheat hex (0,1,-1)
- RED has 6 hidden resource cards

## Available Options
- [0] End my turn
- [1-4] Trade 4 ore for 1 resource (sheep, brick, wood, or wheat)

## Strategic Analysis

I need to review my current plan and resource situation:
1. I have 4 ore and 1 sheep, which isn't enough to build anything useful right now
2. With 4 ore, I could trade for a critical resource
3. My current path to victory needs more settlements/cities, which requires resources I don't have

Looking at what I need most:
- For a settlement: I need 1 brick, 1 wood, 1 wheat, 1 sheep (I already have 1 sheep)
- For a city: I need 3 ore (I have 4) and 2 wheat (I have 0)
- For a development card: I need 1 ore, 1 wheat, 1 sheep

The most efficient use of my resources would be to work toward a city upgrade (since I already have 4 ore) or to work toward a new settlement.

For a city, I need 2 wheat, which I could get one of by trading.
For a settlement, I need brick, wood, and wheat (already have sheep).

<plan>
Trade my ore for wheat to work toward a city upgrade at one of my settlements, as this will give me the most efficient path to victory points. I already have 4 ore, so getting wheat will help me get closer to a city which costs 3 ore + 2 wheat.
</plan>

Since I need wheat for either path (city or settlement), and I have no access to wheat production currently, trading for wheat makes the most strategic sense. This will allow me to get one step closer to upgrading one of my settlements to a city.

Looking at the board state, I also note that:
- RED has access to wheat production via their settlement at node 20
- Blocking RED's wheat with the robber was a good move since they already have 6 cards
- I need to keep working toward better wheat access

Therefore, I should trade 4 ore for 1 wheat to begin accumulating resources for a city upgrade.

# Game State Analysis

Let me analyze the current situation:

## Current Resources
- 1 🧱BRICK
- 2 🐑SHEEP
- 1 🌾WHEAT
- 1 ⛏️ORE

## Victory Points
- I have 4/10 VP (2 settlements + longest road bonus)
- RED has 2/10 VP (2 settlements)

## Available Actions
- [0] End my turn
- [1] Buy a development card (costs 1 🐑SHEEP, 1 🌾WHEAT, 1 ⛏️ORE)

## Strategic Analysis

Looking at my current plan to build a city (which requires 3 ore + 2 wheat), I notice I only have 1 ore and 1 wheat right now. My previous plan assumed I had 4 ore, but that's not accurate based on the current game state.

With my current resources, I can afford to buy a development card. Let's consider the pros and cons:

**Buying a Development Card:**
- Could give me a Victory Point card (immediate hidden VP)
- Could give me a Knight card (moving toward Largest Army bonus)
- Could give me a helpful special card (Monopoly, Year of Plenty, Road Building)
- Uses up resources that could be targeted by the robber (RED has 9 cards, likely to roll a 7 soon)

**Ending Turn:**
- Saves resources for potential city/settlement later
- But risks losing cards to robber if a 7 is rolled

Given that I have exactly the resources needed for a development card, and RED player has many cards (9) suggesting they might be close to building something significant, I should adjust my strategy.

<plan>Buy a development card now to potentially get closer to victory through a VP card or Knight card. This also protects me from losing resources to the robber. Continue collecting resources for city upgrades on future turns.</plan>

Looking at my production:
- Settlement at node 12: ⛏️5 (medium probability) and 🌲8 (high probability)
- Settlement at node 1: 🐑3 (low probability) and 🧱6 (high probability)

I have good production of wood (8) and brick (6), which are excellent for expansion, but I'm lacking consistent ore and wheat production for city upgrades. However, development cards offer an alternative path to victory.

The decision is clear: buying a development card now is the optimal move. It gives me a chance at a VP card or Knight while protecting my resources from the robber.

- Track opponent's path to victory and actively disrupt with roads or robber

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Trade at ports even at 4:1 ratio if it enables immediate critical build
- NEVER trade with opponent unless it enables an immediate settlement/city build
- Avoid trades that allow opponent to build immediately after you
- Calculate the net VP gain of each potential trade
- Use trades to dispose of resources when at risk from robber
- Combine multiple port trades to convert unwanted resources into needed ones
- Be willing to overpay through port trades to secure critical positional advantage

DECISION FRAMEWORK (APPLY TO EVERY TURN):
1. What is my immediate build priority? (settlement > city > longest road/largest army)
2. What resource do I need to complete my highest priority build?
3. What is the fastest way to acquire that resource? (production, trading, development cards)
4. How will this action position me for the next 3 turns?
5. Will this action disrupt my opponent's path to victory?
6. Is there a way to combine multiple actions this turn for greater efficiency?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 48 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  Buy a development card now to potentially get closer to victory through a VP card or Knight card. This also protects me from losing resources to the robber. Continue collecting resources for city upgrades on future turns.
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.

# Game State Analysis

Let me analyze the current game situation:

**Current Points**:
- I (BLUE): 4 points (2 settlements + Longest Road bonus)
- Opponent (RED): 3 points (1 settlement + 1 city)

**Resources**:
- I have: 1 Brick, 1 Sheep, 1 Ore
- Opponent has 5 unknown resources

**Other Factors**:
- I have 1 Knight development card
- I hold Longest Road (5 segments)
- The robber is currently on a Wheat hex (0, 1, -1)

## Action Analysis

I have two options:
1. Play my Knight card [0]
2. Roll the dice [1]

**Option 0: Play Knight Card**
Advantages:
- I could move the robber from the Wheat hex to block a more productive opponent hex
- I could potentially steal a useful resource from RED
- I would be one step closer to Largest Army (currently no one has it)
- I would avoid any risk of losing resources if I roll a 7

Disadvantages:
- I'd be using a strategic card without an immediate build opportunity
- RED only has one settlement and one city, so the disruption impact is limited

**Option 1: Roll the Dice**
Advantages:
- I could gain more resources to build something this turn
- I might roll a 7 and move the robber myself, potentially disrupting RED and stealing a resource
- I preserve my Knight card for a more strategic moment

Disadvantages:
- If I roll a 7, I'd have to move the robber without getting a card (with Knight I would get a card)
- No guaranteed resource gain

## Strategic Considerations

1. My path to victory requires more settlements/cities. I need resources to build.
2. I currently don't have enough resources for any meaningful build.
3. I should focus on collecting resources for my next build opportunity.
4. The Knight card can be valuable later for Largest Army or when RED is closer to winning.

<plan>
Roll the dice to collect resources. If I get useful resources, consider building a road toward a new settlement location or saving for a city upgrade. Only use the Knight card if RED gets close to breaking my Longest Road or is approaching victory.
</plan>

Since I don't have enough resources to build anything significant now, and the robber isn't on one of my productive hexes, I should roll the dice to gather more resources. The Knight card will be more valuable later when I'm competing for Largest Army or need to disrupt RED when they're closer to victory.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist focused on defeating the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRITICAL FOR SUCCESS):
- Above all else, target the highest probability numbers (6 & 8) - these produce resources 5/36 times each
- Strictly prioritize access to all five resources between your two settlements
- Aim for numerical diversity - try to cover 5-6 different dice numbers across your settlements
- Never place initial settlements without analyzing future expansion opportunities
- Prioritize placement on hexes with complementary resources: ore/wheat and brick/wood
- Position roads toward high-value unoccupied areas the opponent cannot easily block
- Choose second settlement to complement your first settlement's resource weaknesses
- Consider 3:1 ports if you can't access a specific resource through settlements
- Analyze opponent placement to avoid contested expansion paths
- ALWAYS calculate production value using probability dots (5-6-8-9 are top priority numbers)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-10):
- Build at least one new settlement by turn 10 - expansion is your TOP priority
- Calculate and build along the fastest path to your next settlement location
- Secure missing resources through strategic settlement placement
- Build roads that secure critical expansion paths before the opponent blocks them
- Avoid development cards completely until you have at least 3 total settlements
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1) to complete critical builds
- Target resource diversity through your expansion locations
- Create a minimum 2-turn expansion plan and stick to it

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT AND PRODUCTION (CORE STRATEGY):
- Early game: Focus on wood/brick to expand with roads and settlements
- Mid game: Transition to ore/wheat focus for cities and development cards
- Calculate the resource production value of every potential build
- Only make 4:1 trades when they enable an immediate important build
- Cycle through "build phases" - expansion phase, then city upgrade phase
- Plan resource collection 2 turns ahead to minimize wasteful trades
- Never accumulate 7+ cards before dice rolls
- Diversify production to minimize dependency on any single resource
- Target a minimum of 4 total settlements before prioritizing city upgrades

COUNTERING ALPHABETA ALGORITHM:
- AlphaBeta looks ahead only 2 steps, so plan your moves 3-4 steps ahead
- Create deceptive game states that appear less threatening than they are
- Block the opponent's highest-probability expansion paths immediately
- Play defensively during early game, then aggressively in mid-game
- When opponent has 7+ points, disrupt their highest-producing hex with the robber
- Track opponent's resources and block their most likely next build
- Secure resources that the opponent depends on heavily
- Place roads to cut off opponent from accessing high-value settlement locations
- Position settlements to deny opponent access to key resource hex intersections

ROBBER PLACEMENT AND KNIGHT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-producing hex of your opponent
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat in mid-game when cities are being built
- Target the specific resource the opponent needs for their next likely build
- Use knight cards reactively when the robber blocks your best production
- Save knight cards for the late game if pursuing largest army
- When stealing, select resources that complete your immediate build needs
- Keep track of opponent cards and target resources they've been collecting
- Balance robber placement between disruption and resource acquisition

DEVELOPMENT CARDS VS. BUILDING:
- Only buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and cannot build
- Buy development cards when you're 1-2 knights away from largest army
- Use knight cards immediately when advantageous (don't save unless close to largest army)
- Victory point cards should only supplement your main strategy, not replace it
- Road Building cards are most valuable when you're cut off or racing to a key location
- Monopoly is best used after high-probability dice rolls to collect opponent's stockpile
- Year of Plenty is ideal to complete a high-value build (settlement or city)
- NEVER delay settlement/city building to purchase development cards unless 1 VP from winning

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY FOCUS):
- Aim for 5 total settlements (2 upgraded to cities) = 9 VP
- Then secure largest army OR longest road for the final point
- Always calculate the fastest path to 10 VP in terms of resource costs
- For each potential build, calculate how many turns closer it gets you to victory
- Determine which victory paths are still viable based on board state
- Switch strategies when your primary path is blocked
- Plan for the end-game by turn 10 (know exactly how you will reach 10 points)
- Track opponent's path to victory and actively disrupt with roads or robber

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Trade at ports even at 4:1 ratio if it enables immediate critical build
- NEVER trade with opponent unless it enables an immediate settlement/city build
- Avoid trades that allow opponent to build immediately after you
- Calculate the net VP gain of each potential trade
- Use trades to dispose of resources when at risk from robber
- Combine multiple port trades to convert unwanted resources into needed ones
- Be willing to overpay through port trades to secure critical positional advantage

DECISION FRAMEWORK (APPLY TO EVERY TURN):
1. What is my immediate build priority? (settlement > city > longest road/largest army)
2. What resource do I need to complete my highest priority build?
3. What is the fastest way to acquire that resource? (production, trading, development cards)

# Analyzing the Game State

First, let's understand the current situation:
- I have 4/10 victory points (2 settlements + Longest Road bonus)
- RED has 3/10 victory points (1 settlement + 1 city)
- The robber is currently on wheat (0, 1, -1)
- I need to choose where to move the robber

## Resource Analysis
- RED has 5 hidden resources
- I have limited resources (1 brick, 1 sheep, 1 ore)
- The robber should target RED's highest producing hexes to disrupt their strategy

## RED's Production Hexes
RED has settlements/cities on:
- Node 20: produces wheat (4) and brick (6)
- Node 9: City that produces sheep (3) and ore (5)

The city at node 9 is particularly valuable because it doubles production.

## Robber Placement Options

Let's analyze each option:
- [0] Desert (0, 0, 0) - Wastes the robber move as desert produces nothing
- [1] Sheep (1, -1, 0) - Blocks RED's city at node 9, steal from RED
- [2] Ore (0, -1, 1) - Blocks RED's city at node 9, steal from RED
- [3] Wood (−1, 0, 1) - Only affects my own settlement
- [4] Wheat (−1, 1, 0) - Doesn't affect any settlements
- [5] Brick (1, 0, -1) - Blocks RED's settlement at node 20, steal from RED

## Strategic Considerations
1. I should target RED's highest production
2. RED's city at node 9 is producing double resources on ore and sheep
3. Brick is also important for RED (settlement at node 20)
4. I should prioritize blocking ore (high value for cities) or brick (expansion)

Given RED has 5 cards, they may be planning a significant build. The most strategic options are:

- Option [2] - Block ore (5) which affects RED's city (highly valuable for city building)
- Option [5] - Block brick (6) which affects RED's settlement (valuable for expansion)
- Option [1] - Block sheep (3) which affects RED's city

Since RED has a city and likely moving toward city building, blocking ore seems most strategic. Additionally, ore is a 5 (⭐⭐) which is a medium-high probability.

<plan>
Block RED's ore production to slow down their city development. Continue building roads toward good settlement locations, focusing on connecting to wheat. Save resources for a future settlement placement.
</plan>

# Game Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state and determine the optimal action:

## Game State Summary
- I have 4 VP (2 settlements + longest road bonus)
- Red has 3 VP (1 settlement + 1 city)
- I have 1 brick, 2 sheep, 1 ore and 1 Knight development card
- The robber is currently on the ore hex (0, -1, 1)
- Red has a city at node 9, connected to the ore hex that's currently blocked
- Red has 4 hidden resource cards

## Action Options
1. Play Knight card - Move the robber and steal a resource
2. End my turn

## Strategic Considerations

The robber is currently on the ore hex (0, -1, 1) which is already blocking Red's city production. This aligns with my current plan to block Red's ore production to slow their city development.

If I play the Knight card now:
- I would move the robber to another hex, likely unblocking the ore for Red
- I'd steal one random resource from Red
- I'd make progress toward largest army (1/3 knights needed)

If I end my turn:
- The robber stays blocking Red's ore production
- I keep my knight card for future strategic use
- I maintain my current resource position

Looking at Red's city at node 9, it produces sheep (3) and ore (5) when not blocked. Since ore is crucial for city development, keeping the robber on this hex aligns perfectly with my plan to slow Red's progress.

I don't have enough resources to build anything significant right now, and playing the knight would likely unblock Red's ore production, which is counter to my strategy.

<plan>Continue blocking RED's ore production with the robber. Save the knight card for when I need to move the robber from my own hexes or to steal a critical resource. Focus on collecting brick and wood to extend my road network, and aim for a new settlement soon.</plan>

The most strategic move is to end my turn, keeping the robber where it is blocking Red's ore production.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist focused on defeating the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRITICAL FOR SUCCESS):
- Above all else, target the highest probability numbers (6 & 8) - these produce resources 5/36 times each
- Strictly prioritize access to all five resources between your two settlements
- Aim for numerical diversity - try to cover 5-6 different dice numbers across your settlements
- Never place initial settlements without analyzing future expansion opportunities
- Prioritize placement on hexes with complementary resources: ore/wheat and brick/wood
- Position roads toward high-value unoccupied areas the opponent cannot easily block
- Choose second settlement to complement your first settlement's resource weaknesses
- Consider 3:1 ports if you can't access a specific resource through settlements
- Analyze opponent placement to avoid contested expansion paths
- ALWAYS calculate production value using probability dots (5-6-8-9 are top priority numbers)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-10):
- Build at least one new settlement by turn 10 - expansion is your TOP priority
- Calculate and build along the fastest path to your next settlement location
- Secure missing resources through strategic settlement placement
- Build roads that secure critical expansion paths before the opponent blocks them
- Avoid development cards completely until you have at least 3 total settlements
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1) to complete critical builds
- Target resource diversity through your expansion locations
- Create a minimum 2-turn expansion plan and stick to it

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT AND PRODUCTION (CORE STRATEGY):
- Early game: Focus on wood/brick to expand with roads and settlements
- Mid game: Transition to ore/wheat focus for cities and development cards
- Calculate the resource production value of every potential build
- Only make 4:1 trades when they enable an immediate important build
- Cycle through "build phases" - expansion phase, then city upgrade phase
- Plan resource collection 2 turns ahead to minimize wasteful trades
- Never accumulate 7+ cards before dice rolls
- Diversify production to minimize dependency on any single resource
- Target a minimum of 4 total settlements before prioritizing city upgrades

COUNTERING ALPHABETA ALGORITHM:
- AlphaBeta looks ahead only 2 steps, so plan your moves 3-4 steps ahead
- Create deceptive game states that appear less threatening than they are
- Block the opponent's highest-probability expansion paths immediately
- Play defensively during early game, then aggressively in mid-game
- When opponent has 7+ points, disrupt their highest-producing hex with the robber
- Track opponent's resources and block their most likely next build
- Secure resources that the opponent depends on heavily
- Place roads to cut off opponent from accessing high-value settlement locations
- Position settlements to deny opponent access to key resource hex intersections

ROBBER PLACEMENT AND KNIGHT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-producing hex of your opponent
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat in mid-game when cities are being built
- Target the specific resource the opponent needs for their next likely build
- Use knight cards reactively when the robber blocks your best production
- Save knight cards for the late game if pursuing largest army
- When stealing, select resources that complete your immediate build needs
- Keep track of opponent cards and target resources they've been collecting
- Balance robber placement between disruption and resource acquisition

DEVELOPMENT CARDS VS. BUILDING:
- Only buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and cannot build
- Buy development cards when you're 1-2 knights away from largest army
- Use knight cards immediately when advantageous (don't save unless close to largest army)
- Victory point cards should only supplement your main strategy, not replace it
- Road Building cards are most valuable when you're cut off or racing to a key location
- Monopoly is best used after high-probability dice rolls to collect opponent's stockpile
- Year of Plenty is ideal to complete a high-value build (settlement or city)
- NEVER delay settlement/city building to purchase development cards unless 1 VP from winning

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY FOCUS):
- Aim for 5 total settlements (2 upgraded to cities) = 9 VP
- Then secure largest army OR longest road for the final point
- Always calculate the fastest path to 10 VP in terms of resource costs
- For each potential build, calculate how many turns closer it gets you to victory
- Determine which victory paths are still viable based on board state
- Switch strategies when your primary path is blocked
- Plan for the end-game by turn 10 (know exactly how you will reach 10 points)
- Track opponent's path to victory and actively disrupt with roads or robber

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Trade at ports even at 4:1 ratio if it enables immediate critical build
- NEVER trade with opponent unless it enables an immediate settlement/city build
- Avoid trades that allow opponent to build immediately after you
- Calculate the net VP gain of each potential trade
- Use trades to dispose of resources when at risk from robber
- Combine multiple port trades to convert unwanted resources into needed ones
- Be willing to overpay through port trades to secure critical positional advantage

DECISION FRAMEWORK (APPLY TO EVERY TURN):
1. What is my immediate build priority? (settlement > city > longest road/largest army)
2. What resource do I need to complete my highest priority build?
3. What is the fastest way to acquire that resource? (production, trading, development cards)
4. How will this action position me for the next 3 turns?
5. Will this action disrupt my opponent's path to victory?
6. Is there a way to combine multiple actions this turn for greater efficiency?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 50 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  Continue blocking RED's ore production with the robber. Save the knight card for when I need to move the robber from my own hexes or to steal a critical resource. Focus on collecting brick and wood to extend my road network, and aim for a new settlement soon.
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.

# Game Analysis for Settlers of Catan Turn 50

Let me carefully analyze the current game state and my options for this turn.

## Game State Assessment
- I have 4 VP: 2 settlements (2 VP) + longest road (2 VP)
- RED has 3 VP: 1 settlement (1 VP) + 1 city (2 VP)
- I currently possess: 1 BRICK, 2 SHEEP, 1 ORE, and 1 KNIGHT card
- The robber is on the ore hex (0, -1, 1), which is marked with 🔍
- This ore hex is connected to RED's city at node 9, blocking their ore production

## Options Analysis
I have two options:
1. **Play Knight card** - Move the robber and steal a resource from RED
2. **Roll the dice** - Continue normal turn sequence

### Option 0: Play Knight
- Advantages:
  - I could move the robber to another hex that RED depends on (like the brick hex)
  - I could steal one of RED's 4 resources
  - Start working toward largest army
- Disadvantages:
  - The robber is already on a good spot blocking RED's ore production from their city
  - My only ore production is also on this hex, so moving it doesn't benefit me
  - I might need the knight later when the robber is moved to one of my productive hexes

### Option 1: Roll the Dice
- Advantages:
  - I could gain more resources to build with
  - The robber stays on the ore hex, continuing to block RED's ore production
  - I keep my knight card for when I really need it
- Disadvantages:
  - Risk of rolling a 7 with only 4 cards (not a big risk)

## Strategic Consideration
The knight card is more valuable to me later because:
1. The robber is already in a good strategic position
2. I may need the knight when the robber blocks my own resources
3. Saving the knight contributes toward potentially getting largest army later

My current plan of blocking RED's ore production is working well. I should continue with it and focus on gathering resources for expansion.

<plan>
Continue blocking RED's ore production with the robber. Roll the dice to collect resources. Focus on expanding my road network toward potential settlement spots. Save the knight card for when I need to move the robber from my critical hexes or when I'm closer to getting largest army.
</plan>

Based on my analysis, I should roll the dice rather than playing the knight card.

# Game Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state and my options carefully:

## Current Game State
- I have 4 victory points (2 settlements + longest road)
- I control the longest road with 5 segments
- I have 1 brick, 2 sheep, 1 ore, and 1 knight card
- The robber is currently on ore (5), which is blocking:
  - My settlement at node 12 (ore production)
  - RED's city at node 9 (ore production, doubled)
- RED has 3 victory points (1 settlement + 1 city)

## Available Actions
[0] Play Knight card - Move the robber and steal a resource
[1] End turn

## Option Analysis

### Option 0: Play Knight Card
- Advantages:
  - I could move the robber off my ore production at node 12
  - I could steal a resource from RED (they have 4 cards)
  - I could continue blocking RED's resources with a different placement
- Disadvantages:
  - The robber is already on a hex that hurts RED more than me (blocking their city's ore production)
  - I would be using my knight card early instead of saving it for a more critical moment
  - I only have 4 resources total, so I can't build anything significant this turn anyway

### Option 1: End Turn
- Advantages:
  - I save my knight card for when I really need it
  - The robber stays on RED's city ore production, continuing to block their city's productivity
  - I'll be able to roll the dice next turn and collect more resources
- Disadvantages:
  - My ore production remains blocked

## Strategic Consideration
The robber is currently in an optimal position as it's blocking RED's city ore production more than it's blocking my settlement. Since I only have 4 resources and can't build anything significant this turn, it makes more sense to save the knight card for when:
1. The robber is moved to one of my critical hexes
2. I'm closer to getting largest army
3. I need a specific resource from RED to complete a build

<plan>Continue with current strategy - maintain robber on RED's ore city production while expanding my road network toward potential settlement spots. Save knight card for defensive use when the robber targets my key hexes or for pursuing largest army later. Next goals: collect resources for a third settlement or city upgrade to progress toward 10 VP.</plan>

Based on this analysis, I should end my turn and roll the dice next turn.

- Save knight cards for the late game if pursuing largest army
- When stealing, select resources that complete your immediate build needs
- Keep track of opponent cards and target resources they've been collecting
- Balance robber placement between disruption and resource acquisition

DEVELOPMENT CARDS VS. BUILDING:
- Only buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and cannot build
- Buy development cards when you're 1-2 knights away from largest army
- Use knight cards immediately when advantageous (don't save unless close to largest army)
- Victory point cards should only supplement your main strategy, not replace it
- Road Building cards are most valuable when you're cut off or racing to a key location
- Monopoly is best used after high-probability dice rolls to collect opponent's stockpile
- Year of Plenty is ideal to complete a high-value build (settlement or city)
- NEVER delay settlement/city building to purchase development cards unless 1 VP from winning

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY FOCUS):
- Aim for 5 total settlements (2 upgraded to cities) = 9 VP
- Then secure largest army OR longest road for the final point
- Always calculate the fastest path to 10 VP in terms of resource costs
- For each potential build, calculate how many turns closer it gets you to victory
- Determine which victory paths are still viable based on board state
- Switch strategies when your primary path is blocked
- Plan for the end-game by turn 10 (know exactly how you will reach 10 points)
- Track opponent's path to victory and actively disrupt with roads or robber

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Trade at ports even at 4:1 ratio if it enables immediate critical build
- NEVER trade with opponent unless it enables an immediate settlement/city build
- Avoid trades that allow opponent to build immediately after you
- Calculate the net VP gain of each potential trade
- Use trades to dispose of resources when at risk from robber
- Combine multiple port trades to convert unwanted resources into needed ones
- Be willing to overpay through port trades to secure critical positional advantage

DECISION FRAMEWORK (APPLY TO EVERY TURN):
1. What is my immediate build priority? (settlement > city > longest road/largest army)
2. What resource do I need to complete my highest priority build?
3. What is the fastest way to acquire that resource? (production, trading, development cards)
4. How will this action position me for the next 3 turns?
5. Will this action disrupt my opponent's path to victory?
6. Is there a way to combine multiple actions this turn for greater efficiency?

TURN 52 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  Continue with current strategy - maintain robber on RED's ore city production while expanding my road network toward potential settlement spots. Save knight card for defensive use when the robber targets my key hexes or for pursuing largest army later. Next goals: collect resources for a third settlement or city upgrade to progress toward 10 VP.

# Game Analysis: Turn 52 for Blue Player

First, let me assess the current game state and my available options:

## Current Status
- I have 4 VP: 2 settlements (2 VP) + Longest Road bonus (2 VP)
- My resources: 1 🧱BRICK, 2 🐑SHEEP, 1 ⛏️ORE
- Development Cards: 1 KNIGHT
- The opponent has 3 VP: 1 settlement (1 VP) + 1 city (2 VP)
- The robber is already on opponent RED's ore hex (0, -1, 1)

## Available Actions
- [0] Play Knight card - Move robber and steal a resource
- [1] Roll the dice

## Analysis

### Option 0: Play Knight Card
- Advantage: I could steal one of RED's 4 cards
- Disadvantage: The robber is already on RED's high-value ore hex (5 is a good number)
- I'd essentially be using my knight card without gaining significant positional advantage
- I should save this knight card for when:
  1. The robber is placed on one of my productive hexes
  2. I'm pursuing largest army in the late game

### Option 1: Roll the Dice
- Primary action to progress the game
- I can produce more resources (potentially from my 8 wood and 6 brick)
- After rolling, I'll have more options including building more roads or saving for a settlement
- Rolling is the natural progression of the game when there's no urgent need to play development cards

## Strategic Considerations
- My knight card is a valuable defensive asset for when RED eventually targets my best production (8 wood)
- I don't have enough resources to build anything significant yet, so generating more resources is the priority
- RED only has 3 VP to my 4 VP, so I'm currently ahead

<plan>
Continue with current strategy - keep the robber on RED's ore production while rolling to gather resources. Save knight card for defensive use when the robber targets my key production hexes. Focus on collecting resources for another settlement to increase my production and victory points.
</plan>

The optimal choice is to roll the dice and continue gathering resources.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist focused on defeating the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRITICAL FOR SUCCESS):
- Above all else, target the highest probability numbers (6 & 8) - these produce resources 5/36 times each
- Strictly prioritize access to all five resources between your two settlements
- Aim for numerical diversity - try to cover 5-6 different dice numbers across your settlements
- Never place initial settlements without analyzing future expansion opportunities
- Prioritize placement on hexes with complementary resources: ore/wheat and brick/wood
- Position roads toward high-value unoccupied areas the opponent cannot easily block
- Choose second settlement to complement your first settlement's resource weaknesses
- Consider 3:1 ports if you can't access a specific resource through settlements
- Analyze opponent placement to avoid contested expansion paths
- ALWAYS calculate production value using probability dots (5-6-8-9 are top priority numbers)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-10):
- Build at least one new settlement by turn 10 - expansion is your TOP priority
- Calculate and build along the fastest path to your next settlement location
- Secure missing resources through strategic settlement placement
- Build roads that secure critical expansion paths before the opponent blocks them
- Avoid development cards completely until you have at least 3 total settlements
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1) to complete critical builds
- Target resource diversity through your expansion locations
- Create a minimum 2-turn expansion plan and stick to it

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT AND PRODUCTION (CORE STRATEGY):
- Early game: Focus on wood/brick to expand with roads and settlements
- Mid game: Transition to ore/wheat focus for cities and development cards
- Calculate the resource production value of every potential build
- Only make 4:1 trades when they enable an immediate important build
- Cycle through "build phases" - expansion phase, then city upgrade phase
- Plan resource collection 2 turns ahead to minimize wasteful trades
- Never accumulate 7+ cards before dice rolls
- Diversify production to minimize dependency on any single resource
- Target a minimum of 4 total settlements before prioritizing city upgrades

COUNTERING ALPHABETA ALGORITHM:
- AlphaBeta looks ahead only 2 steps, so plan your moves 3-4 steps ahead
- Create deceptive game states that appear less threatening than they are
- Block the opponent's highest-probability expansion paths immediately
- Play defensively during early game, then aggressively in mid-game
- When opponent has 7+ points, disrupt their highest-producing hex with the robber
- Track opponent's resources and block their most likely next build
- Secure resources that the opponent depends on heavily
- Place roads to cut off opponent from accessing high-value settlement locations
- Position settlements to deny opponent access to key resource hex intersections

ROBBER PLACEMENT AND KNIGHT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-producing hex of your opponent
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat in mid-game when cities are being built
- Target the specific resource the opponent needs for their next likely build
- Use knight cards reactively when the robber blocks your best production
- Save knight cards for the late game if pursuing largest army
- When stealing, select resources that complete your immediate build needs
- Keep track of opponent cards and target resources they've been collecting
- Balance robber placement between disruption and resource acquisition

# Game State Analysis

Let me analyze the current situation:

## Game Status
- I (BLUE) have 4/10 victory points (2 settlements + longest road bonus)
- RED has 3/10 victory points (1 settlement + 1 city)
- I have 1 BRICK, 2 SHEEP, 1 ORE and 1 KNIGHT development card
- I need to move the robber from (0, -1, 1), which is the ore hex

## Player Settlements & Production
- BLUE: Settlement at node 12 (produces ORE5, WOOD8)
- BLUE: Settlement at node 1 (produces SHEEP3, BRICK6)
- RED: Settlement at node 20 (produces WHEAT4, BRICK6)
- RED: City at node 9 (produces SHEEP3, ORE5 - double production)

## Robber Placement Strategy
The robber is currently on (0, -1, 1) which is the ore hex. Since I need to move it, I should evaluate all options:

[0] Move to (0, 0, 0) - desert tile - not productive
[1] Move to (1, -1, 0) - sheep3 hex - can steal from RED
[2] Move to (-1, 0, 1) - wood8 hex - blocks my own production (bad)
[3] Move to (-1, 1, 0) - wheat10 hex - not connected to RED
[4] Move to (0, 1, -1) - wheat4 hex - can steal from RED
[5] Move to (1, 0, -1) - brick6 hex - can steal from RED

In the mid-game, disrupting opponent's ore/wheat production is critical since they need these for cities and development cards.

## Decision Process

Option [1] - Placing on sheep3 hex:
- Blocks RED's city at node 9 (reduces double sheep production)
- Can steal a resource from RED
- Sheep is less valuable than ore/wheat at this stage

Option [4] - Placing on wheat4 hex:
- Blocks RED's settlement at node 20
- Can steal from RED
- Wheat4 has lower probability (only ⭐) but wheat is critical for cities

Option [5] - Placing on brick6 hex:
- Blocks RED's settlement at node 20
- Can steal from RED
- Brick6 is high probability (⭐⭐⭐)
- Brick is critical for roads/settlements

I should avoid option [2] which would block my own wood production, and option [0] is a waste as desert produces nothing.

Looking at RED's settlements, they have double production on ORE (from city) and access to SHEEP, WHEAT, and BRICK. They're likely pursuing a city-development card strategy with ORE/WHEAT focus.

RED's most valuable production is their city on node 9 producing ORE. The robber is already on that hex, so I need to move it. Their next most valuable hex would be BRICK6, which is high probability (⭐⭐⭐).

<plan>Place robber on RED's high-probability brick production to limit their expansion ability. Use my knight card defensively if RED blocks my key production. Focus on collecting resources for my next settlement while maintaining longest road.</plan>

Given this analysis, I'll place the robber on the brick6 hex and potentially steal a valuable resource from RED. This disrupts their ability to build roads and settlements while maintaining my expansion advantage.

# Game Analysis for Turn 52

I'll analyze the current game state and my available options carefully.

## Current Game State
- **My Victory Points**: 4/10 (2 settlements + 2 VP for longest road)
- **Opponent's VP**: 3/10 (1 settlement + 1 city)
- **My Resources**: 2 🧱BRICK, 2 🐑SHEEP, 1 ⛏️ORE
- **Development Cards**: 1 KNIGHT card
- **Robber**: Currently on RED's 🧱BRICK hex (1, 0, -1)

## Action Options Analysis
I have two options:
1. Play Knight card - Move robber and steal a resource
2. End turn

### Option 1: Play Knight Card
**Pros:**
- Could move the robber to block RED's other productive hex (🐑3 or ⛏️5)
- Would steal a resource from RED (they have 3 cards)
- Would progress toward largest army (first knight played)

**Cons:**
- The robber is already on RED's high-value brick production
- I don't have an immediate build ready that would benefit from an extra resource
- Knight cards are more valuable defensively or when close to largest army

### Option 2: End Turn
**Pros:**
- Robber is already in an optimal position, blocking RED's 6-value brick production
- Save knight card for defense if RED moves robber onto my important hexes
- No immediate build opportunity that would be enabled by playing knight

**Cons:**
- Miss opportunity to steal a resource
- Miss opportunity to start building toward largest army

## Strategic Considerations
1. **Resource Status**: With my current resources (2 brick, 2 sheep, 1 ore), I'm not close to building anything significant. A settlement needs wood+brick+sheep+wheat, and I'm missing wood and wheat.

2. **Robber Position**: The robber is already on RED's high-value brick hex (6), which is an optimal position as it blocks a critical expansion resource.

3. **Knight Card Value**: The knight card is more valuable as a defensive tool right now, especially since I'm not close to largest army. Saving it allows me to respond if RED blocks one of my productive hexes.

4. **Longest Road**: I have longest road (5 segments), giving me 2 VP. Protecting this advantage is crucial.

<plan>Preserve knight card for defensive use. Continue blocking RED's brick production with the robber. Focus on collecting wheat and wood for my next settlement while maintaining longest road advantage. Use knight card defensively if RED moves robber to my key production hexes.</plan>

## Decision
The robber is already in an optimal position blocking RED's brick production (value 6). Playing the knight would not improve this blocking position significantly. I should save my knight card for defensive purposes, especially since I'm not close to making a build this turn or competing for largest army yet.

The most strategic move is to end my turn and wait for better opportunities to use my knight card.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist focused on defeating the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRITICAL FOR SUCCESS):
- Above all else, target the highest probability numbers (6 & 8) - these produce resources 5/36 times each
- Strictly prioritize access to all five resources between your two settlements
- Aim for numerical diversity - try to cover 5-6 different dice numbers across your settlements
- Never place initial settlements without analyzing future expansion opportunities
- Prioritize placement on hexes with complementary resources: ore/wheat and brick/wood
- Position roads toward high-value unoccupied areas the opponent cannot easily block
- Choose second settlement to complement your first settlement's resource weaknesses
- Consider 3:1 ports if you can't access a specific resource through settlements
- Analyze opponent placement to avoid contested expansion paths
- ALWAYS calculate production value using probability dots (5-6-8-9 are top priority numbers)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-10):
- Build at least one new settlement by turn 10 - expansion is your TOP priority
- Calculate and build along the fastest path to your next settlement location
- Secure missing resources through strategic settlement placement
- Build roads that secure critical expansion paths before the opponent blocks them
- Avoid development cards completely until you have at least 3 total settlements
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1) to complete critical builds
- Target resource diversity through your expansion locations
- Create a minimum 2-turn expansion plan and stick to it

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT AND PRODUCTION (CORE STRATEGY):
- Early game: Focus on wood/brick to expand with roads and settlements
- Mid game: Transition to ore/wheat focus for cities and development cards
- Calculate the resource production value of every potential build
- Only make 4:1 trades when they enable an immediate important build
- Cycle through "build phases" - expansion phase, then city upgrade phase
- Plan resource collection 2 turns ahead to minimize wasteful trades
- Never accumulate 7+ cards before dice rolls
- Diversify production to minimize dependency on any single resource
- Target a minimum of 4 total settlements before prioritizing city upgrades

COUNTERING ALPHABETA ALGORITHM:
- AlphaBeta looks ahead only 2 steps, so plan your moves 3-4 steps ahead
- Create deceptive game states that appear less threatening than they are
- Block the opponent's highest-probability expansion paths immediately
- Play defensively during early game, then aggressively in mid-game
- When opponent has 7+ points, disrupt their highest-producing hex with the robber
- Track opponent's resources and block their most likely next build
- Secure resources that the opponent depends on heavily
- Place roads to cut off opponent from accessing high-value settlement locations
- Position settlements to deny opponent access to key resource hex intersections

ROBBER PLACEMENT AND KNIGHT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-producing hex of your opponent
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat in mid-game when cities are being built
- Target the specific resource the opponent needs for their next likely build
- Use knight cards reactively when the robber blocks your best production
- Save knight cards for the late game if pursuing largest army
- When stealing, select resources that complete your immediate build needs
- Keep track of opponent cards and target resources they've been collecting
- Balance robber placement between disruption and resource acquisition

DEVELOPMENT CARDS VS. BUILDING:
- Only buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and cannot build
- Buy development cards when you're 1-2 knights away from largest army
- Use knight cards immediately when advantageous (don't save unless close to largest army)
- Victory point cards should only supplement your main strategy, not replace it
- Road Building cards are most valuable when you're cut off or racing to a key location
- Monopoly is best used after high-probability dice rolls to collect opponent's stockpile
- Year of Plenty is ideal to complete a high-value build (settlement or city)
- NEVER delay settlement/city building to purchase development cards unless 1 VP from winning

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY FOCUS):
- Aim for 5 total settlements (2 upgraded to cities) = 9 VP
- Then secure largest army OR longest road for the final point
- Always calculate the fastest path to 10 VP in terms of resource costs
- For each potential build, calculate how many turns closer it gets you to victory
- Determine which victory paths are still viable based on board state
- Switch strategies when your primary path is blocked
- Plan for the end-game by turn 10 (know exactly how you will reach 10 points)
- Track opponent's path to victory and actively disrupt with roads or robber

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Trade at ports even at 4:1 ratio if it enables immediate critical build
- NEVER trade with opponent unless it enables an immediate settlement/city build
- Avoid trades that allow opponent to build immediately after you
- Calculate the net VP gain of each potential trade
- Use trades to dispose of resources when at risk from robber
- Combine multiple port trades to convert unwanted resources into needed ones
- Be willing to overpay through port trades to secure critical positional advantage

DECISION FRAMEWORK (APPLY TO EVERY TURN):
1. What is my immediate build priority? (settlement > city > longest road/largest army)
2. What resource do I need to complete my highest priority build?
3. What is the fastest way to acquire that resource? (production, trading, development cards)
4. How will this action position me for the next 3 turns?
5. Will this action disrupt my opponent's path to victory?
6. Is there a way to combine multiple actions this turn for greater efficiency?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 54 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  Preserve knight card for defensive use. Continue blocking RED's brick production with the robber. Focus on collecting wheat and wood for my next settlement while maintaining longest road advantage. Use knight card defensively if RED moves robber to my key production hexes.
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.

❓ Select action by number (0-1):


Based on this information, which action number do you choose? Think step by step about your options, then put the final action number in a box like \boxed{1}.
RESPONSE:
I'll analyze this game state carefully to choose the optimal action between playing my Knight card now or rolling the dice.

First, let's assess the current situation:
- I have 4 VP (2 settlements + longest road bonus)
- RED has 3 VP (1 settlement + 1 city)
- The robber is currently on RED's brick hex (1,0,-1), which is a 6 (high-value)
- I have resources: 1 wood, 2 brick, 2 sheep, 1 ore, and 1 knight card

Key decision factors:
1) Knight card timing - Is now the optimal time to use it?
2) Resource needs - What do I need most right now?
3) Opponent status - What is RED likely planning?

If I play the Knight card (option 0):
- I can move the robber to another of RED's production hexes (likely the 5/ore or 3/sheep)
- I steal one random resource from RED (they have 3 cards)
- I use up my defensive knight card

If I roll the dice (option 1):
- I may gain additional resources to build
- There's a risk of rolling a 7 (I have 6 resources, so I'm not at risk of losing any)
- I keep my knight card for future defensive or strategic use

The robber is already on RED's high-value brick hex (6), which is ideal placement. RED has a city on node 9 that produces sheep and ore, so those are important resources for them. However, the robber is already optimally placed on their brick production, which is critical for their expansion.

Currently, I have a strong road network with longest road bonus. My next strategic goal should be building another settlement, which requires 1 wood, 1 brick, 1 sheep, and 1 wheat. I have wood, brick, and sheep, but I'm missing wheat.

Rolling gives me a chance to collect more resources, including potentially wheat from a good roll. The knight card is more valuable as a defensive tool or for later strategic use when RED might place the robber on my critical hexes.

<plan>Roll the dice to collect more resources. Save the knight card for defensive use or when RED moves the robber to my key production hexes. Focus on acquiring wheat to build my next settlement. Continue blocking RED's brick production with the robber.</plan>

Given this analysis, I should roll the dice rather than play the knight card now.

# Game Analysis for Turn 54

Let me carefully analyze the current game state and available actions to determine the optimal move.

## Current Game Status
- **BLUE (me)**: 4/10 VP (2 settlements + Longest Road bonus of 2 VP)
- **RED**: 3/10 VP (1 settlement + 1 city)
- **Resources I have**: 1 Wood, 2 Brick, 2 Sheep, 1 Ore
- **Development Cards**: 1 Knight card
- **Robber** is currently on RED's brick hex (1,0,-1) with a value of 6

## Strategic Assessment

First, I need to evaluate my options:

1. **Play Knight (Action 0)**: Moving the robber and stealing a resource.
2. **End Turn (Action 1)**: Doing nothing this turn.
3. **Build Road (Actions 2-11)**: Using 1 Wood + 1 Brick to extend my road network.

Since I already have the Longest Road bonus, building more roads doesn't directly increase my VP. The main reasons to build roads would be:
- Extend toward valuable settlement locations
- Block RED's expansion opportunities
- Secure my Longest Road bonus if RED threatens it

Currently, RED only has 2 road segments compared to my 7, so there's no immediate threat to my Longest Road bonus.

The robber is already on RED's high-value brick hex (a 6), which is excellent positioning for disrupting their production. Moving it with a Knight card seems unnecessary at this moment, especially since I want to save Knight cards for defensive purposes or to gain Largest Army later.

Looking at my resources, I notice I have exactly what's needed for a road (1 Wood + 2 Brick). Building a road would use my resources efficiently and prevent losing cards to the robber if a 7 is rolled.

## Road Placement Analysis

Let me analyze the potential road placements to determine which provides the best strategic value:

- I need to identify which road placement leads toward valuable settlement locations
- I should look for roads that block RED's expansion
- I should prioritize roads that lead to resource diversity, especially wheat since I don't currently have access to it

Based on the board description, roads leading toward wheat hexes would be most valuable since my current settlements don't produce wheat. The hexes (-1,1,0) and (0,1,-1) both produce wheat.

Looking at the available road options and correlating them with the node information, roads that move toward nodes connected to these wheat hexes would be most strategic.

## Decision

After analyzing the board, I've determined that building a road is my best option. Road option #8 (edge 0,5) appears to be most strategic as it connects toward the wheat hex (0,1,-1) with value 4, allowing me to potentially build a settlement there in the future. This would give me access to wheat, which I'm currently missing.

<plan>Continue expanding toward wheat-producing hexes. Build a road at edge (0,5) this turn. In future turns, build another road and a settlement to secure wheat production. Keep the robber on RED's brick production. Save the Knight card for when RED places the robber on my key production hexes.</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist focused on defeating the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRITICAL FOR SUCCESS):
- Above all else, target the highest probability numbers (6 & 8) - these produce resources 5/36 times each
- Strictly prioritize access to all five resources between your two settlements
- Aim for numerical diversity - try to cover 5-6 different dice numbers across your settlements
- Never place initial settlements without analyzing future expansion opportunities
- Prioritize placement on hexes with complementary resources: ore/wheat and brick/wood
- Position roads toward high-value unoccupied areas the opponent cannot easily block
- Choose second settlement to complement your first settlement's resource weaknesses
- Consider 3:1 ports if you can't access a specific resource through settlements
- Analyze opponent placement to avoid contested expansion paths
- ALWAYS calculate production value using probability dots (5-6-8-9 are top priority numbers)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-10):
- Build at least one new settlement by turn 10 - expansion is your TOP priority
- Calculate and build along the fastest path to your next settlement location
- Secure missing resources through strategic settlement placement
- Build roads that secure critical expansion paths before the opponent blocks them
- Avoid development cards completely until you have at least 3 total settlements
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1) to complete critical builds
- Target resource diversity through your expansion locations
- Create a minimum 2-turn expansion plan and stick to it

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT AND PRODUCTION (CORE STRATEGY):
- Early game: Focus on wood/brick to expand with roads and settlements
- Mid game: Transition to ore/wheat focus for cities and development cards
- Calculate the resource production value of every potential build
- Only make 4:1 trades when they enable an immediate important build
- Cycle through "build phases" - expansion phase, then city upgrade phase
- Plan resource collection 2 turns ahead to minimize wasteful trades
- Never accumulate 7+ cards before dice rolls
- Diversify production to minimize dependency on any single resource
- Target a minimum of 4 total settlements before prioritizing city upgrades

COUNTERING ALPHABETA ALGORITHM:
- AlphaBeta looks ahead only 2 steps, so plan your moves 3-4 steps ahead
- Create deceptive game states that appear less threatening than they are
- Block the opponent's highest-probability expansion paths immediately
- Play defensively during early game, then aggressively in mid-game
- When opponent has 7+ points, disrupt their highest-producing hex with the robber
- Track opponent's resources and block their most likely next build
- Secure resources that the opponent depends on heavily
- Place roads to cut off opponent from accessing high-value settlement locations
- Position settlements to deny opponent access to key resource hex intersections

ROBBER PLACEMENT AND KNIGHT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-producing hex of your opponent
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat in mid-game when cities are being built
- Target the specific resource the opponent needs for their next likely build
- Use knight cards reactively when the robber blocks your best production
- Save knight cards for the late game if pursuing largest army
- When stealing, select resources that complete your immediate build needs
- Keep track of opponent cards and target resources they've been collecting
- Balance robber placement between disruption and resource acquisition

DEVELOPMENT CARDS VS. BUILDING:
- Only buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and cannot build
- Buy development cards when you're 1-2 knights away from largest army
- Use knight cards immediately when advantageous (don't save unless close to largest army)
- Victory point cards should only supplement your main strategy, not replace it
- Road Building cards are most valuable when you're cut off or racing to a key location
- Monopoly is best used after high-probability dice rolls to collect opponent's stockpile
- Year of Plenty is ideal to complete a high-value build (settlement or city)
- NEVER delay settlement/city building to purchase development cards unless 1 VP from winning

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY FOCUS):
- Aim for 5 total settlements (2 upgraded to cities) = 9 VP
- Then secure largest army OR longest road for the final point
- Always calculate the fastest path to 10 VP in terms of resource costs
- For each potential build, calculate how many turns closer it gets you to victory
- Determine which victory paths are still viable based on board state
- Switch strategies when your primary path is blocked
- Plan for the end-game by turn 10 (know exactly how you will reach 10 points)
- Track opponent's path to victory and actively disrupt with roads or robber

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Trade at ports even at 4:1 ratio if it enables immediate critical build
- NEVER trade with opponent unless it enables an immediate settlement/city build
- Avoid trades that allow opponent to build immediately after you
- Calculate the net VP gain of each potential trade
- Use trades to dispose of resources when at risk from robber
- Combine multiple port trades to convert unwanted resources into needed ones
- Be willing to overpay through port trades to secure critical positional advantage

DECISION FRAMEWORK (APPLY TO EVERY TURN):
1. What is my immediate build priority? (settlement > city > longest road/largest army)
2. What resource do I need to complete my highest priority build?
3. What is the fastest way to acquire that resource? (production, trading, development cards)
4. How will this action position me for the next 3 turns?
5. Will this action disrupt my opponent's path to victory?
6. Is there a way to combine multiple actions this turn for greater efficiency?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game State Analysis for Settlers of Catan Turn 54

I'll analyze the current game state and make the optimal decision to maximize my win probability.

## Current Game Status
- I'm at 4/10 VP (2 settlements, longest road bonus +2)
- Opponent is at 3/10 VP (1 settlement, 1 city)
- I have resources: 1 brick, 2 sheep, 1 ore
- I have 1 Knight development card
- Robber is currently on opponent's brick hex (1,0,-1), which produces on a 6

## Available Actions
- [0] Play Knight card - Move the robber and steal a resource
- [1] End turn

## Strategic Analysis

The robber is already placed on a critical resource hex for my opponent (brick on a high-probability 6), which is beneficial for me. Playing my Knight card now would:

1. Allow me to move the robber (but it's already in a good position)
2. Let me steal one random resource from RED
3. Count toward Largest Army bonus (+2VP) in the future

However, I should consider:
- I don't currently have enough resources to build anything (road, settlement, or city)
- The Knight is more valuable defensively if RED places the robber on my key production
- Largest Army requires 3 knights minimum, and I only have 1 card now
- Keeping the Knight gives me flexibility for future turns

Looking at production:
- My 8-producing forest and 6-producing brick are my most valuable hexes
- If RED rolls a 7, they may target these hexes to slow me down
- Having a Knight in reserve is valuable defense against this

## Decision

I should save my Knight card for defensive purposes. RED might place the robber on my key production (especially the 8-wood hex) in an upcoming turn. Additionally, the robber is already in an optimal position, blocking RED's brick production on a high-probability number.

<plan>
Continue with current plan: Save the Knight card for defensive purposes or when RED has accumulated more resources worth stealing. Focus on collecting resources for my next build (road toward wheat-producing hexes). Keep the robber on RED's brick production to limit their expansion capabilities.
</plan>

# Analyzing Game State

Let me analyze the current game state and determine my optimal action.

## Current Situation Analysis:
- I have 4/10 VP (2 settlements + longest road bonus)
- RED has 3/10 VP (1 settlement + 1 city)
- I have 1 Knight card available to play
- My resources: 1 brick, 2 sheep, 1 ore
- Robber is already on RED's brick hex (1, 0, -1)
- My settlements produce ore, wood, brick, and sheep

## Options Analysis:

**Option 0: Play Knight Card**
- Advantages:
  - Could steal one of RED's 3 resources
  - Can reposition the robber to block another important production hex for RED
  - Gets me 1 step closer to Largest Army (need 3 knights total)
- Disadvantages:
  - Knight cards are more valuable when the robber is on my hexes
  - Currently robber is already on RED's brick hex, which is a good position
  - I don't have immediate build plans that would benefit from random resource theft

**Option 1: Roll the Dice**
- Advantages:
  - Could produce more resources to progress my build plan
  - Preserves Knight card for when robber blocks my production
  - Aligns with current plan to collect resources for road building
- Disadvantages:
  - Risk of rolling 7 and losing half my cards (minimal with only 4 cards)

## Strategic Considerations:
- My Knight card has more value in reserve since the robber is already in a good position
- With only 4 cards, rolling a 7 won't hurt me
- I need more resources to continue expanding
- RED only has 3 cards, so stealing might not be very impactful

<plan>
Continue with current plan: Roll the dice to collect resources for my next build (road toward wheat-producing hexes). Keep Knight card for defensive purposes or when RED has accumulated more resources worth stealing. Keep the robber on RED's brick production to limit their expansion capabilities.

- Plan for the end-game by turn 10 (know exactly how you will reach 10 points)
- Track opponent's path to victory and actively disrupt with roads or robber

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Trade at ports even at 4:1 ratio if it enables immediate critical build
- NEVER trade with opponent unless it enables an immediate settlement/city build
- Avoid trades that allow opponent to build immediately after you
- Calculate the net VP gain of each potential trade
- Use trades to dispose of resources when at risk from robber
- Combine multiple port trades to convert unwanted resources into needed ones
- Be willing to overpay through port trades to secure critical positional advantage

DECISION FRAMEWORK (APPLY TO EVERY TURN):
1. What is my immediate build priority? (settlement > city > longest road/largest army)
2. What resource do I need to complete my highest priority build?
3. What is the fastest way to acquire that resource? (production, trading, development cards)
4. How will this action position me for the next 3 turns?
5. Will this action disrupt my opponent's path to victory?
6. Is there a way to combine multiple actions this turn for greater efficiency?

# Game Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state and available actions:

## Current Status
- I have 4 victory points (2 settlements + 2 from longest road)
- Resources: 1 wood, 1 brick, 2 sheep, 1 ore
- I have a Knight development card
- Robber is on RED's brick production hex
- RED has 3 victory points (1 settlement + 1 city)
- RED has 3 hidden resources

## Available Actions
I can:
1. Play Knight (move robber and steal resource)
2. End my turn
3. Build a road at one of several locations (using my wood + brick)

## Strategic Analysis

### Road Building Options
I have exactly enough resources (1 wood, 1 brick) to build one road. Let me analyze road placement options:

- Options 2-10 are all road building choices
- The strategic question is which road position best advances my plans toward:
  1. Setting up for my next settlement 
  2. Maintaining longest road advantage
  3. Blocking RED from expansion

Looking at the node map, I need to analyze which road would position me best for future settlement placement. With my current settlements at nodes 1 and 12, I should look for expansion toward productive hexes.

### Knight Card Consideration
I could play the Knight card to:
1. Move the robber to another one of RED's productive hexes
2. Steal one of RED's 3 resources

However, RED only has 3 resources now, so the impact would be limited. Better to save the Knight for when RED has accumulated more resources or if the robber gets placed on one of my productive hexes.

### Expansion Planning
I need to determine which road leads me toward my next settlement location. Without a more detailed map showing all potential settlement locations, I need to infer the best options.

Given the current board state, I should build a road that:
- Extends toward high-probability numbers I don't yet have (6, 8, 9, 10)
- Maintains my path for longest road
- Heads toward unexplored resource types (especially wheat, which I don't see in my current production)

<plan>
I'll build a road that positions me to expand toward wheat production. Looking at the coordinates, wheat is at (-1, 1, 0) with value 10 and at (0, 1, -1) with value 4. Since I already have wood, brick, sheep and ore, accessing wheat will give me all resource types. I'll choose the road option that best advances me toward these wheat hexes while maintaining my longest road advantage.
</plan>

Based on the coordinates and information provided, road option [7] at edge (5, 16) appears to be closest to the wheat-producing hexes. This would position me toward the wheat hex at (0, 1, -1) which produces on a roll of 4. While not a high-probability number, securing all 5 resources is strategic.

My final decision is to build a road at edge (5, 16):

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist focused on defeating the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRITICAL FOR SUCCESS):
- Above all else, target the highest probability numbers (6 & 8) - these produce resources 5/36 times each
- Strictly prioritize access to all five resources between your two settlements
- Aim for numerical diversity - try to cover 5-6 different dice numbers across your settlements
- Never place initial settlements without analyzing future expansion opportunities
- Prioritize placement on hexes with complementary resources: ore/wheat and brick/wood
- Position roads toward high-value unoccupied areas the opponent cannot easily block
- Choose second settlement to complement your first settlement's resource weaknesses
- Consider 3:1 ports if you can't access a specific resource through settlements
- Analyze opponent placement to avoid contested expansion paths
- ALWAYS calculate production value using probability dots (5-6-8-9 are top priority numbers)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-10):
- Build at least one new settlement by turn 10 - expansion is your TOP priority
- Calculate and build along the fastest path to your next settlement location
- Secure missing resources through strategic settlement placement
- Build roads that secure critical expansion paths before the opponent blocks them
- Avoid development cards completely until you have at least 3 total settlements
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1) to complete critical builds
- Target resource diversity through your expansion locations
- Create a minimum 2-turn expansion plan and stick to it

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT AND PRODUCTION (CORE STRATEGY):
- Early game: Focus on wood/brick to expand with roads and settlements
- Mid game: Transition to ore/wheat focus for cities and development cards
- Calculate the resource production value of every potential build
- Only make 4:1 trades when they enable an immediate important build
- Cycle through "build phases" - expansion phase, then city upgrade phase
- Plan resource collection 2 turns ahead to minimize wasteful trades
- Never accumulate 7+ cards before dice rolls
- Diversify production to minimize dependency on any single resource
- Target a minimum of 4 total settlements before prioritizing city upgrades

COUNTERING ALPHABETA ALGORITHM:
- AlphaBeta looks ahead only 2 steps, so plan your moves 3-4 steps ahead
- Create deceptive game states that appear less threatening than they are
- Block the opponent's highest-probability expansion paths immediately
- Play defensively during early game, then aggressively in mid-game
- When opponent has 7+ points, disrupt their highest-producing hex with the robber
- Track opponent's resources and block their most likely next build
- Secure resources that the opponent depends on heavily
- Place roads to cut off opponent from accessing high-value settlement locations
- Position settlements to deny opponent access to key resource hex intersections

ROBBER PLACEMENT AND KNIGHT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-producing hex of your opponent
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat in mid-game when cities are being built
- Target the specific resource the opponent needs for their next likely build
- Use knight cards reactively when the robber blocks your best production
- Save knight cards for the late game if pursuing largest army
- When stealing, select resources that complete your immediate build needs
- Keep track of opponent cards and target resources they've been collecting
- Balance robber placement between disruption and resource acquisition

DEVELOPMENT CARDS VS. BUILDING:
- Only buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and cannot build
- Buy development cards when you're 1-2 knights away from largest army
- Use knight cards immediately when advantageous (don't save unless close to largest army)
- Victory point cards should only supplement your main strategy, not replace it
- Road Building cards are most valuable when you're cut off or racing to a key location
- Monopoly is best used after high-probability dice rolls to collect opponent's stockpile
- Year of Plenty is ideal to complete a high-value build (settlement or city)
- NEVER delay settlement/city building to purchase development cards unless 1 VP from winning

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY FOCUS):
- Aim for 5 total settlements (2 upgraded to cities) = 9 VP
- Then secure largest army OR longest road for the final point
- Always calculate the fastest path to 10 VP in terms of resource costs
- For each potential build, calculate how many turns closer it gets you to victory
- Determine which victory paths are still viable based on board state
- Switch strategies when your primary path is blocked
- Plan for the end-game by turn 10 (know exactly how you will reach 10 points)
- Track opponent's path to victory and actively disrupt with roads or robber

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Trade at ports even at 4:1 ratio if it enables immediate critical build
- NEVER trade with opponent unless it enables an immediate settlement/city build
- Avoid trades that allow opponent to build immediately after you

# Game Analysis for Turn 56

Let me analyze my current position and options carefully to make the optimal decision.

## Current Game State Assessment
- I have 4 victory points (2 settlements + 2 for longest road)
- My resources: 2 sheep, 1 ore
- I have 1 knight development card
- The robber is on brick hex (1, 0, -1) with value 6, which is a high-value hex
- I cannot build anything right now (need wood+brick for road, wheat+sheep for settlement, or ore+wheat for city)

## Opponent Assessment
- Red has 3 VP (1 settlement + 1 city)
- Red has 3 hidden resource cards
- Red's city at node 9 produces sheep and ore
- Red's settlement at node 20 produces wheat and brick

## Knight Card Evaluation
If I play the knight card:
1. I would move the robber from the brick hex (where it's currently affecting both players) to another location
2. I could steal 1 random resource from Red
3. I'd make progress toward largest army (need 3 knights)

Optimal robber placement would be on the ore hex (0, -1, 1) with value 5, as it:
- Blocks Red's city production (this is significant as cities produce double resources)
- Doesn't affect my own production
- Targets a highly valuable number (5)

The stolen resource could potentially give me something I need for my next build, as Red likely has brick, wheat, or ore.

## Strategic Plan Update
<plan>
I'll play my knight card to move the robber to Red's ore-producing hex at (0, -1, 1) to disrupt their city production. This will give me a potential useful resource and start my path toward largest army. On future turns, I'll focus on acquiring wood and brick to continue road building toward wheat hexes, aiming to build my next settlement at a wheat location (near node 15 or 16).
</plan>

## Decision
Playing the knight card is clearly advantageous because:
- It disrupts Red's high-value production
- I get a resource that could be useful
- I start working toward largest army (another potential 2 VP)
- I have no immediate build options otherwise
- This positions me better for future turns

# Analyzing Game State and Robber Placement Options

Let me analyze each potential robber placement option to determine the optimal move.

## Analyzing Resource Production
- RED has a city at node 9 producing sheep (3) and ore (5)
- RED has a settlement at node 20 producing wheat (4) and brick (6)
- BLUE has settlements producing ore/wood and sheep/brick

## Robber Move Options Analysis:
[0] Move to Desert (0,0,0): Ineffective as desert produces nothing already
[1] Move to Sheep (1,-1,0) and steal from RED: Blocks RED's city sheep production
[2] Move to Ore (0,-1,1) and steal from RED: Blocks RED's city ore production (5)
[3] Move to Wood (-1,0,1): Blocks my own wood production (8) - bad move
[4] Move to Wheat (-1,1,0): Blocks a wheat hex (10) that neither of us produces from
[5] Move to Wheat (0,1,-1) and steal from RED: Blocks RED's settlement wheat production (4)

## Strategic Considerations:
1. RED has a city and will likely aim to build more - ore is critical for cities
2. Blocking RED's high-probability ore (5) would be most disruptive
3. RED has 3 hidden cards - I want to steal something useful
4. I need to continue my road building strategy toward wheat hexes
5. Ore is more valuable in mid-game than sheep or wheat

## Decision Logic:
- Option [2] is clearly optimal as it:
  - Blocks RED's ore production from a city (high value target)
  - Targets a high probability number (5 = ⭐⭐)
  - Gives me a chance to steal a useful resource
  - Aligns with my plan to disrupt RED's city production

<plan>
I'll move the robber to RED's ore-producing hex at (0,-1,1) to disrupt their city production. After this move, I'll focus on acquiring wood and brick to continue road building toward wheat hexes. My immediate goal is to build toward node 16 or 15 to access wheat, which I'm currently missing. With longest road secured, I need 4 more VP - ideally through 2 more settlements and a city upgrade.
</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist focused on defeating the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRITICAL FOR SUCCESS):
- Above all else, target the highest probability numbers (6 & 8) - these produce resources 5/36 times each
- Strictly prioritize access to all five resources between your two settlements
- Aim for numerical diversity - try to cover 5-6 different dice numbers across your settlements
- Never place initial settlements without analyzing future expansion opportunities
- Prioritize placement on hexes with complementary resources: ore/wheat and brick/wood
- Position roads toward high-value unoccupied areas the opponent cannot easily block
- Choose second settlement to complement your first settlement's resource weaknesses
- Consider 3:1 ports if you can't access a specific resource through settlements
- Analyze opponent placement to avoid contested expansion paths
- ALWAYS calculate production value using probability dots (5-6-8-9 are top priority numbers)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-10):
- Build at least one new settlement by turn 10 - expansion is your TOP priority
- Calculate and build along the fastest path to your next settlement location
- Secure missing resources through strategic settlement placement
- Build roads that secure critical expansion paths before the opponent blocks them
- Avoid development cards completely until you have at least 3 total settlements
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1) to complete critical builds
- Target resource diversity through your expansion locations
- Create a minimum 2-turn expansion plan and stick to it

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT AND PRODUCTION (CORE STRATEGY):
- Early game: Focus on wood/brick to expand with roads and settlements
- Mid game: Transition to ore/wheat focus for cities and development cards
- Calculate the resource production value of every potential build
- Only make 4:1 trades when they enable an immediate important build
- Cycle through "build phases" - expansion phase, then city upgrade phase
- Plan resource collection 2 turns ahead to minimize wasteful trades
- Never accumulate 7+ cards before dice rolls
- Diversify production to minimize dependency on any single resource
- Target a minimum of 4 total settlements before prioritizing city upgrades

COUNTERING ALPHABETA ALGORITHM:
- AlphaBeta looks ahead only 2 steps, so plan your moves 3-4 steps ahead
- Create deceptive game states that appear less threatening than they are
- Block the opponent's highest-probability expansion paths immediately
- Play defensively during early game, then aggressively in mid-game
- When opponent has 7+ points, disrupt their highest-producing hex with the robber
- Track opponent's resources and block their most likely next build
- Secure resources that the opponent depends on heavily
- Place roads to cut off opponent from accessing high-value settlement locations
- Position settlements to deny opponent access to key resource hex intersections

ROBBER PLACEMENT AND KNIGHT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-producing hex of your opponent
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat in mid-game when cities are being built
- Target the specific resource the opponent needs for their next likely build
- Use knight cards reactively when the robber blocks your best production
- Save knight cards for the late game if pursuing largest army
- When stealing, select resources that complete your immediate build needs
- Keep track of opponent cards and target resources they've been collecting
- Balance robber placement between disruption and resource acquisition

DEVELOPMENT CARDS VS. BUILDING:
- Only buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and cannot build
- Buy development cards when you're 1-2 knights away from largest army
- Use knight cards immediately when advantageous (don't save unless close to largest army)
- Victory point cards should only supplement your main strategy, not replace it
- Road Building cards are most valuable when you're cut off or racing to a key location
- Monopoly is best used after high-probability dice rolls to collect opponent's stockpile
- Year of Plenty is ideal to complete a high-value build (settlement or city)
- NEVER delay settlement/city building to purchase development cards unless 1 VP from winning

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY FOCUS):
- Aim for 5 total settlements (2 upgraded to cities) = 9 VP
- Then secure largest army OR longest road for the final point
- Always calculate the fastest path to 10 VP in terms of resource costs
- For each potential build, calculate how many turns closer it gets you to victory
- Determine which victory paths are still viable based on board state
- Switch strategies when your primary path is blocked
- Plan for the end-game by turn 10 (know exactly how you will reach 10 points)
- Track opponent's path to victory and actively disrupt with roads or robber

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Trade at ports even at 4:1 ratio if it enables immediate critical build
- NEVER trade with opponent unless it enables an immediate settlement/city build
- Avoid trades that allow opponent to build immediately after you
- Calculate the net VP gain of each potential trade
- Use trades to dispose of resources when at risk from robber
- Combine multiple port trades to convert unwanted resources into needed ones
- Be willing to overpay through port trades to secure critical positional advantage

DECISION FRAMEWORK (APPLY TO EVERY TURN):
1. What is my immediate build priority? (settlement > city > longest road/largest army)
2. What resource do I need to complete my highest priority build?
3. What is the fastest way to acquire that resource? (production, trading, development cards)
4. How will this action position me for the next 3 turns?
5. Will this action disrupt my opponent's path to victory?
6. Is there a way to combine multiple actions this turn for greater efficiency?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 58 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  I'll move the robber to RED's ore-producing hex at (0,-1,1) to disrupt their city production. After this move, I'll focus on acquiring wood and brick to continue road building toward wheat hexes. My immediate goal is to build toward node 16 or 15 to access wheat, which I'm currently missing. With longest road secured, I need 4 more VP - ideally through 2 more settlements and a city upgrade.

# Game State Analysis

Let me analyze the current state of the game before making a decision.

## Current Standing:
- I have 4/10 VP (2 settlements + longest road)
- Red has 3/10 VP (1 settlement + 1 city)
- I have 1 wood, 1 brick, 2 sheep, 1 ore
- The robber is already on Red's ore hex (0,-1,1)
- My settlements are at nodes 1 and 12, producing brick, wood, sheep, and ore

## Resource Assessment:
I'm currently missing wheat production. Looking at the board, there are two wheat hexes:
- (-1,1,0) with wheat/10 [⭐⭐]
- (0,1,-1) with wheat/4 [⭐]

## Expansion Options:
Looking at my roads and potential building spots, I need to focus on:
1. Extending toward wheat production
2. Finding viable settlement spots for future expansion

## Road Building Options:
Given my wood and brick resources, I can build one road. The most strategic edges to consider are:

- Edge (16,21): Gets me closer to the wheat/4 hex
- Edge (16,18): Gets me closer to the wheat/10 hex
- Edge (2,3): Opens path toward the center
- Edge (3,4): Expands toward the wheat/10 hex

## Strategic Decision:
My priority should be securing wheat production as soon as possible. The wheat/10 hex has a better production value than wheat/4.

Looking at the connectivity, edge (16,18) appears to be the best option as it gets me closer to node 18 and eventually node 17, which connects to the wheat/10 hex.

<plan>I'll build a road at edge (16,18) to move toward the wheat/10 hex. My next steps will be to gather resources for another road to edge (17,18), followed by a settlement at node 17 to secure wheat production. With wheat secured, I'll focus on upgrading one of my settlements to a city to reach 7 VP, then build my third settlement for 8 VP. The final 2 VP will come from either a fourth settlement or a second city upgrade.</plan>

Based on this analysis, I'll choose to build a road at edge (16,18).

I can either end my turn (0) or build a road using my wood and brick (options 1-9).

## Strategic Considerations:
1. My current plan focuses on reaching the wheat/10 hex by building toward node 17
2. I don't have wheat production yet, which is limiting my ability to build settlements and cities
3. I need to maintain longest road to keep those 2 VP

## Road Building Options Analysis:
- Option 9 (edge 17,18) would advance me toward the wheat/10 hex as per my current plan
- Option 6 (edge 16,21) would move toward node 21 which is near the wheat/4 hex
- Other options don't appear to advance toward wheat hexes

Looking at the map carefully, edge (17,18) connects directly to the wheat/10 hex, which produces at a probability of 3/36 (better than the wheat/4 hex at 2/36).

Road (17,18) is the logical continuation of my plan to secure wheat production at node 17, which is critical for my ability to build settlements and cities.

<plan>
I'll build a road at edge (17,18) to continue toward the wheat/10 hex. Next, I need one more road to reach node 17, where I can build a settlement to secure wheat production. With wheat secured, I'll focus on upgrading settlements to cities to reach 7-8 VP, then secure the final points by building a third settlement or through development cards if needed.
</plan>

Therefore, I'll select option 9 to build a road at edge (17,18).

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist focused on defeating the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRITICAL FOR SUCCESS):
- Above all else, target the highest probability numbers (6 & 8) - these produce resources 5/36 times each
- Strictly prioritize access to all five resources between your two settlements
- Aim for numerical diversity - try to cover 5-6 different dice numbers across your settlements
- Never place initial settlements without analyzing future expansion opportunities
- Prioritize placement on hexes with complementary resources: ore/wheat and brick/wood
- Position roads toward high-value unoccupied areas the opponent cannot easily block
- Choose second settlement to complement your first settlement's resource weaknesses
- Consider 3:1 ports if you can't access a specific resource through settlements
- Analyze opponent placement to avoid contested expansion paths
- ALWAYS calculate production value using probability dots (5-6-8-9 are top priority numbers)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-10):
- Build at least one new settlement by turn 10 - expansion is your TOP priority
- Calculate and build along the fastest path to your next settlement location
- Secure missing resources through strategic settlement placement
- Build roads that secure critical expansion paths before the opponent blocks them
- Avoid development cards completely until you have at least 3 total settlements
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1) to complete critical builds
- Target resource diversity through your expansion locations
- Create a minimum 2-turn expansion plan and stick to it

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT AND PRODUCTION (CORE STRATEGY):
- Early game: Focus on wood/brick to expand with roads and settlements
- Mid game: Transition to ore/wheat focus for cities and development cards
- Calculate the resource production value of every potential build
- Only make 4:1 trades when they enable an immediate important build
- Cycle through "build phases" - expansion phase, then city upgrade phase
- Plan resource collection 2 turns ahead to minimize wasteful trades
- Never accumulate 7+ cards before dice rolls
- Diversify production to minimize dependency on any single resource
- Target a minimum of 4 total settlements before prioritizing city upgrades

COUNTERING ALPHABETA ALGORITHM:
- AlphaBeta looks ahead only 2 steps, so plan your moves 3-4 steps ahead
- Create deceptive game states that appear less threatening than they are
- Block the opponent's highest-probability expansion paths immediately
- Play defensively during early game, then aggressively in mid-game
- When opponent has 7+ points, disrupt their highest-producing hex with the robber
- Track opponent's resources and block their most likely next build
- Secure resources that the opponent depends on heavily
- Place roads to cut off opponent from accessing high-value settlement locations
- Position settlements to deny opponent access to key resource hex intersections

ROBBER PLACEMENT AND KNIGHT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-producing hex of your opponent
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat in mid-game when cities are being built
- Target the specific resource the opponent needs for their next likely build
- Use knight cards reactively when the robber blocks your best production
- Save knight cards for the late game if pursuing largest army
- When stealing, select resources that complete your immediate build needs
- Keep track of opponent cards and target resources they've been collecting
- Balance robber placement between disruption and resource acquisition

DEVELOPMENT CARDS VS. BUILDING:
- Only buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and cannot build
- Buy development cards when you're 1-2 knights away from largest army
- Use knight cards immediately when advantageous (don't save unless close to largest army)
- Victory point cards should only supplement your main strategy, not replace it
- Road Building cards are most valuable when you're cut off or racing to a key location
- Monopoly is best used after high-probability dice rolls to collect opponent's stockpile
- Year of Plenty is ideal to complete a high-value build (settlement or city)
- NEVER delay settlement/city building to purchase development cards unless 1 VP from winning

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY FOCUS):
- Aim for 5 total settlements (2 upgraded to cities) = 9 VP
- Then secure largest army OR longest road for the final point
- Always calculate the fastest path to 10 VP in terms of resource costs
- For each potential build, calculate how many turns closer it gets you to victory
- Determine which victory paths are still viable based on board state
- Switch strategies when your primary path is blocked
- Plan for the end-game by turn 10 (know exactly how you will reach 10 points)
- Track opponent's path to victory and actively disrupt with roads or robber

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Trade at ports even at 4:1 ratio if it enables immediate critical build
- NEVER trade with opponent unless it enables an immediate settlement/city build
- Avoid trades that allow opponent to build immediately after you
- Calculate the net VP gain of each potential trade
- Use trades to dispose of resources when at risk from robber
- Combine multiple port trades to convert unwanted resources into needed ones
- Be willing to overpay through port trades to secure critical positional advantage

DECISION FRAMEWORK (APPLY TO EVERY TURN):
1. What is my immediate build priority? (settlement > city > longest road/largest army)
2. What resource do I need to complete my highest priority build?
3. What is the fastest way to acquire that resource? (production, trading, development cards)
4. How will this action position me for the next 3 turns?
5. Will this action disrupt my opponent's path to victory?
6. Is there a way to combine multiple actions this turn for greater efficiency?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game State Analysis

Let me carefully analyze the current game state to determine the optimal action:

## Current Status
- I have 4 VP (2 settlements + 2 VP for longest road)
- I have resources: 1 Wood, 2 Brick, 3 Sheep, 1 Ore
- My plan was to build a road at edge (17,18) to continue toward wheat/10 hex
- However, that specific edge doesn't appear in the available actions

## Resource Situation
- I'm currently lacking wheat completely
- I have good production of wood (from 8) and brick (from 6)
- I need to secure wheat production for city upgrades later

## Available Road Building Options
I need to understand where each edge is located relative to my expansion goals:

Looking at the node connections in the board diagram, I need to identify which road option will best help me reach a wheat hex (either the wheat/10 or wheat/4).

The wheat/10 hex is connected to nodes 4,5,15,16,17,18, and from the previous plan I wanted to build toward node 17. The wheat/4 hex is connected to nodes 0,5,16,19,20,21.

## Decision Framework
1. Which road gets me closest to building a settlement on a wheat hex?
2. Which road secures my expansion path from potential RED blocking?
3. Which road maintains my longest road advantage?

Based on my understanding of the node connections:
- Edge (16,21) appears to be toward the wheat/4 hex area
- Edge (3,4) could potentially lead toward the wheat/10 hex area

Without a complete visualization of all road connections, I need to make an educated guess based on the previous plan and available options.

## Optimal Action
Since my previous plan specifically mentioned building toward the wheat/10 hex via node 17, and option [6] involves node 16 which is connected to the wheat/10 hex, this seems to be the most aligned with my strategy.

Building a road at edge (16,21) appears to be the best continuation of my plan to secure wheat production.

<plan>Build a road at edge (16,21) to continue toward the wheat/4 hex. Next turn, assess if I need one more road to reach a valid settlement location at node 19 or 21. With wheat secured, I'll focus on upgrading settlements to cities to reach 7-8 VP, then secure the final points through a third settlement or development cards.</plan>

❓ Select action by number (0-8):


Based on this information, which action number do you choose? Think step by step about your options, then put the final action number in a box like \boxed{1}.
RESPONSE:
I'll analyze the current game state and determine the optimal action.

**Game State Analysis:**
- I have 4 VP (2 settlements + longest road)
- Resources: 1 Wood, 2 Brick, 3 Sheep, 1 Ore
- I have the longest road bonus (+2 VP)
- Opponent has 3 VP (1 settlement + 1 city)

**Board Position Analysis:**
- Looking at the grid, I need to strategically expand toward valuable resources
- My settlements are at nodes 12 (producing wood/ore) and 1 (producing sheep/brick)
- I'm missing wheat production entirely
- Based on my current plan, I need to continue toward the wheat/4 hex

**Available Actions:**
- I can build a road with my 1 wood + 1 brick
- The key option is [8] Build a road at edge (19, 21), which aligns with my current plan to reach the wheat hex

**Strategic Considerations:**
1. My current plan involves building toward the wheat/4 hex, which is critical since I lack wheat production
2. Edge (19, 21) extends toward node 21, which is adjacent to the wheat/4 hex
3. This placement maintains my longest road status
4. This move follows my plan to secure wheat, which I'll need for future city upgrades
5. My ultimate goal is to reach a settlement location that provides wheat access

<plan>Continue building toward the wheat/4 hex with a road at edge (19, 21). Next turn, I'll need to build one final road to reach node 21 (valid settlement location on wheat/4), then save resources for a settlement there. After securing wheat production, I'll focus on upgrading settlements to cities (5 VP) and maintain longest road (2 VP). The final 3 VP will come from a combination of a third settlement and development cards.</plan>

The most strategic move is to continue with my original plan and build the road at edge (19, 21), which extends toward the wheat resource I desperately need.

- Only make 4:1 trades when they enable an immediate important build
- Cycle through "build phases" - expansion phase, then city upgrade phase
- Plan resource collection 2 turns ahead to minimize wasteful trades
- Never accumulate 7+ cards before dice rolls
- Diversify production to minimize dependency on any single resource
- Target a minimum of 4 total settlements before prioritizing city upgrades

COUNTERING ALPHABETA ALGORITHM:
- AlphaBeta looks ahead only 2 steps, so plan your moves 3-4 steps ahead
- Create deceptive game states that appear less threatening than they are
- Block the opponent's highest-probability expansion paths immediately
- Play defensively during early game, then aggressively in mid-game
- When opponent has 7+ points, disrupt their highest-producing hex with the robber
- Track opponent's resources and block their most likely next build
- Secure resources that the opponent depends on heavily
- Place roads to cut off opponent from accessing high-value settlement locations
- Position settlements to deny opponent access to key resource hex intersections

ROBBER PLACEMENT AND KNIGHT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-producing hex of your opponent
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat in mid-game when cities are being built
- Target the specific resource the opponent needs for their next likely build
- Use knight cards reactively when the robber blocks your best production
- Save knight cards for the late game if pursuing largest army
- When stealing, select resources that complete your immediate build needs
- Keep track of opponent cards and target resources they've been collecting
- Balance robber placement between disruption and resource acquisition

DEVELOPMENT CARDS VS. BUILDING:
- Only buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and cannot build
- Buy development cards when you're 1-2 knights away from largest army
- Use knight cards immediately when advantageous (don't save unless close to largest army)
- Victory point cards should only supplement your main strategy, not replace it
- Road Building cards are most valuable when you're cut off or racing to a key location
- Monopoly is best used after high-probability dice rolls to collect opponent's stockpile
- Year of Plenty is ideal to complete a high-value build (settlement or city)
- NEVER delay settlement/city building to purchase development cards unless 1 VP from winning

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY FOCUS):
- Aim for 5 total settlements (2 upgraded to cities) = 9 VP
- Then secure largest army OR longest road for the final point
- Always calculate the fastest path to 10 VP in terms of resource costs
- For each potential build, calculate how many turns closer it gets you to victory
- Determine which victory paths are still viable based on board state
- Switch strategies when your primary path is blocked
- Plan for the end-game by turn 10 (know exactly how you will reach 10 points)
- Track opponent's path to victory and actively disrupt with roads or robber

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Trade at ports even at 4:1 ratio if it enables immediate critical build
- NEVER trade with opponent unless it enables an immediate settlement/city build
- Avoid trades that allow opponent to build immediately after you
- Calculate the net VP gain of each potential trade
- Use trades to dispose of resources when at risk from robber
- Combine multiple port trades to convert unwanted resources into needed ones
- Be willing to overpay through port trades to secure critical positional advantage

DECISION FRAMEWORK (APPLY TO EVERY TURN):
1. What is my immediate build priority? (settlement > city > longest road/largest army)
2. What resource do I need to complete my highest priority build?
3. What is the fastest way to acquire that resource? (production, trading, development cards)
4. How will this action position me for the next 3 turns?
5. Will this action disrupt my opponent's path to victory?
6. Is there a way to combine multiple actions this turn for greater efficiency?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 78 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  Continue building toward the wheat/4 hex with a road at edge (19, 21). Next turn, I'll need to build one final road to reach node 21 (valid settlement location on wheat/4), then save resources for a settlement there. After securing wheat production, I'll focus on upgrading settlements to cities (5 VP) and maintain longest road (2 VP). The final 3 VP will come from a combination of a third settlement and development cards.

❓ Select action by number (0-4):


Based on this information, which action number do you choose? Think step by step about your options, then put the final action number in a box like \boxed{1}.
RESPONSE:
I'll analyze the current game state to determine my optimal action:

## Current game state
- I have 2 brick, 4 sheep, 1 ore
- I currently have 4 VP (2 settlements + longest road bonus)
- I have the longest road (9 segments)
- Red player has 3 VP (1 settlement + 1 city)
- Red has 7 cards, making them vulnerable to the robber
- My current plan is to build toward the wheat/4 hex to establish a settlement at node 21

## Available actions
0. End turn
1-4. Maritime trades with 4 sheep

## Analysis
My primary goal is to establish a wheat-producing settlement at node 21. To do this, I need:
1. Build a road to node 21 (costs 1 brick, 1 wood)
2. Build a settlement at node 21 (costs 1 brick, 1 wood, 1 wheat, 1 sheep)

Current issues:
- I don't have any wood
- I don't have any wheat
- I have plenty of sheep (4)

Looking at the maritime trade options, I could trade 4 sheep for 1 wood (option 3). This would give me the wood I need to build my next road segment toward node 21.

With 2 brick and 1 wood (after trade), I could build one road this turn, continuing my path toward the wheat hex.

<plan>
Trade 4 sheep for 1 wood, then build a road toward node 21. On my next turn, I'll need to acquire more resources to build the final road and settlement. After securing wheat production at node 21, I'll focus on upgrading settlements to cities and maintaining longest road. The goal remains to reach 10 VP through 5 VP from settlements/cities, 2 VP from longest road, and 3 VP from development cards or an additional settlement.
</plan>

The optimal action is to trade my sheep for wood to continue my expansion toward the wheat hex.

PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist focused on defeating the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRITICAL FOR SUCCESS):
- Above all else, target the highest probability numbers (6 & 8) - these produce resources 5/36 times each
- Strictly prioritize access to all five resources between your two settlements
- Aim for numerical diversity - try to cover 5-6 different dice numbers across your settlements
- Never place initial settlements without analyzing future expansion opportunities
- Prioritize placement on hexes with complementary resources: ore/wheat and brick/wood
- Position roads toward high-value unoccupied areas the opponent cannot easily block
- Choose second settlement to complement your first settlement's resource weaknesses
- Consider 3:1 ports if you can't access a specific resource through settlements
- Analyze opponent placement to avoid contested expansion paths
- ALWAYS calculate production value using probability dots (5-6-8-9 are top priority numbers)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-10):
- Build at least one new settlement by turn 10 - expansion is your TOP priority
- Calculate and build along the fastest path to your next settlement location
- Secure missing resources through strategic settlement placement
- Build roads that secure critical expansion paths before the opponent blocks them
- Avoid development cards completely until you have at least 3 total settlements
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1) to complete critical builds
- Target resource diversity through your expansion locations
- Create a minimum 2-turn expansion plan and stick to it

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT AND PRODUCTION (CORE STRATEGY):
- Early game: Focus on wood/brick to expand with roads and settlements
- Mid game: Transition to ore/wheat focus for cities and development cards

# Game State Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state and my available options:

## Current Status
- I have 4 VP: 2 from settlements + 2 from longest road
- I have resources: 1 wood, 2 brick, 1 ore
- My opponent has 3 VP: 1 settlement + 1 city + 0 bonus points
- The robber is currently on an ore hex (0, -1, 1) with value 5, blocking my production at node 12

## Available Actions
I have enough resources (1 wood, 1 brick) to build one road. I have 8 possible road placements to choose from.

## Strategic Considerations
1. My current plan involves building toward node 21 to place a settlement there
2. Node 21 is connected to wheat (4) which I currently don't have access to
3. I need to determine which road gets me closer to node 21
4. I should also consider blocking my opponent's expansion paths

## Road Options Evaluation
Looking at the available road options:
- [1] Build road at edge (0, 1): This connects toward the center but doesn't advance toward node 21
- [2] Build road at edge (3, 4): This moves eastward but not toward node 21
- [3] Build road at edge (19, 20): This builds next to my opponent's settlement at node 20, which is risky
- [4] Build road at edge (2, 3): This doesn't advance toward my target
- [5] Build road at edge (2, 9): This doesn't advance toward my target
- [6] Build road at edge (11, 12): This builds near my settlement at node 12, but doesn't help reach node 21
- [7] Build road at edge (3, 12): This doesn't advance toward node 21
- [8] Build road at edge (1, 6): This could be a step toward node 21 if there's a path from node 6 to 21

Given the limited view of the full board connectivity, I need to determine which road would best advance me toward node 21.

Based on the coordinates, node 21 is likely near the wheat hex (0, 1, -1) in the bottom right. Looking at the nodes connected to that hex, I can see node 21 is indeed there.

From the board description, node 0 connects to node 5, which likely connects to nodes toward the wheat hex. Therefore, I believe road option [1] building at edge (0, 1) provides the best path toward node 21.

<plan>
Continue building roads toward node 21 to establish a settlement there, gaining wheat production. After securing that settlement, focus on converting existing settlements to cities using ore and wheat. Maintain longest road advantage and consider development cards if excess resources become available.
</plan>

Given this analysis, I choose to build a road at edge (0, 1):

# Game State Analysis

Let me carefully analyze the current state of the game and make the best strategic decision.

## Current Status
- We have 4/10 Victory Points (2 settlements + 2 for longest road)
- Resources: 1 Wood, 1 Brick, 1 Ore
- We have longest road with 10 segments
- Our settlements produce Wood (8), Ore (5), Sheep (3), and Brick (6)
- We lack direct Wheat production

## Current Plan Assessment
Our plan involves building toward node 21 to establish a settlement that would give us wheat production. This is critical since we currently lack wheat, which is needed for settlements and cities.

## Resource Evaluation
We have exactly enough resources (1 Wood, 1 Brick) to build one more road. We should use these resources optimally to advance our position.

## Action Options Analysis
Looking at the road options:
- Option 1: Edge (3, 4) - Moves toward the wheat hex (10)
- Option 2: Edge (19, 20) - RED already has a settlement at node 20
- Option 3: Edge (2, 3) - Connects existing nodes but doesn't advance expansion
- Option 4: Edge (2, 9) - RED already has a city at node 9
- Option 5: Edge (11, 12) - We already have a settlement at node 12
- Option 6: Edge (3, 12) - Connects existing nodes but doesn't advance expansion
- Option 7: Edge (1, 6) - Moves toward possible expansion into wheat

I need to determine which road best advances our path toward node 21 (for wheat production) or other strategic locations.

Looking at the node grid, option 1 (edge 3-4) appears to extend toward the wheat hex (-1, 1, 0) with value 10, which would help us get wheat production. This aligns with our current plan.

Option 7 (edge 1-6) seems to be moving toward the sheep hex (1, -1, 0) and potentially the brick hex (1, 0, -1), but we already have access to these resources.

Since our priority is to secure wheat production, and option 1 seems to be advancing in that direction, this is likely our best choice.

<plan>Continue building roads toward the wheat hex (-1, 1, 0) with value 10. After establishing a road network, build a settlement at a node adjacent to this wheat hex. Then focus on city upgrades using the newly acquired wheat along with our ore production. Maintain longest road advantage.</plan>

Given the analysis above and our updated plan, I will choose option 1 to build a road at edge (3, 4).

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist focused on defeating the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRITICAL FOR SUCCESS):
- Above all else, target the highest probability numbers (6 & 8) - these produce resources 5/36 times each
- Strictly prioritize access to all five resources between your two settlements
- Aim for numerical diversity - try to cover 5-6 different dice numbers across your settlements
- Never place initial settlements without analyzing future expansion opportunities
- Prioritize placement on hexes with complementary resources: ore/wheat and brick/wood
- Position roads toward high-value unoccupied areas the opponent cannot easily block
- Choose second settlement to complement your first settlement's resource weaknesses
- Consider 3:1 ports if you can't access a specific resource through settlements
- Analyze opponent placement to avoid contested expansion paths
- ALWAYS calculate production value using probability dots (5-6-8-9 are top priority numbers)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-10):
- Build at least one new settlement by turn 10 - expansion is your TOP priority
- Calculate and build along the fastest path to your next settlement location
- Secure missing resources through strategic settlement placement
- Build roads that secure critical expansion paths before the opponent blocks them
- Avoid development cards completely until you have at least 3 total settlements
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1) to complete critical builds
- Target resource diversity through your expansion locations
- Create a minimum 2-turn expansion plan and stick to it

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT AND PRODUCTION (CORE STRATEGY):
- Early game: Focus on wood/brick to expand with roads and settlements
- Mid game: Transition to ore/wheat focus for cities and development cards
- Calculate the resource production value of every potential build
- Only make 4:1 trades when they enable an immediate important build
- Cycle through "build phases" - expansion phase, then city upgrade phase
- Plan resource collection 2 turns ahead to minimize wasteful trades
- Never accumulate 7+ cards before dice rolls
- Diversify production to minimize dependency on any single resource
- Target a minimum of 4 total settlements before prioritizing city upgrades

COUNTERING ALPHABETA ALGORITHM:
- AlphaBeta looks ahead only 2 steps, so plan your moves 3-4 steps ahead
- Create deceptive game states that appear less threatening than they are
- Block the opponent's highest-probability expansion paths immediately
- Play defensively during early game, then aggressively in mid-game
- When opponent has 7+ points, disrupt their highest-producing hex with the robber
- Track opponent's resources and block their most likely next build
- Secure resources that the opponent depends on heavily
- Place roads to cut off opponent from accessing high-value settlement locations
- Position settlements to deny opponent access to key resource hex intersections

ROBBER PLACEMENT AND KNIGHT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-producing hex of your opponent
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat in mid-game when cities are being built
- Target the specific resource the opponent needs for their next likely build
- Use knight cards reactively when the robber blocks your best production
- Save knight cards for the late game if pursuing largest army
- When stealing, select resources that complete your immediate build needs
- Keep track of opponent cards and target resources they've been collecting
- Balance robber placement between disruption and resource acquisition

DEVELOPMENT CARDS VS. BUILDING:
- Only buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and cannot build
- Buy development cards when you're 1-2 knights away from largest army
- Use knight cards immediately when advantageous (don't save unless close to largest army)
- Victory point cards should only supplement your main strategy, not replace it
- Road Building cards are most valuable when you're cut off or racing to a key location
- Monopoly is best used after high-probability dice rolls to collect opponent's stockpile
- Year of Plenty is ideal to complete a high-value build (settlement or city)
- NEVER delay settlement/city building to purchase development cards unless 1 VP from winning

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY FOCUS):
- Aim for 5 total settlements (2 upgraded to cities) = 9 VP
- Then secure largest army OR longest road for the final point
- Always calculate the fastest path to 10 VP in terms of resource costs
- For each potential build, calculate how many turns closer it gets you to victory
- Determine which victory paths are still viable based on board state
- Switch strategies when your primary path is blocked
- Plan for the end-game by turn 10 (know exactly how you will reach 10 points)
- Track opponent's path to victory and actively disrupt with roads or robber

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Trade at ports even at 4:1 ratio if it enables immediate critical build
- NEVER trade with opponent unless it enables an immediate settlement/city build
- Avoid trades that allow opponent to build immediately after you
- Calculate the net VP gain of each potential trade
- Use trades to dispose of resources when at risk from robber
- Combine multiple port trades to convert unwanted resources into needed ones
- Be willing to overpay through port trades to secure critical positional advantage

DECISION FRAMEWORK (APPLY TO EVERY TURN):
1. What is my immediate build priority? (settlement > city > longest road/largest army)
2. What resource do I need to complete my highest priority build?
3. What is the fastest way to acquire that resource? (production, trading, development cards)
4. How will this action position me for the next 3 turns?
5. Will this action disrupt my opponent's path to victory?
6. Is there a way to combine multiple actions this turn for greater efficiency?

# Robber Placement Analysis

I need to carefully consider where to place the robber to maximize my strategic advantage while disrupting my opponent's production.

## Current Game State Analysis
- I have 4/10 victory points (2 settlements + longest road bonus)
- RED has 3/10 victory points (1 settlement + 1 city)
- I currently hold the longest road (10 segments vs RED's 3)
- I only have 1 brick and 1 ore as resources
- My plan involves building toward the wheat hex (-1,1,0) with value 10

## Analyzing Each Robber Placement Option:

**[0] Move robber to (0, 0, 0)** - This is a desert hex which produces nothing. Placing the robber here wastes the opportunity to block resource production.

**[1] Move robber to (1, -1, 0) and steal from RED** - This is a sheep hex with value 3. RED's city at node 9 produces from this hex. Blocking this low-probability sheep hex (3 = 2/36 probability) and stealing from RED could be valuable.

**[2] Move robber to (-1, 0, 1)** - This is a wood hex with value 8. This is MY best producing hex as my settlement at node 12 relies on this. I should absolutely NOT block my own high-probability wood production.

**[3] Move robber to (-1, 1, 0)** - This is a wheat hex with value 10. Neither of us currently produces from this hex, though it's part of my expansion plan. Blocking this doesn't immediately hurt either player.

**[4] Move robber to (0, 1, -1) and steal from RED** - This is a wheat hex with value 4. RED's settlement at node 20 produces from this. Blocking this low-probability wheat (4 = 3/36 probability) and stealing from RED could be useful.

**[5] Move robber to (1, 0, -1) and steal from RED** - This is a brick hex with value 6. Both RED's settlement at node 20 and my settlement at node 1 produce from this hex. This is a high-probability hex (6 = 5/36 probability) but blocking it hurts me as much as RED.

## Strategic Considerations:
1. I want to disrupt RED's production while minimizing impact on my own
2. RED has a city at node 9 that produces sheep (3) and ore (5)
3. RED has a settlement at node 20 that produces wheat (4) and brick (6) 
4. I should prioritize blocking higher probability numbers (especially 6)
5. I should target resources RED likely needs for their next build

## Decision:
The most optimal choice is to block RED's high-probability brick production on hex (1, 0, -1) and steal a resource from them. While this also blocks my own brick production, I already have 1 brick in hand, and disrupting RED's access to this key resource (5/36 probability) outweighs the temporary disadvantage to myself. This is especially important since brick is critical for early game expansion.

\boxed{5}

<plan>Block RED's brick production to slow their expansion while continuing to build roads toward the wheat hex (-1, 1, 0). Use any stolen resources to supplement my building efforts. After establishing a road network, build a settlement at a node adjacent to this wheat hex. Then focus on city upgrades using the newly acquired wheat along with our ore production. Maintain longest road advantage.</plan>

# Game Analysis and Decision

I'll analyze the current game state and determine the optimal action:

## Current Resources & State
- I have: 4 Bricks, 1 Wheat, 1 Ore
- I have 4 VP (2 from settlements, 2 from longest road)
- RED also has 4 VP (2 from settlements, 1 from city, 0 from longest road)
- I have longest road advantage (10 segments vs 3)
- Robber is currently on the forest hex (-1, 0, 1), blocking my wood production

## Strategy Assessment
Looking at my current plan, I want to build toward the wheat hex (-1, 1, 0) and establish a settlement there. However, I'm missing wood, which is crucial for building more roads and settlements.

## Options Analysis:
1. End Turn: I'd get no immediate benefit, but I might collect resources on the next roll.
2-4. Trade Options: I could trade 4 brick for 1 of another resource.

Since I have excess brick (4), and I'm completely lacking wood, trading for wood would be most beneficial. The wheat hex I'm targeting would give me another wheat production spot, but I first need wood to build roads and a settlement to reach it.

Looking at my current roads (15 built with longest road of 10), I appear to have a solid road network. My immediate need is wood to continue expansion, as I can't build anything with my current resources.

## Decision Logic
1. Trading 4 brick for 1 wood (option #3) would allow me to build one more road, advancing toward my goal of reaching the wheat hex.
2. Keeping all my bricks doesn't help my immediate strategy since I lack wood.
3. I need wood more than additional wheat, sheep, or ore right now to continue my expansion.

<plan>
Trade 4 brick for 1 wood to build another road toward the wheat hex (-1, 1, 0). Continue expanding my road network to establish a settlement near this wheat production. This will improve my resource diversity and production while maintaining my longest road advantage.
</plan>

Based on this analysis, I should trade my excess brick for wood:

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist focused on defeating the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRITICAL FOR SUCCESS):
- Above all else, target the highest probability numbers (6 & 8) - these produce resources 5/36 times each
- Strictly prioritize access to all five resources between your two settlements
- Aim for numerical diversity - try to cover 5-6 different dice numbers across your settlements
- Never place initial settlements without analyzing future expansion opportunities
- Prioritize placement on hexes with complementary resources: ore/wheat and brick/wood
- Position roads toward high-value unoccupied areas the opponent cannot easily block
- Choose second settlement to complement your first settlement's resource weaknesses
- Consider 3:1 ports if you can't access a specific resource through settlements
- Analyze opponent placement to avoid contested expansion paths
- ALWAYS calculate production value using probability dots (5-6-8-9 are top priority numbers)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-10):
- Build at least one new settlement by turn 10 - expansion is your TOP priority
- Calculate and build along the fastest path to your next settlement location
- Secure missing resources through strategic settlement placement
- Build roads that secure critical expansion paths before the opponent blocks them
- Avoid development cards completely until you have at least 3 total settlements
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1) to complete critical builds
- Target resource diversity through your expansion locations
- Create a minimum 2-turn expansion plan and stick to it

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT AND PRODUCTION (CORE STRATEGY):
- Early game: Focus on wood/brick to expand with roads and settlements
- Mid game: Transition to ore/wheat focus for cities and development cards
- Calculate the resource production value of every potential build
- Only make 4:1 trades when they enable an immediate important build
- Cycle through "build phases" - expansion phase, then city upgrade phase
- Plan resource collection 2 turns ahead to minimize wasteful trades
- Never accumulate 7+ cards before dice rolls
- Diversify production to minimize dependency on any single resource
- Target a minimum of 4 total settlements before prioritizing city upgrades

COUNTERING ALPHABETA ALGORITHM:
- AlphaBeta looks ahead only 2 steps, so plan your moves 3-4 steps ahead
- Create deceptive game states that appear less threatening than they are
- Block the opponent's highest-probability expansion paths immediately
- Play defensively during early game, then aggressively in mid-game
- When opponent has 7+ points, disrupt their highest-producing hex with the robber
- Track opponent's resources and block their most likely next build
- Secure resources that the opponent depends on heavily
- Place roads to cut off opponent from accessing high-value settlement locations
- Position settlements to deny opponent access to key resource hex intersections

ROBBER PLACEMENT AND KNIGHT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-producing hex of your opponent
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat in mid-game when cities are being built
- Target the specific resource the opponent needs for their next likely build
- Use knight cards reactively when the robber blocks your best production
- Save knight cards for the late game if pursuing largest army
- When stealing, select resources that complete your immediate build needs
- Keep track of opponent cards and target resources they've been collecting
- Balance robber placement between disruption and resource acquisition

DEVELOPMENT CARDS VS. BUILDING:
- Only buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and cannot build
- Buy development cards when you're 1-2 knights away from largest army
- Use knight cards immediately when advantageous (don't save unless close to largest army)
- Victory point cards should only supplement your main strategy, not replace it
- Road Building cards are most valuable when you're cut off or racing to a key location
- Monopoly is best used after high-probability dice rolls to collect opponent's stockpile
- Year of Plenty is ideal to complete a high-value build (settlement or city)
- NEVER delay settlement/city building to purchase development cards unless 1 VP from winning

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY FOCUS):
- Aim for 5 total settlements (2 upgraded to cities) = 9 VP
- Then secure largest army OR longest road for the final point
- Always calculate the fastest path to 10 VP in terms of resource costs
- For each potential build, calculate how many turns closer it gets you to victory
- Determine which victory paths are still viable based on board state
- Switch strategies when your primary path is blocked
- Plan for the end-game by turn 10 (know exactly how you will reach 10 points)
- Track opponent's path to victory and actively disrupt with roads or robber

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Trade at ports even at 4:1 ratio if it enables immediate critical build
- NEVER trade with opponent unless it enables an immediate settlement/city build
- Avoid trades that allow opponent to build immediately after you
- Calculate the net VP gain of each potential trade
- Use trades to dispose of resources when at risk from robber
- Combine multiple port trades to convert unwanted resources into needed ones
- Be willing to overpay through port trades to secure critical positional advantage

DECISION FRAMEWORK (APPLY TO EVERY TURN):
1. What is my immediate build priority? (settlement > city > longest road/largest army)
2. What resource do I need to complete my highest priority build?
3. What is the fastest way to acquire that resource? (production, trading, development cards)
4. How will this action position me for the next 3 turns?
5. Will this action disrupt my opponent's path to victory?
6. Is there a way to combine multiple actions this turn for greater efficiency?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 92 | Player: BLUE | Action: MOVE_ROBBER

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  Trade 4 brick for 1 wood to build another road toward the wheat hex (-1, 1, 0). Continue expanding my road network to establish a settlement near this wheat production. This will improve my resource diversity and production while maintaining my longest road advantage.
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.

# Game Analysis: Robber Placement Decision

Let me analyze this critical robber placement decision carefully by examining each hex and its strategic impact.

## Current Game State
- I have 4 VP (2 settlements + 2 VP for longest road)
- RED has 4 VP (2 settlements + 1 city)
- Resources: I have 1 wood, 1 wheat
- Current plan: Trading brick for wood to build roads toward the wheat hex

## Robber Placement Options Analysis

[0] Move robber to (1, -1, 0) and steal from RED
- This is the sheep (🐑3) hex
- Blocks production for RED's city at node 9
- Blocks my own settlement at node 1
- Sheep has low production value (3 is only 2/36 probability)

[1] Move robber to (0, -1, 1) and steal from RED
- This is the ore (⛏️5) hex
- Blocks production for RED's city at node 9
- Blocks my own settlement at node 12
- Good number (5 = 4/36 probability)

[2] Move robber to (-1, 0, 1)
- This is the wood (🌲8) hex
- Blocks my settlement at node 12
- Very high production value (8 = 5/36 probability)
- No RED buildings, so no steal opportunity
- Would hurt my own production significantly

[3] Move robber to (-1, 1, 0)
- This is the wheat (🌾10) hex
- No settlements from either player
- Average production value (10 = 3/36 probability)
- No steal opportunity

[4] Move robber to (0, 1, -1) and steal from RED
- This is the wheat (🌾4) hex
- Blocks RED's settlement at node 20
- Low production value (4 = 3/36 probability)

[5] Move robber to (1, 0, -1) and steal from RED
- This is the brick (🧱6) hex
- Blocks RED's 3 buildings (settlement at 20, settlement at 23, and produces for city at 9)
- Very high production value (6 = 5/36 probability)
- Would significantly reduce RED's brick production
- Red might be collecting brick to disrupt my longest road

## Strategic Decision

The most impactful move would be option [5] - placing the robber on the brick hex (1, 0, -1):

1. It blocks a high-probability number (6 = 5/36)
2. It impacts THREE of RED's buildings
3. RED is likely collecting brick to build roads and potentially challenge my longest road
4. It allows me to steal a card from RED
5. It doesn't block any of my own production

<plan>
Block RED's brick production with the robber to protect my longest road advantage. Continue expanding toward the wheat hex (-1, 1, 0) by trading for wood when possible. Focus on building a third settlement to increase my resource diversity and production.
</plan>

# Game Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state to determine the optimal move:

## Current Game Status
- I have 4/10 VP (2 settlements + longest road bonus of 2 VP)
- Opponent has 4/10 VP (2 settlements + 1 city)
- I have 2 wood, 1 brick, 1 sheep, 1 wheat, 1 ore
- The robber is on the brick hex (1, 0, -1), which is one of RED's key production spots

## Resource Assessment
I have exactly 1 of each resource needed to build a settlement (1 wood, 1 brick, 1 wheat, 1 sheep) plus 1 extra wood and 1 ore.

## Settlement Options Analysis
Looking at the possible settlement locations:

- Node 4: Connected to wheat (10), wood (8), and desert
- Node 5: Connected to wheat (10), wheat (4)
- Node 14: Connected to wood (8)
- Node 15: Connected to wood (8), wheat (10)
- Node 16: Connected to wheat (10), wheat (4)
- Node 17: Connected to wheat (10)
- Node 18: Connected to wheat (10)
- Node 21: Connected to wheat (4)

Analyzing by resource production value:
- Node 15: Wood (8, ⭐⭐⭐) + Wheat (10, ⭐⭐) = 5 stars
- Node 4: Wood (8, ⭐⭐⭐) + Wheat (10, ⭐⭐) = 5 stars
- Node 16: Wheat (10, ⭐⭐) + Wheat (4, ⭐) = 3 stars
- Node 5: Wheat (10, ⭐⭐) + Wheat (4, ⭐) = 3 stars

## Strategic Considerations
1. Building a settlement immediately increases my VP to 5 (halfway to victory)
2. I need to prioritize resource diversity and high-probability numbers
3. Nodes 4 and 15 are both connected to wood (8) and wheat (10), making them the strongest options
4. I should consider future expansion opportunities and proximity to existing infrastructure

Node 15 is connected to my existing settlement at node 12, providing a more consolidated territory, while Node 4 would establish presence in a new area.

## Decision
Building a settlement at Node 15 is optimal because:
1. It provides excellent production with both wood (8) and wheat (10)
2. It's connected to my existing infrastructure
3. It secures additional wheat production which I currently lack
4. It increases my VP count to 5, putting me ahead of my opponent
5. It creates a more defensible territory

<plan>Build settlement at node 15 to secure wheat production and increase to 5 VP. Then focus on upgrading to cities using the improved wheat production combined with my ore access. Continue to block opponent's brick production when possible to maintain longest road advantage.</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist focused on defeating the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRITICAL FOR SUCCESS):
- Above all else, target the highest probability numbers (6 & 8) - these produce resources 5/36 times each
- Strictly prioritize access to all five resources between your two settlements
- Aim for numerical diversity - try to cover 5-6 different dice numbers across your settlements
- Never place initial settlements without analyzing future expansion opportunities
- Prioritize placement on hexes with complementary resources: ore/wheat and brick/wood
- Position roads toward high-value unoccupied areas the opponent cannot easily block
- Choose second settlement to complement your first settlement's resource weaknesses
- Consider 3:1 ports if you can't access a specific resource through settlements
- Analyze opponent placement to avoid contested expansion paths
- ALWAYS calculate production value using probability dots (5-6-8-9 are top priority numbers)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-10):
- Build at least one new settlement by turn 10 - expansion is your TOP priority
- Calculate and build along the fastest path to your next settlement location
- Secure missing resources through strategic settlement placement
- Build roads that secure critical expansion paths before the opponent blocks them
- Avoid development cards completely until you have at least 3 total settlements
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1) to complete critical builds
- Target resource diversity through your expansion locations
- Create a minimum 2-turn expansion plan and stick to it

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT AND PRODUCTION (CORE STRATEGY):
- Early game: Focus on wood/brick to expand with roads and settlements
- Mid game: Transition to ore/wheat focus for cities and development cards
- Calculate the resource production value of every potential build
- Only make 4:1 trades when they enable an immediate important build
- Cycle through "build phases" - expansion phase, then city upgrade phase
- Plan resource collection 2 turns ahead to minimize wasteful trades
- Never accumulate 7+ cards before dice rolls
- Diversify production to minimize dependency on any single resource
- Target a minimum of 4 total settlements before prioritizing city upgrades

COUNTERING ALPHABETA ALGORITHM:
- AlphaBeta looks ahead only 2 steps, so plan your moves 3-4 steps ahead
- Create deceptive game states that appear less threatening than they are
- Block the opponent's highest-probability expansion paths immediately
- Play defensively during early game, then aggressively in mid-game
- When opponent has 7+ points, disrupt their highest-producing hex with the robber
- Track opponent's resources and block their most likely next build
- Secure resources that the opponent depends on heavily
- Place roads to cut off opponent from accessing high-value settlement locations
- Position settlements to deny opponent access to key resource hex intersections

ROBBER PLACEMENT AND KNIGHT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-producing hex of your opponent
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat in mid-game when cities are being built
- Target the specific resource the opponent needs for their next likely build
- Use knight cards reactively when the robber blocks your best production
- Save knight cards for the late game if pursuing largest army
- When stealing, select resources that complete your immediate build needs
- Keep track of opponent cards and target resources they've been collecting
- Balance robber placement between disruption and resource acquisition

DEVELOPMENT CARDS VS. BUILDING:
- Only buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and cannot build
- Buy development cards when you're 1-2 knights away from largest army
- Use knight cards immediately when advantageous (don't save unless close to largest army)
- Victory point cards should only supplement your main strategy, not replace it
- Road Building cards are most valuable when you're cut off or racing to a key location
- Monopoly is best used after high-probability dice rolls to collect opponent's stockpile
- Year of Plenty is ideal to complete a high-value build (settlement or city)
- NEVER delay settlement/city building to purchase development cards unless 1 VP from winning

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY FOCUS):
- Aim for 5 total settlements (2 upgraded to cities) = 9 VP
- Then secure largest army OR longest road for the final point
- Always calculate the fastest path to 10 VP in terms of resource costs
- For each potential build, calculate how many turns closer it gets you to victory
- Determine which victory paths are still viable based on board state
- Switch strategies when your primary path is blocked
- Plan for the end-game by turn 10 (know exactly how you will reach 10 points)
- Track opponent's path to victory and actively disrupt with roads or robber

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Trade at ports even at 4:1 ratio if it enables immediate critical build
- NEVER trade with opponent unless it enables an immediate settlement/city build
- Avoid trades that allow opponent to build immediately after you
- Calculate the net VP gain of each potential trade
- Use trades to dispose of resources when at risk from robber
- Combine multiple port trades to convert unwanted resources into needed ones
- Be willing to overpay through port trades to secure critical positional advantage

DECISION FRAMEWORK (APPLY TO EVERY TURN):
1. What is my immediate build priority? (settlement > city > longest road/largest army)
2. What resource do I need to complete my highest priority build?
3. What is the fastest way to acquire that resource? (production, trading, development cards)
4. How will this action position me for the next 3 turns?
5. Will this action disrupt my opponent's path to victory?
6. Is there a way to combine multiple actions this turn for greater efficiency?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Analysis of Game State

Let me carefully analyze the current game state and my options:

## Current Victory Points (VP)
- I (BLUE) have 5 VP: 3 settlements + longest road (2 VP)
- RED has 5 VP: 1 settlement + 2 cities + 0 bonus

## Resources
- I have 1 of each resource: 🌲WOOD, 🧱BRICK, 🐑SHEEP, 🌾WHEAT, 1 ⛏️ORE
- This gives me exactly the resources needed for either a settlement or a development card

## Available Actions
1. End turn
2. Build settlement at one of 4 locations (nodes 5, 16, 18, or 21)
3. Buy a development card

## Analysis of Settlement Options
- Node 5: Connected to 🌾4 and 🌾10 - both wheat but different numbers (good diversity)
- Node 16: Connected to 🌾4, 🌾10 - both wheat hexes (redundant resource)
- Node 18: Connected to 🌾10 only - just one resource (poor choice)
- Node 21: Connected to 🌾4 only - just one resource (poor choice)

## Strategic Considerations
1. Building a settlement would increase me to 6 VP (more than opponent)
2. All settlement options are primarily wheat-producing, which helps city upgrades
3. Node 5 is best as it provides two different wheat dice numbers (4 and 10)
4. Development card could be a victory point or knight (for largest army potential)

## Path to Victory Assessment
- Currently at 5 VP
- Need 5 more VP to win
- Can get +1 VP from a new settlement (nodes 5)
- Could upgrade existing settlements to cities for +1 VP each
- Could aim for largest army (+2 VP) with development cards
- Development card could be an instant +1 VP card

<plan>Build settlement at node 5 to secure diverse wheat production (4 and 10), increasing to 6 VP. Then focus on upgrading settlements to cities using the improved wheat production combined with my ore access. Continue to maintain longest road advantage while working toward largest army if possible.</plan>

Building a settlement is the best move to increase my lead over the opponent. Node 5 provides the most resource diversity with two different wheat dice rolls (4 and 10), which will help with future city upgrades. This builds on my current plan and advances me toward victory faster than potentially getting a random development card.

# Analyzing Robber Placement Options

I need to determine the optimal hex to place the robber to maximize my chances of winning by disrupting my opponent while potentially gaining a useful resource.

## Evaluating each option:

**[0] Move robber to (0, 0, 0)** - This is the desert hex which produces no resources, so placing the robber here has minimal impact on the game. This would effectively remove the robber from play, which doesn't help my strategy.

**[1] Move robber to (1, -1, 0) and steal from RED** - This is the sheep (🐑3) hex. Looking at RED's buildings, they have a city at node 9 which produces sheep from this hex. Sheep has low production value (3 is only ⭐), but I could steal a card from RED.

**[2] Move robber to (0, -1, 1) and steal from RED** - This is the ore (⛏️5) hex. RED has a city at node 9 that produces ore from this hex. Ore has medium production value (5 is ⭐⭐), and RED might be accumulating ore for cities or development cards. This is a strong option.

**[3] Move robber to (-1, 1, 0)** - This is a wheat (🌾10) hex. Looking at the buildings, only I (BLUE) have settlements on this hex (nodes 5 and 15). Blocking this would hurt my own production without affecting RED, so this is not a good option.

**[4] Move robber to (0, 1, -1) and steal from RED** - This is another wheat (🌾4) hex. RED has a city at node 20 that produces wheat from this hex. Wheat has low production value (4 is only ⭐), but is crucial for settlements, cities, and development cards.

**[5] Move robber to (1, 0, -1) and steal from RED** - This is a brick (🧱6) hex. RED has a city at node 20 and a settlement at node 23, both producing brick from this high-probability hex (6 is ⭐⭐⭐). This is their best production hex and disrupting it would significantly impact their building ability.

## Strategic Analysis:

RED currently has 5 victory points and 5 hidden resource cards. They have 2 cities and 1 settlement, meaning they're likely pursuing a city-focused strategy that requires ore and wheat.

However, looking at their production, their strongest resource is brick from hex (1, 0, -1) with a roll of 6, which is one of the highest probability numbers. This brick production is critical for RED as they need it to build roads and settlements to expand further.

Since RED has 5 hidden resource cards, there's a good chance some of them are bricks from their strong production. By placing the robber on the brick hex (1, 0, -1), I can:
1. Block their most productive hex (roll of 6)
2. Potentially steal a brick or other useful resource
3. Severely limit their ability to build roads to catch up to my longest road

## Decision:

I should place the robber on the brick hex to maximize disruption to RED's strategy while potentially gaining a useful resource myself.

<plan>Continue with my settlement at node 5 plan, but focus on disrupting RED's brick production to prevent them from challenging my longest road. Next, I'll work on upgrading settlements to cities using my ore access, starting with my most productive settlements.</plan>

- Secure missing resources through strategic settlement placement
- Build roads that secure critical expansion paths before the opponent blocks them
- Avoid development cards completely until you have at least 3 total settlements
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1) to complete critical builds
- Target resource diversity through your expansion locations
- Create a minimum 2-turn expansion plan and stick to it

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT AND PRODUCTION (CORE STRATEGY):
- Early game: Focus on wood/brick to expand with roads and settlements
- Mid game: Transition to ore/wheat focus for cities and development cards
- Calculate the resource production value of every potential build
- Only make 4:1 trades when they enable an immediate important build
- Cycle through "build phases" - expansion phase, then city upgrade phase
- Plan resource collection 2 turns ahead to minimize wasteful trades
- Never accumulate 7+ cards before dice rolls
- Diversify production to minimize dependency on any single resource
- Target a minimum of 4 total settlements before prioritizing city upgrades

COUNTERING ALPHABETA ALGORITHM:
- AlphaBeta looks ahead only 2 steps, so plan your moves 3-4 steps ahead
- Create deceptive game states that appear less threatening than they are
- Block the opponent's highest-probability expansion paths immediately
- Play defensively during early game, then aggressively in mid-game
- When opponent has 7+ points, disrupt their highest-producing hex with the robber
- Track opponent's resources and block their most likely next build
- Secure resources that the opponent depends on heavily
- Place roads to cut off opponent from accessing high-value settlement locations
- Position settlements to deny opponent access to key resource hex intersections

ROBBER PLACEMENT AND KNIGHT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-producing hex of your opponent
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat in mid-game when cities are being built
- Target the specific resource the opponent needs for their next likely build
- Use knight cards reactively when the robber blocks your best production
- Save knight cards for the late game if pursuing largest army
- When stealing, select resources that complete your immediate build needs
- Keep track of opponent cards and target resources they've been collecting
- Balance robber placement between disruption and resource acquisition

DEVELOPMENT CARDS VS. BUILDING:
- Only buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and cannot build
- Buy development cards when you're 1-2 knights away from largest army
- Use knight cards immediately when advantageous (don't save unless close to largest army)
- Victory point cards should only supplement your main strategy, not replace it
- Road Building cards are most valuable when you're cut off or racing to a key location
- Monopoly is best used after high-probability dice rolls to collect opponent's stockpile
- Year of Plenty is ideal to complete a high-value build (settlement or city)
- NEVER delay settlement/city building to purchase development cards unless 1 VP from winning

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY FOCUS):
- Aim for 5 total settlements (2 upgraded to cities) = 9 VP
- Then secure largest army OR longest road for the final point
- Always calculate the fastest path to 10 VP in terms of resource costs
- For each potential build, calculate how many turns closer it gets you to victory
- Determine which victory paths are still viable based on board state
- Switch strategies when your primary path is blocked
- Plan for the end-game by turn 10 (know exactly how you will reach 10 points)
- Track opponent's path to victory and actively disrupt with roads or robber

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Trade at ports even at 4:1 ratio if it enables immediate critical build
- NEVER trade with opponent unless it enables an immediate settlement/city build
- Avoid trades that allow opponent to build immediately after you
- Calculate the net VP gain of each potential trade
- Use trades to dispose of resources when at risk from robber
- Combine multiple port trades to convert unwanted resources into needed ones
- Be willing to overpay through port trades to secure critical positional advantage

DECISION FRAMEWORK (APPLY TO EVERY TURN):
1. What is my immediate build priority? (settlement > city > longest road/largest army)
2. What resource do I need to complete my highest priority build?
3. What is the fastest way to acquire that resource? (production, trading, development cards)
4. How will this action position me for the next 3 turns?
5. Will this action disrupt my opponent's path to victory?
6. Is there a way to combine multiple actions this turn for greater efficiency?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 126 | Player: BLUE | Action: MOVE_ROBBER

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  Continue with my settlement at node 5 plan, but focus on disrupting RED's brick production to prevent them from challenging my longest road. Next, I'll work on upgrading settlements to cities using my ore access, starting with my most productive settlements.
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.

# Analyzing Robber Placement Options

Let me analyze each robber placement option to determine the optimal move:

## Game State Assessment
- I have 6 VP (4 settlements + longest road bonus)
- RED has 5 VP (1 settlement + 2 cities)
- RED has 5 hidden cards
- I need to disrupt RED's production while maximizing my own

## Move Robber Options Analysis

**[0] Move robber to (0, 0, 0) (Desert)**
- This is the desert tile which produces no resources
- Placing the robber here has no impact on production
- This is essentially wasting the robber move
- No stealing opportunity

**[1] Move robber to (1, -1, 0) (Sheep 3) and steal from RED**
- Blocks sheep production (lowest probability number)
- RED has a city at node 9 connected to this hex
- This blocks RED's sheep production, but sheep is less critical in mid-game
- Probability value: ⭐ (low impact)

**[2] Move robber to (0, -1, 1) (Ore 5) and steal from RED**
- Blocks ore production with decent probability (5)
- RED has a city at node 9 connected to this hex
- This blocks both RED's and my own ore production
- Critical resource for city upgrades
- Probability value: ⭐⭐ (medium impact)

**[3] Move robber to (-1, 1, 0) (Wheat 10)**
- Blocks wheat 10 production
- This is my own wheat production for settlements 15 and 5
- Does not affect RED directly
- No stealing opportunity
- Probability value: ⭐ (low impact)

**[4] Move robber to (0, 1, -1) (Wheat 4) and steal from RED**
- Blocks wheat 4 production
- RED has a city at node 20 connected to this hex
- This blocks both RED's and my own wheat production
- Probability value: ⭐ (low impact)

**[5] Move robber to (1, 0, -1) (Brick 6) and steal from RED**
- Blocks brick 6 production (high probability number)
- RED has a city at node 20 AND a settlement at node 23 connected to this hex
- This is RED's main brick production
- Brick is critical for road building which could threaten my longest road
- I already have 1 brick, so not hurting my immediate needs
- Probability value: ⭐⭐⭐ (high impact)
- This disrupts RED's ability to build roads and settlements

## Strategic Decision

Option [5] is clearly the best choice:
1. It blocks brick production for RED with a high probability number (6)
2. It affects multiple RED buildings (both a city and a settlement)
3. Brick is critical for RED if they want to challenge my longest road
4. I already have 1 brick in hand, so this doesn't hurt my immediate needs
5. I get to steal a card from RED

<plan>Continue building towards cities by collecting ore and wheat. Block RED's brick production to prevent them from threatening my longest road. My next priority is to upgrade at least one settlement to a city to strengthen my position while maintaining my longest road advantage.</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist focused on defeating the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRITICAL FOR SUCCESS):
- Above all else, target the highest probability numbers (6 & 8) - these produce resources 5/36 times each
- Strictly prioritize access to all five resources between your two settlements
- Aim for numerical diversity - try to cover 5-6 different dice numbers across your settlements
- Never place initial settlements without analyzing future expansion opportunities
- Prioritize placement on hexes with complementary resources: ore/wheat and brick/wood
- Position roads toward high-value unoccupied areas the opponent cannot easily block
- Choose second settlement to complement your first settlement's resource weaknesses
- Consider 3:1 ports if you can't access a specific resource through settlements
- Analyze opponent placement to avoid contested expansion paths
- ALWAYS calculate production value using probability dots (5-6-8-9 are top priority numbers)

# Game Analysis

Let me analyze the current state of the game and my options carefully.

## Victory Points Status
- I (BLUE) have 6 VP: 4 from settlements + 2 from longest road
- RED has 5 VP: 1 from settlement + 4 from cities (2 cities)

## Resources
I currently have:
- 1 🧱 BRICK
- 1 🐑 SHEEP
- 2 🌾 WHEAT
- 1 ⛏️ ORE

## Options Analysis
I have only two options:
1. Buy a development card (costs 1 SHEEP, 1 WHEAT, 1 ORE)
2. End my turn

Let's think about what buying a development card could do for me:

### Potential Development Card Benefits
- Victory Point card: Would get me to 7 VP (hidden until I reveal for the win)
- Knight card: Would help protect my resources and could eventually lead to Largest Army (+2 VP)
- Road Building: Would strengthen my longest road position
- Year of Plenty: Would give me two resources of my choice
- Monopoly: Would allow me to collect all of one resource type from RED

I notice RED has 4 hidden cards. They might be collecting resources for their next build.

## Strategic Considerations
- I need to reach 10 VP to win
- I already have longest road (+2 VP)
- I currently have 4 settlements (4 VP) but no cities
- Upgrading to a city would require 2 more wheat and 2 more ore
- My current plan prioritizes upgrading settlements to cities

With my current resources (1 SHEEP, 2 WHEAT, 1 ORE), I can afford a development card, which could help me in various ways as detailed above.

The robber is currently on a brick hex that RED has a settlement/city on, which aligns with my strategy to block their brick production.

<plan>
Buy a development card now to potentially get closer to 10 VP. If it's a Victory Point card, I'll be at 7 VP. If it's a Knight, I can use it to protect my resources or further disrupt RED's production. Other cards will also help my position. After this, continue to gather ore and wheat for city upgrades.
</plan>

Given my position and resources, buying a development card is the optimal strategic move. It has potential upside with minimal downside compared to ending my turn without doing anything.

2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:

- Analyze opponent placement to avoid contested expansion paths
- ALWAYS calculate production value using probability dots (5-6-8-9 are top priority numbers)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-10):
- Build at least one new settlement by turn 10 - expansion is your TOP priority
- Calculate and build along the fastest path to your next settlement location
- Secure missing resources through strategic settlement placement
- Build roads that secure critical expansion paths before the opponent blocks them
- Avoid development cards completely until you have at least 3 total settlements
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1) to complete critical builds
- Target resource diversity through your expansion locations
- Create a minimum 2-turn expansion plan and stick to it

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT AND PRODUCTION (CORE STRATEGY):
- Early game: Focus on wood/brick to expand with roads and settlements
- Mid game: Transition to ore/wheat focus for cities and development cards
- Calculate the resource production value of every potential build
- Only make 4:1 trades when they enable an immediate important build
- Cycle through "build phases" - expansion phase, then city upgrade phase
- Plan resource collection 2 turns ahead to minimize wasteful trades
- Never accumulate 7+ cards before dice rolls
- Diversify production to minimize dependency on any single resource
- Target a minimum of 4 total settlements before prioritizing city upgrades

COUNTERING ALPHABETA ALGORITHM:
- AlphaBeta looks ahead only 2 steps, so plan your moves 3-4 steps ahead
- Create deceptive game states that appear less threatening than they are
- Block the opponent's highest-probability expansion paths immediately
- Play defensively during early game, then aggressively in mid-game
- When opponent has 7+ points, disrupt their highest-producing hex with the robber
- Track opponent's resources and block their most likely next build
- Secure resources that the opponent depends on heavily
- Place roads to cut off opponent from accessing high-value settlement locations
- Position settlements to deny opponent access to key resource hex intersections

ROBBER PLACEMENT AND KNIGHT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-producing hex of your opponent
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat in mid-game when cities are being built
- Target the specific resource the opponent needs for their next likely build
- Use knight cards reactively when the robber blocks your best production
- Save knight cards for the late game if pursuing largest army
- When stealing, select resources that complete your immediate build needs
- Keep track of opponent cards and target resources they've been collecting
- Balance robber placement between disruption and resource acquisition

DEVELOPMENT CARDS VS. BUILDING:
- Only buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and cannot build
- Buy development cards when you're 1-2 knights away from largest army
- Use knight cards immediately when advantageous (don't save unless close to largest army)
- Victory point cards should only supplement your main strategy, not replace it
- Road Building cards are most valuable when you're cut off or racing to a key location
- Monopoly is best used after high-probability dice rolls to collect opponent's stockpile
- Year of Plenty is ideal to complete a high-value build (settlement or city)
- NEVER delay settlement/city building to purchase development cards unless 1 VP from winning

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY FOCUS):
- Aim for 5 total settlements (2 upgraded to cities) = 9 VP
- Then secure largest army OR longest road for the final point
- Always calculate the fastest path to 10 VP in terms of resource costs
- For each potential build, calculate how many turns closer it gets you to victory
- Determine which victory paths are still viable based on board state
- Switch strategies when your primary path is blocked
- Plan for the end-game by turn 10 (know exactly how you will reach 10 points)
- Track opponent's path to victory and actively disrupt with roads or robber

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Trade at ports even at 4:1 ratio if it enables immediate critical build
- NEVER trade with opponent unless it enables an immediate settlement/city build
- Avoid trades that allow opponent to build immediately after you
- Calculate the net VP gain of each potential trade
- Use trades to dispose of resources when at risk from robber
- Combine multiple port trades to convert unwanted resources into needed ones
- Be willing to overpay through port trades to secure critical positional advantage

DECISION FRAMEWORK (APPLY TO EVERY TURN):
1. What is my immediate build priority? (settlement > city > longest road/largest army)
2. What resource do I need to complete my highest priority build?
3. What is the fastest way to acquire that resource? (production, trading, development cards)
4. How will this action position me for the next 3 turns?
5. Will this action disrupt my opponent's path to victory?
6. Is there a way to combine multiple actions this turn for greater efficiency?

- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 128 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  Buy a development card now to potentially get closer to 10 VP. If it's a Victory Point card, I'll be at 7 VP. If it's a Knight, I can use it to protect my resources or further disrupt RED's production. Other cards will also help my position. After this, continue to gather ore and wheat for city upgrades.
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.

# Game State Analysis

Let me analyze my current position and available options:

## Victory Points Assessment
- I have 6 VP: 4 settlements (4 VP) + longest road (2 VP)
- RED has 5 VP: 1 settlement (1 VP) + 2 cities (4 VP)
- I need 4 more VP to win

## Resource Holdings
- I have: 2 wood, 1 brick, 1 wheat
- I also have 1 unplayed KNIGHT card

## Available Actions
- [0] Play Knight card - Move robber and steal a resource
- [1] Roll the dice

## Board Analysis
- The robber is currently on the brick hex (1,0,-1) with dice number 6
- This is blocking a high-value production hex (6 = ⭐⭐⭐)
- This affects my settlement at node 1, which produces brick from this hex
- It also affects RED's city at node 20 and settlement at node 23

## Decision Analysis

Playing the Knight card (Option 0) would:
- Move the robber away from my brick production
- Allow me to steal a resource from RED (who has 4 cards)
- Disrupt one of RED's productive hexes
- Put me on track for Largest Army (I would have 2 knights played)

Rolling the dice (Option 1) would:
- Potentially give me more resources based on my settlements
- Move the game forward but keep the robber blocking my brick production

My current plan involves getting development cards, but I don't have enough resources to buy one (need 1 ore, 1 wheat, 1 sheep - I only have 1 wheat).

<plan>
Play the Knight card now to unblock my brick production and disrupt RED's resource generation. I'll target their highest production hex. After this, I'll collect resources through dice rolls to either build a city (need 3 ore, 2 wheat) or buy more development cards (for Victory Points or to secure Largest Army). With longest road already secured, my path to victory is clearest through city upgrades and development cards.
</plan>

Looking at the board state, playing the Knight card is clearly the optimal move. It removes the robber from blocking my own resource production while allowing me to disrupt RED's production. Since I need more resources to execute my build strategy, and the robber is currently hurting my own production, this is the correct strategic choice.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist focused on defeating the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRITICAL FOR SUCCESS):
- Above all else, target the highest probability numbers (6 & 8) - these produce resources 5/36 times each
- Strictly prioritize access to all five resources between your two settlements
- Aim for numerical diversity - try to cover 5-6 different dice numbers across your settlements
- Never place initial settlements without analyzing future expansion opportunities
- Prioritize placement on hexes with complementary resources: ore/wheat and brick/wood
- Position roads toward high-value unoccupied areas the opponent cannot easily block
- Choose second settlement to complement your first settlement's resource weaknesses
- Consider 3:1 ports if you can't access a specific resource through settlements
- Analyze opponent placement to avoid contested expansion paths
- ALWAYS calculate production value using probability dots (5-6-8-9 are top priority numbers)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-10):
- Build at least one new settlement by turn 10 - expansion is your TOP priority
- Calculate and build along the fastest path to your next settlement location
- Secure missing resources through strategic settlement placement
- Build roads that secure critical expansion paths before the opponent blocks them
- Avoid development cards completely until you have at least 3 total settlements
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1) to complete critical builds
- Target resource diversity through your expansion locations
- Create a minimum 2-turn expansion plan and stick to it

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT AND PRODUCTION (CORE STRATEGY):
- Early game: Focus on wood/brick to expand with roads and settlements
- Mid game: Transition to ore/wheat focus for cities and development cards
- Calculate the resource production value of every potential build
- Only make 4:1 trades when they enable an immediate important build
- Cycle through "build phases" - expansion phase, then city upgrade phase
- Plan resource collection 2 turns ahead to minimize wasteful trades
- Never accumulate 7+ cards before dice rolls
- Diversify production to minimize dependency on any single resource
- Target a minimum of 4 total settlements before prioritizing city upgrades

COUNTERING ALPHABETA ALGORITHM:
- AlphaBeta looks ahead only 2 steps, so plan your moves 3-4 steps ahead
- Create deceptive game states that appear less threatening than they are
- Block the opponent's highest-probability expansion paths immediately
- Play defensively during early game, then aggressively in mid-game
- When opponent has 7+ points, disrupt their highest-producing hex with the robber
- Track opponent's resources and block their most likely next build
- Secure resources that the opponent depends on heavily
- Place roads to cut off opponent from accessing high-value settlement locations
- Position settlements to deny opponent access to key resource hex intersections

ROBBER PLACEMENT AND KNIGHT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-producing hex of your opponent
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat in mid-game when cities are being built
- Target the specific resource the opponent needs for their next likely build
- Use knight cards reactively when the robber blocks your best production
- Save knight cards for the late game if pursuing largest army
- When stealing, select resources that complete your immediate build needs
- Keep track of opponent cards and target resources they've been collecting
- Balance robber placement between disruption and resource acquisition

DEVELOPMENT CARDS VS. BUILDING:
- Only buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and cannot build
- Buy development cards when you're 1-2 knights away from largest army
- Use knight cards immediately when advantageous (don't save unless close to largest army)
- Victory point cards should only supplement your main strategy, not replace it
- Road Building cards are most valuable when you're cut off or racing to a key location
- Monopoly is best used after high-probability dice rolls to collect opponent's stockpile
- Year of Plenty is ideal to complete a high-value build (settlement or city)
- NEVER delay settlement/city building to purchase development cards unless 1 VP from winning

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY FOCUS):
- Aim for 5 total settlements (2 upgraded to cities) = 9 VP
- Then secure largest army OR longest road for the final point
- Always calculate the fastest path to 10 VP in terms of resource costs
- For each potential build, calculate how many turns closer it gets you to victory
- Determine which victory paths are still viable based on board state
- Switch strategies when your primary path is blocked
- Plan for the end-game by turn 10 (know exactly how you will reach 10 points)
- Track opponent's path to victory and actively disrupt with roads or robber

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Trade at ports even at 4:1 ratio if it enables immediate critical build
- NEVER trade with opponent unless it enables an immediate settlement/city build
- Avoid trades that allow opponent to build immediately after you
- Calculate the net VP gain of each potential trade
- Use trades to dispose of resources when at risk from robber
- Combine multiple port trades to convert unwanted resources into needed ones
- Be willing to overpay through port trades to secure critical positional advantage

DECISION FRAMEWORK (APPLY TO EVERY TURN):
1. What is my immediate build priority? (settlement > city > longest road/largest army)
2. What resource do I need to complete my highest priority build?
3. What is the fastest way to acquire that resource? (production, trading, development cards)
4. How will this action position me for the next 3 turns?
5. Will this action disrupt my opponent's path to victory?
6. Is there a way to combine multiple actions this turn for greater efficiency?

# Game Analysis: Move Robber Decision

Let me analyze the current game state and available robber movement options to make an optimal decision.

## Current Game Status
- I have 6/10 victory points (4 settlements + longest road bonus)
- Opponent (RED) has 5/10 points (1 settlement + 2 cities)
- Robber is currently on (1, 0, -1) which is a 🧱6 hex - blocking my brick production at node 1

## Resource Analysis
- I have: 2 wood, 1 brick, 1 wheat
- For my next builds, I need:
  - City upgrade: 3 ore, 2 wheat (I'm missing significant resources)
  - Development card: 1 ore, 1 wheat, 1 sheep (I have 1 wheat but missing ore and sheep)

## Robber Movement Options
[0] Move to (0, 0, 0) - desert hex - wasted move, no production blocked
[1] Move to (1, -1, 0) - sheep 3 hex - affects RED's node 9 city
[2] Move to (0, -1, 1) - ore 5 hex - affects RED's node 9 city and my node 12 settlement
[3] Move to (-1, 0, 1) - wood 8 hex - affects my settlements at nodes 12 and 15
[4] Move to (-1, 1, 0) - wheat 10 hex - affects my settlements at nodes 5 and 15
[5] Move to (0, 1, -1) - wheat 4 hex - affects RED's node 20 city and my node 5 settlement

## Strategic Evaluation

Looking at each option:
- Option [0] moves the robber to the desert which has no production - this is pointless
- Option [2] blocks ore, but affects both RED and me - counterproductive as I need ore
- Option [3] blocks my own wood production - would hurt me severely
- Option [4] blocks my own wheat production - would hurt me when I need wheat

The best options are:
- Option [1]: Blocks RED's sheep 3 hex and allows me to steal from RED
- Option [5]: Blocks wheat 4 hex, affecting RED's city and my settlement, and lets me steal from RED

Option [1] targets the sheep 3 hex connected to RED's city at node 9. While sheep is a lower-value resource (3 is a less frequent roll), this option only impacts RED without hurting my own production.

Option [5] targets the wheat 4 hex which affects RED's city at node 20, but also impacts my settlement at node 5. This would hurt both of us, and wheat is important for both city upgrades and development cards.

<plan>
I'll prioritize disrupting RED's production without impacting my own. After moving the robber to the sheep 3 hex, I'll focus on collecting ore and wheat for either a city upgrade or development cards. With longest road secured, I'll aim for either city upgrades or largest army through development cards to reach 10 VP.
</plan>

## Final Decision
Option [1] is optimal as it:
1. Disrupts RED's production at their city
2. Doesn't block any of my own production
3. Gives me an opportunity to steal a resource from RED
4. Targets a resource (sheep) that I need for development cards

# Game Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state and options:

## Current Status
- I have 6 VP (4 settlements + longest road bonus)
- Red has 5 VP (1 settlement + 2 cities)
- I have 4 wood, 1 brick, 1 sheep, 1 wheat, 0 ore
- I have longest road (10 segments) giving me +2 VP
- The robber is on a sheep hex

## Available Options
0. End turn
1. Build settlement at node 18 (costs 1 wood, 1 brick, 1 wheat, 1 sheep)
2. Build settlement at node 21 (costs 1 wood, 1 brick, 1 wheat, 1 sheep)
3-6. Maritime trades exchanging wood for other resources

## Analysis

Building a settlement would:
- Increase my VP to 7/10
- Improve my resource production
- Use all my non-wood resources

Let's examine the settlement locations:
- Node 18 connects to hex producing wheat (10)
- Node 21 connects to hex producing wheat (4)

Building either settlement would:
1. Move me to 7 VP (3 away from winning)
2. Increase my wheat production
3. Deplete my current resources except wood

Since I already have longest road, my path to victory requires:
- Building this settlement (+1 VP)
- Building 1 more settlement (+1 VP) or
- Upgrading 2 settlements to cities (+2 VP) or
- Getting largest army (+2 VP)

With my current abundance of wood, I could trade for missing resources next turn. Building a settlement now is the most efficient use of my current resources.

Between nodes 18 and 21, node 18 connects to wheat (10), which has better probability than node 21's wheat (4).

<plan>Build settlement at node 18 now. Next, focus on using excess wood to trade for ore and wheat to either upgrade settlements to cities or buy development cards for largest army. Aim to reach 10 VP through either 5 settlements + longest road OR 4 settlements + 1-2 cities + longest road.</plan>

Based on this analysis, I choose to:

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist focused on defeating the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRITICAL FOR SUCCESS):
- Above all else, target the highest probability numbers (6 & 8) - these produce resources 5/36 times each
- Strictly prioritize access to all five resources between your two settlements
- Aim for numerical diversity - try to cover 5-6 different dice numbers across your settlements
- Never place initial settlements without analyzing future expansion opportunities
- Prioritize placement on hexes with complementary resources: ore/wheat and brick/wood
- Position roads toward high-value unoccupied areas the opponent cannot easily block
- Choose second settlement to complement your first settlement's resource weaknesses
- Consider 3:1 ports if you can't access a specific resource through settlements
- Analyze opponent placement to avoid contested expansion paths
- ALWAYS calculate production value using probability dots (5-6-8-9 are top priority numbers)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-10):
- Build at least one new settlement by turn 10 - expansion is your TOP priority
- Calculate and build along the fastest path to your next settlement location
- Secure missing resources through strategic settlement placement
- Build roads that secure critical expansion paths before the opponent blocks them
- Avoid development cards completely until you have at least 3 total settlements
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1) to complete critical builds
- Target resource diversity through your expansion locations
- Create a minimum 2-turn expansion plan and stick to it

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT AND PRODUCTION (CORE STRATEGY):
- Early game: Focus on wood/brick to expand with roads and settlements
- Mid game: Transition to ore/wheat focus for cities and development cards
- Calculate the resource production value of every potential build
- Only make 4:1 trades when they enable an immediate important build
- Cycle through "build phases" - expansion phase, then city upgrade phase
- Plan resource collection 2 turns ahead to minimize wasteful trades
- Never accumulate 7+ cards before dice rolls
- Diversify production to minimize dependency on any single resource
- Target a minimum of 4 total settlements before prioritizing city upgrades

COUNTERING ALPHABETA ALGORITHM:
- AlphaBeta looks ahead only 2 steps, so plan your moves 3-4 steps ahead
- Create deceptive game states that appear less threatening than they are
- Block the opponent's highest-probability expansion paths immediately
- Play defensively during early game, then aggressively in mid-game
- When opponent has 7+ points, disrupt their highest-producing hex with the robber
- Track opponent's resources and block their most likely next build
- Secure resources that the opponent depends on heavily
- Place roads to cut off opponent from accessing high-value settlement locations
- Position settlements to deny opponent access to key resource hex intersections

ROBBER PLACEMENT AND KNIGHT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-producing hex of your opponent
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat in mid-game when cities are being built
- Target the specific resource the opponent needs for their next likely build
- Use knight cards reactively when the robber blocks your best production
- Save knight cards for the late game if pursuing largest army
- When stealing, select resources that complete your immediate build needs
- Keep track of opponent cards and target resources they've been collecting
- Balance robber placement between disruption and resource acquisition

DEVELOPMENT CARDS VS. BUILDING:
- Only buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and cannot build
- Buy development cards when you're 1-2 knights away from largest army
- Use knight cards immediately when advantageous (don't save unless close to largest army)
- Victory point cards should only supplement your main strategy, not replace it
- Road Building cards are most valuable when you're cut off or racing to a key location
- Monopoly is best used after high-probability dice rolls to collect opponent's stockpile
- Year of Plenty is ideal to complete a high-value build (settlement or city)
- NEVER delay settlement/city building to purchase development cards unless 1 VP from winning

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY FOCUS):
- Aim for 5 total settlements (2 upgraded to cities) = 9 VP
- Then secure largest army OR longest road for the final point
- Always calculate the fastest path to 10 VP in terms of resource costs
- For each potential build, calculate how many turns closer it gets you to victory
- Determine which victory paths are still viable based on board state
- Switch strategies when your primary path is blocked
- Plan for the end-game by turn 10 (know exactly how you will reach 10 points)
- Track opponent's path to victory and actively disrupt with roads or robber

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Trade at ports even at 4:1 ratio if it enables immediate critical build
- NEVER trade with opponent unless it enables an immediate settlement/city build
- Avoid trades that allow opponent to build immediately after you
- Calculate the net VP gain of each potential trade
- Use trades to dispose of resources when at risk from robber
- Combine multiple port trades to convert unwanted resources into needed ones
- Be willing to overpay through port trades to secure critical positional advantage

DECISION FRAMEWORK (APPLY TO EVERY TURN):
1. What is my immediate build priority? (settlement > city > longest road/largest army)
2. What resource do I need to complete my highest priority build?
3. What is the fastest way to acquire that resource? (production, trading, development cards)
4. How will this action position me for the next 3 turns?
5. Will this action disrupt my opponent's path to victory?
6. Is there a way to combine multiple actions this turn for greater efficiency?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 130 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  Build settlement at node 18 now. Next, focus on using excess wood to trade for ore and wheat to either upgrade settlements to cities or buy development cards for largest army. Aim to reach 10 VP through either 5 settlements + longest road OR 4 settlements + 1-2 cities + longest road.

# Game State Analysis

Let me assess the current situation:

## Victory Points Status
- BLUE (me): 7 VP (5 settlements + longest road bonus)
- RED: 5 VP (1 settlement + 2 cities)

## Resource Status
- I have: 3 🌲WOOD, 6 🌾WHEAT
- RED has: 3 hidden cards

## Board Position
- I have 5 settlements and longest road (10 segments)
- RED has 1 settlement, 2 cities
- The robber is on the sheep hex (1, -1, 0)

## Path to Victory Analysis
I need 3 more VP to win. My options:
1. Build a city (2 VP) and get 1 more VP from somewhere else
2. Build development cards hoping for VP cards or largest army

## Current Plan Evaluation
My plan was to build a settlement at node 18, which I've already done. Now I need to focus on cities or development cards.

## Resource Needs
- For a city: Need 3 ore, 2 wheat (I have 6 wheat but no ore)
- For dev card: Need 1 ore, 1 wheat, 1 sheep (I have wheat but no ore or sheep)

# Decision Process

Looking at my available actions:
- [0] End turn
- [1-4] Trade wheat for another resource

Since I already have 6 wheat and 3 wood, but no ore, I should consider trading some wheat for ore. This would be the most efficient use of my resources, as I could start working toward a city upgrade.

Let's consider the options:
- Option 4: Trade 4 wheat for 1 ore
  This would leave me with 2 wheat and 1 ore, getting closer to a city but still needing 2 more ore
- Option 0: End turn
  This preserves my resources, but doesn't advance my position

<plan>Trade wheat for ore to work toward city upgrades. Focus on upgrading one settlement to a city (2 VP), then use development cards or another settlement for the final VP needed. Continue using the longest road advantage while blocking opponent's expansion.</plan>

Given my current state and the fact that I have excess wheat, trading for ore makes the most sense to work toward upgrading a settlement to a city.

# Game Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state in detail:

## Victory Points
- I (BLUE) have 7 VP: 5 settlements (5 VP) + Longest Road (2 VP)
- RED has 5 VP: 1 settlement (1 VP) + 2 cities (4 VP)
- I need 3 more VP to win

## Resources
- I have: 3 WOOD, 2 WHEAT, 3 ORE
- To build a city, I need: 2 WHEAT, 3 ORE
- I have exactly enough resources to upgrade one settlement to a city

## Strategic Considerations
1. Upgrading a settlement to a city would increase my VP from 7 to 8
2. RED has 7 hidden resources, possibly saving for another city or development cards
3. The robber is on a sheep hex which doesn't affect my production
4. Upgrading a settlement would double its resource production

## Settlement Upgrade Analysis
Looking at each settlement's resource production:
- Node 12: produces ORE(5) and WOOD(8) - both high probability numbers
- Node 1: produces SHEEP(3) and BRICK(6) - BRICK is high value
- Node 15: produces WOOD(8) and WHEAT(10) - WOOD is high value
- Node 5: produces two WHEAT hexes (4 and 10) - doubling WHEAT production
- Node 18: produces only WHEAT(10) - least valuable to upgrade

Upgrading node 12 seems most beneficial because:
- It produces ORE (5) which has high probability (⭐⭐)
- It produces WOOD (8) which has very high probability (⭐⭐⭐)
- ORE is crucial for future city upgrades and development cards
- This would strengthen my mid-game resource engine

<plan>Upgrade settlement at node 12 to a city to reach 8 VP. This doubles production of key resources (ORE and WOOD). Then focus on either buying development cards for potential VPs or knights, or save resources for another city upgrade. Maintain longest road advantage while working toward the final 2 VP needed.</plan>

Upgrading the settlement at node 12 is clearly the optimal move as it strengthens my resource engine with high-probability production while advancing me to 8 VP.

4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRITICAL FOR SUCCESS):
- Above all else, target the highest probability numbers (6 & 8) - these produce resources 5/36 times each
- Strictly prioritize access to all five resources between your two settlements
- Aim for numerical diversity - try to cover 5-6 different dice numbers across your settlements
- Never place initial settlements without analyzing future expansion opportunities
- Prioritize placement on hexes with complementary resources: ore/wheat and brick/wood
- Position roads toward high-value unoccupied areas the opponent cannot easily block
- Choose second settlement to complement your first settlement's resource weaknesses
- Consider 3:1 ports if you can't access a specific resource through settlements
- Analyze opponent placement to avoid contested expansion paths
- ALWAYS calculate production value using probability dots (5-6-8-9 are top priority numbers)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-10):
- Build at least one new settlement by turn 10 - expansion is your TOP priority
- Calculate and build along the fastest path to your next settlement location
- Secure missing resources through strategic settlement placement
- Build roads that secure critical expansion paths before the opponent blocks them
- Avoid development cards completely until you have at least 3 total settlements
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1) to complete critical builds
- Target resource diversity through your expansion locations
- Create a minimum 2-turn expansion plan and stick to it

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT AND PRODUCTION (CORE STRATEGY):
- Early game: Focus on wood/brick to expand with roads and settlements
- Mid game: Transition to ore/wheat focus for cities and development cards
- Calculate the resource production value of every potential build
- Only make 4:1 trades when they enable an immediate important build
- Cycle through "build phases" - expansion phase, then city upgrade phase
- Plan resource collection 2 turns ahead to minimize wasteful trades
- Never accumulate 7+ cards before dice rolls
- Diversify production to minimize dependency on any single resource
- Target a minimum of 4 total settlements before prioritizing city upgrades

COUNTERING ALPHABETA ALGORITHM:
- AlphaBeta looks ahead only 2 steps, so plan your moves 3-4 steps ahead
- Create deceptive game states that appear less threatening than they are
- Block the opponent's highest-probability expansion paths immediately
- Play defensively during early game, then aggressively in mid-game
- When opponent has 7+ points, disrupt their highest-producing hex with the robber
- Track opponent's resources and block their most likely next build
- Secure resources that the opponent depends on heavily
- Place roads to cut off opponent from accessing high-value settlement locations
- Position settlements to deny opponent access to key resource hex intersections

ROBBER PLACEMENT AND KNIGHT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-producing hex of your opponent
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat in mid-game when cities are being built
- Target the specific resource the opponent needs for their next likely build
- Use knight cards reactively when the robber blocks your best production
- Save knight cards for the late game if pursuing largest army
- When stealing, select resources that complete your immediate build needs
- Keep track of opponent cards and target resources they've been collecting
- Balance robber placement between disruption and resource acquisition

DEVELOPMENT CARDS VS. BUILDING:
- Only buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and cannot build
- Buy development cards when you're 1-2 knights away from largest army
- Use knight cards immediately when advantageous (don't save unless close to largest army)
- Victory point cards should only supplement your main strategy, not replace it
- Road Building cards are most valuable when you're cut off or racing to a key location
- Monopoly is best used after high-probability dice rolls to collect opponent's stockpile
- Year of Plenty is ideal to complete a high-value build (settlement or city)
- NEVER delay settlement/city building to purchase development cards unless 1 VP from winning

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY FOCUS):
- Aim for 5 total settlements (2 upgraded to cities) = 9 VP
- Then secure largest army OR longest road for the final point
- Always calculate the fastest path to 10 VP in terms of resource costs
- For each potential build, calculate how many turns closer it gets you to victory
- Determine which victory paths are still viable based on board state
- Switch strategies when your primary path is blocked
- Plan for the end-game by turn 10 (know exactly how you will reach 10 points)
- Track opponent's path to victory and actively disrupt with roads or robber

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Trade at ports even at 4:1 ratio if it enables immediate critical build
- NEVER trade with opponent unless it enables an immediate settlement/city build
- Avoid trades that allow opponent to build immediately after you
- Calculate the net VP gain of each potential trade
- Use trades to dispose of resources when at risk from robber
- Combine multiple port trades to convert unwanted resources into needed ones
- Be willing to overpay through port trades to secure critical positional advantage

DECISION FRAMEWORK (APPLY TO EVERY TURN):
1. What is my immediate build priority? (settlement > city > longest road/largest army)
2. What resource do I need to complete my highest priority build?
3. What is the fastest way to acquire that resource? (production, trading, development cards)
4. How will this action position me for the next 3 turns?
5. Will this action disrupt my opponent's path to victory?
6. Is there a way to combine multiple actions this turn for greater efficiency?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 140 | Player: BLUE | Action: MOVE_ROBBER

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  Upgrade settlement at node 12 to a city to reach 8 VP. This doubles production of key resources (ORE and WOOD). Then focus on either buying development cards for potential VPs or knights, or save resources for another city upgrade. Maintain longest road advantage while working toward the final 2 VP needed.
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.

# Robber Placement Analysis

I need to analyze the optimal robber placement to disrupt RED's production while potentially gaining a useful resource.

## Step 1: Assess the current game state
- I have 8 VP (4 settlements, 1 city, longest road bonus)
- RED has 6 VP (2 settlements, 2 cities)
- I have 6 🌲WOOD and 1 🌾WHEAT
- RED has 2 unknown cards

## Step 2: Analyze each potential robber location

[0] Move robber to (0, 0, 0) - Desert
- This is the desert hex which produces nothing
- Placing the robber here has no strategic value
- No theft opportunity

[1] Move robber to (0, -1, 1) and steal from RED
- This is ⛏️5 (ore) with 2 dots (medium-high probability)
- RED's city at node 9 produces from this hex
- Blocks a key resource RED likely needs for development cards or cities

[2] Move robber to (-1, 0, 1)
- This is 🌲8 (wood) with 3 dots (high probability)
- This would block my own city production at node 12 and settlement at node 15
- This would severely limit my own wood production, which is counterproductive

[3] Move robber to (-1, 1, 0)
- This is 🌾10 (wheat) with 1 dot (lower probability)
- Would block my own settlements at nodes 5, 15, and 18
- This would harm my own wheat production significantly

[4] Move robber to (0, 1, -1) and steal from RED
- This is 🌾4 (wheat) with 1 dot (lower probability)
- RED's city at node 20 produces from this hex
- While this blocks wheat, it's a low probability number (4)

[5] Move robber to (1, 0, -1) and steal from RED
- This is 🧱6 (brick) with 3 dots (high probability)
- RED has a city at node 20 and settlement at node 23 producing from this hex
- This is RED's main brick production (high value resource)

## Step 3: Strategic considerations
- RED likely needs ore for development cards or city upgrades
- RED also heavily depends on brick (6) with two buildings adjacent to it
- I have a strong lead with longest road and overall VP
- I need to focus on disrupting RED's ability to catch up

## Step 4: Decision

Option [5] provides the best strategic value because:
1. It blocks a high-probability (6) brick hex
2. Brick is crucial for RED if they want to expand with roads and settlements
3. It affects two of RED's buildings (city at node 20 and settlement at node 23)
4. I can potentially steal a useful resource
5. I'm not blocking any of my own production

<plan>Continue with city upgrade at node 12. With longest road secured, focus on disrupting RED's access to brick and ore resources while I accumulate resources for another city upgrade or development cards. Watch for opportunities to acquire ore to complement my wood and wheat production.</plan>

# Game State Analysis

First, let's assess my current position:
- I have 8/10 victory points (4 settlements + 1 city + longest road)
- I have 6 wood and 2 wheat resources
- The robber is on brick (1, 0, -1), blocking my opponent's high-producing brick hex
- I have secured longest road with 10 segments

## Resource Assessment
- I have plenty of wood (6) but limited wheat (2)
- I'm completely lacking ore, brick, and sheep
- My buildings produce wood and wheat well, with some ore access

## Victory Point Path Analysis
To reach 10 points, I need 2 more points. Options:
1. Upgrade a settlement to city (+1 VP) and buy a victory point card (+1 VP)
2. Build 2 more settlements (+2 VP)
3. Secure largest army if possible (+2 VP)

Option 1 seems most viable given my current position, but I need ore.

## Available Actions
My options are:
- [0] End turn
- [1-4] Trade 4 wood for 1 of another resource

## Strategic Decision Making
I currently have 6 wood and 2 wheat. To upgrade a settlement to a city, I need 3 ore and 2 wheat. I already have the wheat needed, but I have no ore.

Trading 4 wood for 1 ore would give me 1/3 of the ore needed for a city upgrade. This is not enough to complete a city this turn, but it's a step toward my goal. With 2 wood remaining after the trade, I would still have resources for future production.

<plan>
Trade wood for ore to begin collecting resources for a city upgrade. I need 3 ore total for a city, so this is the first step. After I get more ore from production or trading, upgrade another settlement to a city to reach 9 VP. Then either secure largest army or build another settlement for the final victory point.
</plan>

Since I can't complete any meaningful build this turn, and trading gets me started toward my next city upgrade, I'll trade for ore.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist focused on defeating the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRITICAL FOR SUCCESS):
- Above all else, target the highest probability numbers (6 & 8) - these produce resources 5/36 times each
- Strictly prioritize access to all five resources between your two settlements
- Aim for numerical diversity - try to cover 5-6 different dice numbers across your settlements
- Never place initial settlements without analyzing future expansion opportunities
- Prioritize placement on hexes with complementary resources: ore/wheat and brick/wood
- Position roads toward high-value unoccupied areas the opponent cannot easily block
- Choose second settlement to complement your first settlement's resource weaknesses
- Consider 3:1 ports if you can't access a specific resource through settlements
- Analyze opponent placement to avoid contested expansion paths
- ALWAYS calculate production value using probability dots (5-6-8-9 are top priority numbers)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-10):
- Build at least one new settlement by turn 10 - expansion is your TOP priority
- Calculate and build along the fastest path to your next settlement location
- Secure missing resources through strategic settlement placement
- Build roads that secure critical expansion paths before the opponent blocks them
- Avoid development cards completely until you have at least 3 total settlements
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1) to complete critical builds
- Target resource diversity through your expansion locations
- Create a minimum 2-turn expansion plan and stick to it

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT AND PRODUCTION (CORE STRATEGY):
- Early game: Focus on wood/brick to expand with roads and settlements
- Mid game: Transition to ore/wheat focus for cities and development cards
- Calculate the resource production value of every potential build
- Only make 4:1 trades when they enable an immediate important build
- Cycle through "build phases" - expansion phase, then city upgrade phase
- Plan resource collection 2 turns ahead to minimize wasteful trades
- Never accumulate 7+ cards before dice rolls
- Diversify production to minimize dependency on any single resource
- Target a minimum of 4 total settlements before prioritizing city upgrades

COUNTERING ALPHABETA ALGORITHM:
- AlphaBeta looks ahead only 2 steps, so plan your moves 3-4 steps ahead
- Create deceptive game states that appear less threatening than they are
- Block the opponent's highest-probability expansion paths immediately
- Play defensively during early game, then aggressively in mid-game
- When opponent has 7+ points, disrupt their highest-producing hex with the robber
- Track opponent's resources and block their most likely next build
- Secure resources that the opponent depends on heavily
- Place roads to cut off opponent from accessing high-value settlement locations
- Position settlements to deny opponent access to key resource hex intersections

ROBBER PLACEMENT AND KNIGHT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-producing hex of your opponent
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat in mid-game when cities are being built
- Target the specific resource the opponent needs for their next likely build
- Use knight cards reactively when the robber blocks your best production
- Save knight cards for the late game if pursuing largest army
- When stealing, select resources that complete your immediate build needs
- Keep track of opponent cards and target resources they've been collecting
- Balance robber placement between disruption and resource acquisition

DEVELOPMENT CARDS VS. BUILDING:
- Only buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and cannot build
- Buy development cards when you're 1-2 knights away from largest army
- Use knight cards immediately when advantageous (don't save unless close to largest army)
- Victory point cards should only supplement your main strategy, not replace it
- Road Building cards are most valuable when you're cut off or racing to a key location
- Monopoly is best used after high-probability dice rolls to collect opponent's stockpile
- Year of Plenty is ideal to complete a high-value build (settlement or city)
- NEVER delay settlement/city building to purchase development cards unless 1 VP from winning

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY FOCUS):
- Aim for 5 total settlements (2 upgraded to cities) = 9 VP
- Then secure largest army OR longest road for the final point
- Always calculate the fastest path to 10 VP in terms of resource costs
- For each potential build, calculate how many turns closer it gets you to victory
- Determine which victory paths are still viable based on board state
- Switch strategies when your primary path is blocked
- Plan for the end-game by turn 10 (know exactly how you will reach 10 points)
- Track opponent's path to victory and actively disrupt with roads or robber

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Trade at ports even at 4:1 ratio if it enables immediate critical build
- NEVER trade with opponent unless it enables an immediate settlement/city build
- Avoid trades that allow opponent to build immediately after you
- Calculate the net VP gain of each potential trade
- Use trades to dispose of resources when at risk from robber
- Combine multiple port trades to convert unwanted resources into needed ones
- Be willing to overpay through port trades to secure critical positional advantage

DECISION FRAMEWORK (APPLY TO EVERY TURN):
1. What is my immediate build priority? (settlement > city > longest road/largest army)
2. What resource do I need to complete my highest priority build?
3. What is the fastest way to acquire that resource? (production, trading, development cards)
4. How will this action position me for the next 3 turns?
5. Will this action disrupt my opponent's path to victory?
6. Is there a way to combine multiple actions this turn for greater efficiency?

TURN 142 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  Trade wood for ore to begin collecting resources for a city upgrade. I need 3 ore total for a city, so this is the first step. After I get more ore from production or trading, upgrade another settlement to a city to reach 9 VP. Then either secure largest army or build another settlement for the final victory point.

# Game Analysis and Action Selection

Let me analyze the current game state and my best move options:

## Current Victory Points (8/10):
- 5 VP from buildings (4 settlements + 1 city)
- 2 VP from Longest Road bonus
- 1 VP away from 9, and 2 VP away from winning

## Resources:
- 2 🌲WOOD
- 1 🐑SHEEP
- 2 🌾WHEAT
- 3 ⛏️ORE

## Available Actions:
I can either:
1. Upgrade one of my settlements to a city (costs 2 WHEAT + 3 ORE)
2. Buy a development card (costs 1 SHEEP + 1 WHEAT + 1 ORE)
3. End my turn

## Decision Analysis:

1. **City Upgrade Option**:
   - I have 2 WHEAT and 3 ORE, which is exactly what I need to upgrade to a city
   - This would give me +1 VP, bringing me to 9 VP (just 1 away from winning)
   - It would also increase my production capacity for future turns

2. **Development Card Option**:
   - Could potentially get a Victory Point card (instant win if I already have a hidden VP card)
   - Could get a Knight to help toward Largest Army
   - But this is more of a gamble and doesn't guarantee progress

3. **End Turn Option**:
   - No benefit to ending turn without taking an action when I can make a productive move

The most strategic move is clearly to upgrade one of my settlements to a city. This will:
- Immediately increase my VP total to 9/10
- Increase my production capacity
- Position me just 1 VP away from winning

## Which Settlement to Upgrade?

Let me evaluate each settlement:

1. Node 1: Produces 🐑3[⭐], 🧱6[⭐⭐⭐] - Strong brick production on a 6
2. Node 15: Produces 🌲8[⭐⭐⭐], 🌾10[⭐] - Strong wood production on an 8
3. Node 5: Produces 🌾10[⭐], 🌾4[⭐] - Moderate wheat production
4. Node 18: Produces 🌾10[⭐] - Limited to just wheat production

Node 15 on the 8 for wood is the most strategic choice as:
1. Wood is valuable for continued expansion
2. It's on an 8, which is one of the highest probability numbers
3. This increases my production on a resource I'm currently low on (wood)

<plan>
After upgrading the settlement at node 15 to a city, I'll have 9 VP. For my final VP, I'll need to either:
1. Build one more settlement (need 1 wood, 1 brick, 1 wheat, 1 sheep)
2. Get a VP development card
3. Or secure Largest Army (I already have 2 knights played)
I'll focus on maximizing my production while blocking the opponent from catching up.
</plan>

Based on this analysis, I will upgrade my settlement at node 15 to a city.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist focused on defeating the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRITICAL FOR SUCCESS):
- Above all else, target the highest probability numbers (6 & 8) - these produce resources 5/36 times each
- Strictly prioritize access to all five resources between your two settlements
- Aim for numerical diversity - try to cover 5-6 different dice numbers across your settlements
- Never place initial settlements without analyzing future expansion opportunities
- Prioritize placement on hexes with complementary resources: ore/wheat and brick/wood
- Position roads toward high-value unoccupied areas the opponent cannot easily block
- Choose second settlement to complement your first settlement's resource weaknesses
- Consider 3:1 ports if you can't access a specific resource through settlements
- Analyze opponent placement to avoid contested expansion paths
- ALWAYS calculate production value using probability dots (5-6-8-9 are top priority numbers)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-10):
- Build at least one new settlement by turn 10 - expansion is your TOP priority
- Calculate and build along the fastest path to your next settlement location
- Secure missing resources through strategic settlement placement
- Build roads that secure critical expansion paths before the opponent blocks them
- Avoid development cards completely until you have at least 3 total settlements
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1) to complete critical builds
- Target resource diversity through your expansion locations
- Create a minimum 2-turn expansion plan and stick to it

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT AND PRODUCTION (CORE STRATEGY):
- Early game: Focus on wood/brick to expand with roads and settlements
- Mid game: Transition to ore/wheat focus for cities and development cards
- Calculate the resource production value of every potential build
- Only make 4:1 trades when they enable an immediate important build
- Cycle through "build phases" - expansion phase, then city upgrade phase
- Plan resource collection 2 turns ahead to minimize wasteful trades
- Never accumulate 7+ cards before dice rolls
- Diversify production to minimize dependency on any single resource
- Target a minimum of 4 total settlements before prioritizing city upgrades

COUNTERING ALPHABETA ALGORITHM:
- AlphaBeta looks ahead only 2 steps, so plan your moves 3-4 steps ahead
- Create deceptive game states that appear less threatening than they are
- Block the opponent's highest-probability expansion paths immediately
- Play defensively during early game, then aggressively in mid-game
- When opponent has 7+ points, disrupt their highest-producing hex with the robber
- Track opponent's resources and block their most likely next build
- Secure resources that the opponent depends on heavily
- Place roads to cut off opponent from accessing high-value settlement locations
- Position settlements to deny opponent access to key resource hex intersections

ROBBER PLACEMENT AND KNIGHT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-producing hex of your opponent
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat in mid-game when cities are being built
- Target the specific resource the opponent needs for their next likely build
- Use knight cards reactively when the robber blocks your best production
- Save knight cards for the late game if pursuing largest army
- When stealing, select resources that complete your immediate build needs
- Keep track of opponent cards and target resources they've been collecting
- Balance robber placement between disruption and resource acquisition

DEVELOPMENT CARDS VS. BUILDING:
- Only buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and cannot build
- Buy development cards when you're 1-2 knights away from largest army
- Use knight cards immediately when advantageous (don't save unless close to largest army)
- Victory point cards should only supplement your main strategy, not replace it
- Road Building cards are most valuable when you're cut off or racing to a key location
- Monopoly is best used after high-probability dice rolls to collect opponent's stockpile
- Year of Plenty is ideal to complete a high-value build (settlement or city)
- NEVER delay settlement/city building to purchase development cards unless 1 VP from winning

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY FOCUS):
- Aim for 5 total settlements (2 upgraded to cities) = 9 VP
- Then secure largest army OR longest road for the final point
- Always calculate the fastest path to 10 VP in terms of resource costs
- For each potential build, calculate how many turns closer it gets you to victory

# Game State Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state and my available options to make the optimal decision.

## Current Position
- I have 9/10 victory points (2 cities = 4 VP, 3 settlements = 3 VP, Longest Road = 2 VP)
- Need just 1 more VP to win
- Resources: 2 Wood, 1 Sheep, 1 Wheat, 2 Ore
- Opponent has 6/10 VP (2 cities = 4 VP, 2 settlements = 2 VP)
- The robber is on a brick hex (1,0,-1) which is producing for my opponent

## Available Actions
[0] End turn
[1] Buy a development card (1 Sheep, 1 Wheat, 1 Ore)

## Option Analysis

### Option 0: End Turn
If I end my turn, I keep my current resources (2 Wood, 1 Sheep, 1 Wheat, 2 Ore). This doesn't immediately advance me toward victory. I'd be waiting for future dice rolls to get the resources I need, possibly for:
- Building a new settlement (need more brick)
- Buying another development card in a future turn

### Option 1: Buy Development Card
Resources required: 1 Sheep, 1 Wheat, 1 Ore
Resources after purchase: 2 Wood, 0 Sheep, 0 Wheat, 1 Ore

Benefits:
- Could potentially get a Victory Point card, which would win me the game immediately
- Could get a Knight card, which would be my 3rd Knight and give me Largest Army (2 VP), winning the game
- Other cards (Monopoly, Road Building, Year of Plenty) would help get resources needed for my final VP

Risk analysis:
- Development deck has 23 cards remaining
- Typically, a development deck contains 5 VP cards, 14 Knights, 2 Monopoly, 2 Road Building, 2 Year of Plenty
- Probability of getting a VP card: ~22% (assuming standard distribution)
- Probability of getting a Knight: ~61% (assuming standard distribution)
- Combined probability of getting either: ~83%

## Decision Logic

Given that:
1. I'm at 9 VP and need just 1 more to win
2. I have exactly the resources needed for a development card
3. Getting either a VP card or a Knight (for Largest Army) would win me the game
4. The probability of getting one of these is quite high (~83%)
5. My opponent has 10 hidden resources, suggesting they could make a significant move on their turn
6. I don't have the resources to build a settlement this turn (missing brick)

The optimal decision is to buy a development card. This gives me the highest probability of winning the game immediately or on my next turn.

<plan>
Buy a development card now. If it's a VP card, I win immediately. If it's a Knight, I'll play it on my next turn to get Largest Army and win. If it's another type of card (Monopoly, Road Building, Year of Plenty), I'll use it to acquire the resources needed for my final VP through either another development card or a settlement.

# Game State Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state and strategic options:

- I have 9 VP (3 settlements @ 1 VP each, 2 cities @ 2 VP each, and Longest Road @ 2 VP)
- I need just 1 more VP to win
- Resources: 2 Wood, 1 Wheat, 1 Ore
- Development cards: 1 Monopoly card
- 2 Knights played already
- Opponent has 7 VP and the robber is on Brick (6)

## Victory Path Analysis
My current options to get the 10th VP:
1. Buy a development card (1 Sheep, 1 Wheat, 1 Ore) and hope for a Victory Point card
2. Build another settlement (1 Wood, 1 Brick, 1 Sheep, 1 Wheat)
3. Use Monopoly strategically to gather resources for either option 1 or 2

## Resource Analysis
I'm missing:
- For a development card: Sheep (don't have)
- For a settlement: Brick and Sheep (don't have)

## Strategic Monopoly Use
I have Monopoly card which can help me get the resources I need:
- Option 2 (Brick): This might be useful if opponent has brick I need for settlement
- Option 4 (Ore): This could help gather ore for development cards if opponent has some

Given my current hand of 2 Wood, 1 Wheat, 1 Ore, I'm closer to buying a development card (missing just Sheep) than building a settlement (missing Brick and Sheep).

## Optimal Play
I should play Monopoly on Sheep, as this:
1. Directly addresses my most critical resource need
2. May give me enough sheep to buy a development card
3. Even if opponent has no sheep, I haven't lost anything since I need to roll anyway

<plan>
Play Monopoly card to collect all SHEEP from my opponent. If I get at least 1 sheep, I can buy a development card right away with my existing 1 Wheat and 1 Ore. If I get a Victory Point card, I win immediately. If I get a Knight, I play it next turn to get Largest Army (2 VP) and win.
</plan>

Therefore, I should select option 2: Play Monopoly card - Take all SHEEP from other players.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist focused on defeating the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRITICAL FOR SUCCESS):
- Above all else, target the highest probability numbers (6 & 8) - these produce resources 5/36 times each
- Strictly prioritize access to all five resources between your two settlements
- Aim for numerical diversity - try to cover 5-6 different dice numbers across your settlements
- Never place initial settlements without analyzing future expansion opportunities
- Prioritize placement on hexes with complementary resources: ore/wheat and brick/wood
- Position roads toward high-value unoccupied areas the opponent cannot easily block
- Choose second settlement to complement your first settlement's resource weaknesses
- Consider 3:1 ports if you can't access a specific resource through settlements
- Analyze opponent placement to avoid contested expansion paths
- ALWAYS calculate production value using probability dots (5-6-8-9 are top priority numbers)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-10):
- Build at least one new settlement by turn 10 - expansion is your TOP priority
- Calculate and build along the fastest path to your next settlement location
- Secure missing resources through strategic settlement placement
- Build roads that secure critical expansion paths before the opponent blocks them
- Avoid development cards completely until you have at least 3 total settlements
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1) to complete critical builds
- Target resource diversity through your expansion locations
- Create a minimum 2-turn expansion plan and stick to it

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT AND PRODUCTION (CORE STRATEGY):
- Early game: Focus on wood/brick to expand with roads and settlements
- Mid game: Transition to ore/wheat focus for cities and development cards
- Calculate the resource production value of every potential build
- Only make 4:1 trades when they enable an immediate important build
- Cycle through "build phases" - expansion phase, then city upgrade phase
- Plan resource collection 2 turns ahead to minimize wasteful trades
- Never accumulate 7+ cards before dice rolls
- Diversify production to minimize dependency on any single resource
- Target a minimum of 4 total settlements before prioritizing city upgrades

COUNTERING ALPHABETA ALGORITHM:
- AlphaBeta looks ahead only 2 steps, so plan your moves 3-4 steps ahead
- Create deceptive game states that appear less threatening than they are
- Block the opponent's highest-probability expansion paths immediately
- Play defensively during early game, then aggressively in mid-game
- When opponent has 7+ points, disrupt their highest-producing hex with the robber
- Track opponent's resources and block their most likely next build
- Secure resources that the opponent depends on heavily
- Place roads to cut off opponent from accessing high-value settlement locations
- Position settlements to deny opponent access to key resource hex intersections

ROBBER PLACEMENT AND KNIGHT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-producing hex of your opponent
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat in mid-game when cities are being built
- Target the specific resource the opponent needs for their next likely build
- Use knight cards reactively when the robber blocks your best production
- Save knight cards for the late game if pursuing largest army
- When stealing, select resources that complete your immediate build needs
- Keep track of opponent cards and target resources they've been collecting
- Balance robber placement between disruption and resource acquisition

DEVELOPMENT CARDS VS. BUILDING:
- Only buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and cannot build
- Buy development cards when you're 1-2 knights away from largest army
- Use knight cards immediately when advantageous (don't save unless close to largest army)
- Victory point cards should only supplement your main strategy, not replace it
- Road Building cards are most valuable when you're cut off or racing to a key location
- Monopoly is best used after high-probability dice rolls to collect opponent's stockpile
- Year of Plenty is ideal to complete a high-value build (settlement or city)
- NEVER delay settlement/city building to purchase development cards unless 1 VP from winning

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY FOCUS):
- Aim for 5 total settlements (2 upgraded to cities) = 9 VP
- Then secure largest army OR longest road for the final point
- Always calculate the fastest path to 10 VP in terms of resource costs
- For each potential build, calculate how many turns closer it gets you to victory
- Determine which victory paths are still viable based on board state
- Switch strategies when your primary path is blocked
- Plan for the end-game by turn 10 (know exactly how you will reach 10 points)
- Track opponent's path to victory and actively disrupt with roads or robber

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Trade at ports even at 4:1 ratio if it enables immediate critical build
- NEVER trade with opponent unless it enables an immediate settlement/city build
- Avoid trades that allow opponent to build immediately after you
- Calculate the net VP gain of each potential trade
- Use trades to dispose of resources when at risk from robber
- Combine multiple port trades to convert unwanted resources into needed ones
- Be willing to overpay through port trades to secure critical positional advantage

DECISION FRAMEWORK (APPLY TO EVERY TURN):
1. What is my immediate build priority? (settlement > city > longest road/largest army)
2. What resource do I need to complete my highest priority build?
3. What is the fastest way to acquire that resource? (production, trading, development cards)
4. How will this action position me for the next 3 turns?
5. Will this action disrupt my opponent's path to victory?
6. Is there a way to combine multiple actions this turn for greater efficiency?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game State Analysis

Let me carefully analyze the current game state:

- I have 9 victory points:
  - 3 settlements (3 VP)
  - 2 cities (4 VP)
  - Longest road (2 VP)
- I need just 1 more victory point to win
- Resources: 2 Wood, 2 Sheep, 1 Wheat, 1 Ore
- My opponent has 7 VP and is 3 points away from winning

## Evaluating Available Actions

**Option 0: End turn**
- This would waste my current resources
- I would not make any progress toward winning
- My opponent gets a chance to advance their position

**Option 1: Buy a development card (1 Sheep, 1 Wheat, 1 Ore)**
- I have exactly the resources needed (2 Sheep, 1 Wheat, 1 Ore)
- Development card possibilities:
  - Victory Point card (20% chance) → Would give me my 10th VP and immediate win
  - Knight card (60% chance) → Would let me play it next turn to get largest army (2 VP) and win
  - Year of Plenty or Road Building or Monopoly (20% chance) → Would help but not win immediately

## Decision Logic

This is a clear decision. I need 1 more victory point to win, and buying a development card gives me:
- 20% chance of immediate win (if I get a VP card)
- 60% chance of securing a win next turn (if I get a Knight)
- 20% chance of helpful resources/actions but not immediate win

There is absolutely no reason to end my turn when I can pursue this path to victory. The development card purchase aligns perfectly with my current plan.

<plan>Buy a development card with my resources. If I get a Victory Point card, I win immediately. If I get a Knight, I'll play it next turn to get Largest Army (2 VP) and win. Any other card will provide additional strategic options.</plan>

- I need 1 more victory point to win
- I have resources: 1 wood, 1 sheep
- I have 1 unplayed knight card
- I've already played 2 knight cards previously
- My opponent (RED) has 7 victory points
- The robber is on a wood hex that I produce from

## Available Actions
0. Play Knight card - Move the robber and steal a resource
1. Roll the dice

## Strategic Analysis
If I play my Knight card:
- I would have 3 knights total played (2 already played + this one)
- This would give me Largest Army (worth 2 VP)
- I would immediately win the game with 11 points (5 from settlements/cities + 2 from longest road + 2 from largest army + 2 virtual points from my existing knight cards)
- I can also move the robber off my wood hex and potentially steal a useful resource

If I roll the dice:
- I have limited resources (just 1 wood, 1 sheep)
- I can't build anything significant with these
- I would need to hope for good production rolls to get resources for my next move
- There's a risk of rolling a 7 and losing half my cards if I have 7+ cards

<plan>Play my Knight card immediately to claim Largest Army (2 VP) and win the game.</plan>

The optimal play is clearly to use the Knight card. This will:
1. Give me Largest Army bonus (2 VP)
2. Increase my total to 11 VP (exceeding the 10 needed to win)
3. End the game immediately with my victory
4. As a bonus, I can move the robber off my wood hex

Given that this action leads to immediate victory, there's no reason to consider any other option.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist focused on defeating the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRITICAL FOR SUCCESS):
- Above all else, target the highest probability numbers (6 & 8) - these produce resources 5/36 times each
- Strictly prioritize access to all five resources between your two settlements
- Aim for numerical diversity - try to cover 5-6 different dice numbers across your settlements
- Never place initial settlements without analyzing future expansion opportunities
- Prioritize placement on hexes with complementary resources: ore/wheat and brick/wood
- Position roads toward high-value unoccupied areas the opponent cannot easily block
- Choose second settlement to complement your first settlement's resource weaknesses
- Consider 3:1 ports if you can't access a specific resource through settlements
- Analyze opponent placement to avoid contested expansion paths
- ALWAYS calculate production value using probability dots (5-6-8-9 are top priority numbers)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-10):
- Build at least one new settlement by turn 10 - expansion is your TOP priority
- Calculate and build along the fastest path to your next settlement location
- Secure missing resources through strategic settlement placement
- Build roads that secure critical expansion paths before the opponent blocks them
- Avoid development cards completely until you have at least 3 total settlements
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1) to complete critical builds
- Target resource diversity through your expansion locations
- Create a minimum 2-turn expansion plan and stick to it

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT AND PRODUCTION (CORE STRATEGY):
- Early game: Focus on wood/brick to expand with roads and settlements
- Mid game: Transition to ore/wheat focus for cities and development cards
- Calculate the resource production value of every potential build
- Only make 4:1 trades when they enable an immediate important build
- Cycle through "build phases" - expansion phase, then city upgrade phase
- Plan resource collection 2 turns ahead to minimize wasteful trades
- Never accumulate 7+ cards before dice rolls
- Diversify production to minimize dependency on any single resource
- Target a minimum of 4 total settlements before prioritizing city upgrades

COUNTERING ALPHABETA ALGORITHM:
- AlphaBeta looks ahead only 2 steps, so plan your moves 3-4 steps ahead
- Create deceptive game states that appear less threatening than they are
- Block the opponent's highest-probability expansion paths immediately
- Play defensively during early game, then aggressively in mid-game
- When opponent has 7+ points, disrupt their highest-producing hex with the robber
- Track opponent's resources and block their most likely next build
- Secure resources that the opponent depends on heavily
- Place roads to cut off opponent from accessing high-value settlement locations
- Position settlements to deny opponent access to key resource hex intersections

ROBBER PLACEMENT AND KNIGHT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-producing hex of your opponent
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat in mid-game when cities are being built
- Target the specific resource the opponent needs for their next likely build
- Use knight cards reactively when the robber blocks your best production
- Save knight cards for the late game if pursuing largest army
- When stealing, select resources that complete your immediate build needs
- Keep track of opponent cards and target resources they've been collecting
- Balance robber placement between disruption and resource acquisition

DEVELOPMENT CARDS VS. BUILDING:
- Only buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and cannot build
- Buy development cards when you're 1-2 knights away from largest army
- Use knight cards immediately when advantageous (don't save unless close to largest army)
- Victory point cards should only supplement your main strategy, not replace it
- Road Building cards are most valuable when you're cut off or racing to a key location
- Monopoly is best used after high-probability dice rolls to collect opponent's stockpile
- Year of Plenty is ideal to complete a high-value build (settlement or city)
- NEVER delay settlement/city building to purchase development cards unless 1 VP from winning

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY FOCUS):
- Aim for 5 total settlements (2 upgraded to cities) = 9 VP
- Then secure largest army OR longest road for the final point
- Always calculate the fastest path to 10 VP in terms of resource costs
- For each potential build, calculate how many turns closer it gets you to victory
- Determine which victory paths are still viable based on board state
- Switch strategies when your primary path is blocked
- Plan for the end-game by turn 10 (know exactly how you will reach 10 points)
- Track opponent's path to victory and actively disrupt with roads or robber

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Trade at ports even at 4:1 ratio if it enables immediate critical build
- NEVER trade with opponent unless it enables an immediate settlement/city build
- Avoid trades that allow opponent to build immediately after you
- Calculate the net VP gain of each potential trade
- Use trades to dispose of resources when at risk from robber
- Combine multiple port trades to convert unwanted resources into needed ones
- Be willing to overpay through port trades to secure critical positional advantage

DECISION FRAMEWORK (APPLY TO EVERY TURN):
1. What is my immediate build priority? (settlement > city > longest road/largest army)
2. What resource do I need to complete my highest priority build?
3. What is the fastest way to acquire that resource? (production, trading, development cards)
4. How will this action position me for the next 3 turns?
5. Will this action disrupt my opponent's path to victory?
6. Is there a way to combine multiple actions this turn for greater efficiency?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex

- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Initial Settlement Placement Analysis

I need to place my first settlement optimally, focusing on high-probability numbers and resource diversity while considering future expansion paths. Let me analyze my options:

## Resource Distribution & Numbers
- Highest probability numbers (6,8): 🐑6 at (0,0,0) and 🌾8 at (1,-1,0)
- Strong probability numbers (5,9): ⛏️5 at (1,0,-1) and 🌲9 at (0,-1,1)
- Weaker numbers: 🌾3 at (-1,0,1) and 🧱4 at (-1,1,0)
- Desert (no production): (0,1,-1) has the robber

## Opponent's Position
- RED has settlement at node 1, which accesses 🐑6, 🌾8, and ⛏️5
- RED has roads connecting nodes (0,1) and (1,0)

## Prioritizing Intersections
I need to find an intersection that:
1. Covers high-probability numbers
2. Provides diverse resources
3. Has good expansion potential
4. Doesn't compete directly with opponent's expansion

## Node-by-Node Analysis:

Looking at key intersections:
- Node 3: Connects to 🌲9, 🌾3, 🐑6 (three different resources with 9+3+6 numbers)
- Node 4: Connects to 🌾3, 🐑6, 🧱4 (three resources with 3+6+4 numbers)
- Node 9: Connects to 🌲9, 🌾8 (two resources with strong numbers 9+8)
- Node 12: Connects to 🌲9, 🌾3 (two resources but lower production potential)
- Node 16: Connects to 🧱4, 🏜️- (only one resource with low number)
- Node 20: Connects to ⛏️5, 🏜️- (only one resource)

The strongest options appear to be:
- Node 3: Good resource diversity (🌲🌾🐑) with decent numbers (9+3+6)
- Node 9: Strong numbers (9+8) but only two resources (🌲🌾)
- Node 4: Good diversity (🌾🐑🧱) but weaker numbers overall

<plan>
Place initial settlement at node 3 to access three different resources (wood, wheat, sheep) with a good mix of probabilities. This provides resource diversity and gives me options for future expansion while not competing directly with RED's path.
</plan>

Node 3 gives me the best balance of resource diversity (3 types) with reasonable probability numbers, including access to the valuable wood resource for early expansion. It's also positioned away from RED's current position, giving me room to expand.

# Initial Road Placement Analysis

I need to place my first road connected to my initial settlement at node 3. Let me analyze each option carefully to make the best strategic decision for future expansion.

## Option Analysis:

### [0] Build a road at edge (2, 3)
This road would connect toward node 2, which borders:
- 🌲Wood (9) - already accessed by my settlement
- 🌾Wheat (8) - high-value number
- 🐑Sheep (6) - already accessed by my settlement
This direction moves me toward RED's settlement at node 1, potentially creating competition.

### [1] Build a road at edge (3, 4)
This road would lead toward node 4, which borders:
- 🐑Sheep (6) - already accessed by my settlement
- 🌾Wheat (3) - already accessed by my settlement
- 🧱Brick (4) - new resource access
This provides access to brick which I need for future roads and settlements.

### [2] Build a road at edge (3, 12)
This road would connect toward node 12, which borders:
- 🌲Wood (9) - already accessed by my settlement
- 🌾Wheat (3) - already accessed by my settlement
This doesn't provide any new resource access and the numbers are already covered.

## Strategic Considerations:

1. **Resource Diversity**: Option [1] opens up access to brick (4), which I don't yet have.
2. **Expansion Path**: Option [1] moves away from RED's position, reducing competition.
3. **Future Settlement Opportunities**: The path toward node 4 eventually leads to nodes that might access ore, which I'm currently missing.

<plan>
Place initial road at edge (3, 4) to open access to brick resources and create an expansion path away from RED's position. This will help secure brick needed for future roads and settlements while avoiding direct competition. My next goal will be to secure my second initial settlement at a location with access to ore and any other missing resources.
</plan>

The optimal choice is to build my initial road at edge (3, 4), which gives me access to brick resources and creates a promising expansion path.

- Mid game: Transition to ore/wheat focus for cities and development cards
- Calculate the resource production value of every potential build
- Only make 4:1 trades when they enable an immediate important build
- Cycle through "build phases" - expansion phase, then city upgrade phase
- Plan resource collection 2 turns ahead to minimize wasteful trades
- Never accumulate 7+ cards before dice rolls
- Diversify production to minimize dependency on any single resource
- Target a minimum of 4 total settlements before prioritizing city upgrades

COUNTERING ALPHABETA ALGORITHM:
- AlphaBeta looks ahead only 2 steps, so plan your moves 3-4 steps ahead
- Create deceptive game states that appear less threatening than they are
- Block the opponent's highest-probability expansion paths immediately
- Play defensively during early game, then aggressively in mid-game
- When opponent has 7+ points, disrupt their highest-producing hex with the robber
- Track opponent's resources and block their most likely next build
- Secure resources that the opponent depends on heavily
- Place roads to cut off opponent from accessing high-value settlement locations
- Position settlements to deny opponent access to key resource hex intersections

ROBBER PLACEMENT AND KNIGHT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-producing hex of your opponent
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat in mid-game when cities are being built
- Target the specific resource the opponent needs for their next likely build
- Use knight cards reactively when the robber blocks your best production
- Save knight cards for the late game if pursuing largest army
- When stealing, select resources that complete your immediate build needs
- Keep track of opponent cards and target resources they've been collecting
- Balance robber placement between disruption and resource acquisition

DEVELOPMENT CARDS VS. BUILDING:
- Only buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and cannot build
- Buy development cards when you're 1-2 knights away from largest army
- Use knight cards immediately when advantageous (don't save unless close to largest army)
- Victory point cards should only supplement your main strategy, not replace it
- Road Building cards are most valuable when you're cut off or racing to a key location
- Monopoly is best used after high-probability dice rolls to collect opponent's stockpile
- Year of Plenty is ideal to complete a high-value build (settlement or city)
- NEVER delay settlement/city building to purchase development cards unless 1 VP from winning

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY FOCUS):
- Aim for 5 total settlements (2 upgraded to cities) = 9 VP
- Then secure largest army OR longest road for the final point
- Always calculate the fastest path to 10 VP in terms of resource costs
- For each potential build, calculate how many turns closer it gets you to victory
- Determine which victory paths are still viable based on board state
- Switch strategies when your primary path is blocked
- Plan for the end-game by turn 10 (know exactly how you will reach 10 points)
- Track opponent's path to victory and actively disrupt with roads or robber

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Trade at ports even at 4:1 ratio if it enables immediate critical build
- NEVER trade with opponent unless it enables an immediate settlement/city build
- Avoid trades that allow opponent to build immediately after you
- Calculate the net VP gain of each potential trade
- Use trades to dispose of resources when at risk from robber
- Combine multiple port trades to convert unwanted resources into needed ones
- Be willing to overpay through port trades to secure critical positional advantage

DECISION FRAMEWORK (APPLY TO EVERY TURN):
1. What is my immediate build priority? (settlement > city > longest road/largest army)
2. What resource do I need to complete my highest priority build?
3. What is the fastest way to acquire that resource? (production, trading, development cards)
4. How will this action position me for the next 3 turns?
5. Will this action disrupt my opponent's path to victory?
6. Is there a way to combine multiple actions this turn for greater efficiency?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 1 | Player: BLUE | Action: BUILD_INITIAL_SETTLEMENT

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  Place initial road at edge (3, 4) to open access to brick resources and create an expansion path away from RED's position. This will help secure brick needed for future roads and settlements while avoiding direct competition. My next goal will be to secure my second initial settlement at a location with access to ore and any other missing resources.

# Initial Settlement Placement Analysis

I need to analyze the available options for my second initial settlement. This is a critical decision that will greatly impact my entire game strategy.

## Current Status
- My first settlement is at node 3, producing 🐑6 (high probability), 🌲9 (medium-low probability), and 🌾3 (low probability)
- RED has a settlement at node 1, producing 🐑6, 🌾8, and ⛏️5
- I have a road at edge (3, 4)

## Key Considerations
1. I need to complement my first settlement's resources (missing 🧱brick and ⛏️ore)
2. I want to prioritize high probability numbers (6, 8, 5)
3. I need good numerical diversity (avoid overlapping with my existing 3, 6, 9)
4. I should position for future expansion opportunities
5. I should consider ports if accessible

## Node Analysis

Looking at the available nodes:
- Node 15: Connects to 🧱4 (low probability), 🌾3 (low), and seems to be at the junction of 3 hexes
- Node 16: Connected to 🧱4 and the desert hex with robber
- Node 13: Connected to 🌾3 and 🧱4
- Node 17/18: Connected to 🧱4

The brick resource (node 13, 15, 16, 17, 18) is important since I already have wood from my first settlement, allowing me to build roads.

Node 20 appears to be at a junction connecting to ⛏️5, which would give me access to ore that I'm currently missing.

## Decision

Node 20 seems to be the best option as it would:
1. Give me access to ore (⛏️5) which I'm missing
2. Add a good probability number (5 has medium-high probability)
3. Position me away from RED's settlements for future expansion
4. Diversify my resource production

Node 15 would also be a consideration for brick access, but the numbers there appear to be lower probability.

Based on this analysis, I believe node 20 is the optimal choice for my second initial settlement.

<plan>Secure ore resource at node 20, which is a medium-high probability (5). This complements my first settlement's wood and sheep access. Next focus on acquiring brick through trading or strategic road building to enable expansion.</plan>

PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist focused on defeating the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRITICAL FOR SUCCESS):
- Above all else, target the highest probability numbers (6 & 8) - these produce resources 5/36 times each
- Strictly prioritize access to all five resources between your two settlements
- Aim for numerical diversity - try to cover 5-6 different dice numbers across your settlements
- Never place initial settlements without analyzing future expansion opportunities
- Prioritize placement on hexes with complementary resources: ore/wheat and brick/wood
- Position roads toward high-value unoccupied areas the opponent cannot easily block
- Choose second settlement to complement your first settlement's resource weaknesses
- Consider 3:1 ports if you can't access a specific resource through settlements
- Analyze opponent placement to avoid contested expansion paths
- ALWAYS calculate production value using probability dots (5-6-8-9 are top priority numbers)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-10):
- Build at least one new settlement by turn 10 - expansion is your TOP priority
- Calculate and build along the fastest path to your next settlement location

# Game Analysis - Turn 1 Initial Road Placement

Let me analyze the current game state and my options for this initial road placement from my settlement at node 20.

## Current Resources
I have 1 ore and no other resources. I cannot build a road this turn (requires wood and brick). This is just planning where my initial free road will go.

## Settlement Positions
- My settlements: Node 3 (produces sheep 6, wood 9, wheat 3) and Node 20 (produces ore 5)
- Opponent's settlement: Node 1 (produces sheep 6, wheat 8, ore 5)

## Resource Coverage
I currently produce:
- Sheep (6) - good probability
- Wood (9) - medium probability
- Wheat (3) - low probability
- Ore (5) - medium probability
- Missing: Brick

## Road Options
- Option [0]: Road at edge (0, 20)
- Option [1]: Road at edge (19, 20) 
- Option [2]: Road at edge (20, 22)

## Strategic Analysis

Looking at the node grid, I need to establish which direction gives me:
1. Access to brick (missing resource)
2. Best expansion opportunities 
3. Potential to block opponent's expansion

Node 20 is connected to the ore hex. Let me trace where each road option leads:

- Option [0] (0, 20): This connects toward nodes 0, 5 which are near the robber hex (desert) and connecting toward opponent's territory
- Option [1] (19, 20): This leads toward nodes 19, 21 which are on the edge of the board
- Option [2] (20, 22): This leads toward nodes 22, 23 which are still connected to the ore hex

I need to understand which nodes these roads could eventually lead to and what resources they might give me access to.

Without full visibility of where brick hexes are located, my best strategy is to position myself away from the opponent's expansion path and toward potentially unclaimed resources.

Given what I can see, option [2] building toward nodes 22, 23 seems most promising as it:
1. Maintains connection to my current ore production
2. Moves away from the opponent's settlement
3. Opens up potential new expansion paths

<plan>Build initial road toward edge (20, 22) to position for future expansion away from opponent. Next turns will focus on acquiring brick and wood to expand with new settlements, aiming for brick access within the next 2-3 turns.</plan>

DECISION FRAMEWORK (APPLY TO EVERY TURN):
1. What is my immediate build priority? (settlement > city > longest road/largest army)
2. What resource do I need to complete my highest priority build?
3. What is the fastest way to acquire that resource? (production, trading, development cards)
4. How will this action position me for the next 3 turns?
5. Will this action disrupt my opponent's path to victory?
6. Is there a way to combine multiple actions this turn for greater efficiency?

# Game Analysis for Turn 25

I'll start by assessing my current position, resources, and strategic options.

## Current Situation
- I have 2 settlement (2 VP)
- Resources: 4 Wood, 2 Sheep, 3 Ore
- Missing: Brick and Wheat for expansion
- Initial plan: Build roads toward edge (20, 22) for future expansion

## Resource Analysis
- Strong in wood and ore
- Missing brick completely (needed for roads/settlements)
- Missing wheat (needed for settlements/cities/development cards)
- Need to acquire missing resources to advance

## Board Position
- Settlement at node 3: produces sheep, wood, wheat (but wheat hex has robber)
- Settlement at node 20: produces ore
- Need better access to brick and wheat

## Available Actions
My options are:
- [0] End turn (no building possible without brick/wheat)
- [1-4] Trade 4 wood for another resource (wheat, sheep, brick, or ore)

## Strategic Decision
Since I have 4 wood, I can make a maritime trade. The question is which resource to acquire:

1. Wheat: Would allow me to buy a development card with my sheep and ore
2. Sheep: Not needed (already have 2)
3. Brick: Would allow me to build a road to expand
4. Ore: Not needed (already have 3)

Looking at my current needs and plan, brick is most critical for expansion. Without brick, I cannot build roads or settlements, severely limiting my growth potential. According to my plan, I need to focus on acquiring brick for road building.

<plan>Trade wood for brick to enable road building. Next turns will focus on building roads toward areas with brick production to secure this critical resource long-term. Target expansion toward areas with wheat/brick access.</plan>

The optimal action is to trade 4 wood for 1 brick:

\boxed{3}
========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist focused on defeating the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRITICAL FOR SUCCESS):
- Above all else, target the highest probability numbers (6 & 8) - these produce resources 5/36 times each
- Strictly prioritize access to all five resources between your two settlements
- Aim for numerical diversity - try to cover 5-6 different dice numbers across your settlements
- Never place initial settlements without analyzing future expansion opportunities
- Prioritize placement on hexes with complementary resources: ore/wheat and brick/wood
- Position roads toward high-value unoccupied areas the opponent cannot easily block
- Choose second settlement to complement your first settlement's resource weaknesses
- Consider 3:1 ports if you can't access a specific resource through settlements
- Analyze opponent placement to avoid contested expansion paths
- ALWAYS calculate production value using probability dots (5-6-8-9 are top priority numbers)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-10):
- Build at least one new settlement by turn 10 - expansion is your TOP priority
- Calculate and build along the fastest path to your next settlement location
- Secure missing resources through strategic settlement placement
- Build roads that secure critical expansion paths before the opponent blocks them
- Avoid development cards completely until you have at least 3 total settlements
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1) to complete critical builds
- Target resource diversity through your expansion locations
- Create a minimum 2-turn expansion plan and stick to it

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT AND PRODUCTION (CORE STRATEGY):
- Early game: Focus on wood/brick to expand with roads and settlements
- Mid game: Transition to ore/wheat focus for cities and development cards
- Calculate the resource production value of every potential build
- Only make 4:1 trades when they enable an immediate important build
- Cycle through "build phases" - expansion phase, then city upgrade phase
- Plan resource collection 2 turns ahead to minimize wasteful trades
- Never accumulate 7+ cards before dice rolls
- Diversify production to minimize dependency on any single resource
- Target a minimum of 4 total settlements before prioritizing city upgrades

COUNTERING ALPHABETA ALGORITHM:
- AlphaBeta looks ahead only 2 steps, so plan your moves 3-4 steps ahead
- Create deceptive game states that appear less threatening than they are
- Block the opponent's highest-probability expansion paths immediately
- Play defensively during early game, then aggressively in mid-game
- When opponent has 7+ points, disrupt their highest-producing hex with the robber
- Track opponent's resources and block their most likely next build
- Secure resources that the opponent depends on heavily
- Place roads to cut off opponent from accessing high-value settlement locations
- Position settlements to deny opponent access to key resource hex intersections

ROBBER PLACEMENT AND KNIGHT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-producing hex of your opponent
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat in mid-game when cities are being built
- Target the specific resource the opponent needs for their next likely build
- Use knight cards reactively when the robber blocks your best production
- Save knight cards for the late game if pursuing largest army
- When stealing, select resources that complete your immediate build needs
- Keep track of opponent cards and target resources they've been collecting
- Balance robber placement between disruption and resource acquisition

DEVELOPMENT CARDS VS. BUILDING:
- Only buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and cannot build
- Buy development cards when you're 1-2 knights away from largest army
- Use knight cards immediately when advantageous (don't save unless close to largest army)
- Victory point cards should only supplement your main strategy, not replace it
- Road Building cards are most valuable when you're cut off or racing to a key location
- Monopoly is best used after high-probability dice rolls to collect opponent's stockpile
- Year of Plenty is ideal to complete a high-value build (settlement or city)
- NEVER delay settlement/city building to purchase development cards unless 1 VP from winning

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY FOCUS):
- Aim for 5 total settlements (2 upgraded to cities) = 9 VP
- Then secure largest army OR longest road for the final point
- Always calculate the fastest path to 10 VP in terms of resource costs
- For each potential build, calculate how many turns closer it gets you to victory
- Determine which victory paths are still viable based on board state
- Switch strategies when your primary path is blocked
- Plan for the end-game by turn 10 (know exactly how you will reach 10 points)
- Track opponent's path to victory and actively disrupt with roads or robber

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Trade at ports even at 4:1 ratio if it enables immediate critical build
- NEVER trade with opponent unless it enables an immediate settlement/city build
- Avoid trades that allow opponent to build immediately after you
- Calculate the net VP gain of each potential trade
- Use trades to dispose of resources when at risk from robber
- Combine multiple port trades to convert unwanted resources into needed ones
- Be willing to overpay through port trades to secure critical positional advantage

DECISION FRAMEWORK (APPLY TO EVERY TURN):
1. What is my immediate build priority? (settlement > city > longest road/largest army)
2. What resource do I need to complete my highest priority build?
3. What is the fastest way to acquire that resource? (production, trading, development cards)
4. How will this action position me for the next 3 turns?
5. Will this action disrupt my opponent's path to victory?
6. Is there a way to combine multiple actions this turn for greater efficiency?

# Game Analysis for Turn 27

Let me analyze the current game state carefully to make the optimal decision.

## Resource Assessment
I have:
- 1 🌲WOOD
- 1 🧱BRICK
- 2 🐑SHEEP
- 3 ⛏️ORE

This means I can build exactly one road without needing trades.

## Board Position Analysis
My settlements are at:
- Node 3: Producing 🐑6[⭐⭐⭐], 🌲9[⭐⭐], 🌾3[🔍⭐] (note the robber is blocking wheat)
- Node 20: Producing ⛏️5[⭐⭐]

My resource production is heavily weighted toward ore and sheep, but I'm weak on wood, brick, and wheat (especially with wheat currently blocked).

## Road Building Options
Let me examine each available road option strategically:

1. Edge (0, 20): Extends from my settlement at node 20 toward node 0, which connects to sheep and wheat resources.
2. Edge (19, 20): Extends from my settlement at node 20 in another direction.
3. Edge (22, 23): Extends from my road at node 22, moving away from my settlement.
4. Edge (2, 3): Extends from my settlement at node 3 toward node 2, which has wheat and wood.
5. Edge (4, 15): Extends from my road at node 4 toward the brick resource.
6. Edge (4, 5): Extends from my road at node 4 in another direction.
7. Edge (3, 12): Extends from my settlement at node 3 toward a wheat hex.

## Strategic Priorities
1. I need to improve my access to brick and wood for future expansion
2. I need to gain access to wheat which is currently blocked
3. I should aim to create paths toward potential settlement locations

## Decision Analysis
Looking at the options:
- Road 5 (edge 4, 15) appears most valuable as it extends toward the brick hex, which is a resource I critically need.
- Road 7 (edge 3, 12) could give me a path toward a wheat hex, which is also valuable.
- Road 4 (edge 2, 3) heads toward wheat and wood, but may be contested by the red player.

The optimal choice is edge (4, 15) as it:
1. Follows my current plan of targeting brick production
2. Moves me toward a resource I'm currently lacking
3. Creates a path for potential settlement expansion 
4. Is less likely to be contested as it's moving away from red's settlements

<plan>Continue building roads toward brick hex, then aim to build a settlement that provides access to brick and wheat. After securing these resources, focus on city upgrades using my abundant ore.</plan>

# Analyzing Game State and Robber Placement Options

I'll examine my current position and each robber placement option to determine the optimal move.

## Current Analysis:
- I have 2 VP from my 2 settlements at nodes 3 and 20
- My resources: 3 sheep and 1 ore
- RED has 4 hidden cards and has played 1 knight card
- RED has settlements at nodes 1 and 9, both on high-probability hexes (8, 6, 5, 9)
- The robber is currently on (0, 1, -1), which is a desert hex (not blocking anything)

## Robber Placement Options:
Let me analyze each option by the resource blocked and its impact:

[0] (0, 0, 0) - Sheep (6) - Blocks RED's settlement at node 1 and my settlement at node 3
[1] (1, -1, 0) - Wheat (8) - Blocks BOTH of RED's settlements (nodes 1 and 9)
[2] (0, -1, 1) - Wood (9) - Blocks RED's settlement at node 9 and my settlement at node 3
[3] (-1, 0, 1) - Wheat (3) - Blocks my settlement at node 3, but it's a low-probability (3)
[4] (-1, 1, 0) - Brick (4) - Doesn't block any settlements
[5] (1, 0, -1) - Ore (5) - Blocks RED's settlement at node 1 and my settlement at node 20

## Strategic Decision:

Looking at values and production impact:
- Option [1] is clearly optimal - it blocks wheat (8), which:
  - Has high probability (⭐⭐⭐)
  - Affects BOTH of RED's settlements
  - Doesn't block any of my own production
  - Allows me to steal a resource

Option [1] delivers maximum disruption to RED's production without hurting my own resources. Wheat is also a critical resource for both settlements and city upgrades, making it strategic to block.

<plan>Block RED's wheat production and focus on expanding toward the brick hex. Once I secure brick access, I'll use my brick, wood, and sheep to build more settlements to gain access to all resources. Then transition to using my ore advantage for city upgrades.</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist focused on defeating the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRITICAL FOR SUCCESS):
- Above all else, target the highest probability numbers (6 & 8) - these produce resources 5/36 times each
- Strictly prioritize access to all five resources between your two settlements
- Aim for numerical diversity - try to cover 5-6 different dice numbers across your settlements
- Never place initial settlements without analyzing future expansion opportunities
- Prioritize placement on hexes with complementary resources: ore/wheat and brick/wood
- Position roads toward high-value unoccupied areas the opponent cannot easily block
- Choose second settlement to complement your first settlement's resource weaknesses
- Consider 3:1 ports if you can't access a specific resource through settlements
- Analyze opponent placement to avoid contested expansion paths
- ALWAYS calculate production value using probability dots (5-6-8-9 are top priority numbers)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-10):
- Build at least one new settlement by turn 10 - expansion is your TOP priority
- Calculate and build along the fastest path to your next settlement location
- Secure missing resources through strategic settlement placement
- Build roads that secure critical expansion paths before the opponent blocks them
- Avoid development cards completely until you have at least 3 total settlements
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1) to complete critical builds
- Target resource diversity through your expansion locations
- Create a minimum 2-turn expansion plan and stick to it

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT AND PRODUCTION (CORE STRATEGY):
- Early game: Focus on wood/brick to expand with roads and settlements
- Mid game: Transition to ore/wheat focus for cities and development cards
- Calculate the resource production value of every potential build
- Only make 4:1 trades when they enable an immediate important build
- Cycle through "build phases" - expansion phase, then city upgrade phase
- Plan resource collection 2 turns ahead to minimize wasteful trades
- Never accumulate 7+ cards before dice rolls
- Diversify production to minimize dependency on any single resource
- Target a minimum of 4 total settlements before prioritizing city upgrades

COUNTERING ALPHABETA ALGORITHM:
- AlphaBeta looks ahead only 2 steps, so plan your moves 3-4 steps ahead
- Create deceptive game states that appear less threatening than they are
- Block the opponent's highest-probability expansion paths immediately
- Play defensively during early game, then aggressively in mid-game
- When opponent has 7+ points, disrupt their highest-producing hex with the robber
- Track opponent's resources and block their most likely next build
- Secure resources that the opponent depends on heavily
- Place roads to cut off opponent from accessing high-value settlement locations
- Position settlements to deny opponent access to key resource hex intersections

ROBBER PLACEMENT AND KNIGHT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-producing hex of your opponent
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat in mid-game when cities are being built
- Target the specific resource the opponent needs for their next likely build
- Use knight cards reactively when the robber blocks your best production
- Save knight cards for the late game if pursuing largest army
- When stealing, select resources that complete your immediate build needs
- Keep track of opponent cards and target resources they've been collecting
- Balance robber placement between disruption and resource acquisition

DEVELOPMENT CARDS VS. BUILDING:
- Only buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and cannot build
- Buy development cards when you're 1-2 knights away from largest army
- Use knight cards immediately when advantageous (don't save unless close to largest army)
- Victory point cards should only supplement your main strategy, not replace it
- Road Building cards are most valuable when you're cut off or racing to a key location
- Monopoly is best used after high-probability dice rolls to collect opponent's stockpile
- Year of Plenty is ideal to complete a high-value build (settlement or city)
- NEVER delay settlement/city building to purchase development cards unless 1 VP from winning

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY FOCUS):
- Aim for 5 total settlements (2 upgraded to cities) = 9 VP
- Then secure largest army OR longest road for the final point
- Always calculate the fastest path to 10 VP in terms of resource costs
- For each potential build, calculate how many turns closer it gets you to victory
- Determine which victory paths are still viable based on board state
- Switch strategies when your primary path is blocked
- Plan for the end-game by turn 10 (know exactly how you will reach 10 points)
- Track opponent's path to victory and actively disrupt with roads or robber

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Trade at ports even at 4:1 ratio if it enables immediate critical build
- NEVER trade with opponent unless it enables an immediate settlement/city build
- Avoid trades that allow opponent to build immediately after you
- Calculate the net VP gain of each potential trade
- Use trades to dispose of resources when at risk from robber
- Combine multiple port trades to convert unwanted resources into needed ones
- Be willing to overpay through port trades to secure critical positional advantage

DECISION FRAMEWORK (APPLY TO EVERY TURN):
1. What is my immediate build priority? (settlement > city > longest road/largest army)
2. What resource do I need to complete my highest priority build?
3. What is the fastest way to acquire that resource? (production, trading, development cards)
4. How will this action position me for the next 3 turns?
5. Will this action disrupt my opponent's path to victory?
6. Is there a way to combine multiple actions this turn for greater efficiency?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 35 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  Block RED's wheat production and focus on expanding toward the brick hex. Once I secure brick access, I'll use my brick, wood, and sheep to build more settlements to gain access to all resources. Then transition to using my ore advantage for city upgrades.
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.

# Game Analysis for Turn 35

## Current Situation Assessment
- I have 2 VP from my 2 settlements
- Resources: 4 sheep, 1 ore
- Settlements at nodes 3 (sheep6, wood9, wheat3) and 20 (ore5)
- My production is diversified but I'm completely lacking brick access
- RED has settlements at nodes 1 and 9, both producing wheat8 - a high-value resource

## Resource Analysis
- My current production: sheep (good), wood (low), wheat (very low), ore (low), brick (none)
- Missing brick is my biggest weakness
- I have excess sheep (4) that can be traded at 4:1 ratio

## Strategic Options
1. End turn and accumulate more resources
2. Trade 4 sheep for 1 ore (increasing ore to 2)
3. Trade 4 sheep for 1 brick to enable road building
4. Trade 4 sheep for 1 wood to build a road
5. Trade 4 sheep for 1 wheat (not immediately useful)

## Decision Process
Trading 4:1 is inefficient, but in this case it may be necessary to overcome my lack of brick production. Looking at the board, I need to expand toward high-value hexes and secure brick access.

With brick, I could build a road and start expanding toward the brick hex. This aligns with my current plan of accessing brick. However, a single brick without wood doesn't allow me to build a road, and I don't currently have wood.

Ending my turn to collect more resources seems most prudent. The robber is already on wheat8, disrupting RED's production, which benefits me.

<plan>Keep accumulating resources. Next trade 4 sheep for brick when I collect wood, then build roads toward the brick hex (node 4-15-16). Focus on establishing a third settlement at node 16 to gain brick production.</plan>

Without ability to build anything meaningful this turn, conserving resources is the best option.

# Game Analysis for Turn 37

Let me analyze the current game state and available options to determine the optimal move.

## Current Resources
- I have: 4 🐑SHEEP, 2 ⛏️ORE
- No wood, brick, or wheat

## Victory Point Status
- I have 2 VP from my two settlements
- RED also has 2 VP
- No longest road or largest army established yet

## Board Position Analysis
- My settlements are at nodes 3 (produces sheep, wood, wheat) and 20 (produces ore)
- I have roads at (3, 4), (4, 15) and (20, 22)
- My current plan involves building toward node 16 for a brick hex

## Building Costs to Consider
- Road: 1 wood + 1 brick
- Settlement: 1 wood + 1 brick + 1 sheep + 1 wheat
- City: 2 wheat + 3 ore
- Development card: 1 sheep + 1 wheat + 1 ore

## Available Actions Evaluation
1. End Turn: Simply pass with my current resources
2-5. Maritime Trade options to convert sheep to other resources:
   - Trade 4 sheep for 1 ore (I already have 2 ore)
   - Trade 4 sheep for 1 brick (needed for roads)
   - Trade 4 sheep for 1 wood (needed for roads)
   - Trade 4 sheep for 1 wheat (not critical right now)

## Strategic Thinking
My current plan involves accumulating resources to build roads toward node 16 to get access to brick production. To build a road, I need both wood AND brick, but I currently have neither. 

According to my plan, I should "trade 4 sheep for brick when I collect wood." However, I don't have wood yet, so trading for brick now would leave me with just brick but no wood to actually build a road.

Since I can only make one maritime trade this turn and still won't have the complete set of resources needed for any build, the most strategic move is to end my turn and wait to collect more resources.

<plan>Wait to collect wood, then trade sheep for brick to build the next road toward node 16. Continue focusing on establishing a third settlement at node 16 to gain brick production. If I roll a 9, I'll get wood from my settlement at node 3, which would allow me to trade for brick next turn.</plan>

Given this analysis, the optimal action is:

- Never accumulate 7+ cards before dice rolls
- Diversify production to minimize dependency on any single resource
- Target a minimum of 4 total settlements before prioritizing city upgrades

COUNTERING ALPHABETA ALGORITHM:
- AlphaBeta looks ahead only 2 steps, so plan your moves 3-4 steps ahead
- Create deceptive game states that appear less threatening than they are
- Block the opponent's highest-probability expansion paths immediately
- Play defensively during early game, then aggressively in mid-game
- When opponent has 7+ points, disrupt their highest-producing hex with the robber
- Track opponent's resources and block their most likely next build
- Secure resources that the opponent depends on heavily
- Place roads to cut off opponent from accessing high-value settlement locations
- Position settlements to deny opponent access to key resource hex intersections

ROBBER PLACEMENT AND KNIGHT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-producing hex of your opponent
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat in mid-game when cities are being built
- Target the specific resource the opponent needs for their next likely build
- Use knight cards reactively when the robber blocks your best production
- Save knight cards for the late game if pursuing largest army
- When stealing, select resources that complete your immediate build needs
- Keep track of opponent cards and target resources they've been collecting
- Balance robber placement between disruption and resource acquisition

DEVELOPMENT CARDS VS. BUILDING:
- Only buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and cannot build
- Buy development cards when you're 1-2 knights away from largest army
- Use knight cards immediately when advantageous (don't save unless close to largest army)
- Victory point cards should only supplement your main strategy, not replace it
- Road Building cards are most valuable when you're cut off or racing to a key location
- Monopoly is best used after high-probability dice rolls to collect opponent's stockpile
- Year of Plenty is ideal to complete a high-value build (settlement or city)
- NEVER delay settlement/city building to purchase development cards unless 1 VP from winning

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY FOCUS):
- Aim for 5 total settlements (2 upgraded to cities) = 9 VP
- Then secure largest army OR longest road for the final point
- Always calculate the fastest path to 10 VP in terms of resource costs
- For each potential build, calculate how many turns closer it gets you to victory
- Determine which victory paths are still viable based on board state
- Switch strategies when your primary path is blocked
- Plan for the end-game by turn 10 (know exactly how you will reach 10 points)
- Track opponent's path to victory and actively disrupt with roads or robber

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Trade at ports even at 4:1 ratio if it enables immediate critical build
- NEVER trade with opponent unless it enables an immediate settlement/city build
- Avoid trades that allow opponent to build immediately after you
- Calculate the net VP gain of each potential trade
- Use trades to dispose of resources when at risk from robber
- Combine multiple port trades to convert unwanted resources into needed ones
- Be willing to overpay through port trades to secure critical positional advantage

DECISION FRAMEWORK (APPLY TO EVERY TURN):
1. What is my immediate build priority? (settlement > city > longest road/largest army)
2. What resource do I need to complete my highest priority build?
3. What is the fastest way to acquire that resource? (production, trading, development cards)
4. How will this action position me for the next 3 turns?
5. Will this action disrupt my opponent's path to victory?
6. Is there a way to combine multiple actions this turn for greater efficiency?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 39 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  Wait to collect wood, then trade sheep for brick to build the next road toward node 16. Continue focusing on establishing a third settlement at node 16 to gain brick production. If I roll a 9, I'll get wood from my settlement at node 3, which would allow me to trade for brick next turn.

# Game Analysis for Turn 39

I need to analyze my current position and the available actions to make the optimal move.

## Current Situation
- I have 2 victory points (2 settlements)
- Resources: 1 Wood, 4 Sheep, 2 Ore
- No development cards
- Roads built connecting to nodes 4 and 15, which are on the path toward node 16

## Board Position Assessment
- My settlements are at nodes 3 and 20
- Settlement at node 3 produces on rolls of 3, 6, and 9
- Settlement at node 20 produces on roll of 5
- I lack brick production completely
- The robber is on the wheat hex (1, -1, 0) with roll 8

## Strategic Goals Assessment
I need to build my third settlement to increase resource production and victory points. Node 16 is my target as it would give me brick production, which I currently lack.

## Available Actions
0. End turn
1-4. Trade 4 sheep for various resources (ore, brick, wood, wheat)

## Action Analysis

Option 0 (End Turn): 
- I currently have 1 wood, which isn't enough to build a road (costs 1 wood + 1 brick)
- If I end my turn, I'm hoping for favorable dice rolls next turn
- Given my production, a roll of 9 would give me another wood, but I still need brick

Options 1-4 (Trade sheep):
- I have 4 sheep, allowing a single 4:1 port trade
- Option 2 (Trade for brick) would give me 1 brick
- With my 1 wood + 1 brick, I could immediately build a road toward node 16
- This advances my plan to reach node 16 for my next settlement

The most strategic choice is to trade 4 sheep for 1 brick (Option 2) which allows me to build a road immediately, making progress toward my expansion goal.

<plan>Trade 4 sheep for 1 brick to build a road from node 15 to node 16. Continue focusing on establishing a third settlement at node 16 to gain brick production. After building this road, I'll need 1 more wood and 1 more brick for the final road to node 16, then 1 wood, 1 brick, 1 wheat, and 1 sheep for the settlement.</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist focused on defeating the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRITICAL FOR SUCCESS):
- Above all else, target the highest probability numbers (6 & 8) - these produce resources 5/36 times each
- Strictly prioritize access to all five resources between your two settlements
- Aim for numerical diversity - try to cover 5-6 different dice numbers across your settlements
- Never place initial settlements without analyzing future expansion opportunities
- Prioritize placement on hexes with complementary resources: ore/wheat and brick/wood
- Position roads toward high-value unoccupied areas the opponent cannot easily block
- Choose second settlement to complement your first settlement's resource weaknesses
- Consider 3:1 ports if you can't access a specific resource through settlements
- Analyze opponent placement to avoid contested expansion paths
- ALWAYS calculate production value using probability dots (5-6-8-9 are top priority numbers)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-10):
- Build at least one new settlement by turn 10 - expansion is your TOP priority
- Calculate and build along the fastest path to your next settlement location
- Secure missing resources through strategic settlement placement
- Build roads that secure critical expansion paths before the opponent blocks them
- Avoid development cards completely until you have at least 3 total settlements
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1) to complete critical builds
- Target resource diversity through your expansion locations
- Create a minimum 2-turn expansion plan and stick to it

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT AND PRODUCTION (CORE STRATEGY):
- Early game: Focus on wood/brick to expand with roads and settlements
- Mid game: Transition to ore/wheat focus for cities and development cards
- Calculate the resource production value of every potential build
- Only make 4:1 trades when they enable an immediate important build
- Cycle through "build phases" - expansion phase, then city upgrade phase
- Plan resource collection 2 turns ahead to minimize wasteful trades
- Never accumulate 7+ cards before dice rolls

- Then secure largest army OR longest road for the final point
- Always calculate the fastest path to 10 VP in terms of resource costs
- For each potential build, calculate how many turns closer it gets you to victory
- Determine which victory paths are still viable based on board state
- Switch strategies when your primary path is blocked
- Plan for the end-game by turn 10 (know exactly how you will reach 10 points)
- Track opponent's path to victory and actively disrupt with roads or robber

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Trade at ports even at 4:1 ratio if it enables immediate critical build
- NEVER trade with opponent unless it enables an immediate settlement/city build
- Avoid trades that allow opponent to build immediately after you
- Calculate the net VP gain of each potential trade
- Use trades to dispose of resources when at risk from robber
- Combine multiple port trades to convert unwanted resources into needed ones
- Be willing to overpay through port trades to secure critical positional advantage

DECISION FRAMEWORK (APPLY TO EVERY TURN):
1. What is my immediate build priority? (settlement > city > longest road/largest army)
2. What resource do I need to complete my highest priority build?
3. What is the fastest way to acquire that resource? (production, trading, development cards)
4. How will this action position me for the next 3 turns?
5. Will this action disrupt my opponent's path to victory?
6. Is there a way to combine multiple actions this turn for greater efficiency?

❓ Select action by number (0-8):


Based on this information, which action number do you choose? Think step by step about your options, then put the final action number in a box like \boxed{1}.
RESPONSE:
I'll analyze the game state and my available options to determine the optimal move.

## Game State Analysis
- I'm playing BLUE, with 2 victory points (from 2 settlements)
- I have 1 wood, 1 brick, and 2 ore as resources
- I have settlements at nodes 3 (🐑6[⭐⭐⭐], 🌲9[⭐⭐], 🌾3[⭐]) and 20 (⛏️5[⭐⭐])
- I have roads connecting nodes 3-4, 4-15, and 20-22
- My current plan involves building toward node 16 for a third settlement with brick production

## Resource Analysis
- I produce: wood (🌲9), sheep (🐑6), wheat (🌾3), and ore (⛏️5)
- I'm missing consistent brick production, which is essential for expansion
- Hex (-1, 1, 0) has brick with number 4, connecting to nodes 4, 5, 15, 16, 17, 18

## Available Road Options
I can build a road since I have 1 wood and 1 brick. Let me evaluate each option:

1. Edge (0, 20): Doesn't advance toward my goal of node 16
2. Edge (19, 20): Doesn't advance toward my goal
3. Edge (15, 17): Extends from node 15 toward node 17, one step toward hex with brick
4. Edge (22, 23): Extends from my settlement at 20 but doesn't help with brick access
5. Edge (2, 3): Connects back to my settlement at 3, not useful
6. Edge (4, 5): Extends from node 4 toward node 5, which helps toward brick
7. Edge (3, 12): Extends from settlement at 3 but doesn't help with brick access
8. Edge (14, 15): Connects toward node 14, not on my path to node 16

## Strategic Analysis
Looking at the board configuration, I need to decide the best path to expand:

- Option 3 (edge 15-17): This extends from node 15 toward the brick hex, but node 16 seems more optimal than 17 for settlement placement as it would give me access to brick (4) production.
- Option 6 (edge 4-5): This is another path toward the brick hex that could eventually reach node 16.

Let me trace both potential paths to node 16:
- Path via 15: I already have a road at 4-15, so I would need roads at 15-16 for direct access.
- Path via 4-5: I would need 4-5, then 5-16.

I notice that option 3 is for edge (15, 17), not (15, 16) as I might have expected. Looking at the node connections to the brick hex, I see that nodes 15 and 16 must be connected. So edge (15, 16) must not be available as an action, which means the connections are likely:
15 connects to 17, and 17 connects to 16.

<plan>Build road from node 15 to node 17, then from node 17 to node 16 in a future turn. Then build a settlement at node 16 to gain brick production. This requires one more road build after this turn, then resources for a settlement.</plan>

Based on this analysis, my best option is to build a road at edge (15, 17), which advances me toward reaching the brick hex via node 16.

1. What is my immediate build priority? (settlement > city > longest road/largest army)
2. What resource do I need to complete my highest priority build?
3. What is the fastest way to acquire that resource? (production, trading, development cards)
4. How will this action position me for the next 3 turns?
5. Will this action disrupt my opponent's path to victory?
6. Is there a way to combine multiple actions this turn for greater efficiency?

# Game Analysis and Decision-Making

Let me analyze the current game state and available options:

## Current Resources:
- I have 1 Wood, 2 Sheep, and 4 Ore
- No Wheat or Brick in hand

## Current Board Position:
- I have 2 settlements (2 VP)
- My settlements produce: Sheep (6), Wood (9), Wheat (3), and Ore (5)
- Opponent has 3 settlements (3 VP) and has played 1 Knight
- My plan is to build a road to node 17 (already done) and then to node 16, followed by a settlement at node 16

## Available Actions:
- End turn [0]
- Trade 4 Ore for Sheep [1]
- Trade 4 Ore for Brick [2]
- Trade 4 Ore for Wood [3]
- Trade 4 Ore for Wheat [4]

## Strategic Analysis:
According to my current plan, I need to:
1. Build a road from node 17 to node 16 (requires 1 Wood + 1 Brick)
2. Build a settlement at node 16 (requires 1 Wood + 1 Brick + 1 Wheat + 1 Sheep)

I already have 1 Wood but need 1 Brick for my next road build. Since I have 4 Ore and no direct use for it right now, trading for Brick would help me advance my plan.

Looking at action [2], I can trade 4 Ore for 1 Brick, which would give me one of the resources I need for my next road. However, I still need another Wood to complete the road build, which I don't currently have and can't get with my remaining resources this turn.

Given that I can't complete any builds this turn regardless of which trade I make, I should consider whether trading makes strategic sense now or if I should wait until my next turn when I might roll for more needed resources.

Since the robber is currently on my Wheat hex (3), I'm not producing Wheat, making it a priority resource to acquire through trades in the future. However, since I can't complete any builds this turn regardless, I should conserve my Ore for more efficient trades later.

<plan>Wait until next turn to decide on trading. If I roll and get Wood, then I can trade Ore for Brick to complete the road to node 16. If I roll and get Brick, I can save Ore for future builds. Build road from node 17 to node 16 when resources allow, then build a settlement at node 16 to gain brick production.</plan>

Since I can't complete any builds this turn and trading now would be premature, I should end my turn and reassess after my next resource roll.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist focused on defeating the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRITICAL FOR SUCCESS):
- Above all else, target the highest probability numbers (6 & 8) - these produce resources 5/36 times each
- Strictly prioritize access to all five resources between your two settlements
- Aim for numerical diversity - try to cover 5-6 different dice numbers across your settlements
- Never place initial settlements without analyzing future expansion opportunities
- Prioritize placement on hexes with complementary resources: ore/wheat and brick/wood
- Position roads toward high-value unoccupied areas the opponent cannot easily block
- Choose second settlement to complement your first settlement's resource weaknesses
- Consider 3:1 ports if you can't access a specific resource through settlements
- Analyze opponent placement to avoid contested expansion paths
- ALWAYS calculate production value using probability dots (5-6-8-9 are top priority numbers)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-10):
- Build at least one new settlement by turn 10 - expansion is your TOP priority
- Calculate and build along the fastest path to your next settlement location
- Secure missing resources through strategic settlement placement
- Build roads that secure critical expansion paths before the opponent blocks them
- Avoid development cards completely until you have at least 3 total settlements
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1) to complete critical builds
- Target resource diversity through your expansion locations
- Create a minimum 2-turn expansion plan and stick to it

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT AND PRODUCTION (CORE STRATEGY):
- Early game: Focus on wood/brick to expand with roads and settlements
- Mid game: Transition to ore/wheat focus for cities and development cards
- Calculate the resource production value of every potential build
- Only make 4:1 trades when they enable an immediate important build
- Cycle through "build phases" - expansion phase, then city upgrade phase
- Plan resource collection 2 turns ahead to minimize wasteful trades
- Never accumulate 7+ cards before dice rolls
- Diversify production to minimize dependency on any single resource
- Target a minimum of 4 total settlements before prioritizing city upgrades

COUNTERING ALPHABETA ALGORITHM:
- AlphaBeta looks ahead only 2 steps, so plan your moves 3-4 steps ahead
- Create deceptive game states that appear less threatening than they are
- Block the opponent's highest-probability expansion paths immediately
- Play defensively during early game, then aggressively in mid-game
- When opponent has 7+ points, disrupt their highest-producing hex with the robber
- Track opponent's resources and block their most likely next build
- Secure resources that the opponent depends on heavily
- Place roads to cut off opponent from accessing high-value settlement locations
- Position settlements to deny opponent access to key resource hex intersections

ROBBER PLACEMENT AND KNIGHT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-producing hex of your opponent
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat in mid-game when cities are being built
- Target the specific resource the opponent needs for their next likely build
- Use knight cards reactively when the robber blocks your best production
- Save knight cards for the late game if pursuing largest army
- When stealing, select resources that complete your immediate build needs
- Keep track of opponent cards and target resources they've been collecting
- Balance robber placement between disruption and resource acquisition

DEVELOPMENT CARDS VS. BUILDING:
- Only buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and cannot build
- Buy development cards when you're 1-2 knights away from largest army
- Use knight cards immediately when advantageous (don't save unless close to largest army)
- Victory point cards should only supplement your main strategy, not replace it
- Road Building cards are most valuable when you're cut off or racing to a key location
- Monopoly is best used after high-probability dice rolls to collect opponent's stockpile
- Year of Plenty is ideal to complete a high-value build (settlement or city)
- NEVER delay settlement/city building to purchase development cards unless 1 VP from winning

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY FOCUS):
- Aim for 5 total settlements (2 upgraded to cities) = 9 VP
- Then secure largest army OR longest road for the final point
- Always calculate the fastest path to 10 VP in terms of resource costs
- For each potential build, calculate how many turns closer it gets you to victory
- Determine which victory paths are still viable based on board state
- Switch strategies when your primary path is blocked
- Plan for the end-game by turn 10 (know exactly how you will reach 10 points)
- Track opponent's path to victory and actively disrupt with roads or robber

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Trade at ports even at 4:1 ratio if it enables immediate critical build
- NEVER trade with opponent unless it enables an immediate settlement/city build
- Avoid trades that allow opponent to build immediately after you
- Calculate the net VP gain of each potential trade
- Use trades to dispose of resources when at risk from robber
- Combine multiple port trades to convert unwanted resources into needed ones
- Be willing to overpay through port trades to secure critical positional advantage

DECISION FRAMEWORK (APPLY TO EVERY TURN):
1. What is my immediate build priority? (settlement > city > longest road/largest army)
2. What resource do I need to complete my highest priority build?
3. What is the fastest way to acquire that resource? (production, trading, development cards)
4. How will this action position me for the next 3 turns?

# Game State Analysis

Let me carefully analyze the current game state and available actions to determine the optimal move.

## Current Resources
- I have: 2 Wood, 2 Sheep, 4 Ore
- I'm missing: Brick, Wheat

## Current Settlements and Production
- Settlement at node 3: Produces Sheep(6), Wood(9), Wheat(3)
- Settlement at node 20: Produces Ore(5)
- Resource diversity is good but production of Brick is missing entirely

## My Plan Review
My current plan involves building a road to node 16 and then a settlement there to gain brick production. This is a sound goal as I currently lack brick production.

## Available Actions Analysis:
- [0] End turn - This would mean waiting until next roll to take action
- [1-4] Maritime trades to convert Ore into other resources

## Road Building Analysis:
To build a road, I need 1 Wood + 1 Brick
- I have 2 Wood already
- I need 1 Brick which I don't have

## Settlement Building Analysis:
To build a settlement, I need 1 Wood + 1 Brick + 1 Wheat + 1 Sheep
- I already have: 2 Wood, 2 Sheep
- I'm missing: Brick, Wheat

## Strategic Decision Process

1. **Option: End Turn**
   - Pros: Save resources for future turns
   - Cons: Delay progress, risk losing cards to robber (I have 8 cards total)
   
2. **Option: Trade Ore for Brick**
   - Pros: Get Brick needed for road building, can immediately build road toward node 16
   - Cons: 4:1 trade is expensive, using much of my Ore stockpile

Looking at my plan, I want to build a road to node 16, which requires Brick. I currently have no way to produce Brick, so trading is necessary. With 4 Ore, I can trade for 1 Brick which would allow me to build a road immediately (since I already have the Wood).

I need to expand to gain Brick production capabilities, and expanding toward node 16 accomplishes this goal. Without trade, my expansion is stalled.

The optimal move is to trade Ore for Brick to enable immediate road building.

<plan>
Trade Ore for Brick, then build road from node 17 to node 16. Continue focusing on building a settlement at node 16 to gain brick production, then look toward city upgrades.
</plan>

# Game Analysis for Turn 55

I'll analyze the current state of the game and determine the best action to take.

## Current Game State
- I have 2 VP (from 2 settlements)
- I have 2 wood, 1 brick, 2 sheep (5 total resources)
- My settlements are at nodes 3 and 20
- My roads form two separate networks: one around settlement 3 and one around settlement 20
- Opponent has 3 VP from 3 settlements

## Resource Analysis
My current production:
- Node 3: Produces sheep(6), wood(9), wheat(3) - good diversity
- Node 20: Produces ore(5) - limited but important for later city upgrades

## Available Road Building Options
Looking at the road options, I need to determine which road best advances my strategy:

1. Edge (0, 20): Connects towards the desert hex
2. Edge (19, 20): Another connection from node 20
3. Edge (22, 23): Extends from node 22 near my settlement at node 20
4. Edge (2, 3): Extends from my settlement at node 3
5. Edge (4, 5): Connects from node 4 to node 5 where opponent has a settlement
6. Edge (3, 12): Extends from my settlement at node 3 toward wheat(3)
7. Edge (17, 18): Extends from node 17 toward brick(4) hex
8. Edge (14, 15): Connects near the brick(4) hex

## Strategic Evaluation

My previous plan was to "Trade Ore for Brick, then build road from node 17 to node 16." However, none of the available roads connect to node 16, suggesting I need to revise my plan.

Looking closely at the road options, I notice that option 7 (edge 17-18) extends toward the brick hex, which aligns with my goal of gaining better brick production. This road would move me closer to node 16, which is connected to the brick resource.

Option 8 (edge 14-15) also helps me move toward the brick hex from a different direction.

For longest road consideration, extending my current road networks won't immediately give me longest road.

## Settlement Planning
The most strategic move is to extend roads toward valuable unoccupied nodes where I can build settlements. Looking at the available roads:
- Option 7 (17-18) moves me toward node 16, connected to the brick hex
- Option 8 (14-15) also moves me toward the brick hex region

## Decision Making
Since my original plan mentioned building a road from 17 to 16, and option 7 extends from node 17 in that general direction, this aligns best with continuing my strategy of gaining access to brick production.

<plan>
Build road from node 17 to 18, moving closer to accessing the brick hex. Next, continue building roads toward node 16 to establish a settlement with brick production. After securing brick access, focus on city upgrades using ore from my node 20 settlement.
</plan>

Therefore, my optimal action is:

\boxed{7}
========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist focused on defeating the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRITICAL FOR SUCCESS):
- Above all else, target the highest probability numbers (6 & 8) - these produce resources 5/36 times each
- Strictly prioritize access to all five resources between your two settlements
- Aim for numerical diversity - try to cover 5-6 different dice numbers across your settlements
- Never place initial settlements without analyzing future expansion opportunities
- Prioritize placement on hexes with complementary resources: ore/wheat and brick/wood
- Position roads toward high-value unoccupied areas the opponent cannot easily block
- Choose second settlement to complement your first settlement's resource weaknesses
- Consider 3:1 ports if you can't access a specific resource through settlements
- Analyze opponent placement to avoid contested expansion paths
- ALWAYS calculate production value using probability dots (5-6-8-9 are top priority numbers)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-10):
- Build at least one new settlement by turn 10 - expansion is your TOP priority
- Calculate and build along the fastest path to your next settlement location
- Secure missing resources through strategic settlement placement
- Build roads that secure critical expansion paths before the opponent blocks them
- Avoid development cards completely until you have at least 3 total settlements
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1) to complete critical builds
- Target resource diversity through your expansion locations
- Create a minimum 2-turn expansion plan and stick to it

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT AND PRODUCTION (CORE STRATEGY):
- Early game: Focus on wood/brick to expand with roads and settlements
- Mid game: Transition to ore/wheat focus for cities and development cards
- Calculate the resource production value of every potential build
- Only make 4:1 trades when they enable an immediate important build
- Cycle through "build phases" - expansion phase, then city upgrade phase
- Plan resource collection 2 turns ahead to minimize wasteful trades
- Never accumulate 7+ cards before dice rolls
- Diversify production to minimize dependency on any single resource
- Target a minimum of 4 total settlements before prioritizing city upgrades

COUNTERING ALPHABETA ALGORITHM:
- AlphaBeta looks ahead only 2 steps, so plan your moves 3-4 steps ahead
- Create deceptive game states that appear less threatening than they are
- Block the opponent's highest-probability expansion paths immediately
- Play defensively during early game, then aggressively in mid-game
- When opponent has 7+ points, disrupt their highest-producing hex with the robber
- Track opponent's resources and block their most likely next build
- Secure resources that the opponent depends on heavily
- Place roads to cut off opponent from accessing high-value settlement locations
- Position settlements to deny opponent access to key resource hex intersections

ROBBER PLACEMENT AND KNIGHT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-producing hex of your opponent
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat in mid-game when cities are being built
- Target the specific resource the opponent needs for their next likely build
- Use knight cards reactively when the robber blocks your best production
- Save knight cards for the late game if pursuing largest army
- When stealing, select resources that complete your immediate build needs
- Keep track of opponent cards and target resources they've been collecting
- Balance robber placement between disruption and resource acquisition

DEVELOPMENT CARDS VS. BUILDING:
- Only buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and cannot build
- Buy development cards when you're 1-2 knights away from largest army
- Use knight cards immediately when advantageous (don't save unless close to largest army)
- Victory point cards should only supplement your main strategy, not replace it
- Road Building cards are most valuable when you're cut off or racing to a key location
- Monopoly is best used after high-probability dice rolls to collect opponent's stockpile
- Year of Plenty is ideal to complete a high-value build (settlement or city)
- NEVER delay settlement/city building to purchase development cards unless 1 VP from winning

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY FOCUS):
- Aim for 5 total settlements (2 upgraded to cities) = 9 VP
- Then secure largest army OR longest road for the final point
- Always calculate the fastest path to 10 VP in terms of resource costs
- For each potential build, calculate how many turns closer it gets you to victory
- Determine which victory paths are still viable based on board state
- Switch strategies when your primary path is blocked
- Plan for the end-game by turn 10 (know exactly how you will reach 10 points)
- Track opponent's path to victory and actively disrupt with roads or robber

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Trade at ports even at 4:1 ratio if it enables immediate critical build
- NEVER trade with opponent unless it enables an immediate settlement/city build
- Avoid trades that allow opponent to build immediately after you
- Calculate the net VP gain of each potential trade
- Use trades to dispose of resources when at risk from robber
- Combine multiple port trades to convert unwanted resources into needed ones
- Be willing to overpay through port trades to secure critical positional advantage

DECISION FRAMEWORK (APPLY TO EVERY TURN):
1. What is my immediate build priority? (settlement > city > longest road/largest army)
2. What resource do I need to complete my highest priority build?
3. What is the fastest way to acquire that resource? (production, trading, development cards)
4. How will this action position me for the next 3 turns?
5. Will this action disrupt my opponent's path to victory?
6. Is there a way to combine multiple actions this turn for greater efficiency?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 59 | Player: BLUE | Action: MOVE_ROBBER

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  Build road from node 17 to 18, moving closer to accessing the brick hex. Next, continue building roads toward node 16 to establish a settlement with brick production. After securing brick access, focus on city upgrades using ore from my node 20 settlement.

# Game Analysis for Robber Placement

I need to analyze where to place the robber to maximize my chances of winning by disrupting my opponent's production while potentially gaining useful resources.

## Current Game State Assessment
- I have 2 VP (2 settlements)
- RED has 4 VP (1 city, 2 settlements)
- I have 2 wood and 3 sheep resources
- RED is ahead by 2 VP, so I need to disrupt their strategy

## Robber Placement Options Analysis

Let's analyze each option:

**[0] Move robber to (0, 0, 0) and steal from RED**
- This is a sheep hex with value 6 (highest probability)
- RED has a city at node 1 and a settlement at node 5 connected to this hex
- This would block RED's best production (6 is the highest probability)

**[1] Move robber to (1, -1, 0) and steal from RED**
- This is a wheat hex with value 8 (second highest probability)
- RED has a city at node 1 and a settlement at node 9 connected to this hex
- This would block an extremely valuable resource for city building

**[2] Move robber to (0, -1, 1) and steal from RED**
- This is a wood hex with value 9 (medium probability)
- RED has a settlement at node 9 connected to this hex
- This would block wood production for RED

**[3] Move robber to (-1, 1, 0) and steal from RED**
- This is a brick hex with value 4 (lower probability)
- RED has a settlement at node 5 connected to this hex
- This would block brick production for RED

**[4] Move robber to (0, 1, -1) and steal from RED**
- This is a desert hex
- No production to block

**[5] Move robber to (1, 0, -1) and steal from RED**
- This is an ore hex with value 5 (medium probability)
- RED has a city at node 1 connected to this hex
- This would block ore production which is crucial for city upgrades

## Strategic Decision

Looking at RED's settlements and cities:
- Their city at node 1 produces sheep(6), wheat(8), and ore(5)
- This is an extremely strong production node for city building

For my optimal strategy:
1. I should block RED's highest value production
2. Target resources that enable city building (ore and wheat)
3. Consider what resource I might steal that would help me most

Since RED has a city at node 1 connected to both the wheat(8) and sheep(6) hexes, these are high-value targets. However, the wheat hex is particularly important since:
- It's required for both settlements and cities
- It has a high probability (8)
- RED has TWO settlements connected to this hex (city at node 1 and settlement at node 9)

<plan>I'll block RED's wheat production to slow down their city and settlement building. After this, I'll continue with my plan to build toward the brick hex to secure all resources. Given RED's strong position, disrupting their wheat will be most effective.</plan>

Therefore, my optimal choice is:

# Game State Analysis

Let me analyze the current state thoroughly to determine the best move:

## My Current Position
- 2 Victory Points (from 2 settlements)
- Resources: 2 wood, 4 sheep
- 5 roads built (longest: 4)
- No development cards

## Opponent's Position
- 4 Victory Points (from 2 settlements, 1 city)
- Unknown resources (1 card)
- Has played 1 knight card
- Robber is currently on their high-producing wheat hex (8)

## Resource Production
- I produce sheep (6), wood (9), wheat (3), and ore (5)
- I'm missing brick production
- My production is somewhat balanced but weaker than opponent's

## Available Actions
- End turn
- Trade 4 sheep for 1 ore, brick, wood, or wheat

## Strategic Considerations

Looking at my resources, I have 2 wood and 4 sheep. This isn't enough for any major build:
- Settlement (1 wood, 1 brick, 1 sheep, 1 wheat) - missing brick and wheat
- Road (1 wood, 1 brick) - missing brick
- Development card (1 ore, 1 sheep, 1 wheat) - missing ore and wheat

Since I can't build anything immediately, my focus should be on preparing for my next turn by converting excess sheep into a critical resource I need. 

The most efficient path to victory requires expanding with settlements, which need brick. I currently lack brick production entirely, making it my highest priority resource.

<plan>
Trade sheep for brick to enable road building next turn. Continue expanding toward valuable nodes to establish a third settlement. Target a brick-producing hex for my next settlement to complete my resource diversity.
</plan>

Since I have 4 sheep and can make a 4:1 port trade, I should convert them to my most needed resource. Brick is critical as I have no brick production and need it for both roads and settlements. Trading for brick now will position me to build a road on my next turn when I hopefully get wood production.

Therefore, I should choose action [2] to trade 4 sheep for 1 brick.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist focused on defeating the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRITICAL FOR SUCCESS):
- Above all else, target the highest probability numbers (6 & 8) - these produce resources 5/36 times each
- Strictly prioritize access to all five resources between your two settlements
- Aim for numerical diversity - try to cover 5-6 different dice numbers across your settlements
- Never place initial settlements without analyzing future expansion opportunities
- Prioritize placement on hexes with complementary resources: ore/wheat and brick/wood
- Position roads toward high-value unoccupied areas the opponent cannot easily block
- Choose second settlement to complement your first settlement's resource weaknesses
- Consider 3:1 ports if you can't access a specific resource through settlements
- Analyze opponent placement to avoid contested expansion paths
- ALWAYS calculate production value using probability dots (5-6-8-9 are top priority numbers)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-10):
- Build at least one new settlement by turn 10 - expansion is your TOP priority
- Calculate and build along the fastest path to your next settlement location
- Secure missing resources through strategic settlement placement
- Build roads that secure critical expansion paths before the opponent blocks them
- Avoid development cards completely until you have at least 3 total settlements
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1) to complete critical builds
- Target resource diversity through your expansion locations
- Create a minimum 2-turn expansion plan and stick to it

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT AND PRODUCTION (CORE STRATEGY):
- Early game: Focus on wood/brick to expand with roads and settlements
- Mid game: Transition to ore/wheat focus for cities and development cards
- Calculate the resource production value of every potential build
- Only make 4:1 trades when they enable an immediate important build
- Cycle through "build phases" - expansion phase, then city upgrade phase
- Plan resource collection 2 turns ahead to minimize wasteful trades
- Never accumulate 7+ cards before dice rolls
- Diversify production to minimize dependency on any single resource
- Target a minimum of 4 total settlements before prioritizing city upgrades

COUNTERING ALPHABETA ALGORITHM:
- AlphaBeta looks ahead only 2 steps, so plan your moves 3-4 steps ahead
- Create deceptive game states that appear less threatening than they are
- Block the opponent's highest-probability expansion paths immediately
- Play defensively during early game, then aggressively in mid-game
- When opponent has 7+ points, disrupt their highest-producing hex with the robber
- Track opponent's resources and block their most likely next build
- Secure resources that the opponent depends on heavily
- Place roads to cut off opponent from accessing high-value settlement locations
- Position settlements to deny opponent access to key resource hex intersections

ROBBER PLACEMENT AND KNIGHT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-producing hex of your opponent
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat in mid-game when cities are being built
- Target the specific resource the opponent needs for their next likely build
- Use knight cards reactively when the robber blocks your best production
- Save knight cards for the late game if pursuing largest army
- When stealing, select resources that complete your immediate build needs
- Keep track of opponent cards and target resources they've been collecting
- Balance robber placement between disruption and resource acquisition

DEVELOPMENT CARDS VS. BUILDING:
- Only buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and cannot build
- Buy development cards when you're 1-2 knights away from largest army
- Use knight cards immediately when advantageous (don't save unless close to largest army)
- Victory point cards should only supplement your main strategy, not replace it
- Road Building cards are most valuable when you're cut off or racing to a key location
- Monopoly is best used after high-probability dice rolls to collect opponent's stockpile
- Year of Plenty is ideal to complete a high-value build (settlement or city)
- NEVER delay settlement/city building to purchase development cards unless 1 VP from winning

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY FOCUS):
- Aim for 5 total settlements (2 upgraded to cities) = 9 VP
- Then secure largest army OR longest road for the final point
- Always calculate the fastest path to 10 VP in terms of resource costs
- For each potential build, calculate how many turns closer it gets you to victory
- Determine which victory paths are still viable based on board state
- Switch strategies when your primary path is blocked
- Plan for the end-game by turn 10 (know exactly how you will reach 10 points)
- Track opponent's path to victory and actively disrupt with roads or robber

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Trade at ports even at 4:1 ratio if it enables immediate critical build
- NEVER trade with opponent unless it enables an immediate settlement/city build
- Avoid trades that allow opponent to build immediately after you
- Calculate the net VP gain of each potential trade
- Use trades to dispose of resources when at risk from robber
- Combine multiple port trades to convert unwanted resources into needed ones
- Be willing to overpay through port trades to secure critical positional advantage

DECISION FRAMEWORK (APPLY TO EVERY TURN):
1. What is my immediate build priority? (settlement > city > longest road/largest army)
2. What resource do I need to complete my highest priority build?
3. What is the fastest way to acquire that resource? (production, trading, development cards)
4. How will this action position me for the next 3 turns?
5. Will this action disrupt my opponent's path to victory?
6. Is there a way to combine multiple actions this turn for greater efficiency?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game State Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state and my options carefully:

1) **Victory Point Situation**:
   - I have 2 VPs (2 settlements)
   - Opponent has 4 VPs (2 settlements + 1 city)
   - I'm behind but still early enough to recover

2) **My Resources**:
   - 2 Wood
   - 1 Brick
   - This is just enough for one road build

3) **Production Analysis**:
   - My settlements produce from:
     - Node 3: 🐑6 (good value), 🌲9 (medium value), 🌾3 (poor value)
     - Node 20: ⛏️5 (good value)
   - I'm missing dedicated brick production
   - My wheat is limited to low-probability 3

4) **Available Actions**:
   - I can build a road in several locations
   - I can end my turn

## Strategic Evaluation of Road Options

I need to determine which road brings me closest to establishing a new settlement that will maximize my resource diversity and production. Let me evaluate each road option:

- Option 1: Road at edge (0, 20)
  - Extends from my settlement at node 20
  - Moves toward unexplored territory, but limited information available

- Option 3: Road at edge (22, 23)
  - Also extends from my settlement at node 20
  - Direction unknown without full map information

- Option 7: Road at edge (3, 12)
  - Extends from my settlement at node 3
  - Could potentially lead toward more resource diversity

Since I currently lack information about what resources are around nodes 0, 22, 23, and 12, I need to make an educated decision based on my current needs:

1. I need to improve my brick production
2. I need better wheat production than just the 3 value hex
3. I should build toward potential settlement locations that won't be easily blocked

Based on the limited information provided, extending from node 3 via option 7 (edge 3, 12) seems most promising as it could potentially lead toward additional resources while leveraging my current settlement position.

<plan>Build road at edge (3, 12) to expand from my settlement at node 3. Continue expanding toward resource-diverse areas, prioritizing finding a brick production hex and better wheat production. After establishing roads, build a settlement at a strategic location with complementary resources to my current production.</plan>

# Analyzing the Robber Placement Options

Let me think step by step about the optimal robber placement to maximize my chances of winning this game against the AlphaBeta algorithm.

## Game State Analysis
- I have 4 VP (2 settlements + longest road bonus)
- RED also has 4 VP (2 settlements + 1 city)
- RED has 5 hidden resource cards
- I have limited resources: just 1 wood and 1 ore

## Robber Placement Strategy
I need to place the robber to:
1. Block RED's most productive hex
2. Disrupt their likely building plans
3. Potentially steal a resource I need

Let's analyze the opponent's production hubs:

### RED's Settlements/Cities:
- City at node 1: produces sheep(6), wheat(8), ore(5)
- Settlement at node 9: produces wheat(8), wood(9)
- Settlement at node 5: produces sheep(6), brick(4)

## Evaluating Each Robber Option:
[0] Move to (0, 0, 0) - Sheep hex (6)
   - This blocks a 6 (high probability) sheep hex
   - Affects RED's city at node 1 and settlement at node 5
   - But also blocks my own settlement at node 3
   - NOT optimal as it hurts my production too

[1] Move to (1, -1, 0) - Wheat hex (8)
   - This blocks an 8 (highest probability) wheat hex
   - Disrupts RED's city at node 1 and settlement at node 9
   - This is a strong option as it blocks RED's best production hex

[2] Move to (0, -1, 1) - Wood hex (9)
   - This blocks a 9 (good probability) wood hex
   - Affects RED's settlement at node 9
   - But also blocks my own settlement at node 3
   - NOT optimal as it hurts my production too

[3] Move to (-1, 1, 0) - Brick hex (4)
   - This blocks a 4 (low probability) brick hex
   - Only affects RED's settlement at node 5
   - Low impact choice

[4] Move to (0, 1, -1) - Desert hex (-)
   - This blocks a desert hex which produces nothing
   - Completely wasted robber placement - NO impact

[5] Move to (1, 0, -1) - Ore hex (5)
   - This blocks a 5 (medium probability) ore hex
   - Affects RED's city at node 1
   - But also blocks my own settlement at node 20
   - NOT optimal as it hurts my production too

## Decision Framework Application
1. My immediate build priority is expanding with settlements
2. I need brick (which I don't have) for roads and settlements
3. Blocking RED's wheat(8) production is most impactful without hurting myself
4. This positions me well for the next turns as it slows RED's development
5. This directly disrupts RED's path to victory by limiting their access to wheat
6. I can steal a resource and hopefully get brick or wheat which I need

<plan>
Continue with expansion through road building toward areas with brick production. Block RED's wheat production to slow their development while I build roads to secure a location for my next settlement. Target establishing a settlement at a location that gives me access to brick and better wheat production.
</plan>

Option [1] is clearly the best choice as it:
- Blocks RED's highest probability production (wheat 8)
- Affects two of their buildings without harming mine
- Gives me a chance to steal a needed resource
- Aligns with my strategy to slow RED while I expand

- Mid game: Transition to ore/wheat focus for cities and development cards
- Calculate the resource production value of every potential build
- Only make 4:1 trades when they enable an immediate important build
- Cycle through "build phases" - expansion phase, then city upgrade phase
- Plan resource collection 2 turns ahead to minimize wasteful trades
- Never accumulate 7+ cards before dice rolls
- Diversify production to minimize dependency on any single resource
- Target a minimum of 4 total settlements before prioritizing city upgrades

COUNTERING ALPHABETA ALGORITHM:
- AlphaBeta looks ahead only 2 steps, so plan your moves 3-4 steps ahead
- Create deceptive game states that appear less threatening than they are
- Block the opponent's highest-probability expansion paths immediately
- Play defensively during early game, then aggressively in mid-game
- When opponent has 7+ points, disrupt their highest-producing hex with the robber
- Track opponent's resources and block their most likely next build
- Secure resources that the opponent depends on heavily
- Place roads to cut off opponent from accessing high-value settlement locations
- Position settlements to deny opponent access to key resource hex intersections

ROBBER PLACEMENT AND KNIGHT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-producing hex of your opponent
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat in mid-game when cities are being built
- Target the specific resource the opponent needs for their next likely build
- Use knight cards reactively when the robber blocks your best production
- Save knight cards for the late game if pursuing largest army
- When stealing, select resources that complete your immediate build needs
- Keep track of opponent cards and target resources they've been collecting
- Balance robber placement between disruption and resource acquisition

DEVELOPMENT CARDS VS. BUILDING:
- Only buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and cannot build
- Buy development cards when you're 1-2 knights away from largest army
- Use knight cards immediately when advantageous (don't save unless close to largest army)
- Victory point cards should only supplement your main strategy, not replace it
- Road Building cards are most valuable when you're cut off or racing to a key location
- Monopoly is best used after high-probability dice rolls to collect opponent's stockpile
- Year of Plenty is ideal to complete a high-value build (settlement or city)
- NEVER delay settlement/city building to purchase development cards unless 1 VP from winning

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY FOCUS):
- Aim for 5 total settlements (2 upgraded to cities) = 9 VP
- Then secure largest army OR longest road for the final point
- Always calculate the fastest path to 10 VP in terms of resource costs
- For each potential build, calculate how many turns closer it gets you to victory
- Determine which victory paths are still viable based on board state
- Switch strategies when your primary path is blocked
- Plan for the end-game by turn 10 (know exactly how you will reach 10 points)
- Track opponent's path to victory and actively disrupt with roads or robber

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Trade at ports even at 4:1 ratio if it enables immediate critical build
- NEVER trade with opponent unless it enables an immediate settlement/city build
- Avoid trades that allow opponent to build immediately after you
- Calculate the net VP gain of each potential trade
- Use trades to dispose of resources when at risk from robber
- Combine multiple port trades to convert unwanted resources into needed ones
- Be willing to overpay through port trades to secure critical positional advantage

DECISION FRAMEWORK (APPLY TO EVERY TURN):
1. What is my immediate build priority? (settlement > city > longest road/largest army)
2. What resource do I need to complete my highest priority build?
3. What is the fastest way to acquire that resource? (production, trading, development cards)
4. How will this action position me for the next 3 turns?
5. Will this action disrupt my opponent's path to victory?
6. Is there a way to combine multiple actions this turn for greater efficiency?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 83 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  Continue with expansion through road building toward areas with brick production. Block RED's wheat production to slow their development while I build roads to secure a location for my next settlement. Target establishing a settlement at a location that gives me access to brick and better wheat production.
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.

# Game Analysis

Let me carefully analyze the current game state and my options:

## Current Game State
- I (BLUE) have 4 VP total (2 from settlements + 2 from longest road)
- RED has 6 VP (2 from settlements + 4 from cities)
- Resources: 1 wood, 4 sheep, 1 ore
- I need to continue expanding to catch up with RED who is ahead

## Available Actions
- [0] End turn
- [1-4] Maritime trade options to convert 4 sheep into another resource

## Resource Analysis
- I have no wheat or brick currently
- For expansion (settlements), I need brick and wood
- For development cards, I need ore, wheat, and sheep
- For cities, I need ore and wheat

## Strategic Considerations
1. RED is 2 points ahead and has better resource production (especially wheat)
2. I need to expand with more settlements to improve my resource generation
3. Building roads and settlements requires wood and brick
4. I currently have the longest road (5 segments) which gives me +2 VP
5. I should maintain and extend this advantage

## Decision Process

Looking at my current resources (1 wood, 4 sheep, 1 ore), I cannot build any settlements (need wood + brick) or cities (need ore + wheat) immediately.

To continue my expansion plan, I need brick the most since I already have 1 wood. Trading 4 sheep for 1 brick would allow me to build a road this turn, extending toward a potential settlement location and strengthening my longest road advantage.

The other trade options are less valuable right now:
- Getting ore: I already have 1, but need wheat for either development cards or cities
- Getting wood: I already have 1, so getting brick is more valuable for road building
- Getting wheat: Would need more wheat and ore for a city, or wheat plus other resources for a development card

<plan>Trade sheep for brick to continue road building. Maintain and extend longest road while working toward a new settlement location that provides better resource diversity. Keep monitoring RED's progress and focus on securing brick and wheat production in future settlements.</plan>

Since my priority is expansion through road building, and I need brick to do this, I should trade 4 sheep for 1 brick.

PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist focused on defeating the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points

5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRITICAL FOR SUCCESS):
- Above all else, target the highest probability numbers (6 & 8) - these produce resources 5/36 times each
- Strictly prioritize access to all five resources between your two settlements
- Aim for numerical diversity - try to cover 5-6 different dice numbers across your settlements
- Never place initial settlements without analyzing future expansion opportunities
- Prioritize placement on hexes with complementary resources: ore/wheat and brick/wood
- Position roads toward high-value unoccupied areas the opponent cannot easily block
- Choose second settlement to complement your first settlement's resource weaknesses
- Consider 3:1 ports if you can't access a specific resource through settlements
- Analyze opponent placement to avoid contested expansion paths
- ALWAYS calculate production value using probability dots (5-6-8-9 are top priority numbers)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-10):
- Build at least one new settlement by turn 10 - expansion is your TOP priority
- Calculate and build along the fastest path to your next settlement location
- Secure missing resources through strategic settlement placement
- Build roads that secure critical expansion paths before the opponent blocks them
- Avoid development cards completely until you have at least 3 total settlements
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1) to complete critical builds

# Game Analysis for Settlers of Catan Turn 83

I'll analyze my current position and available actions to determine the optimal move.

## Current Game State Assessment:
- I have 4 VP (2 settlements + longest road bonus)
- RED has 6 VP (2 settlements + 2 cities)
- I have 1 wood, 1 brick, 1 ore
- I control longest road (5 segments vs RED's 4)
- The robber is on a forest hex (9)

## Resource Analysis:
- I can build exactly one road with my current resources (1 wood, 1 brick)
- I need more resources to build settlements/cities
- I'm producing from limited hexes (6, 9, 3, 5)

## Strategic Options:
1. Build a road to:
   - Extend my longest road lead
   - Move toward potential settlement locations
   - Block RED's expansion

Let me analyze each potential road location:

- [1] Edge (0, 20): Expands toward unclaimed areas, extends longest road
- [2] Edge (19, 20): Similar to [1], different direction
- [3] Edge (12, 13): Extends from my settlement at node 3
- [4] Edge (22, 23): Builds next to RED's settlement, less strategic
- [5] Edge (2, 3): Redundant, connects to my settlement at node 3
- [6] Edge (11, 12): Extends from my settlement, potential expansion
- [7] Edge (4, 5): Builds near RED's city, less strategic
- [8] Edge (16, 18): Extends in a direction with limited immediate value
- [9] Edge (14, 15): Potentially useful for expansion

The most strategic roads appear to be the ones that:
- Extend my longest road advantage (critical for maintaining 2 VP)
- Enable future settlement placement in resource-diverse locations

Looking at the board connectivity, option [3] (edge 12, 13) seems most promising as it:
- Extends from my settlement at node 3
- Moves toward unexplored territory
- Positions me for future settlement placement
- Secures my longest road advantage

<plan>
Continue road building toward unclaimed areas to maintain longest road advantage. Focus next on acquiring resources for a new settlement that provides brick and wheat production. Protect against RED's expansion by strategically placing roads to block their potential settlement locations.
</plan>

Given my analysis, I'll build a road at edge (12, 13) to extend from my settlement at node 3, which maintains my longest road advantage while positioning for future expansion.

# Initial Settlement Placement Analysis

I'm placing my first settlement, which is a critical decision that will impact the entire game. Let me analyze the available nodes thoroughly.

## Resource Analysis
Looking at the game board:
- 🧱 Brick: hex (0,-1,1) with number 5 (4 dots, medium-good probability)
- ⛏️ Ore: hex (1,-1,0) with number 10 (2 dots, low probability)
- 🐑 Sheep: hex (0,0,0) with number 9 (4 dots, medium-good probability)
- 🌲 Wood: hex (1,0,-1) with number 8 (5 dots, excellent probability)
- 🌾 Wheat: two hexes - (-1,1,0) with number 6 (5 dots, excellent probability) and (0,1,-1) with number 4 (3 dots, medium-low probability)
- 🏜️ Desert: hex (-1,0,1) with robber currently on it

## Node Production Value Analysis
Let me evaluate the strategic nodes based on resource production probability dots:

- Node 3: Connects to Brick 5 (4 dots), Sheep 9 (4 dots), Desert (-) = 8 dots on active resources
- Node 4: Connects to Desert (-), Sheep 9 (4 dots), Wheat 6 (5 dots) = 9 dots on active resources
- Node 5: Connects to Sheep 9 (4 dots), Wheat 6 (5 dots), Wheat 4 (3 dots) = 12 dots on active resources
- Node 12: Connects to Brick 5 (4 dots), Desert (-), Desert (-) = 4 dots on active resources
- Node 15: Connects to Desert (-), Wheat 6 (5 dots), Desert (-) = 5 dots on active resources
- Node 16: Connects to Wheat 6 (5 dots), Wheat 4 (3 dots), Desert (-) = 8 dots on active resources
- Node 20: Connects to Wood 8 (5 dots), Wheat 4 (3 dots), Desert (-) = 8 dots on active resources

## Strategic Considerations
1. Node 5 has the highest productivity (12 dots) with Wheat 6, Wheat 4, and Sheep 9
2. Need to ensure access to diverse resources (especially wood and brick for early expansion)
3. Need to consider RED's placement at node 1 (already has access to Sheep 9, Ore 10, Wood 8)
4. Need to position for future road expansion opportunities
5. RED has roads connecting nodes 1→2 and 2→1, suggesting they may expand toward nodes 3 or 9

## Decision Analysis
- Node 5 has highest productivity with wheat and sheep, but lacks wood and brick for early expansion
- Node 3 provides brick (critical for early expansion) plus sheep, with decent probability (8 dots)
- Node 4 provides wheat (6) and sheep (9) with good probability (9 dots)
- Need to ensure my second settlement can complement this first one with missing resources

The optimal initial placement is node 5, as it:
1. Has the highest production value (12 dots)
2. Gives access to both wheat hexes (6 and 4) plus sheep (9)
3. Positions me for expansion toward wood resource in future turns
4. Doesn't directly compete with RED's current position

<plan>Place first settlement at node 5 to secure wheat and sheep production. For second settlement, prioritize a location with wood and brick to ensure access to all resources. Build roads to expand toward high-value wood resource regions and block RED's expansion path.</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist focused on defeating the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRITICAL FOR SUCCESS):
- Above all else, target the highest probability numbers (6 & 8) - these produce resources 5/36 times each
- Strictly prioritize access to all five resources between your two settlements
- Aim for numerical diversity - try to cover 5-6 different dice numbers across your settlements
- Never place initial settlements without analyzing future expansion opportunities
- Prioritize placement on hexes with complementary resources: ore/wheat and brick/wood
- Position roads toward high-value unoccupied areas the opponent cannot easily block
- Choose second settlement to complement your first settlement's resource weaknesses
- Consider 3:1 ports if you can't access a specific resource through settlements
- Analyze opponent placement to avoid contested expansion paths
- ALWAYS calculate production value using probability dots (5-6-8-9 are top priority numbers)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-10):
- Build at least one new settlement by turn 10 - expansion is your TOP priority
- Calculate and build along the fastest path to your next settlement location
- Secure missing resources through strategic settlement placement
- Build roads that secure critical expansion paths before the opponent blocks them
- Avoid development cards completely until you have at least 3 total settlements
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1) to complete critical builds
- Target resource diversity through your expansion locations
- Create a minimum 2-turn expansion plan and stick to it

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT AND PRODUCTION (CORE STRATEGY):
- Early game: Focus on wood/brick to expand with roads and settlements
- Mid game: Transition to ore/wheat focus for cities and development cards
- Calculate the resource production value of every potential build
- Only make 4:1 trades when they enable an immediate important build
- Cycle through "build phases" - expansion phase, then city upgrade phase
- Plan resource collection 2 turns ahead to minimize wasteful trades
- Never accumulate 7+ cards before dice rolls
- Diversify production to minimize dependency on any single resource
- Target a minimum of 4 total settlements before prioritizing city upgrades

COUNTERING ALPHABETA ALGORITHM:
- AlphaBeta looks ahead only 2 steps, so plan your moves 3-4 steps ahead
- Create deceptive game states that appear less threatening than they are
- Block the opponent's highest-probability expansion paths immediately
- Play defensively during early game, then aggressively in mid-game
- When opponent has 7+ points, disrupt their highest-producing hex with the robber
- Track opponent's resources and block their most likely next build
- Secure resources that the opponent depends on heavily
- Place roads to cut off opponent from accessing high-value settlement locations
- Position settlements to deny opponent access to key resource hex intersections

ROBBER PLACEMENT AND KNIGHT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-producing hex of your opponent
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat in mid-game when cities are being built
- Target the specific resource the opponent needs for their next likely build
- Use knight cards reactively when the robber blocks your best production
- Save knight cards for the late game if pursuing largest army
- When stealing, select resources that complete your immediate build needs
- Keep track of opponent cards and target resources they've been collecting
- Balance robber placement between disruption and resource acquisition

DEVELOPMENT CARDS VS. BUILDING:
- Only buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and cannot build
- Buy development cards when you're 1-2 knights away from largest army
- Use knight cards immediately when advantageous (don't save unless close to largest army)
- Victory point cards should only supplement your main strategy, not replace it
- Road Building cards are most valuable when you're cut off or racing to a key location
- Monopoly is best used after high-probability dice rolls to collect opponent's stockpile
- Year of Plenty is ideal to complete a high-value build (settlement or city)
- NEVER delay settlement/city building to purchase development cards unless 1 VP from winning

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY FOCUS):
- Aim for 5 total settlements (2 upgraded to cities) = 9 VP
- Then secure largest army OR longest road for the final point
- Always calculate the fastest path to 10 VP in terms of resource costs
- For each potential build, calculate how many turns closer it gets you to victory
- Determine which victory paths are still viable based on board state
- Switch strategies when your primary path is blocked
- Plan for the end-game by turn 10 (know exactly how you will reach 10 points)
- Track opponent's path to victory and actively disrupt with roads or robber

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Trade at ports even at 4:1 ratio if it enables immediate critical build
- NEVER trade with opponent unless it enables an immediate settlement/city build
- Avoid trades that allow opponent to build immediately after you
- Calculate the net VP gain of each potential trade
- Use trades to dispose of resources when at risk from robber
- Combine multiple port trades to convert unwanted resources into needed ones
- Be willing to overpay through port trades to secure critical positional advantage

DECISION FRAMEWORK (APPLY TO EVERY TURN):
1. What is my immediate build priority? (settlement > city > longest road/largest army)
2. What resource do I need to complete my highest priority build?
3. What is the fastest way to acquire that resource? (production, trading, development cards)
4. How will this action position me for the next 3 turns?
5. Will this action disrupt my opponent's path to victory?
6. Is there a way to combine multiple actions this turn for greater efficiency?

# Initial Road Placement Analysis

I need to carefully analyze my first road placement as it will determine my future expansion path. This is a critical decision that will affect the entire game trajectory.

## Current Game State
- I have my first settlement at node 5, producing wheat from both hex 6 (good probability) and hex 4 (low probability), plus sheep from hex 9 (decent probability)
- RED player has settled at node 1 with access to sheep, ore, and wood
- I need to build my road to set up my second settlement placement

## Analyzing Road Options
Let me analyze each of the three available road placements:

### Option 0: Build road at edge (4, 5)
- This road heads toward the desert hex and the wheat hex (6)
- Limited future expansion opportunities
- Does not open up access to missing resources (wood and brick)

### Option 1: Build road at edge (5, 16)
- This road heads toward nodes 16, connecting to wheat hex 4 and wheat hex 6
- Would give me access to the same resources I already have
- Does not open up potential for wood or brick acquisition

### Option 2: Build road at edge (0, 5)
- This road heads toward node 0, which connects to sheep hex 9, wood hex 8, and wheat hex 4
- Opens up potential access to wood (hex 8), which is one of my missing resources
- Node 0 is a valuable expansion point as it covers 3 different resources including wood (8)

## Strategic Considerations
- I need to prioritize access to all resources, particularly wood and brick which I'm missing
- Road option 2 (edge 0, 5) provides the best path to diversify my resources
- This path leads toward wood hex 8 which has a good probability (8 is rated ⭐⭐⭐)
- This direction appears less likely to be contested by RED in the immediate future

<plan>
Build initial road toward node 0 to secure a path to wood resource (hex 8). For my second settlement placement, prioritize a location with access to brick to complete my resource diversity. Continue expanding toward high-value, unoccupied areas that complement my resource needs.
</plan>

After careful analysis, road option 2 provides the best strategic advantage by opening a path to wood resources while maintaining future expansion flexibility.

# Initial Settlement Placement Analysis

I need to choose the optimal location for my second initial settlement. Let me analyze all the options systematically focusing on:
- Resource diversity
- Probability value (dot count)
- Complementing my existing settlement
- Future expansion opportunities
- Avoiding overlap with opponent's production

My current settlement at node 5 produces:
- 🐑9 (2 dots)
- 🌾6 (5 dots)
- 🌾4 (1 dot)

This gives me access to sheep and wheat, but I'm missing wood, brick, and ore. My settlement is particularly strong in wheat (6) which is good for cities later.

## Settlement Options Analysis:

Node 3:
- Resources: 🐑9, 🧱5, 🏜️- (desert)
- Dots: 2 + 4 = 6
- Adds brick, complements my wheat
- Desert hex doesn't produce
- Connected to the robber hex

Node 10:
- Resources: 🧱5, ⛏️10
- Dots: 4 + 2 = 6
- Adds brick AND ore
- Both are needed for settlements/cities
- Good numeric diversity (5, 10)

Node 11:
- Resources: 🧱5
- Dots: 4
- Only adds one resource (brick)
- Limited production potential

Node 12:
- Resources: 🧱5, 🏜️- (desert)
- Dots: 4 + 0 = 4
- Adds brick but includes desert
- Connected to robber hex
- Suboptimal production

Node 13:
- Resources: 🏜️- (desert)
- Dots: 0
- Desert hex with robber
- Extremely poor choice

Node 15:
- Resources: 🏜️- (desert), 🌾6
- Dots: 0 + 5 = 5
- Includes a desert hex
- Wheat overlaps with my current production
- Suboptimal

Node 17:
- Resources: 🌾6
- Dots: 5
- Duplicates wheat I already have
- Suboptimal

I should also examine options that provide wood:

Node 20:
- Resources: 🌾4, 🌲8
- Dots: 1 + 5 = 6
- Adds wood (critical resource)
- Duplicate wheat resource
- Wood has high probability (8)

Node 22 or 23:
- Resources: 🌲8
- Dots: 5
- Adds only wood
- Limited resource diversity

After analysis, nodes 10 and 20 stand out:
- Node 10 gives brick + ore (5 + 10), complementary resources with 6 dots total
- Node 20 gives wood + wheat (8 + 4), with wood being critical and 6 dots total

Node 10 adds two new resources I need, while node 20 adds wood but duplicates wheat. Given that my existing settlement is already strong in wheat, and I need both brick and ore for development, node 10 offers greater resource diversity.

<plan>Place second settlement at node 10 to secure brick and ore. This gives me access to three different resources between my settlements (wheat, sheep, brick, ore). Next focus on acquiring wood through trading or strategic road building toward wood hexes for future settlements.</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist focused on defeating the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRITICAL FOR SUCCESS):
- Above all else, target the highest probability numbers (6 & 8) - these produce resources 5/36 times each
- Strictly prioritize access to all five resources between your two settlements
- Aim for numerical diversity - try to cover 5-6 different dice numbers across your settlements
- Never place initial settlements without analyzing future expansion opportunities
- Prioritize placement on hexes with complementary resources: ore/wheat and brick/wood
- Position roads toward high-value unoccupied areas the opponent cannot easily block
- Choose second settlement to complement your first settlement's resource weaknesses
- Consider 3:1 ports if you can't access a specific resource through settlements
- Analyze opponent placement to avoid contested expansion paths
- ALWAYS calculate production value using probability dots (5-6-8-9 are top priority numbers)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-10):
- Build at least one new settlement by turn 10 - expansion is your TOP priority
- Calculate and build along the fastest path to your next settlement location
- Secure missing resources through strategic settlement placement
- Build roads that secure critical expansion paths before the opponent blocks them
- Avoid development cards completely until you have at least 3 total settlements
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1) to complete critical builds
- Target resource diversity through your expansion locations
- Create a minimum 2-turn expansion plan and stick to it

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT AND PRODUCTION (CORE STRATEGY):
- Early game: Focus on wood/brick to expand with roads and settlements
- Mid game: Transition to ore/wheat focus for cities and development cards
- Calculate the resource production value of every potential build
- Only make 4:1 trades when they enable an immediate important build
- Cycle through "build phases" - expansion phase, then city upgrade phase
- Plan resource collection 2 turns ahead to minimize wasteful trades
- Never accumulate 7+ cards before dice rolls
- Diversify production to minimize dependency on any single resource
- Target a minimum of 4 total settlements before prioritizing city upgrades

COUNTERING ALPHABETA ALGORITHM:
- AlphaBeta looks ahead only 2 steps, so plan your moves 3-4 steps ahead
- Create deceptive game states that appear less threatening than they are
- Block the opponent's highest-probability expansion paths immediately
- Play defensively during early game, then aggressively in mid-game
- When opponent has 7+ points, disrupt their highest-producing hex with the robber
- Track opponent's resources and block their most likely next build
- Secure resources that the opponent depends on heavily
- Place roads to cut off opponent from accessing high-value settlement locations
- Position settlements to deny opponent access to key resource hex intersections

ROBBER PLACEMENT AND KNIGHT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-producing hex of your opponent
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat in mid-game when cities are being built
- Target the specific resource the opponent needs for their next likely build
- Use knight cards reactively when the robber blocks your best production
- Save knight cards for the late game if pursuing largest army
- When stealing, select resources that complete your immediate build needs
- Keep track of opponent cards and target resources they've been collecting
- Balance robber placement between disruption and resource acquisition

DEVELOPMENT CARDS VS. BUILDING:
- Only buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and cannot build
- Buy development cards when you're 1-2 knights away from largest army
- Use knight cards immediately when advantageous (don't save unless close to largest army)
- Victory point cards should only supplement your main strategy, not replace it
- Road Building cards are most valuable when you're cut off or racing to a key location
- Monopoly is best used after high-probability dice rolls to collect opponent's stockpile
- Year of Plenty is ideal to complete a high-value build (settlement or city)
- NEVER delay settlement/city building to purchase development cards unless 1 VP from winning

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY FOCUS):
- Aim for 5 total settlements (2 upgraded to cities) = 9 VP
- Then secure largest army OR longest road for the final point
- Always calculate the fastest path to 10 VP in terms of resource costs
- For each potential build, calculate how many turns closer it gets you to victory
- Determine which victory paths are still viable based on board state
- Switch strategies when your primary path is blocked
- Plan for the end-game by turn 10 (know exactly how you will reach 10 points)
- Track opponent's path to victory and actively disrupt with roads or robber

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Trade at ports even at 4:1 ratio if it enables immediate critical build
- NEVER trade with opponent unless it enables an immediate settlement/city build
- Avoid trades that allow opponent to build immediately after you
- Calculate the net VP gain of each potential trade
- Use trades to dispose of resources when at risk from robber
- Combine multiple port trades to convert unwanted resources into needed ones
- Be willing to overpay through port trades to secure critical positional advantage

DECISION FRAMEWORK (APPLY TO EVERY TURN):
1. What is my immediate build priority? (settlement > city > longest road/largest army)
2. What resource do I need to complete my highest priority build?
3. What is the fastest way to acquire that resource? (production, trading, development cards)
4. How will this action position me for the next 3 turns?
5. Will this action disrupt my opponent's path to victory?
6. Is there a way to combine multiple actions this turn for greater efficiency?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 1 | Player: BLUE | Action: BUILD_INITIAL_ROAD

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  Place second settlement at node 10 to secure brick and ore. This gives me access to three different resources between my settlements (wheat, sheep, brick, ore). Next focus on acquiring wood through trading or strategic road building toward wood hexes for future settlements.

# Game Analysis for Initial Road Placement

I'm placing my second settlement's initial road, which is a critical strategic decision that will influence my future expansion paths.

## Current Situation
- I have settlements at node 5 (producing wheat6, wheat4, sheep9) and node 10 (producing brick5)
- I have 1 brick resource
- The opponent has a settlement at node 1 (producing wood8, sheep9, ore10)
- I need to place my initial road connected to my settlement at node 10

## Road Options
Let me analyze each option:

**[0] Build road at edge (9, 10)**
- Direction: This connects toward node 9
- Node 9 connects to:
  - Brick5 hex (which I already have access to)
  - Ore10 hex (valuable new resource)
- Future expansion: Could lead toward more ore production

**[1] Build road at edge (10, 11)**
- Direction: This connects toward node 11
- Node 11 connects to:
  - Brick5 hex (which I already have access to)
- Future expansion: Less clear resource diversity advantage

## Strategic Considerations
- I already have wheat and sheep from my first settlement
- I have brick from my second settlement
- I'm missing wood and ore in my production
- Option [0] moves me toward an ore hex, which would help with city upgrades later
- Node 9 also connects to the ore10 hex, which is a strong production number

<plan>Place initial road toward node 9 to move toward the ore hex. Next, acquire wood resources through trading to build another road and eventually secure a settlement with wood production. Goal is to have all 5 resources for balanced development.</plan>

Looking at the board connectivity and future resources, road option [0] to edge (9, 10) provides better strategic positioning toward gaining ore access, which complements my current resource portfolio better.

# Game Analysis for Settler of Catan - Turn 11

Let me analyze the current game state and determine the optimal move:

## Current Resource Assessment
- I have: 5 brick, 1 sheep, 1 wheat, 0 wood, 0 ore
- My settlements are at nodes: 5 (sheep-9, wheat-6, wheat-4) and 10 (brick-5)
- I completely lack wood and ore production

## Production Analysis
- My wheat production is strong (nodes with values 6 and 4)
- I have decent brick production (node 5)
- I have some sheep production (node with value 9)
- Critical missing resources: wood and ore

## Strategic Assessment
1. My settlements don't provide access to all 5 resources
2. I need to expand to get wood and ore production
3. The robber is on the wheat-6 hex, limiting one of my main production sources

## Possible Actions
- Option 0: End turn (waste my resources)
- Options 1-4: Trade 4 brick for 1 of sheep, ore, wood, or wheat

## Decision Process
I need wood to build roads for expansion. Having 5 bricks is excessive without wood to pair with it. Trading for wood would allow me to build a road and work toward a new settlement that could provide ore or more wood production.

Looking at the board, I should expand from node 9 toward the wood-8 hex which has high production value (3 dots). This aligns with my initial plan to secure all 5 resources.

Trading 4 brick for 1 wood will allow me to build a road immediately, advancing my position. I'll still have 1 brick left plus my other resources.

<plan>Trade brick for wood to build a road from node 9 toward node 8. Continue expansion toward the wood-8 hex to secure all 5 resources. Next goal is to reach a location with ore production.</plan>

The optimal action is to trade 4 brick for 1 wood (option 3).

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist focused on defeating the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRITICAL FOR SUCCESS):
- Above all else, target the highest probability numbers (6 & 8) - these produce resources 5/36 times each
- Strictly prioritize access to all five resources between your two settlements
- Aim for numerical diversity - try to cover 5-6 different dice numbers across your settlements
- Never place initial settlements without analyzing future expansion opportunities
- Prioritize placement on hexes with complementary resources: ore/wheat and brick/wood
- Position roads toward high-value unoccupied areas the opponent cannot easily block
- Choose second settlement to complement your first settlement's resource weaknesses
- Consider 3:1 ports if you can't access a specific resource through settlements
- Analyze opponent placement to avoid contested expansion paths
- ALWAYS calculate production value using probability dots (5-6-8-9 are top priority numbers)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-10):
- Build at least one new settlement by turn 10 - expansion is your TOP priority
- Calculate and build along the fastest path to your next settlement location
- Secure missing resources through strategic settlement placement
- Build roads that secure critical expansion paths before the opponent blocks them
- Avoid development cards completely until you have at least 3 total settlements
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1) to complete critical builds
- Target resource diversity through your expansion locations
- Create a minimum 2-turn expansion plan and stick to it

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT AND PRODUCTION (CORE STRATEGY):
- Early game: Focus on wood/brick to expand with roads and settlements
- Mid game: Transition to ore/wheat focus for cities and development cards
- Calculate the resource production value of every potential build
- Only make 4:1 trades when they enable an immediate important build
- Cycle through "build phases" - expansion phase, then city upgrade phase
- Plan resource collection 2 turns ahead to minimize wasteful trades
- Never accumulate 7+ cards before dice rolls
- Diversify production to minimize dependency on any single resource
- Target a minimum of 4 total settlements before prioritizing city upgrades

COUNTERING ALPHABETA ALGORITHM:
- AlphaBeta looks ahead only 2 steps, so plan your moves 3-4 steps ahead
- Create deceptive game states that appear less threatening than they are
- Block the opponent's highest-probability expansion paths immediately
- Play defensively during early game, then aggressively in mid-game
- When opponent has 7+ points, disrupt their highest-producing hex with the robber
- Track opponent's resources and block their most likely next build
- Secure resources that the opponent depends on heavily
- Place roads to cut off opponent from accessing high-value settlement locations
- Position settlements to deny opponent access to key resource hex intersections

ROBBER PLACEMENT AND KNIGHT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-producing hex of your opponent
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat in mid-game when cities are being built
- Target the specific resource the opponent needs for their next likely build
- Use knight cards reactively when the robber blocks your best production
- Save knight cards for the late game if pursuing largest army
- When stealing, select resources that complete your immediate build needs
- Keep track of opponent cards and target resources they've been collecting
- Balance robber placement between disruption and resource acquisition

DEVELOPMENT CARDS VS. BUILDING:
- Only buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and cannot build
- Buy development cards when you're 1-2 knights away from largest army
- Use knight cards immediately when advantageous (don't save unless close to largest army)
- Victory point cards should only supplement your main strategy, not replace it
- Road Building cards are most valuable when you're cut off or racing to a key location
- Monopoly is best used after high-probability dice rolls to collect opponent's stockpile
- Year of Plenty is ideal to complete a high-value build (settlement or city)
- NEVER delay settlement/city building to purchase development cards unless 1 VP from winning

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY FOCUS):
- Aim for 5 total settlements (2 upgraded to cities) = 9 VP
- Then secure largest army OR longest road for the final point
- Always calculate the fastest path to 10 VP in terms of resource costs
- For each potential build, calculate how many turns closer it gets you to victory
- Determine which victory paths are still viable based on board state
- Switch strategies when your primary path is blocked
- Plan for the end-game by turn 10 (know exactly how you will reach 10 points)
- Track opponent's path to victory and actively disrupt with roads or robber

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Trade at ports even at 4:1 ratio if it enables immediate critical build
- NEVER trade with opponent unless it enables an immediate settlement/city build
- Avoid trades that allow opponent to build immediately after you
- Calculate the net VP gain of each potential trade
- Use trades to dispose of resources when at risk from robber
- Combine multiple port trades to convert unwanted resources into needed ones
- Be willing to overpay through port trades to secure critical positional advantage

DECISION FRAMEWORK (APPLY TO EVERY TURN):
1. What is my immediate build priority? (settlement > city > longest road/largest army)
2. What resource do I need to complete my highest priority build?
3. What is the fastest way to acquire that resource? (production, trading, development cards)
4. How will this action position me for the next 3 turns?
5. Will this action disrupt my opponent's path to victory?
6. Is there a way to combine multiple actions this turn for greater efficiency?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 11 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  Trade brick for wood to build a road from node 9 toward node 8. Continue expansion toward the wood-8 hex to secure all 5 resources. Next goal is to reach a location with ore production.

# Game Analysis for Turn 11

I'll analyze the current game state and determine the optimal move for the BLUE player.

## Current Game State Assessment
- I have 2 VP from my 2 settlements
- My resources: 1 wood, 1 brick, 1 sheep, 1 wheat
- My current settlements produce:
  * Node 5: Sheep (9), Wheat (6), Wheat (4) - good wheat production but wheat hex 6 has robber
  * Node 10: Brick (5) - only source of brick

## Resource Analysis
- I currently have all resources EXCEPT ORE
- The robber is blocking my wheat-6 production, limiting my wheat generation
- I need to expand toward ore production

## Road Building Options Analysis
Let me analyze each available road option:

1. Edge (0, 1): Connects toward RED's settlement at node 1
2. Edge (0, 20): Connects toward RED's settlement at node 20
3. Edge (10, 11): Extends from my settlement at node 10 toward brick-5 hex
4. Edge (2, 9): Connects toward the ore-10 hex
5. Edge (4, 5): Connects from node 4 to my settlement at node 5
6. Edge (8, 9): Connects toward the ore-10 hex
7. Edge (5, 16): Extends from my settlement at node 5 toward the wheat-4 hex

## Strategic Evaluation
- I need ore for future city upgrades
- Edge options 4 and 6 both lead toward the ore-10 hex
- Option 6 (edge 8, 9) positions me to eventually reach node 7, which would connect to ore-10
- Option 4 (edge 2, 9) positions me closer to node 7 as well

Looking at the board connectivity:
- Building at edge (8, 9) gets me closer to securing ore production
- This follows my current plan to expand toward the wood-8 hex (which is near the ore-10 hex)
- This move takes me toward node 7, a critical intersection with ore-10 production

## Decision
I should build a road at edge (8, 9) to position myself toward both wood-8 and ore-10 hexes. This follows my plan to secure all 5 resources.

<plan>
Build road at edge (8, 9) to advance toward node 7 where I can build a settlement with access to ore-10 and wood-8 production. This gives me all 5 resources and positions me for future city upgrades.
</plan>

# Robber Placement Analysis

I need to analyze where to place the robber to maximize my strategic advantage while hampering my opponent's production.

## Game State Analysis
- I'm BLUE with 2 VP (2 settlements)
- RED has 3 VP (1 settlement, 1 city)
- I have 1 brick, 2 sheep, 2 wheat
- RED has 6 hidden cards
- I'm working toward building a settlement at node 7 to access ore-10 and wood-8

## Analyzing Robber Placement Options

Let's evaluate each option:

**[0] Move robber to (0, 0, 0) and steal from RED**
- This is the sheep-9 hex
- RED has a city at node 1 producing from this hex
- Disrupts RED's sheep production (important for development cards)
- I would steal a card from RED
- This hex has a productivity of 2 dots (medium value)

**[1] Move robber to (1, -1, 0) and steal from RED**
- This is the ore-10 hex
- RED has a city at node 1 producing from this hex
- Ore is critical for city upgrades in mid-game
- I would steal a card from RED
- Productivity is 2 dots (medium value)

**[2] Move robber to (0, -1, 1)**
- This is the brick-5 hex
- I have a settlement at node 10 producing from this hex
- Placing here would hurt my own production
- No stealing opportunity
- Not a good option

**[3] Move robber to (-1, 0, 1)**
- This is a desert hex with no production
- Placing here wastes the robber effect
- No stealing opportunity
- Not a good option

**[4] Move robber to (0, 1, -1) and steal from RED**
- This is the wheat-4 hex
- RED has a settlement at node 20 producing from this hex
- I also have a settlement at node 5 producing from this hex
- Would hurt my own production
- Productivity is only 1 dot (low value)
- Not ideal

**[5] Move robber to (1, 0, -1) and steal from RED**
- This is the wood-8 hex
- RED has both settlements/cities (nodes 1 and 20) producing from this hex
- Wood-8 has highest production value (3 dots)
- This is RED's most valuable resource hex
- I would steal a card from RED
- Blocks a critical resource RED needs for expansion

## Decision Making

The most disruptive placement would be on the wood-8 hex (option 5):
- It's RED's best production hex (3 dots, probability 5/36)
- Both of RED's buildings produce from this hex
- RED likely needs wood for expansion
- I can steal a card, potentially wood

The ore-10 hex (option 1) is also a good choice:
- RED will need ore for city upgrades
- Productivity is decent (2 dots)
- I can steal a card

<plan>Continue with original plan to build road at edge (8, 9) toward node 7, but disrupt RED's wood production to slow their expansion while I work toward my settlement. After placing my next settlement, I'll need to focus on obtaining ore for city upgrades.</plan>

Looking at RED's buildings, they produce from wood-8 at both locations, making it their most important resource. Blocking this will significantly hamper their ability to expand with roads and settlements.

- Create a minimum 2-turn expansion plan and stick to it

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT AND PRODUCTION (CORE STRATEGY):
- Early game: Focus on wood/brick to expand with roads and settlements
- Mid game: Transition to ore/wheat focus for cities and development cards
- Calculate the resource production value of every potential build
- Only make 4:1 trades when they enable an immediate important build
- Cycle through "build phases" - expansion phase, then city upgrade phase
- Plan resource collection 2 turns ahead to minimize wasteful trades
- Never accumulate 7+ cards before dice rolls
- Diversify production to minimize dependency on any single resource
- Target a minimum of 4 total settlements before prioritizing city upgrades

COUNTERING ALPHABETA ALGORITHM:
- AlphaBeta looks ahead only 2 steps, so plan your moves 3-4 steps ahead
- Create deceptive game states that appear less threatening than they are
- Block the opponent's highest-probability expansion paths immediately
- Play defensively during early game, then aggressively in mid-game
- When opponent has 7+ points, disrupt their highest-producing hex with the robber
- Track opponent's resources and block their most likely next build
- Secure resources that the opponent depends on heavily
- Place roads to cut off opponent from accessing high-value settlement locations
- Position settlements to deny opponent access to key resource hex intersections

ROBBER PLACEMENT AND KNIGHT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-producing hex of your opponent
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat in mid-game when cities are being built
- Target the specific resource the opponent needs for their next likely build
- Use knight cards reactively when the robber blocks your best production
- Save knight cards for the late game if pursuing largest army
- When stealing, select resources that complete your immediate build needs
- Keep track of opponent cards and target resources they've been collecting
- Balance robber placement between disruption and resource acquisition

DEVELOPMENT CARDS VS. BUILDING:
- Only buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and cannot build
- Buy development cards when you're 1-2 knights away from largest army
- Use knight cards immediately when advantageous (don't save unless close to largest army)
- Victory point cards should only supplement your main strategy, not replace it
- Road Building cards are most valuable when you're cut off or racing to a key location
- Monopoly is best used after high-probability dice rolls to collect opponent's stockpile
- Year of Plenty is ideal to complete a high-value build (settlement or city)
- NEVER delay settlement/city building to purchase development cards unless 1 VP from winning

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY FOCUS):
- Aim for 5 total settlements (2 upgraded to cities) = 9 VP
- Then secure largest army OR longest road for the final point
- Always calculate the fastest path to 10 VP in terms of resource costs
- For each potential build, calculate how many turns closer it gets you to victory
- Determine which victory paths are still viable based on board state
- Switch strategies when your primary path is blocked
- Plan for the end-game by turn 10 (know exactly how you will reach 10 points)
- Track opponent's path to victory and actively disrupt with roads or robber

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Trade at ports even at 4:1 ratio if it enables immediate critical build
- NEVER trade with opponent unless it enables an immediate settlement/city build
- Avoid trades that allow opponent to build immediately after you
- Calculate the net VP gain of each potential trade
- Use trades to dispose of resources when at risk from robber
- Combine multiple port trades to convert unwanted resources into needed ones
- Be willing to overpay through port trades to secure critical positional advantage

DECISION FRAMEWORK (APPLY TO EVERY TURN):
1. What is my immediate build priority? (settlement > city > longest road/largest army)
2. What resource do I need to complete my highest priority build?
3. What is the fastest way to acquire that resource? (production, trading, development cards)
4. How will this action position me for the next 3 turns?
5. Will this action disrupt my opponent's path to victory?
6. Is there a way to combine multiple actions this turn for greater efficiency?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 25 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  Continue with original plan to build road at edge (8, 9) toward node 7, but disrupt RED's wood production to slow their expansion while I work toward my settlement. After placing my next settlement, I'll need to focus on obtaining ore for city upgrades.
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.

# Game State Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state and my available options:

## Resources
I have: 1 🧱BRICK, 2 🐑SHEEP, 2 🌾WHEAT, 1 ⛏️ORE

## Victory Points
- Me (BLUE): 2/10 (from 2 settlements)
- RED: 3/10 (from 1 settlement, 1 city)

## Board Analysis
- RED is ahead by 1 VP and has longer roads (4 built with longest at 3)
- RED has a city at a strong location with access to wood (8), sheep (9), ore (10)
- My settlements have good wheat production (both 4 and 6) and brick (5), but I'm lacking consistent wood

## Available Actions
1. Buy a development card (1 🐑SHEEP, 1 🌾WHEAT, 1 ⛏️ORE)
2. End turn

## Decision Analysis

If I buy a development card:
- Pros:
  - Could get a victory point card (immediate progress)
  - Could get Knight to move robber from wood hex
  - Could get Road Building to accelerate expansion
  - Could get Year of Plenty/Monopoly to gain needed resources
- Cons:
  - Slows down my road building expansion
  - Uses my only ore that I could save for later city upgrades
  - Development cards are generally lower value early game than expansion

If I end my turn:
- Pros:
  - Save resources for future expansion
  - More flexible position next turn with new resources
- Cons:
  - Not making immediate progress this turn

Looking at my current plan, I want to continue building roads toward node 7 to place a settlement. I've already placed a road at edge (8, 9), but I need more brick to continue expanding. If I buy a development card now, I'll use my only brick and delay my expansion further.

<plan>
Save resources for continuing road expansion. I need to build another settlement urgently as I only have 2 VP currently. Will focus on getting more brick to continue my road towards node 7 for my next settlement. The robber is already on RED's wood production, which helps slow them down.
</plan>

Since I don't have enough brick to build another road this turn, and buying a development card would deplete key resources needed for my expansion strategy, I should end my turn and collect more resources.

PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist focused on defeating the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRITICAL FOR SUCCESS):
- Above all else, target the highest probability numbers (6 & 8) - these produce resources 5/36 times each
- Strictly prioritize access to all five resources between your two settlements
- Aim for numerical diversity - try to cover 5-6 different dice numbers across your settlements
- Never place initial settlements without analyzing future expansion opportunities
- Prioritize placement on hexes with complementary resources: ore/wheat and brick/wood
- Position roads toward high-value unoccupied areas the opponent cannot easily block
- Choose second settlement to complement your first settlement's resource weaknesses
- Consider 3:1 ports if you can't access a specific resource through settlements
- Analyze opponent placement to avoid contested expansion paths
- ALWAYS calculate production value using probability dots (5-6-8-9 are top priority numbers)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-10):
- Build at least one new settlement by turn 10 - expansion is your TOP priority
- Calculate and build along the fastest path to your next settlement location
- Secure missing resources through strategic settlement placement
- Build roads that secure critical expansion paths before the opponent blocks them
- Avoid development cards completely until you have at least 3 total settlements
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1) to complete critical builds
- Target resource diversity through your expansion locations
- Create a minimum 2-turn expansion plan and stick to it

# Game Analysis for Turn 27

Let me analyze the current game state and my available options:

## Current Game State
- I have 2 VP (from my 2 settlements)
- I have 1 🧱BRICK, 2 🐑SHEEP, 2 🌾WHEAT, 1 ⛏️ORE
- RED has 3 VP (1 settlement, 1 city) and 5 hidden cards
- The robber is on RED's wood hex, which is already helping me

## Resource Assessment
My current hand has a diverse set of resources, but I only have two options available:
1. Buy a development card (costs 1 🐑SHEEP, 1 🌾WHEAT, 1 ⛏️ORE)
2. End my turn

I can't build any roads (need 1 wood + 1 brick, but I only have 1 brick), can't build settlements (need placement locations and more resources), and can't upgrade to cities (need 3 ore + 2 wheat).

## Strategic Considerations
According to my current plan, I want to continue road expansion toward node 7 for my next settlement. However, I lack wood to build roads this turn.

A development card could be:
- Victory Point (immediate hidden VP)
- Knight (can move robber and steal from opponent)
- Road Building (free 2 roads, very valuable for my expansion plan)
- Year of Plenty (2 resources of my choice)
- Monopoly (steal all of one resource from opponent)

Given that I'm early in the game with only 2 VP, expansion remains my top priority. A development card could potentially help with this, especially if it's a Road Building card.

## Decision
While I typically would avoid development cards until I have 3 settlements, in this case:
1. I cannot build anything else with my current resources
2. I need wood for road building which I currently lack
3. A Road Building card would be extremely valuable for my expansion
4. Even a Knight card would allow me to potentially steal wood from RED

<plan>Buy a development card now. If it's a Road Building card, use it next turn to expand toward node 7. If it's a Knight, use it to move the robber from RED's wood hex to another high-value hex and try to steal wood. Continue saving resources for road expansion toward node 7 for my next settlement.</plan>

Given these considerations, I'll purchase a development card to potentially accelerate my expansion plan.

❓ Select action by number (0-1):


Based on this information, which action number do you choose? Think step by step about your options, then put the final action number in a box like \boxed{1}.
RESPONSE:
I'll analyze the current game state and make my decision step by step.

**Current Game Analysis:**
- I have 2 victory points from my 2 settlements
- I have 1 brick, 1 sheep, and 1 wheat resource
- I have 1 Knight development card available to play
- The robber is currently on RED's wood hex (1, 0, -1) with probability 8 (high value)
- RED has 3 victory points and 5 hidden resource cards
- I need more resources to continue my expansion plan toward node 7

**Options Analysis:**
1. **Play Knight Card [0]:** 
   - Advantages: Move robber from RED's wood hex (potentially to another high-value RED hex) and steal one of RED's 5 cards
   - I could disrupt RED's production while improving my own chances of getting needed resources
   - RED has 5 cards, so there's a good chance to steal something useful

2. **Roll Dice [1]:**
   - Advantages: Potentially gain more resources before playing the Knight
   - Risks: If I roll a 7, I'll have to move the robber anyway but without stealing
   - My current settlements produce on 4, 5, 6, and 9 - good dice spread

**Decision Process:**
RED has 5 cards and might be planning a build. Using the Knight now would disrupt their wood production and potentially steal a valuable resource. This would slow RED down while giving me an extra resource. Then I can roll for additional resources on my turn.

Since RED has a 1-point lead and appears to be expanding faster than me (with a city already), disrupting their production is tactically sound. Also, with 5 cards, RED is one roll of 7 away from losing half their hand.

<plan>Play Knight to move the robber from RED's wood hex to another high-value RED hex (likely their ore hex). Steal a resource card, then roll for more resources. Focus on building roads toward node 7 for my next settlement, which will give me access to ore that I currently lack.</plan>

Given the current game state and my need to slow RED's progress while improving my own resource position, I should play my Knight card first.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist focused on defeating the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRITICAL FOR SUCCESS):
- Above all else, target the highest probability numbers (6 & 8) - these produce resources 5/36 times each
- Strictly prioritize access to all five resources between your two settlements
- Aim for numerical diversity - try to cover 5-6 different dice numbers across your settlements
- Never place initial settlements without analyzing future expansion opportunities
- Prioritize placement on hexes with complementary resources: ore/wheat and brick/wood
- Position roads toward high-value unoccupied areas the opponent cannot easily block
- Choose second settlement to complement your first settlement's resource weaknesses
- Consider 3:1 ports if you can't access a specific resource through settlements
- Analyze opponent placement to avoid contested expansion paths
- ALWAYS calculate production value using probability dots (5-6-8-9 are top priority numbers)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-10):
- Build at least one new settlement by turn 10 - expansion is your TOP priority
- Calculate and build along the fastest path to your next settlement location
- Secure missing resources through strategic settlement placement
- Build roads that secure critical expansion paths before the opponent blocks them
- Avoid development cards completely until you have at least 3 total settlements
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1) to complete critical builds
- Target resource diversity through your expansion locations
- Create a minimum 2-turn expansion plan and stick to it

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT AND PRODUCTION (CORE STRATEGY):
- Early game: Focus on wood/brick to expand with roads and settlements
- Mid game: Transition to ore/wheat focus for cities and development cards
- Calculate the resource production value of every potential build
- Only make 4:1 trades when they enable an immediate important build
- Cycle through "build phases" - expansion phase, then city upgrade phase
- Plan resource collection 2 turns ahead to minimize wasteful trades
- Never accumulate 7+ cards before dice rolls
- Diversify production to minimize dependency on any single resource
- Target a minimum of 4 total settlements before prioritizing city upgrades

COUNTERING ALPHABETA ALGORITHM:
- AlphaBeta looks ahead only 2 steps, so plan your moves 3-4 steps ahead
- Create deceptive game states that appear less threatening than they are
- Block the opponent's highest-probability expansion paths immediately
- Play defensively during early game, then aggressively in mid-game
- When opponent has 7+ points, disrupt their highest-producing hex with the robber
- Track opponent's resources and block their most likely next build
- Secure resources that the opponent depends on heavily
- Place roads to cut off opponent from accessing high-value settlement locations
- Position settlements to deny opponent access to key resource hex intersections

ROBBER PLACEMENT AND KNIGHT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-producing hex of your opponent
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat in mid-game when cities are being built
- Target the specific resource the opponent needs for their next likely build
- Use knight cards reactively when the robber blocks your best production
- Save knight cards for the late game if pursuing largest army
- When stealing, select resources that complete your immediate build needs
- Keep track of opponent cards and target resources they've been collecting
- Balance robber placement between disruption and resource acquisition

DEVELOPMENT CARDS VS. BUILDING:
- Only buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and cannot build
- Buy development cards when you're 1-2 knights away from largest army
- Use knight cards immediately when advantageous (don't save unless close to largest army)
- Victory point cards should only supplement your main strategy, not replace it
- Road Building cards are most valuable when you're cut off or racing to a key location
- Monopoly is best used after high-probability dice rolls to collect opponent's stockpile
- Year of Plenty is ideal to complete a high-value build (settlement or city)
- NEVER delay settlement/city building to purchase development cards unless 1 VP from winning

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY FOCUS):
- Aim for 5 total settlements (2 upgraded to cities) = 9 VP
- Then secure largest army OR longest road for the final point
- Always calculate the fastest path to 10 VP in terms of resource costs
- For each potential build, calculate how many turns closer it gets you to victory
- Determine which victory paths are still viable based on board state
- Switch strategies when your primary path is blocked
- Plan for the end-game by turn 10 (know exactly how you will reach 10 points)
- Track opponent's path to victory and actively disrupt with roads or robber

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Trade at ports even at 4:1 ratio if it enables immediate critical build
- NEVER trade with opponent unless it enables an immediate settlement/city build
- Avoid trades that allow opponent to build immediately after you
- Calculate the net VP gain of each potential trade
- Use trades to dispose of resources when at risk from robber
- Combine multiple port trades to convert unwanted resources into needed ones
- Be willing to overpay through port trades to secure critical positional advantage

DECISION FRAMEWORK (APPLY TO EVERY TURN):
1. What is my immediate build priority? (settlement > city > longest road/largest army)
2. What resource do I need to complete my highest priority build?
3. What is the fastest way to acquire that resource? (production, trading, development cards)
4. How will this action position me for the next 3 turns?
5. Will this action disrupt my opponent's path to victory?
6. Is there a way to combine multiple actions this turn for greater efficiency?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 29 | Player: BLUE | Action: MOVE_ROBBER

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  Play Knight to move the robber from RED's wood hex to another high-value RED hex (likely their ore hex). Steal a resource card, then roll for more resources. Focus on building roads toward node 7 for my next settlement, which will give me access to ore that I currently lack.
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.

# Analyzing Robber Placement Options

Let me analyze the current game state and identify the optimal robber placement to disrupt RED player while maximizing my strategic advantage.

## Current Game State
- I'm BLUE with 2 victory points, RED has 3 points
- I have 1 BRICK, 1 SHEEP, 1 WHEAT
- RED has 5 hidden cards
- Robber is currently on RED's wood (8) hex, which is highly productive (3 dots)

## Robber Placement Analysis

Option 0: Move to SHEEP (9) hex at (0, 0, 0)
- This blocks a 2-dot resource that both RED and I produce
- RED has a city at node 1 that produces from this hex
- I have a settlement at node 5 that produces from this hex
- This would hurt my own production while only partly hurting RED

Option 1: Move to ORE (10) hex at (1, -1, 0)
- This blocks a 1-dot resource
- RED has a city at node 1 that produces from this hex
- I don't produce ore currently
- Low impact target since it's only a 1-dot resource

Option 2: Move to BRICK (5) hex at (0, -1, 1)
- This blocks a 2-dot resource
- Only I produce from this hex (settlement at node 10)
- This would hurt my own production and not affect RED
- Never beneficial to block my own exclusive resource

Option 3: Move to DESERT (-) hex at (-1, 0, 1)
- Desert produces nothing
- No impact on either player
- Wasting the robber placement

Option 4: Move to WHEAT (6) hex at (-1, 1, 0)
- This blocks a 3-dot resource (high value)
- Only I produce from this hex (settlement at node 5)
- This would severely hurt my own production and not affect RED
- Terrible option

Option 5: Move to WHEAT (4) hex at (0, 1, -1)
- This blocks a 1-dot resource
- RED has a settlement at node 20 that produces from this hex
- I have a settlement at node 5 that produces from this hex
- This would hurt my own production while only slightly hurting RED

## Strategic Considerations
- RED has a city at node 1 that produces sheep (9), ore (10), and wood (8) - all 3 are important
- The most valuable hex for RED is still the WOOD (8) hex - but robber is already there
- The SHEEP (9) hex is RED's second most valuable production with 2 dots
- While moving to the ORE (10) hex would only block a 1-dot production, ORE is crucial for city building

<plan>
Place the robber on RED's sheep hex (0,0,0) to disrupt their most valuable remaining resource production. Then I'll focus on building roads toward node 7 for my next settlement, which will give me access to ore that I currently lack. I'll specifically work toward building a road from node 9 to node 7 to secure that ore access.
</plan>

## Final Decision
I need to maximally disrupt RED while minimizing impact to myself. Option 0 disrupts RED's high value SHEEP (9) production from their city. While I also produce sheep from this hex, disrupting RED's city production is worth the tradeoff. RED likely has sheep cards I could steal.

# Analysis of Game State and Options

Let me analyze the current game state and my available options carefully:

## Current Resources
I have: 1 🌲WOOD, 1 🧱BRICK, 1 🐑SHEEP, 2 🌾WHEAT

## Board Position
- I have settlements at nodes 5 and 10
- I'm producing: 🐑9[⭐⭐], 🌾6[⭐⭐⭐], 🌾4[⭐], 🧱5[⭐⭐]
- Missing resources: ⛏️ORE (critical for cities)
- My roads are at (0, 5), (5, 0), (9, 10), (10, 9), (8, 9), (9, 8)
- Current VPs: 2/10
- Red has: 3/10 VPs

## Available Actions
I can:
1. Build a road with my 1 wood, 1 brick
2. Build a settlement at node 8 (costs 1 wood, 1 brick, 1 wheat, 1 sheep - which I have)
3. End my turn

## Node 8 Examination
Node 8 connects to:
- ⛏️10 (1, -1, 0) hex - gives me access to ore (which I'm missing)
- Would enable building toward other valuable locations
- Increases my production significantly

Looking at the settlement option (#8) - this is extremely valuable as it:
1. Gives me access to ⛏️ORE (10) which I currently lack
2. Increases my VP count to 3
3. Improves my resource diversity
4. Follows my current plan of expanding toward ore

This is a perfect opportunity to build a settlement at a strategic location that gives me the ore I need, increases my victory points, and improves my position on the board. I have exactly the resources needed to build this settlement.

<plan>
Build settlement at node 8 to gain ore access, then focus on upgrading my settlement at node 5 to a city (needs 3 ore, 2 wheat), followed by expanding roads toward other valuable resource nodes.
</plan>

\boxed{8}
========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist focused on defeating the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRITICAL FOR SUCCESS):
- Above all else, target the highest probability numbers (6 & 8) - these produce resources 5/36 times each
- Strictly prioritize access to all five resources between your two settlements
- Aim for numerical diversity - try to cover 5-6 different dice numbers across your settlements
- Never place initial settlements without analyzing future expansion opportunities
- Prioritize placement on hexes with complementary resources: ore/wheat and brick/wood
- Position roads toward high-value unoccupied areas the opponent cannot easily block
- Choose second settlement to complement your first settlement's resource weaknesses
- Consider 3:1 ports if you can't access a specific resource through settlements
- Analyze opponent placement to avoid contested expansion paths
- ALWAYS calculate production value using probability dots (5-6-8-9 are top priority numbers)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-10):
- Build at least one new settlement by turn 10 - expansion is your TOP priority
- Calculate and build along the fastest path to your next settlement location
- Secure missing resources through strategic settlement placement
- Build roads that secure critical expansion paths before the opponent blocks them
- Avoid development cards completely until you have at least 3 total settlements
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1) to complete critical builds
- Target resource diversity through your expansion locations
- Create a minimum 2-turn expansion plan and stick to it

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT AND PRODUCTION (CORE STRATEGY):
- Early game: Focus on wood/brick to expand with roads and settlements
- Mid game: Transition to ore/wheat focus for cities and development cards
- Calculate the resource production value of every potential build
- Only make 4:1 trades when they enable an immediate important build
- Cycle through "build phases" - expansion phase, then city upgrade phase
- Plan resource collection 2 turns ahead to minimize wasteful trades
- Never accumulate 7+ cards before dice rolls
- Diversify production to minimize dependency on any single resource
- Target a minimum of 4 total settlements before prioritizing city upgrades

COUNTERING ALPHABETA ALGORITHM:
- AlphaBeta looks ahead only 2 steps, so plan your moves 3-4 steps ahead
- Create deceptive game states that appear less threatening than they are
- Block the opponent's highest-probability expansion paths immediately
- Play defensively during early game, then aggressively in mid-game
- When opponent has 7+ points, disrupt their highest-producing hex with the robber
- Track opponent's resources and block their most likely next build
- Secure resources that the opponent depends on heavily
- Place roads to cut off opponent from accessing high-value settlement locations
- Position settlements to deny opponent access to key resource hex intersections

ROBBER PLACEMENT AND KNIGHT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-producing hex of your opponent
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat in mid-game when cities are being built
- Target the specific resource the opponent needs for their next likely build
- Use knight cards reactively when the robber blocks your best production
- Save knight cards for the late game if pursuing largest army
- When stealing, select resources that complete your immediate build needs
- Keep track of opponent cards and target resources they've been collecting
- Balance robber placement between disruption and resource acquisition

DEVELOPMENT CARDS VS. BUILDING:
- Only buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and cannot build
- Buy development cards when you're 1-2 knights away from largest army
- Use knight cards immediately when advantageous (don't save unless close to largest army)
- Victory point cards should only supplement your main strategy, not replace it
- Road Building cards are most valuable when you're cut off or racing to a key location
- Monopoly is best used after high-probability dice rolls to collect opponent's stockpile
- Year of Plenty is ideal to complete a high-value build (settlement or city)
- NEVER delay settlement/city building to purchase development cards unless 1 VP from winning

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY FOCUS):
- Aim for 5 total settlements (2 upgraded to cities) = 9 VP
- Then secure largest army OR longest road for the final point
- Always calculate the fastest path to 10 VP in terms of resource costs
- For each potential build, calculate how many turns closer it gets you to victory
- Determine which victory paths are still viable based on board state
- Switch strategies when your primary path is blocked
- Plan for the end-game by turn 10 (know exactly how you will reach 10 points)
- Track opponent's path to victory and actively disrupt with roads or robber

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Trade at ports even at 4:1 ratio if it enables immediate critical build
- NEVER trade with opponent unless it enables an immediate settlement/city build
- Avoid trades that allow opponent to build immediately after you
- Calculate the net VP gain of each potential trade
- Use trades to dispose of resources when at risk from robber
- Combine multiple port trades to convert unwanted resources into needed ones
- Be willing to overpay through port trades to secure critical positional advantage

DECISION FRAMEWORK (APPLY TO EVERY TURN):
1. What is my immediate build priority? (settlement > city > longest road/largest army)
2. What resource do I need to complete my highest priority build?
3. What is the fastest way to acquire that resource? (production, trading, development cards)
4. How will this action position me for the next 3 turns?
5. Will this action disrupt my opponent's path to victory?
6. Is there a way to combine multiple actions this turn for greater efficiency?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game Analysis

Let me analyze my current position and available actions carefully:

## Current Game State
- I have 3 settlements (at nodes 5, 8, 10), giving me 3 victory points
- I have 4 🌾WHEAT and 1 ⛏️ORE resources
- I need to reach 10 victory points to win
- Red has 4 victory points with 2 cities

## Resource Production Analysis
- I produce: 🌾Wheat (from nodes 5, 6, and 4), 🐑Sheep (node 5), ⛏️Ore (node 8), and 🧱Brick (node 10)
- I'm missing reliable 🌲Wood production which limits my expansion ability

## My Available Actions
1. End my turn
2. Trade 4 wheat for 1 sheep
3. Trade 4 wheat for 1 brick
4. Trade 4 wheat for 1 wood
5. Trade 4 wheat for 1 ore

## Path to Victory Analysis
To reach 10 VPs, I need 7 more points. Options:
- Upgrade my 3 settlements to cities = 3 more points
- Build 4 more settlements = 4 points
- Secure Largest Army (need at least 3 knights) = 2 points
- Secure Longest Road (need at least 5 connected roads) = 2 points

## Strategic Priorities
1. I need to upgrade settlements to cities (especially the well-positioned node 5)
2. I need reliable wood access for further expansion
3. I should work toward either longest road or largest army

## Action Evaluation
- I have 1 ore and need 3 ore to upgrade a city (plus 2 wheat)
- Trading 4 wheat for 1 ore would give me 2 ore total, still short of a city
- I have no immediate builds possible with the current resources
- Holding resources is risky due to the robber, but I can hold 7 cards safely

<plan>
Continue focusing on upgrading the settlement at node 5 to a city. Need to acquire 2 more ore. After that, aim to build roads toward wood production or expand toward areas with good numbers. Consider buying development card next turn if I gain more resources.
</plan>

Since I cannot make any productive build this turn and trading wheat at a 4:1 ratio would not allow me to complete any significant build, the most efficient move is to end my turn and hope for good rolls on the next turn. Trading away my wheat now would be inefficient.

❓ Select action by number (0-5):


Based on this information, which action number do you choose? Think step by step about your options, then put the final action number in a box like \boxed{1}.
RESPONSE:
I'll analyze this turn step-by-step to determine where to move the robber for maximum strategic benefit.

**Game State Analysis:**
- I have 3 VP (3 settlements)
- Red has 4 VP (2 cities)
- I'm holding 4 Wheat and 1 Ore
- I need 2 more Ore to upgrade my settlement at node 5 to a city
- The robber is currently on the Sheep (9) hex

**Resources Production Analysis:**
- Red's most productive resource is Wood from the Wood (8) hex - produces for both cities
- Red also gets Sheep from a 9 hex and Ore from a 10 hex
- I get Wheat from two sources (4 and 6), Brick from a 5 hex, and Ore from a 10 hex

**Robber Move Options:**
- [0] Ore (10) hex - would block both Red and my Ore production
- [1] Brick (5) hex - would block my own Brick production
- [2] Desert (-) hex - no effect on production
- [3] Wheat (6) hex - would block one of my Wheat sources
- [4] Wheat (4) hex - would block Red's city and my settlement
- [5] Wood (8) hex - would block Red's most productive hex (supplies both cities)

**Strategic Analysis:**
- Since I need Ore to upgrade my settlement, I should avoid blocking the Ore (10) hex
- Red's Wood (8) hex is their most productive resource (2 cities benefit)
- Blocking Wood would significantly hamper Red's production
- I also get to steal a resource from Red, which could help with my city upgrade

**Decision Process:**
Option [5] (Move robber to Wood hex) is clearly the best choice because:
1. It blocks Red's most productive hex
2. It doesn't block any of my critical resources
3. I get to steal a card from Red which might help my city upgrade
4. Disrupting Red's wood production will slow down their expansion

<plan>Block Red's Wood production with robber. Continue my plan to upgrade settlement at node 5 to a city (need 2 more Ore). After city upgrade, look to build roads toward resource diversity, focusing on acquiring wood which I currently lack.</plan>

- Only make 4:1 trades when they enable an immediate important build
- Cycle through "build phases" - expansion phase, then city upgrade phase
- Plan resource collection 2 turns ahead to minimize wasteful trades
- Never accumulate 7+ cards before dice rolls
- Diversify production to minimize dependency on any single resource
- Target a minimum of 4 total settlements before prioritizing city upgrades

COUNTERING ALPHABETA ALGORITHM:
- AlphaBeta looks ahead only 2 steps, so plan your moves 3-4 steps ahead
- Create deceptive game states that appear less threatening than they are
- Block the opponent's highest-probability expansion paths immediately
- Play defensively during early game, then aggressively in mid-game
- When opponent has 7+ points, disrupt their highest-producing hex with the robber
- Track opponent's resources and block their most likely next build
- Secure resources that the opponent depends on heavily
- Place roads to cut off opponent from accessing high-value settlement locations
- Position settlements to deny opponent access to key resource hex intersections

ROBBER PLACEMENT AND KNIGHT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-producing hex of your opponent
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat in mid-game when cities are being built
- Target the specific resource the opponent needs for their next likely build
- Use knight cards reactively when the robber blocks your best production
- Save knight cards for the late game if pursuing largest army
- When stealing, select resources that complete your immediate build needs
- Keep track of opponent cards and target resources they've been collecting
- Balance robber placement between disruption and resource acquisition

DEVELOPMENT CARDS VS. BUILDING:
- Only buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and cannot build
- Buy development cards when you're 1-2 knights away from largest army
- Use knight cards immediately when advantageous (don't save unless close to largest army)
- Victory point cards should only supplement your main strategy, not replace it
- Road Building cards are most valuable when you're cut off or racing to a key location
- Monopoly is best used after high-probability dice rolls to collect opponent's stockpile
- Year of Plenty is ideal to complete a high-value build (settlement or city)
- NEVER delay settlement/city building to purchase development cards unless 1 VP from winning

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY FOCUS):
- Aim for 5 total settlements (2 upgraded to cities) = 9 VP
- Then secure largest army OR longest road for the final point
- Always calculate the fastest path to 10 VP in terms of resource costs
- For each potential build, calculate how many turns closer it gets you to victory
- Determine which victory paths are still viable based on board state
- Switch strategies when your primary path is blocked
- Plan for the end-game by turn 10 (know exactly how you will reach 10 points)
- Track opponent's path to victory and actively disrupt with roads or robber

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Trade at ports even at 4:1 ratio if it enables immediate critical build
- NEVER trade with opponent unless it enables an immediate settlement/city build
- Avoid trades that allow opponent to build immediately after you
- Calculate the net VP gain of each potential trade
- Use trades to dispose of resources when at risk from robber
- Combine multiple port trades to convert unwanted resources into needed ones
- Be willing to overpay through port trades to secure critical positional advantage

DECISION FRAMEWORK (APPLY TO EVERY TURN):
1. What is my immediate build priority? (settlement > city > longest road/largest army)
2. What resource do I need to complete my highest priority build?
3. What is the fastest way to acquire that resource? (production, trading, development cards)
4. How will this action position me for the next 3 turns?
5. Will this action disrupt my opponent's path to victory?
6. Is there a way to combine multiple actions this turn for greater efficiency?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game Analysis and Decision Process

I'll analyze the current game state and my available options to determine the best move.

## Current Situation Overview
- I have 3/10 victory points (3 settlements)
- Red has 4/10 victory points (2 cities)
- Resources: 1 sheep, 4 wheat, 1 ore
- No development cards in hand
- Robber is on Red's wood resource (hex 8) which is good

## Strategic Position Analysis
- I need to upgrade my settlements to cities to catch up with Red
- Currently unable to build roads or settlements (lack of brick/wood)
- Need more ore to upgrade a settlement to city (need 3 ore total, have only 1)
- I'm producing wheat efficiently but lack wood production
- Red's key production includes wood (8) which is currently blocked by the robber

## Available Actions Analysis

**[0] End Turn**
This would waste my current resources and opportunity to improve position.

**[1] Buy Development Card (1 sheep, 1 wheat, 1 ore)**
- Pros: Could get VP card, Knight (to maintain robber control), or utility card
- Cons: Uses my only ore which delays city upgrade, and development cards are random

**[2-5] Maritime Trade Options with Wheat**
- Option [5] Trade 4 wheat for 1 ore
  - This would give me 2 ore total, bringing me closer to the 3 required for a city upgrade
  - I'd still have plenty of wheat production to rebuild my wheat supply
  - This directly supports my plan to upgrade my settlement at node 5

Looking at my plan, I need 2 more ore to upgrade my settlement at node 5 to a city. Trading 4 wheat for 1 ore brings me one step closer to this goal and makes efficient use of my wheat surplus.

<plan>Continue focusing on upgrading settlement at node 5 to a city. After this trade, I'll have 2 ore and need just 1 more. Continue blocking Red's wood production with the robber while accumulating the final ore needed. Once the city is built, consider development cards if I have excess sheep/wheat/ore or look for opportunities to build roads if I can acquire brick/wood.</plan>

The optimal move is to trade 4 wheat for 1 ore through maritime trade.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist focused on defeating the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRITICAL FOR SUCCESS):
- Above all else, target the highest probability numbers (6 & 8) - these produce resources 5/36 times each
- Strictly prioritize access to all five resources between your two settlements
- Aim for numerical diversity - try to cover 5-6 different dice numbers across your settlements
- Never place initial settlements without analyzing future expansion opportunities
- Prioritize placement on hexes with complementary resources: ore/wheat and brick/wood
- Position roads toward high-value unoccupied areas the opponent cannot easily block
- Choose second settlement to complement your first settlement's resource weaknesses
- Consider 3:1 ports if you can't access a specific resource through settlements
- Analyze opponent placement to avoid contested expansion paths
- ALWAYS calculate production value using probability dots (5-6-8-9 are top priority numbers)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-10):
- Build at least one new settlement by turn 10 - expansion is your TOP priority
- Calculate and build along the fastest path to your next settlement location
- Secure missing resources through strategic settlement placement
- Build roads that secure critical expansion paths before the opponent blocks them
- Avoid development cards completely until you have at least 3 total settlements
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1) to complete critical builds
- Target resource diversity through your expansion locations
- Create a minimum 2-turn expansion plan and stick to it

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT AND PRODUCTION (CORE STRATEGY):
- Early game: Focus on wood/brick to expand with roads and settlements
- Mid game: Transition to ore/wheat focus for cities and development cards
- Calculate the resource production value of every potential build
- Only make 4:1 trades when they enable an immediate important build
- Cycle through "build phases" - expansion phase, then city upgrade phase

- Then secure largest army OR longest road for the final point
- Always calculate the fastest path to 10 VP in terms of resource costs
- For each potential build, calculate how many turns closer it gets you to victory
- Determine which victory paths are still viable based on board state
- Switch strategies when your primary path is blocked
- Plan for the end-game by turn 10 (know exactly how you will reach 10 points)
- Track opponent's path to victory and actively disrupt with roads or robber

# Analyzing Robber Placement Options

I need to analyze the best hex to place the robber to maximize my chances of winning. Let me think through each option carefully:

## Current Game Status
- I have 3 VP (3 settlements)
- Red has 4 VP (2 cities)
- I currently have 2 ore, and my plan is to build a city at node 5, which requires 3 ore and 2 wheat
- I need to disrupt Red's production while potentially gaining a useful resource

## Evaluating Each Robber Option:
**[0] Move robber to (0, 0, 0) - Sheep 9 - and steal from RED**
- This blocks a 9 (sheep) hex which produces for both Red's city at node 1 and my settlement at node 5
- Blocks 2 dots of probability for Red's city at node 1
- But also blocks 2 dots of probability for my settlement at node 5
- Not ideal as it hurts my production as well

**[1] Move robber to (1, -1, 0) - Ore 10 - and steal from RED**
- This blocks a 10 (ore) hex which produces for Red's city at node 1 and my settlement at node 8
- Blocks 1 dot of probability for Red's city at node 1
- But also blocks 1 dot of probability for my settlement
- Not ideal as it hurts my ore production which I need

**[2] Move robber to (0, -1, 1) - Brick 5**
- This blocks a 5 (brick) hex which only produces for my settlement at node 10
- This would hurt my production without affecting Red
- Very poor choice

**[3] Move robber to (-1, 0, 1) - Desert**
- This is the desert hex which produces nothing
- Completely wasted move

**[4] Move robber to (0, 1, -1) - Wheat 4 - and steal from RED**
- This blocks a 4 (wheat) hex which produces for Red's city at node 20 and my settlement at node 5
- Blocks 1 dot of probability for Red's city
- But also blocks 1 dot of probability for my settlement
- Hurts my wheat production which I need for a city

**[5] Move robber to (1, 0, -1) - Wood 8 - and steal from RED**
- This blocks an 8 (wood) hex which produces for both of Red's cities (nodes 1 and 20)
- Blocks 3 dots of probability for each of Red's cities (6 dots total)
- Doesn't affect any of my settlements
- Gives me a chance to steal a card from Red, who has 4 cards

## Strategic Analysis
Option [5] is clearly the best choice because:
1. It blocks Red's most productive hex (8 - Wood) which produces for both of their cities
2. It disrupts 6 probability dots of production from Red (most impactful)
3. It doesn't hurt any of my own production
4. I have a chance to steal a resource from Red that might help me build my city
5. Wood is valuable for Red since they may be pursuing longest road (they already have 5 roads)

<plan>Continue focusing on upgrading settlement at node 5 to a city. After this move, I'll block Red's wood production and potentially steal a useful resource. I still need 1 more ore for my city. If I steal ore or can trade for it, I'll build the city immediately. Otherwise, I'll focus on getting that final ore through production on my next turns. Once the city is built, I'll assess whether to pursue development cards with my sheep/wheat/ore excess or build roads if I can acquire brick/wood.</plan>

TURN 49 | Player: BLUE | Action: MOVE_ROBBER

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  Continue focusing on upgrading settlement at node 5 to a city. After this move, I'll block Red's wood production and potentially steal a useful resource. I still need 1 more ore for my city. If I steal ore or can trade for it, I'll build the city immediately. Otherwise, I'll focus on getting that final ore through production on my next turns. Once the city is built, I'll assess whether to pursue development cards with my sheep/wheat/ore excess or build roads if I can acquire brick/wood.

# Game Analysis and Decision Process

I'll analyze each robber placement option to determine which one offers the most strategic advantage:

## Robber Placement Options Analysis

**Option [0]**: Move robber to (0, 0, 0) and steal from RED
- Blocks: 🐑9 hex with 2 dots (medium production value)
- RED has a city at node 1 connected to this hex
- This would block one of RED's sheep productions
- I have a settlement on this hex at node 5, so I'd be blocking my own sheep production too

**Option [1]**: Move robber to (1, -1, 0) and steal from RED
- Blocks: ⛏️10 hex with 1 dot (low-medium production value)
- RED has a city at node 1 connected to this hex
- I have a settlement at node 8 connected to this hex, so I'd block my own ore production
- I need ore for my city upgrade, so this is counterproductive

**Option [2]**: Move robber to (0, -1, 1)
- Blocks: 🧱5 hex with 2 dots (medium production value)
- No RED buildings on this hex
- I have a settlement at node 10 connected to this hex, so I'd block my own brick production
- Cannot steal from RED since they don't have buildings here

**Option [3]**: Move robber to (-1, 0, 1)
- Blocks: 🏜️ Desert hex (no production value)
- This is wasteful as desert produces nothing anyway

**Option [4]**: Move robber to (0, 1, -1) and steal from RED
- Blocks: 🌾4 hex with 1 dot (low production value)
- RED has a city at node 20 connected to this hex
- I have a settlement at node 5 connected to this hex, so I'd block my own wheat production
- I need wheat for my city upgrade

**Option [5]**: Move robber to (1, 0, -1) and steal from RED
- Blocks: 🌲8 hex with 3 dots (high production value)
- RED has cities at both node 1 and node 20 connected to this hex
- This is RED's best production hex with two cities connected (producing twice per roll)
- Blocking this significantly reduces RED's wood production
- I have no buildings on this hex, so no impact on my production
- Can steal a card from RED

## Strategic Considerations

1. My current goal is to upgrade my settlement at node 5 to a city, which requires 3 ore and 2 wheat.
2. I currently have 2 ore and 2 wheat, so I need 1 more ore.
3. RED is ahead with 6 VPs, while I only have 3 VPs, so disrupting RED's production is crucial.
4. Option [5] blocks RED's highest-producing hex (wood) without affecting my own production.
5. RED having two cities on the 8-value wood hex makes this an extremely valuable target.
6. The opportunity to steal a card from RED might provide the ore I need for my city upgrade.

<plan>
Move the robber to RED's wood hex to disrupt their high-value production. If I steal ore, immediately upgrade to a city at node 5. Otherwise, focus on trading or waiting for ore production from my settlement at node 8. After building the city, evaluate whether to pursue development cards (for potential VPs and knights toward largest army) or focus on road expansion to contest longest road.
</plan>

## Decision

Option [5] is clearly the optimal choice. It disrupts RED's best production without impacting my own resources, potentially delays RED's progress toward 10 VP, and gives me a chance to steal the ore I need for my city upgrade.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist focused on defeating the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRITICAL FOR SUCCESS):
- Above all else, target the highest probability numbers (6 & 8) - these produce resources 5/36 times each
- Strictly prioritize access to all five resources between your two settlements
- Aim for numerical diversity - try to cover 5-6 different dice numbers across your settlements
- Never place initial settlements without analyzing future expansion opportunities
- Prioritize placement on hexes with complementary resources: ore/wheat and brick/wood
- Position roads toward high-value unoccupied areas the opponent cannot easily block
- Choose second settlement to complement your first settlement's resource weaknesses
- Consider 3:1 ports if you can't access a specific resource through settlements
- Analyze opponent placement to avoid contested expansion paths
- ALWAYS calculate production value using probability dots (5-6-8-9 are top priority numbers)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-10):
- Build at least one new settlement by turn 10 - expansion is your TOP priority
- Calculate and build along the fastest path to your next settlement location
- Secure missing resources through strategic settlement placement
- Build roads that secure critical expansion paths before the opponent blocks them
- Avoid development cards completely until you have at least 3 total settlements
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1) to complete critical builds
- Target resource diversity through your expansion locations
- Create a minimum 2-turn expansion plan and stick to it

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT AND PRODUCTION (CORE STRATEGY):
- Early game: Focus on wood/brick to expand with roads and settlements
- Mid game: Transition to ore/wheat focus for cities and development cards
- Calculate the resource production value of every potential build
- Only make 4:1 trades when they enable an immediate important build
- Cycle through "build phases" - expansion phase, then city upgrade phase
- Plan resource collection 2 turns ahead to minimize wasteful trades
- Never accumulate 7+ cards before dice rolls
- Diversify production to minimize dependency on any single resource
- Target a minimum of 4 total settlements before prioritizing city upgrades

COUNTERING ALPHABETA ALGORITHM:
- AlphaBeta looks ahead only 2 steps, so plan your moves 3-4 steps ahead
- Create deceptive game states that appear less threatening than they are
- Block the opponent's highest-probability expansion paths immediately
- Play defensively during early game, then aggressively in mid-game
- When opponent has 7+ points, disrupt their highest-producing hex with the robber
- Track opponent's resources and block their most likely next build
- Secure resources that the opponent depends on heavily
- Place roads to cut off opponent from accessing high-value settlement locations
- Position settlements to deny opponent access to key resource hex intersections

ROBBER PLACEMENT AND KNIGHT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-producing hex of your opponent
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat in mid-game when cities are being built
- Target the specific resource the opponent needs for their next likely build
- Use knight cards reactively when the robber blocks your best production
- Save knight cards for the late game if pursuing largest army
- When stealing, select resources that complete your immediate build needs
- Keep track of opponent cards and target resources they've been collecting
- Balance robber placement between disruption and resource acquisition

DEVELOPMENT CARDS VS. BUILDING:
- Only buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and cannot build
- Buy development cards when you're 1-2 knights away from largest army
- Use knight cards immediately when advantageous (don't save unless close to largest army)
- Victory point cards should only supplement your main strategy, not replace it
- Road Building cards are most valuable when you're cut off or racing to a key location
- Monopoly is best used after high-probability dice rolls to collect opponent's stockpile
- Year of Plenty is ideal to complete a high-value build (settlement or city)
- NEVER delay settlement/city building to purchase development cards unless 1 VP from winning

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY FOCUS):
- Aim for 5 total settlements (2 upgraded to cities) = 9 VP
- Then secure largest army OR longest road for the final point
- Always calculate the fastest path to 10 VP in terms of resource costs
- For each potential build, calculate how many turns closer it gets you to victory
- Determine which victory paths are still viable based on board state
- Switch strategies when your primary path is blocked
- Plan for the end-game by turn 10 (know exactly how you will reach 10 points)
- Track opponent's path to victory and actively disrupt with roads or robber

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Trade at ports even at 4:1 ratio if it enables immediate critical build
- NEVER trade with opponent unless it enables an immediate settlement/city build
- Avoid trades that allow opponent to build immediately after you
- Calculate the net VP gain of each potential trade
- Use trades to dispose of resources when at risk from robber
- Combine multiple port trades to convert unwanted resources into needed ones
- Be willing to overpay through port trades to secure critical positional advantage

DECISION FRAMEWORK (APPLY TO EVERY TURN):
1. What is my immediate build priority? (settlement > city > longest road/largest army)
2. What resource do I need to complete my highest priority build?
3. What is the fastest way to acquire that resource? (production, trading, development cards)
4. How will this action position me for the next 3 turns?
5. Will this action disrupt my opponent's path to victory?
6. Is there a way to combine multiple actions this turn for greater efficiency?

RESPONSE:
# Game Analysis: Catan Turn 49

I'll methodically analyze my current position and available options to determine the optimal move.

## Current Status Assessment
- I have 3 VP (3 settlements, no cities)
- RED has 6 VP (2 cities, longest road)
- Resources on hand: 1 🧱 BRICK, 1 🐑 SHEEP, 2 🌾 WHEAT, 2 ⛏️ ORE
- Options: Buy development card or end turn

## Resource Analysis
With 1 🐑 SHEEP, 1 🌾 WHEAT, 1 ⛏️ ORE required for a development card, I have exactly enough resources to purchase one.

## Strategic Considerations

1. **Development Card Benefits**:
   - Could get a Victory Point card (immediate hidden VP)
   - Could get a Knight (helps toward largest army, defensive robber placement)
   - Could get Year of Plenty or Monopoly (resource acceleration)
   - Could get Road Building (expansion opportunity)

2. **Path to Victory Analysis**:
   - I need 7 more VP to win
   - Potential VP sources: 2 cities (+2 VP), 2 more settlements (+2 VP), largest army (+2 VP), longest road (+2 VP)
   - Development cards could directly contribute through VP cards or knights for largest army

3. **Opportunity Cost**:
   - Using resources now means I'll need to collect more before city upgrade
   - However, I don't have enough for a city upgrade anyway (need 3 ore, 2 wheat; have 2 ore, 2 wheat)
   - No immediate build opportunity is lost by buying a development card

4. **Risk Assessment**:
   - If I save resources, I risk losing them to a 7 roll/robber
   - RED is closer to victory at 6 VP and may threaten to win soon

## Decision Logic
Given that:
- I'm not sacrificing an immediate build opportunity
- I can potentially gain direct VP or strategic advantage
- There's risk in holding resources for future turns
- My current VP count (3) is far behind RED's (6)

Buying a development card is the optimal choice. It has potential upside with minimal downside, as I can't build a city this turn anyway and would otherwise be holding resources at risk.

<plan>
Purchase a development card now. If it's a Victory Point, I'll be at 4 VP. If it's a Knight, I'll use it to move the robber from RED's wood hex and potentially steal a valuable resource. Next, focus on upgrading one settlement to a city (need 1 more ore) to reach 5 VP, then evaluate whether to pursue largest army or continue expanding with settlements.

❓ Select action by number (0-1):


Based on this information, which action number do you choose? Think step by step about your options, then put the final action number in a box like \boxed{1}.
RESPONSE:
I'll analyze the current game state and make a strategic decision.

Current Situation:
- I have 3 VP (3 settlements)
- RED has 6 VP (2 cities + longest road bonus)
- I have 1 Knight card ready to play
- I have limited resources: 1 brick, 1 wheat, 1 ore
- The robber is currently on a wood hex (1,0,-1) with value 8 (high-probability)
- The robber is blocking RED's access to wood, which seems to be working in my favor

Options Analysis:
1. Play Knight (Action 0):
   - Benefits: Move robber from wood hex to another strategic location and steal a resource
   - Drawbacks: The robber is already on RED's valuable wood hex, which is helping us by limiting their production

2. Roll Dice (Action 1):
   - Benefits: Get resources based on dice roll to advance my building plans
   - Drawbacks: Risk rolling a 7 and losing resources

Strategic Considerations:
- RED is ahead at 6 VP, so disrupting their strategy remains important
- I need resources to either build more settlements or upgrade to cities
- My current resource holdings are insufficient for any major build
- Getting more resources through a roll is the priority at this moment

<plan>
Roll the dice to gather resources. I need more materials before I can make meaningful progress. After the roll, I'll focus on either upgrading to a city (need 2 more ore and 1 more wheat) or building toward a new settlement location. I'll save my Knight card for when RED has more cards to steal or when the robber is placed on one of my productive hexes.
</plan>

The robber is already in a good position for me, blocking RED's valuable wood hex. Playing the Knight now would be suboptimal since I would likely move it to a less strategic location. Rolling the dice gives me a chance to collect more resources I desperately need to continue my building strategy.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist focused on defeating the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRITICAL FOR SUCCESS):
- Above all else, target the highest probability numbers (6 & 8) - these produce resources 5/36 times each
- Strictly prioritize access to all five resources between your two settlements
- Aim for numerical diversity - try to cover 5-6 different dice numbers across your settlements
- Never place initial settlements without analyzing future expansion opportunities
- Prioritize placement on hexes with complementary resources: ore/wheat and brick/wood
- Position roads toward high-value unoccupied areas the opponent cannot easily block
- Choose second settlement to complement your first settlement's resource weaknesses
- Consider 3:1 ports if you can't access a specific resource through settlements
- Analyze opponent placement to avoid contested expansion paths
- ALWAYS calculate production value using probability dots (5-6-8-9 are top priority numbers)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-10):
- Build at least one new settlement by turn 10 - expansion is your TOP priority
- Calculate and build along the fastest path to your next settlement location
- Secure missing resources through strategic settlement placement
- Build roads that secure critical expansion paths before the opponent blocks them
- Avoid development cards completely until you have at least 3 total settlements
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1) to complete critical builds
- Target resource diversity through your expansion locations
- Create a minimum 2-turn expansion plan and stick to it

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT AND PRODUCTION (CORE STRATEGY):
- Early game: Focus on wood/brick to expand with roads and settlements
- Mid game: Transition to ore/wheat focus for cities and development cards
- Calculate the resource production value of every potential build
- Only make 4:1 trades when they enable an immediate important build
- Cycle through "build phases" - expansion phase, then city upgrade phase
- Plan resource collection 2 turns ahead to minimize wasteful trades
- Never accumulate 7+ cards before dice rolls
- Diversify production to minimize dependency on any single resource
- Target a minimum of 4 total settlements before prioritizing city upgrades

COUNTERING ALPHABETA ALGORITHM:
- AlphaBeta looks ahead only 2 steps, so plan your moves 3-4 steps ahead
- Create deceptive game states that appear less threatening than they are
- Block the opponent's highest-probability expansion paths immediately
- Play defensively during early game, then aggressively in mid-game
- When opponent has 7+ points, disrupt their highest-producing hex with the robber
- Track opponent's resources and block their most likely next build
- Secure resources that the opponent depends on heavily
- Place roads to cut off opponent from accessing high-value settlement locations
- Position settlements to deny opponent access to key resource hex intersections

ROBBER PLACEMENT AND KNIGHT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-producing hex of your opponent
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat in mid-game when cities are being built
- Target the specific resource the opponent needs for their next likely build
- Use knight cards reactively when the robber blocks your best production
- Save knight cards for the late game if pursuing largest army
- When stealing, select resources that complete your immediate build needs
- Keep track of opponent cards and target resources they've been collecting
- Balance robber placement between disruption and resource acquisition

DEVELOPMENT CARDS VS. BUILDING:
- Only buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and cannot build
- Buy development cards when you're 1-2 knights away from largest army
- Use knight cards immediately when advantageous (don't save unless close to largest army)
- Victory point cards should only supplement your main strategy, not replace it
- Road Building cards are most valuable when you're cut off or racing to a key location
- Monopoly is best used after high-probability dice rolls to collect opponent's stockpile
- Year of Plenty is ideal to complete a high-value build (settlement or city)
- NEVER delay settlement/city building to purchase development cards unless 1 VP from winning

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY FOCUS):
- Aim for 5 total settlements (2 upgraded to cities) = 9 VP
- Then secure largest army OR longest road for the final point
- Always calculate the fastest path to 10 VP in terms of resource costs
- For each potential build, calculate how many turns closer it gets you to victory
- Determine which victory paths are still viable based on board state
- Switch strategies when your primary path is blocked
- Plan for the end-game by turn 10 (know exactly how you will reach 10 points)
- Track opponent's path to victory and actively disrupt with roads or robber

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Trade at ports even at 4:1 ratio if it enables immediate critical build
- NEVER trade with opponent unless it enables an immediate settlement/city build
- Avoid trades that allow opponent to build immediately after you
- Calculate the net VP gain of each potential trade
- Use trades to dispose of resources when at risk from robber
- Combine multiple port trades to convert unwanted resources into needed ones
- Be willing to overpay through port trades to secure critical positional advantage

DECISION FRAMEWORK (APPLY TO EVERY TURN):
1. What is my immediate build priority? (settlement > city > longest road/largest army)
2. What resource do I need to complete my highest priority build?
3. What is the fastest way to acquire that resource? (production, trading, development cards)
4. How will this action position me for the next 3 turns?
5. Will this action disrupt my opponent's path to victory?
6. Is there a way to combine multiple actions this turn for greater efficiency?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 51 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  Roll the dice to gather resources. I need more materials before I can make meaningful progress. After the roll, I'll focus on either upgrading to a city (need 2 more ore and 1 more wheat) or building toward a new settlement location. I'll save my Knight card for when RED has more cards to steal or when the robber is placed on one of my productive hexes.

# Game Analysis for Turn 51

Let me analyze my current position and options:

## Game State Analysis
- I have 3 victory points (3 settlements)
- RED has 6 victory points (2 cities + longest road)
- I have 1 🧱BRICK, 1 🌾WHEAT, 2 ⛏️ORE
- I have 1 KNIGHT development card available to play
- The robber is currently on the 🌲8 hex, which is RED's most productive hex

## My Options
I have only two options:
1. [0] Play my Knight card to move the robber and steal a resource
2. [1] End my turn

## Strategic Considerations

**Option 0: Play Knight Card**
- Benefits:
  - I could move the robber from RED's 8 timber hex to another productive RED hex
  - I would steal a resource from RED, who has 4 cards
  - Playing a knight puts me one step closer to largest army (currently I have 1)
- Drawbacks:
  - I don't have an immediate build I can complete even with an additional resource

**Option 1: End Turn**
- Benefits:
  - Save the knight card for a more strategic moment
  - The robber is already on RED's most productive hex (8 timber)
- Drawbacks:
  - Miss opportunity to disrupt RED and gain a resource

## Decision Logic

The robber is already on RED's most productive hex (timber-8), which produces for BOTH of RED's cities. This is an optimal position for the robber from my perspective. Playing a knight would require me to move the robber, which would likely be less optimal.

Additionally, I don't have enough resources to complete any builds even if I steal a card, so there's no immediate benefit to playing the knight now.

<plan>
Save my knight card for when RED removes the robber from their 8 timber hex or when I need to protect my own production. Continue gathering resources for either a city upgrade (need 1 more wheat and 2 more ore) or new roads/settlements. After my next dice roll, reassess whether to use the knight card based on resource needs and robber position.

Given these considerations, the most strategic choice is to:

# Game Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state and decide between playing my Knight card (option 0) or rolling the dice (option 1).

## Current Situation
- I have 3 VP (3 settlements)
- RED has 6 VP (2 cities + longest road)
- I have 1 BRICK, 1 SHEEP, 1 WHEAT, 2 ORE
- I have 1 KNIGHT card available to play
- The robber is currently on RED's 8 timber hex (1,0,-1)

## Resource Needs
For immediate builds:
- City upgrade: Need 1 more WHEAT and 1 more ORE
- New road: Have enough BRICK for 1 road
- New settlement: Need 1 more WOOD and 2 more BRICK

## Strategic Considerations

1. **Knight Card Timing**
   - The robber is already on RED's valuable 8 timber hex, which is optimal for me
   - Playing the Knight would force me to move the robber elsewhere, potentially to a less optimal location
   - I should save the Knight for when RED moves the robber from this hex

2. **Resource Collection**
   - Rolling first allows me to potentially collect more resources for my builds
   - My settlements cover dice numbers: 4, 5, 6, 9, 10
   - Good probability of getting something useful with a roll

3. **Risk Assessment**
   - I have 5 resource cards, so no risk of losing cards to a "7" roll
   - Rolling will increase my options before using the Knight card

## Decision Logic
Rolling the dice is clearly the better option here. The robber is already placed optimally (blocking RED's most productive hex), and I need more resources to execute my strategy. Playing the Knight now would be counterproductive as I would have to move the robber from its currently ideal position.

<plan>
Roll the dice to collect more resources. If I roll a 7, place the robber on RED's other productive hex. Otherwise, gather resources and focus on either upgrading a settlement to a city (if I get wheat) or building roads toward a new settlement location to catch up to RED. Save the Knight card for when RED moves the robber from their 8 timber hex.

- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1) to complete critical builds
- Target resource diversity through your expansion locations
- Create a minimum 2-turn expansion plan and stick to it

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT AND PRODUCTION (CORE STRATEGY):
- Early game: Focus on wood/brick to expand with roads and settlements
- Mid game: Transition to ore/wheat focus for cities and development cards
- Calculate the resource production value of every potential build
- Only make 4:1 trades when they enable an immediate important build
- Cycle through "build phases" - expansion phase, then city upgrade phase
- Plan resource collection 2 turns ahead to minimize wasteful trades
- Never accumulate 7+ cards before dice rolls
- Diversify production to minimize dependency on any single resource
- Target a minimum of 4 total settlements before prioritizing city upgrades

COUNTERING ALPHABETA ALGORITHM:
- AlphaBeta looks ahead only 2 steps, so plan your moves 3-4 steps ahead
- Create deceptive game states that appear less threatening than they are
- Block the opponent's highest-probability expansion paths immediately
- Play defensively during early game, then aggressively in mid-game
- When opponent has 7+ points, disrupt their highest-producing hex with the robber
- Track opponent's resources and block their most likely next build
- Secure resources that the opponent depends on heavily
- Place roads to cut off opponent from accessing high-value settlement locations
- Position settlements to deny opponent access to key resource hex intersections

ROBBER PLACEMENT AND KNIGHT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-producing hex of your opponent
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat in mid-game when cities are being built
- Target the specific resource the opponent needs for their next likely build
- Use knight cards reactively when the robber blocks your best production
- Save knight cards for the late game if pursuing largest army
- When stealing, select resources that complete your immediate build needs
- Keep track of opponent cards and target resources they've been collecting
- Balance robber placement between disruption and resource acquisition

DEVELOPMENT CARDS VS. BUILDING:
- Only buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and cannot build
- Buy development cards when you're 1-2 knights away from largest army
- Use knight cards immediately when advantageous (don't save unless close to largest army)
- Victory point cards should only supplement your main strategy, not replace it
- Road Building cards are most valuable when you're cut off or racing to a key location
- Monopoly is best used after high-probability dice rolls to collect opponent's stockpile
- Year of Plenty is ideal to complete a high-value build (settlement or city)
- NEVER delay settlement/city building to purchase development cards unless 1 VP from winning

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY FOCUS):
- Aim for 5 total settlements (2 upgraded to cities) = 9 VP
- Then secure largest army OR longest road for the final point
- Always calculate the fastest path to 10 VP in terms of resource costs
- For each potential build, calculate how many turns closer it gets you to victory
- Determine which victory paths are still viable based on board state
- Switch strategies when your primary path is blocked
- Plan for the end-game by turn 10 (know exactly how you will reach 10 points)
- Track opponent's path to victory and actively disrupt with roads or robber

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Trade at ports even at 4:1 ratio if it enables immediate critical build
- NEVER trade with opponent unless it enables an immediate settlement/city build
- Avoid trades that allow opponent to build immediately after you
- Calculate the net VP gain of each potential trade
- Use trades to dispose of resources when at risk from robber
- Combine multiple port trades to convert unwanted resources into needed ones
- Be willing to overpay through port trades to secure critical positional advantage

DECISION FRAMEWORK (APPLY TO EVERY TURN):
1. What is my immediate build priority? (settlement > city > longest road/largest army)
2. What resource do I need to complete my highest priority build?
3. What is the fastest way to acquire that resource? (production, trading, development cards)
4. How will this action position me for the next 3 turns?
5. Will this action disrupt my opponent's path to victory?
6. Is there a way to combine multiple actions this turn for greater efficiency?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 53 | Player: BLUE | Action: MOVE_ROBBER

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  Roll the dice to collect more resources. If I roll a 7, place the robber on RED's other productive hex. Otherwise, gather resources and focus on either upgrading a settlement to a city (if I get wheat) or building roads toward a new settlement location to catch up to RED. Save the Knight card for when RED moves the robber from their 8 timber hex.
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.

# Analyzing the Move Robber Options

I'm currently in a tough position against RED, who has 6 victory points versus my 3 points. I need to make smart strategic moves to catch up.

Let me analyze each robber placement option:

**Option 0: Move robber to (0, 0, 0) - Sheep 9**
- This is RED's 🏙️ at node 1 (produces: 🐑9[⭐⭐], ⛏️10[⭐], 🌲8[⭐⭐⭐])
- Would block sheep production, which is not critical for city upgrades
- I also use this hex for my settlement at node 5, so I'd hurt my own production

**Option 1: Move robber to (1, -1, 0) - Ore 10**
- This is connected to RED's 🏙️ at node 1 (produces: 🐑9[⭐⭐], ⛏️10[⭐], 🌲8[⭐⭐⭐])
- Would block ore production which RED needs for development cards and cities
- But I also use this hex for my settlement at node 8, so I'd hurt my own production

**Option 2: Move robber to (0, -1, 1) - Brick 5**
- No RED settlements here
- This would block brick which is not as critical for RED's city strategy
- I have a settlement at node 10 producing brick, so I'd hurt myself significantly

**Option 3: Move robber to (-1, 0, 1) - Desert**
- This is a desert hex with no production, so placing the robber here is pointless

**Option 4: Move robber to (-1, 1, 0) - Wheat 6**
- No RED settlements here
- This is connected to my settlement at node 5, so I'd hurt my own wheat production
- Wheat is critical for both cities and development cards

**Option 5: Move robber to (0, 1, -1) - Wheat 4**
- This is connected to RED's 🏙️ at node 20 (produces: 🌾4[⭐], 🌲8[⭐⭐⭐])
- Would block wheat production which RED needs for cities and development cards
- This also affects my settlement at node 5, but wheat 4 is a low probability (only ⭐)

<plan>
Target RED's most productive resources that I don't depend on heavily. Focus on blocking their wheat production (for cities) while minimizing impact to my own production. After this move, I'll use my resources to either build a city (need more wheat) or roads toward potential settlement locations. I need to catch up by increasing my production capacity.
</plan>

Looking at RED's production, their timber 8 hex is currently blocked. Their most important remaining resource is wheat, which they need for cities and development cards. Placing the robber on wheat 4 (option 5) would disrupt RED's city-building strategy while minimizing impact to my own production (since it's only a 4, which is lower probability).

This also gives me the opportunity to steal a card from RED, who has 6 cards. I might get a valuable resource to help with my building plans.

PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist focused on defeating the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRITICAL FOR SUCCESS):
- Above all else, target the highest probability numbers (6 & 8) - these produce resources 5/36 times each
- Strictly prioritize access to all five resources between your two settlements
- Aim for numerical diversity - try to cover 5-6 different dice numbers across your settlements
- Never place initial settlements without analyzing future expansion opportunities
- Prioritize placement on hexes with complementary resources: ore/wheat and brick/wood
- Position roads toward high-value unoccupied areas the opponent cannot easily block
- Choose second settlement to complement your first settlement's resource weaknesses
- Consider 3:1 ports if you can't access a specific resource through settlements
- Analyze opponent placement to avoid contested expansion paths
- ALWAYS calculate production value using probability dots (5-6-8-9 are top priority numbers)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-10):

# Game State Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state and my available options:

**Victory Points:**
- RED has 6 VP (2 cities = 4 VP + Longest Road = 2 VP)
- I (BLUE) have 3 VP (3 settlements = 3 VP)
- I'm trailing by 3 VP and need to catch up quickly

**My Resources:**
- 1 BRICK, 2 SHEEP, 1 WHEAT, 2 ORE
- 1 KNIGHT card available to play

**Available Actions:**
- [0] Play Knight card - Move the robber and steal a resource
- [1] End turn
- [2] Buy a development card (costs 1 SHEEP, 1 WHEAT, 1 ORE)

## Option Analysis:

### Option 0: Play Knight Card
- Current robber is on (0, 1, -1), which is a wheat hex with value 4
- This hex produces for me at node 5, but also for RED at node 20
- By playing a Knight, I can:
  1. Move the robber to a hex that produces more for RED
  2. Potentially steal a valuable resource
  3. Contribute toward Largest Army (need 3+ knights)
- Best target: (1, 0, -1) - Wood hex with value 8 that produces for RED at TWO cities

### Option 1: End Turn
- No immediate benefit
- I'd be passing up an opportunity to disrupt RED and potentially gain resources

### Option 2: Buy Development Card
- Would use 1 SHEEP, 1 WHEAT, 1 ORE
- Could be a Victory Point, Knight, Road Building, Year of Plenty, or Monopoly
- Development cards are random and might not provide immediate benefit
- Would leave me with just 1 BRICK, 1 SHEEP, 1 ORE remaining

## Strategic Decision:

Playing the Knight provides the most immediate value:
1. I can target RED's most productive hex (the wood-8)
2. I'll potentially steal a valuable resource
3. This disrupts RED's production engine
4. I'll be on my way toward Largest Army (now at 2 knights)
5. I retain all my current resources for future builds

<plan>
Play the Knight card to move the robber to the wood-8 hex (1, 0, -1) which produces for both RED cities. This disrupts RED's most productive resource while potentially stealing a resource. Then focus on gathering resources to upgrade one of my settlements to a city (need 3 ORE, 2 WHEAT) or building more roads toward potential settlement locations.
</plan>

Option 0 is clearly the strongest play as it gives immediate benefit, disrupts my opponent's production, and contributes to a potential Largest Army victory path.

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT AND PRODUCTION (CORE STRATEGY):
- Early game: Focus on wood/brick to expand with roads and settlements
- Mid game: Transition to ore/wheat focus for cities and development cards
- Calculate the resource production value of every potential build
- Only make 4:1 trades when they enable an immediate important build
- Cycle through "build phases" - expansion phase, then city upgrade phase
- Plan resource collection 2 turns ahead to minimize wasteful trades
- Never accumulate 7+ cards before dice rolls
- Diversify production to minimize dependency on any single resource
- Target a minimum of 4 total settlements before prioritizing city upgrades

COUNTERING ALPHABETA ALGORITHM:
- AlphaBeta looks ahead only 2 steps, so plan your moves 3-4 steps ahead
- Create deceptive game states that appear less threatening than they are

- Position settlements to deny opponent access to key resource hex intersections

ROBBER PLACEMENT AND KNIGHT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-producing hex of your opponent
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat in mid-game when cities are being built
- Target the specific resource the opponent needs for their next likely build
- Use knight cards reactively when the robber blocks your best production
- Save knight cards for the late game if pursuing largest army

- Keep track of opponent cards and target resources they've been collecting
- Balance robber placement between disruption and resource acquisition

DEVELOPMENT CARDS VS. BUILDING:
- Only buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and cannot build
- Buy development cards when you're 1-2 knights away from largest army
- Use knight cards immediately when advantageous (don't save unless close to largest army)
- Victory point cards should only supplement your main strategy, not replace it
- Road Building cards are most valuable when you're cut off or racing to a key location
- Monopoly is best used after high-probability dice rolls to collect opponent's stockpile
- Year of Plenty is ideal to complete a high-value build (settlement or city)
- NEVER delay settlement/city building to purchase development cards unless 1 VP from winning

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY FOCUS):
- Aim for 5 total settlements (2 upgraded to cities) = 9 VP
- Then secure largest army OR longest road for the final point
- Always calculate the fastest path to 10 VP in terms of resource costs
- For each potential build, calculate how many turns closer it gets you to victory
- Determine which victory paths are still viable based on board state
- Switch strategies when your primary path is blocked
- Plan for the end-game by turn 10 (know exactly how you will reach 10 points)
- Track opponent's path to victory and actively disrupt with roads or robber

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Trade at ports even at 4:1 ratio if it enables immediate critical build
- NEVER trade with opponent unless it enables an immediate settlement/city build
- Avoid trades that allow opponent to build immediately after you
- Calculate the net VP gain of each potential trade
- Use trades to dispose of resources when at risk from robber
- Combine multiple port trades to convert unwanted resources into needed ones
- Be willing to overpay through port trades to secure critical positional advantage

DECISION FRAMEWORK (APPLY TO EVERY TURN):
1. What is my immediate build priority? (settlement > city > longest road/largest army)
2. What resource do I need to complete my highest priority build?

- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 53 | Player: BLUE | Action: MOVE_ROBBER

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  Play the Knight card to move the robber to the wood-8 hex (1, 0, -1) which produces for both RED cities. This disrupts RED's most productive resource while potentially stealing a resource. Then focus on gathering resources to upgrade one of my settlements to a city (need 3 ORE, 2 WHEAT) or building more roads toward potential settlement locations.
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.

❓ Select action by number (0-5):


Based on this information, which action number do you choose? Think step by step about your options, then put the final action number in a box like \boxed{1}.
RESPONSE:
I'll analyze the available options for moving the robber to make the optimal decision.

First, let me understand the current game state:
- I (BLUE) have 3 VP (from 3 settlements)
- RED has 6 VP (2 cities + longest road bonus)
- RED is ahead, so disrupting their production is critical
- I need to focus on upgrading settlements to cities (need ORE and WHEAT)
- I have 1 BRICK, 2 SHEEP, 1 WHEAT, and 2 ORE

Let's evaluate each robber placement option:

[0] Move robber to (0, 0, 0) - Sheep-9 hex:
- Blocks RED's city at node 1 (reduces sheep production)
- Also blocks my settlement at node 5 (hurts my own production)
- Sheep is less critical for city building

[1] Move robber to (1, -1, 0) - Ore-10 hex:
- Blocks RED's city at node 1 (reduces ore production)
- Also blocks my settlement at node 8 (hurts my own production)
- Ore is critical for city building

[2] Move robber to (0, -1, 1) - Brick-5 hex:
- Doesn't block RED's production
- Blocks my settlement at node 10
- Not strategic as brick is less valuable in mid-game

[3] Move robber to (-1, 0, 1) - Desert hex:
- No production impact for either player
- Wasted move

[4] Move robber to (-1, 1, 0) - Wheat-6 hex:
- Doesn't block RED's production
- Blocks my settlement at node 5
- Hurts my wheat production which I need

[5] Move robber to (1, 0, -1) - Wood-8 hex:
- Blocks BOTH of RED's cities (major impact)
- Wood-8 is RED's most productive hex (highest probability number)
- Doesn't block any of my settlements
- Allows me to steal from RED

Option [5] is clearly the best choice as it:
1. Maximizes disruption to RED's production (blocks their most valuable hex)
2. Impacts both of RED's cities simultaneously
3. Doesn't hurt my own production
4. Follows my current plan
5. Provides an opportunity to steal a resource from RED

<plan>Move the robber to the wood-8 hex (1, 0, -1) to block RED's highest production hex that feeds both their cities. After stealing a resource, focus on gathering ore and wheat to upgrade one of my settlements to a city. I need 1 more ORE and 1 more WHEAT for this upgrade.</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist focused on defeating the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRITICAL FOR SUCCESS):
- Above all else, target the highest probability numbers (6 & 8) - these produce resources 5/36 times each
- Strictly prioritize access to all five resources between your two settlements
- Aim for numerical diversity - try to cover 5-6 different dice numbers across your settlements
- Never place initial settlements without analyzing future expansion opportunities
- Prioritize placement on hexes with complementary resources: ore/wheat and brick/wood
- Position roads toward high-value unoccupied areas the opponent cannot easily block
- Choose second settlement to complement your first settlement's resource weaknesses
- Consider 3:1 ports if you can't access a specific resource through settlements
- Analyze opponent placement to avoid contested expansion paths
- ALWAYS calculate production value using probability dots (5-6-8-9 are top priority numbers)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-10):
- Build at least one new settlement by turn 10 - expansion is your TOP priority
- Calculate and build along the fastest path to your next settlement location
- Secure missing resources through strategic settlement placement
- Build roads that secure critical expansion paths before the opponent blocks them
- Avoid development cards completely until you have at least 3 total settlements
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1) to complete critical builds
- Target resource diversity through your expansion locations
- Create a minimum 2-turn expansion plan and stick to it

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT AND PRODUCTION (CORE STRATEGY):
- Early game: Focus on wood/brick to expand with roads and settlements
- Mid game: Transition to ore/wheat focus for cities and development cards
- Calculate the resource production value of every potential build
- Only make 4:1 trades when they enable an immediate important build
- Cycle through "build phases" - expansion phase, then city upgrade phase
- Plan resource collection 2 turns ahead to minimize wasteful trades
- Never accumulate 7+ cards before dice rolls
- Diversify production to minimize dependency on any single resource
- Target a minimum of 4 total settlements before prioritizing city upgrades

COUNTERING ALPHABETA ALGORITHM:
- AlphaBeta looks ahead only 2 steps, so plan your moves 3-4 steps ahead
- Create deceptive game states that appear less threatening than they are
- Block the opponent's highest-probability expansion paths immediately
- Play defensively during early game, then aggressively in mid-game
- When opponent has 7+ points, disrupt their highest-producing hex with the robber
- Track opponent's resources and block their most likely next build
- Secure resources that the opponent depends on heavily
- Place roads to cut off opponent from accessing high-value settlement locations
- Position settlements to deny opponent access to key resource hex intersections

ROBBER PLACEMENT AND KNIGHT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-producing hex of your opponent
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat in mid-game when cities are being built
- Target the specific resource the opponent needs for their next likely build
- Use knight cards reactively when the robber blocks your best production
- Save knight cards for the late game if pursuing largest army
- When stealing, select resources that complete your immediate build needs
- Keep track of opponent cards and target resources they've been collecting
- Balance robber placement between disruption and resource acquisition

DEVELOPMENT CARDS VS. BUILDING:
- Only buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and cannot build
- Buy development cards when you're 1-2 knights away from largest army
- Use knight cards immediately when advantageous (don't save unless close to largest army)
- Victory point cards should only supplement your main strategy, not replace it
- Road Building cards are most valuable when you're cut off or racing to a key location
- Monopoly is best used after high-probability dice rolls to collect opponent's stockpile
- Year of Plenty is ideal to complete a high-value build (settlement or city)
- NEVER delay settlement/city building to purchase development cards unless 1 VP from winning

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY FOCUS):
- Aim for 5 total settlements (2 upgraded to cities) = 9 VP
- Then secure largest army OR longest road for the final point
- Always calculate the fastest path to 10 VP in terms of resource costs
- For each potential build, calculate how many turns closer it gets you to victory
- Determine which victory paths are still viable based on board state
- Switch strategies when your primary path is blocked
- Plan for the end-game by turn 10 (know exactly how you will reach 10 points)
- Track opponent's path to victory and actively disrupt with roads or robber

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Trade at ports even at 4:1 ratio if it enables immediate critical build
- NEVER trade with opponent unless it enables an immediate settlement/city build
- Avoid trades that allow opponent to build immediately after you
- Calculate the net VP gain of each potential trade
- Use trades to dispose of resources when at risk from robber
- Combine multiple port trades to convert unwanted resources into needed ones
- Be willing to overpay through port trades to secure critical positional advantage

DECISION FRAMEWORK (APPLY TO EVERY TURN):
1. What is my immediate build priority? (settlement > city > longest road/largest army)
2. What resource do I need to complete my highest priority build?
3. What is the fastest way to acquire that resource? (production, trading, development cards)
4. How will this action position me for the next 3 turns?
5. Will this action disrupt my opponent's path to victory?
6. Is there a way to combine multiple actions this turn for greater efficiency?

# Game State Analysis

Let me analyze my current situation in this Settlers of Catan game:

## Victory Points
- I have 3 VP from my 3 settlements
- RED has 6 VP (4 VP from 2 cities + 2 VP from longest road)
- I need 7 more VP to win

## My Resources
- 1 BRICK
- 2 SHEEP
- 1 WHEAT
- 3 ORE

## Available Actions
- [0] End turn
- [1] Buy a development card (1 SHEEP, 1 WHEAT, 1 ORE)

## Strategic Assessment

First, let's consider a development card purchase:
- I have exactly the resources needed (1 SHEEP, 1 WHEAT, 1 ORE)
- Development cards could be: Knight (most common), Victory Point, Road Building, Year of Plenty, or Monopoly
- All would be useful, especially Knights (for largest army) or a Victory Point

If I end my turn:
- I preserve my resources
- I'm very close to a city upgrade (need 1 more ORE and 1 more WHEAT)
- With the robber already on RED's wood-8 hex, I've disrupted their production already

Looking at my current plan:
- I wanted to focus on gathering resources for a city upgrade
- I need 1 more ORE and 1 more WHEAT for this upgrade
- However, I currently have 3 ORE, so I only need 1 more WHEAT (not 1 more ORE)

Development card advantages:
- Potential immediate VP
- Knight would give me 3 knights, making me closest to largest army (+2 VP)
- Road Building would help me challenge longest road
- Year of Plenty could get me the WHEAT needed for a city
- Monopoly could potentially give me multiple resources

Looking ahead:
- RED is at 6 points and has strong production despite the robber
- I need to accelerate my point generation

<plan>
Buy a development card with my current resources. This could give me a victory point, a knight (getting me closer to largest army), or a resource card that helps me get the wheat needed for a city upgrade. After this, focus on using my production and potentially the new development card to upgrade one of my settlements to a city for +1 VP.
</plan>

Given my analysis, the best move is to buy a development card. This leverages my current resources optimally and has the potential to accelerate my path to victory either through a direct VP, helping with largest army, or providing utility to complete my city upgrade.

# Game State Analysis

Let me carefully analyze the current game state to make the best decision:

## Current Status
- I (BLUE) have 3 VP (3 settlements)
- RED has 6 VP (2 cities + longest road)
- I have 2🧱BRICK, 1🐑SHEEP, 2⛏️ORE resources
- I have 1 ROAD_BUILDING development card
- I've played 2 KNIGHTs already (need 3 for largest army)

## Available Actions
[0] Play Road Building card - Build two roads for free
[1] Roll the dice

## Strategic Analysis

First, let's consider my current plan:
> Buy a development card with my current resources. This could give me a victory point, a knight (getting me closer to largest army), or a resource card that helps me get the wheat needed for a city upgrade.

Looking at my resources, I have 2🧱BRICK, 1🐑SHEEP, 2⛏️ORE. To buy a development card, I need 1🐑SHEEP, 1🌾WHEAT, 1⛏️ORE. I don't have any wheat, so I cannot buy a development card right now.

To move toward victory, my options are:
1. Upgrade settlements to cities (need ORE and WHEAT)
2. Build more settlements (need all resources)
3. Go for largest army (need more development cards)
4. Go for longest road (need to build more roads)

My current position:
- I have 3 settlements (10, 5, 8) producing brick, sheep, wheat, and ore
- The robber is on the wood hex, blocking my wood production
- I have a Road Building card that could help me expand

Since I cannot immediately build anything with my current resources, I should roll the dice to potentially gather more resources. After rolling, I can potentially use my Road Building card strategically to expand toward new settlement locations or work toward longest road.

<plan>
1. Roll dice to gather resources
2. If I get wheat, consider buying a development card or saving toward a city upgrade
3. Use Road Building card strategically to either:
   a) Extend toward new settlement locations
   b) Work toward longest road to contest RED's bonus
4. Focus on city upgrades as soon as I get wheat and ore
</plan>

Therefore, the optimal action is to:

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist focused on defeating the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRITICAL FOR SUCCESS):
- Above all else, target the highest probability numbers (6 & 8) - these produce resources 5/36 times each
- Strictly prioritize access to all five resources between your two settlements
- Aim for numerical diversity - try to cover 5-6 different dice numbers across your settlements
- Never place initial settlements without analyzing future expansion opportunities
- Prioritize placement on hexes with complementary resources: ore/wheat and brick/wood
- Position roads toward high-value unoccupied areas the opponent cannot easily block
- Choose second settlement to complement your first settlement's resource weaknesses
- Consider 3:1 ports if you can't access a specific resource through settlements
- Analyze opponent placement to avoid contested expansion paths
- ALWAYS calculate production value using probability dots (5-6-8-9 are top priority numbers)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-10):
- Build at least one new settlement by turn 10 - expansion is your TOP priority
- Calculate and build along the fastest path to your next settlement location
- Secure missing resources through strategic settlement placement
- Build roads that secure critical expansion paths before the opponent blocks them
- Avoid development cards completely until you have at least 3 total settlements
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1) to complete critical builds
- Target resource diversity through your expansion locations
- Create a minimum 2-turn expansion plan and stick to it

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT AND PRODUCTION (CORE STRATEGY):
- Early game: Focus on wood/brick to expand with roads and settlements
- Mid game: Transition to ore/wheat focus for cities and development cards
- Calculate the resource production value of every potential build
- Only make 4:1 trades when they enable an immediate important build
- Cycle through "build phases" - expansion phase, then city upgrade phase
- Plan resource collection 2 turns ahead to minimize wasteful trades
- Never accumulate 7+ cards before dice rolls
- Diversify production to minimize dependency on any single resource
- Target a minimum of 4 total settlements before prioritizing city upgrades

COUNTERING ALPHABETA ALGORITHM:
- AlphaBeta looks ahead only 2 steps, so plan your moves 3-4 steps ahead
- Create deceptive game states that appear less threatening than they are
- Block the opponent's highest-probability expansion paths immediately
- Play defensively during early game, then aggressively in mid-game
- When opponent has 7+ points, disrupt their highest-producing hex with the robber
- Track opponent's resources and block their most likely next build
- Secure resources that the opponent depends on heavily
- Place roads to cut off opponent from accessing high-value settlement locations
- Position settlements to deny opponent access to key resource hex intersections

ROBBER PLACEMENT AND KNIGHT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-producing hex of your opponent
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat in mid-game when cities are being built
- Target the specific resource the opponent needs for their next likely build
- Use knight cards reactively when the robber blocks your best production
- Save knight cards for the late game if pursuing largest army
- When stealing, select resources that complete your immediate build needs
- Keep track of opponent cards and target resources they've been collecting
- Balance robber placement between disruption and resource acquisition

DEVELOPMENT CARDS VS. BUILDING:
- Only buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and cannot build
- Buy development cards when you're 1-2 knights away from largest army
- Use knight cards immediately when advantageous (don't save unless close to largest army)
- Victory point cards should only supplement your main strategy, not replace it
- Road Building cards are most valuable when you're cut off or racing to a key location
- Monopoly is best used after high-probability dice rolls to collect opponent's stockpile
- Year of Plenty is ideal to complete a high-value build (settlement or city)
- NEVER delay settlement/city building to purchase development cards unless 1 VP from winning

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY FOCUS):
- Aim for 5 total settlements (2 upgraded to cities) = 9 VP
- Then secure largest army OR longest road for the final point
- Always calculate the fastest path to 10 VP in terms of resource costs
- For each potential build, calculate how many turns closer it gets you to victory
- Determine which victory paths are still viable based on board state
- Switch strategies when your primary path is blocked
- Plan for the end-game by turn 10 (know exactly how you will reach 10 points)
- Track opponent's path to victory and actively disrupt with roads or robber

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Trade at ports even at 4:1 ratio if it enables immediate critical build
- NEVER trade with opponent unless it enables an immediate settlement/city build
- Avoid trades that allow opponent to build immediately after you
- Calculate the net VP gain of each potential trade
- Use trades to dispose of resources when at risk from robber
- Combine multiple port trades to convert unwanted resources into needed ones
- Be willing to overpay through port trades to secure critical positional advantage

DECISION FRAMEWORK (APPLY TO EVERY TURN):
1. What is my immediate build priority? (settlement > city > longest road/largest army)
2. What resource do I need to complete my highest priority build?
3. What is the fastest way to acquire that resource? (production, trading, development cards)
4. How will this action position me for the next 3 turns?
5. Will this action disrupt my opponent's path to victory?
6. Is there a way to combine multiple actions this turn for greater efficiency?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game State Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state to make the optimal decision:

## Victory Point Status
- RED: 6/10 VP (2 cities × 2 VP + longest road bonus 2 VP)
- BLUE (me): 3/10 VP (3 settlements × 1 VP)
- I need 7 more VP to win

## My Resources
- 2 Brick, 1 Sheep, 3 Ore
- 1 Road Building development card

## Board Position Analysis
- I have settlements at nodes 5, 8, and 10
- I have access to Brick, Sheep, Ore, and Wheat, but limited Wood
- RED has two cities on productive spots, including a node that produces Wood on an 8
- The robber is currently on the Wood hex (1,0,-1) with value 8, blocking a key resource

## Available Actions
I can either:
- [0] Play Road Building card to build two free roads
- [1] End my turn

## Strategic Analysis

Playing the Road Building card now has several advantages:
1. I can extend my road network toward future settlement locations
2. I could begin working toward longest road (RED currently has this bonus with 5 segments)
3. Using the card now frees up my future turns to focus on city upgrades
4. I can secure valuable paths before RED blocks them

With 3 ore already, I'm getting close to a city upgrade (3 ore + 2 wheat). If I can upgrade one or two settlements to cities, that would give me 2-4 more VP.

Looking at the board, playing the Road Building card to extend my network is clearly the best option. I can begin positioning for either a new settlement or to contest longest road, which would both accelerate my path to victory.

<plan>
1. Play Road Building card to extend my road network strategically
2. Focus on gathering wheat and ore to upgrade settlements to cities
3. If possible, work toward contesting longest road from RED
4. Target a new settlement location that provides Wood (currently lacking)
5. Continue using knight cards to maintain robber control on RED's productive hexes
</plan>

Based on this analysis, I should:

# Game State Analysis

Let me carefully analyze the current game state:

**Victory points:**
- RED: 6/10 (4 VP from cities, 2 VP from longest road)
- BLUE (me): 3/10 (3 VP from settlements)

**Resources I have:**
- 2 Brick
- 1 Sheep
- 3 Ore
- No Wood (critical limitation)

**Important observations:**
- I'm down 3 VP compared to RED
- I cannot build roads without Wood, which I currently lack
- I have played a Road Building card (allows me to place 2 roads for free)
- My settlements cover Brick, Sheep, Wheat, and Ore, but I lack Wood production
- The robber is currently on the Wood (8) hex, blocking the only Wood production on the board

## Road Building Options Analysis

I need to analyze each road placement option strategically:

**Option 0: Edge (0, 1)**
- Connects toward node 0 which connects to Wood (8) hex
- Could potentially lead to a settlement with Wood access

**Option 1: Edge (0, 20)** 
- Helps connect to node 20 (already occupied by RED's city)
- Not useful for expansion

**Option 2: Edge (10, 11)**
- Extends from my settlement at node 10
- Could lead toward potentially valuable nodes

**Option 3: Edge (2, 9)**
- Connects toward central area
- Could help secure future expansion

**Option 4: Edge (4, 5)**
- Connects from my settlement at node 5
- Doesn't seem to offer immediate strategic advantage

**Option 5: Edge (5, 16)**
- Extends from my settlement at node 5 toward hex producing Wheat (6)
- Could be valuable for future settlement placement

**Option 6: Edge (7, 8)**
- Connects to my settlement at node 8
- Could expand toward valuable locations

## Strategic Decision

Since I can place 2 roads for free due to the Road Building card, I need to choose the most strategic combination. My primary goals should be:

1. Secure access to Wood (my missing resource)
2. Position for future settlement placement
3. Contest longest road from RED

Looking at the board connectivity and my current positions, I believe the most strategic road placements would be:

- Edge (0, 1) - to move toward the Wood hex
- Edge (3, 2) or another strategic edge (however, this isn't listed as an option)

Since I must choose from the available options, and I need to maximize my strategic position:

<plan>
1. Use Road Building card to place roads at edges (0, 1) and (2, 9)
2. Work toward securing a settlement location with Wood access
3. Continue gathering ore/wheat for city upgrades
4. Use port trading if necessary to acquire missing resources
5. Consider development cards if resource conversion isn't possible
</plan>

Based on my analysis, I should choose option:

- Position roads toward high-value unoccupied areas the opponent cannot easily block
- Choose second settlement to complement your first settlement's resource weaknesses
- Consider 3:1 ports if you can't access a specific resource through settlements
- Analyze opponent placement to avoid contested expansion paths
- ALWAYS calculate production value using probability dots (5-6-8-9 are top priority numbers)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-10):
- Build at least one new settlement by turn 10 - expansion is your TOP priority
- Calculate and build along the fastest path to your next settlement location
- Secure missing resources through strategic settlement placement
- Build roads that secure critical expansion paths before the opponent blocks them
- Avoid development cards completely until you have at least 3 total settlements
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1) to complete critical builds
- Target resource diversity through your expansion locations
- Create a minimum 2-turn expansion plan and stick to it

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT AND PRODUCTION (CORE STRATEGY):
- Early game: Focus on wood/brick to expand with roads and settlements
- Mid game: Transition to ore/wheat focus for cities and development cards
- Calculate the resource production value of every potential build
- Only make 4:1 trades when they enable an immediate important build
- Cycle through "build phases" - expansion phase, then city upgrade phase
- Plan resource collection 2 turns ahead to minimize wasteful trades
- Never accumulate 7+ cards before dice rolls
- Diversify production to minimize dependency on any single resource
- Target a minimum of 4 total settlements before prioritizing city upgrades

COUNTERING ALPHABETA ALGORITHM:
- AlphaBeta looks ahead only 2 steps, so plan your moves 3-4 steps ahead
- Create deceptive game states that appear less threatening than they are
- Block the opponent's highest-probability expansion paths immediately
- Play defensively during early game, then aggressively in mid-game
- When opponent has 7+ points, disrupt their highest-producing hex with the robber
- Track opponent's resources and block their most likely next build
- Secure resources that the opponent depends on heavily
- Place roads to cut off opponent from accessing high-value settlement locations
- Position settlements to deny opponent access to key resource hex intersections

ROBBER PLACEMENT AND KNIGHT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-producing hex of your opponent
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat in mid-game when cities are being built
- Target the specific resource the opponent needs for their next likely build
- Use knight cards reactively when the robber blocks your best production
- Save knight cards for the late game if pursuing largest army
- When stealing, select resources that complete your immediate build needs
- Keep track of opponent cards and target resources they've been collecting
- Balance robber placement between disruption and resource acquisition

DEVELOPMENT CARDS VS. BUILDING:
- Only buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and cannot build
- Buy development cards when you're 1-2 knights away from largest army
- Use knight cards immediately when advantageous (don't save unless close to largest army)
- Victory point cards should only supplement your main strategy, not replace it
- Road Building cards are most valuable when you're cut off or racing to a key location
- Monopoly is best used after high-probability dice rolls to collect opponent's stockpile
- Year of Plenty is ideal to complete a high-value build (settlement or city)
- NEVER delay settlement/city building to purchase development cards unless 1 VP from winning

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY FOCUS):
- Aim for 5 total settlements (2 upgraded to cities) = 9 VP
- Then secure largest army OR longest road for the final point
- Always calculate the fastest path to 10 VP in terms of resource costs
- For each potential build, calculate how many turns closer it gets you to victory
- Determine which victory paths are still viable based on board state
- Switch strategies when your primary path is blocked
- Plan for the end-game by turn 10 (know exactly how you will reach 10 points)
- Track opponent's path to victory and actively disrupt with roads or robber

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Trade at ports even at 4:1 ratio if it enables immediate critical build
- NEVER trade with opponent unless it enables an immediate settlement/city build
- Avoid trades that allow opponent to build immediately after you
- Calculate the net VP gain of each potential trade
- Use trades to dispose of resources when at risk from robber
- Combine multiple port trades to convert unwanted resources into needed ones
- Be willing to overpay through port trades to secure critical positional advantage

DECISION FRAMEWORK (APPLY TO EVERY TURN):
1. What is my immediate build priority? (settlement > city > longest road/largest army)
2. What resource do I need to complete my highest priority build?
3. What is the fastest way to acquire that resource? (production, trading, development cards)
4. How will this action position me for the next 3 turns?
5. Will this action disrupt my opponent's path to victory?
6. Is there a way to combine multiple actions this turn for greater efficiency?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 55 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Use Road Building card to place roads at edges (0, 1) and (2, 9)
2. Work toward securing a settlement location with Wood access
3. Continue gathering ore/wheat for city upgrades
4. Use port trading if necessary to acquire missing resources
5. Consider development cards if resource conversion isn't possible

# Game Analysis for Settlers of Catan

I need to carefully analyze my position and determine the optimal road building location to maximize my chances of winning.

## Current Situation Assessment
- I have 3 VP (3 settlements)
- Resources: 2 Brick, 1 Sheep, 3 Ore
- RED has 6 VP (4 from cities, 2 from longest road)
- I'm lacking Wood, which is critical for building roads
- I need to find ways to gather resources and reach 10 VP

## Options Analysis
Let me analyze each road building option:

**[0] Build at edge (0, 20)**
- Connects toward the Wood hex (8)
- Could help access resources I'm currently missing
- Moves toward a potential settlement spot

**[1] Build at edge (10, 11)**
- Extends from my settlement at node 10
- Doesn't immediately access new valuable resources
- Limited strategic value for future growth

**[2] Build at edge (2, 9)**
- Connects from road (0,1) toward the ore/sheep region
- Could enable expansion toward new resource areas
- Potential to eventually contest longest road

**[3] Build at edge (4, 5)**
- This would be redundant since I already have a settlement at node 5
- No strategic value

**[4] Build at edge (5, 16)**
- Extends from my settlement at node 5
- Could lead toward wheat production areas
- Potential for future settlement

**[5] Build at edge (7, 8)**
- Connects to my settlement at node 8
- Doesn't immediately access new resources
- Limited value for expansion

## Strategic Decision
Looking at the options, I need to prioritize:
1. Access to resources I'm lacking (particularly wood)
2. Creating expansion opportunities for new settlements
3. Potential to contest longest road in the future

The most strategic option appears to be option [0] - building a road at edge (0, 20). This road:
- Moves me toward the Wood hex (8), which I currently don't have access to
- Creates potential for a new settlement that could access wood
- Begins a path that could eventually help contest longest road

<plan>
1. Build road at edge (0, 20) to move toward Wood access
2. Continue gathering resources needed for city upgrades (Ore/Wheat)
3. Work toward placing a settlement that gives me Wood access
4. Consider development card purchases if I accumulate excess sheep/wheat/ore
5. Long-term goal: upgrade settlements to cities and contest longest road
</plan>

Therefore, I will choose option [0] to build a road at edge (0, 20).

# Game Analysis for Turn 57

Let me analyze my current situation carefully to determine the best action:

## Current Status Assessment
- I have 3 VP (3 settlements)
- Resources: 2 Brick, 1 Sheep, 1 Wheat, 4 Ore
- RED has 6 VP (2 cities + longest road)
- The robber is on the Wood tile, blocking my potential wood production

## Analysis of Available Options

**Option 0: End Turn**
This wastes my resources and gives no immediate benefit.

**Option 1: Buy Development Card (1 Sheep, 1 Wheat, 1 Ore)**
This would leave me with 2 Brick and 3 Ore. Development cards could give:
- Victory Point (immediate hidden VP)
- Knight (can move robber off wood, helps toward largest army)
- Year of Plenty (get 2 needed resources)
- Monopoly or Road Building (situational value)

**Options 2-5: Maritime Trade**
Trading 4 Ore for another resource:
- Option 2: Get 1 Sheep
- Option 3: Get 1 Brick
- Option 4: Get 1 Wood
- Option 5: Get 1 Wheat

## Strategic Considerations

1. **Path to Victory Analysis**:
   - I need 7 more VP to win
   - Upgrading my 3 settlements to cities would give +3 VP (total 6 VP)
   - Building 2 more settlements would give +2 VP (total 8 VP)
   - Largest army would give +2 VP (I already have 2 knights played)

2. **Resource Production Analysis**:
   - I lack Wood production entirely
   - The robber is blocking the Wood hex
   - I have decent Ore (10), Wheat (4, 6), and Sheep (9) production
   - Limited Brick production (just one 5)

3. **Critical Resource Needs**:
   - Wood is my most critical missing resource
   - Need Ore and Wheat for city upgrades
   - Need Wood and Brick for expansion

Looking at my current plan, I'm working toward building a road to gain Wood access. Since I have 2 Brick already but no Wood, getting Wood should be a priority to enable expansion.

## Decision

I need to adjust my strategy. With 4 Ore, I should either:
1. Buy a development card for potential victory points or knights
2. Trade for Wood to enable expansion

Given that:
- Development cards are a lottery but offer potential immediate benefits
- I already have Brick for road building but lack Wood
- Wood access is critical for my expansion

<plan>
1. Trade for Wood to enable road building toward Wood access
2. Continue gathering resources for expansion and city upgrades
3. Target areas that will give me Wood access
4. Work toward city upgrades when possible
5. Long-term: increase production, upgrade settlements to cities, and acquire more victory points through development cards or longest road
</plan>

The most logical move is to trade for Wood so I can build roads and expand toward Wood-producing hexes.

- Aim for 5 total settlements (2 upgraded to cities) = 9 VP
- Then secure largest army OR longest road for the final point
- Always calculate the fastest path to 10 VP in terms of resource costs
- For each potential build, calculate how many turns closer it gets you to victory
- Determine which victory paths are still viable based on board state
- Switch strategies when your primary path is blocked
- Plan for the end-game by turn 10 (know exactly how you will reach 10 points)
- Track opponent's path to victory and actively disrupt with roads or robber

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Trade at ports even at 4:1 ratio if it enables immediate critical build
- NEVER trade with opponent unless it enables an immediate settlement/city build
- Avoid trades that allow opponent to build immediately after you
- Calculate the net VP gain of each potential trade
- Use trades to dispose of resources when at risk from robber
- Combine multiple port trades to convert unwanted resources into needed ones
- Be willing to overpay through port trades to secure critical positional advantage

DECISION FRAMEWORK (APPLY TO EVERY TURN):
1. What is my immediate build priority? (settlement > city > longest road/largest army)
2. What resource do I need to complete my highest priority build?
3. What is the fastest way to acquire that resource? (production, trading, development cards)
4. How will this action position me for the next 3 turns?
5. Will this action disrupt my opponent's path to victory?
6. Is there a way to combine multiple actions this turn for greater efficiency?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game State Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state and available options:

## Current Position
- I have 3 VP (3 settlements)
- RED has 6 VP (2 cities + Longest Road)
- I have 1 Wood, 2 Brick, 1 Sheep, 1 Wheat
- The robber is on the Wood hex (1,0,-1) which is one of RED's productive hexes
- I have 3 settlements, producing: Sheep, Wheat, Brick, and Ore

## Resource Analysis
- I'm lacking consistent Wood production since the robber is on the Wood hex
- I have the resources to build one road (1 Wood, 1 Brick)
- I need to improve my resource production and expand toward another settlement

## Available Actions
I can build a road at one of 5 locations or end my turn. Let me evaluate each road option:

1. Road at edge (10, 11): Extends from my settlement at node 10
2. Road at edge (2, 9): Connects toward potential settlement spots
3. Road at edge (4, 5): Connects to my settlement at node 5
4. Road at edge (5, 16): Extends from my settlement at node 5
5. Road at edge (7, 8): Connects to my settlement at node 8

## Road Option Evaluation

**Option 1 (10, 11)**: Extends from my brick-producing settlement but doesn't seem to lead toward high-value nodes or resources I need.

**Option 2 (2, 9)**: This road would extend toward nodes connecting to the brick hex and potentially toward better spots. It could help with future expansion.

**Option 3 (4, 5)**: This doesn't make sense as I already have a settlement at node 5.

**Option 4 (5, 16)**: This extends from my productive settlement at node 5 toward node 16, which is on a wheat hex. It could help secure another wheat-producing spot.

**Option 5 (7, 8)**: This doesn't make sense as I already have a settlement at node 8.

## Strategic Decision
Looking at the board layout, option 2 (edge 2, 9) seems most promising as it could help me connect toward nodes that might give me access to wood and other resources. Option 4 (edge 5, 16) is also viable but may not help me secure the diverse resources I need.

<plan>
1. Build road at edge (2, 9) to expand toward potential settlement locations
2. Continue working toward additional settlements to increase production
3. Focus on accessing wood resources which I currently lack
4. Work toward city upgrades when possible
5. Consider development cards for potential largest army or victory points
</plan>

Given this analysis, I'll build a road at edge (2, 9) to expand my network and open up new settlement possibilities.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist focused on defeating the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRITICAL FOR SUCCESS):
- Above all else, target the highest probability numbers (6 & 8) - these produce resources 5/36 times each
- Strictly prioritize access to all five resources between your two settlements
- Aim for numerical diversity - try to cover 5-6 different dice numbers across your settlements
- Never place initial settlements without analyzing future expansion opportunities
- Prioritize placement on hexes with complementary resources: ore/wheat and brick/wood
- Position roads toward high-value unoccupied areas the opponent cannot easily block
- Choose second settlement to complement your first settlement's resource weaknesses
- Consider 3:1 ports if you can't access a specific resource through settlements
- Analyze opponent placement to avoid contested expansion paths
- ALWAYS calculate production value using probability dots (5-6-8-9 are top priority numbers)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-10):
- Build at least one new settlement by turn 10 - expansion is your TOP priority
- Calculate and build along the fastest path to your next settlement location
- Secure missing resources through strategic settlement placement
- Build roads that secure critical expansion paths before the opponent blocks them
- Avoid development cards completely until you have at least 3 total settlements
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1) to complete critical builds
- Target resource diversity through your expansion locations
- Create a minimum 2-turn expansion plan and stick to it

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT AND PRODUCTION (CORE STRATEGY):
- Early game: Focus on wood/brick to expand with roads and settlements
- Mid game: Transition to ore/wheat focus for cities and development cards
- Calculate the resource production value of every potential build
- Only make 4:1 trades when they enable an immediate important build
- Cycle through "build phases" - expansion phase, then city upgrade phase
- Plan resource collection 2 turns ahead to minimize wasteful trades
- Never accumulate 7+ cards before dice rolls
- Diversify production to minimize dependency on any single resource
- Target a minimum of 4 total settlements before prioritizing city upgrades

COUNTERING ALPHABETA ALGORITHM:
- AlphaBeta looks ahead only 2 steps, so plan your moves 3-4 steps ahead
- Create deceptive game states that appear less threatening than they are
- Block the opponent's highest-probability expansion paths immediately
- Play defensively during early game, then aggressively in mid-game
- When opponent has 7+ points, disrupt their highest-producing hex with the robber
- Track opponent's resources and block their most likely next build
- Secure resources that the opponent depends on heavily
- Place roads to cut off opponent from accessing high-value settlement locations
- Position settlements to deny opponent access to key resource hex intersections

ROBBER PLACEMENT AND KNIGHT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-producing hex of your opponent
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat in mid-game when cities are being built
- Target the specific resource the opponent needs for their next likely build
- Use knight cards reactively when the robber blocks your best production
- Save knight cards for the late game if pursuing largest army
- When stealing, select resources that complete your immediate build needs
- Keep track of opponent cards and target resources they've been collecting
- Balance robber placement between disruption and resource acquisition

DEVELOPMENT CARDS VS. BUILDING:
- Only buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and cannot build
- Buy development cards when you're 1-2 knights away from largest army
- Use knight cards immediately when advantageous (don't save unless close to largest army)
- Victory point cards should only supplement your main strategy, not replace it
- Road Building cards are most valuable when you're cut off or racing to a key location
- Monopoly is best used after high-probability dice rolls to collect opponent's stockpile
- Year of Plenty is ideal to complete a high-value build (settlement or city)
- NEVER delay settlement/city building to purchase development cards unless 1 VP from winning

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY FOCUS):
- Aim for 5 total settlements (2 upgraded to cities) = 9 VP
- Then secure largest army OR longest road for the final point
- Always calculate the fastest path to 10 VP in terms of resource costs
- For each potential build, calculate how many turns closer it gets you to victory
- Determine which victory paths are still viable based on board state
- Switch strategies when your primary path is blocked
- Plan for the end-game by turn 10 (know exactly how you will reach 10 points)
- Track opponent's path to victory and actively disrupt with roads or robber

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Trade at ports even at 4:1 ratio if it enables immediate critical build

# Game State Analysis

I need to decide whether to end my turn or buy a development card with my current resources.

## Current Situation Overview
- I have 3 VP (3 settlements)
- Resources: 1 Brick, 1 Sheep, 1 Wheat, 2 Ore
- My opponent has 6 VP (2 cities + longest road)
- I lack access to wood which is limiting my expansion options

## Option Analysis

**Option 0: End Turn**
- This preserves my resources for future turns
- I'll potentially collect more resources next roll
- Wastes an opportunity to make progress this turn

**Option 1: Buy Development Card (1 Sheep, 1 Wheat, 1 Ore)**
- Costs: 1 Sheep + 1 Wheat + 1 Ore
- Leaves me with: 1 Brick, 1 Ore
- Potential benefits:
  - Could get a Victory Point card (immediate +1 VP)
  - Could get a Knight (helps toward Largest Army, +2 VP)
  - Could get Road Building (helps expansion without needing wood)
  - Could get Monopoly or Year of Plenty (utility)

## Strategic Considerations
1. I'm struggling with expansion due to lack of wood
2. I'm behind in victory points (3 vs 6)
3. I have no clear path to build new settlements currently
4. If I don't use my resources now, I risk losing them to a robber roll
5. Development cards provide potential alternate paths to victory
6. I've already played 2 knights, so I'm making progress toward largest army

## Decision Logic
Looking at my current position, buying a development card is the optimal move because:
- It gives me a chance at a victory point or knight (advancing toward largest army)
- It reduces my hand size in case of a "7" roll
- I can't build roads or new settlements without wood anyway
- If I get a Road Building card, it solves my wood shortage problem
- I need to find alternate paths to victory since I'm behind by 3 points

<plan>
1. Buy development card now
2. Continue focusing on obtaining wood through trades or production
3. Use development cards strategically to either:
   - Build toward largest army (with knights)
   - Get immediate victory points
   - Use utility cards to acquire missing resources
4. Target upgrading settlements to cities with my ore production
5. Look for opportunities to break opponent's longest road

# Game State Analysis

Let me analyze my current position and options:

**Current Situation:**
- I have 3 VP (3 settlements)
- Red has 6 VP (4 from cities + 2 from longest road)
- I have 1 🧱BRICK, 1 🐑SHEEP, 1 ⛏️ORE resources
- I have 1 KNIGHT development card unplayed
- Resources are limited, and I have options to roll or play a knight

**Resource Production Analysis:**
- My settlements produce 🐑9, 🌾6, 🌾4, 🧱5, ⛏️10
- The robber is currently on the wheat hex with value 6, blocking one of my best production hexes
- Red's cities produce from high-value hexes (8, 9, 10)

**Strategic Considerations:**
1. Playing the KNIGHT card would:
   - Remove the robber from my wheat hex (value 6)
   - Allow me to place it on Red's 8-value wood hex (their best production)
   - Let me steal a resource from Red (who has 6 cards)
   - Count toward largest army (I would have 3 knights vs 0 for Red)

2. Rolling the dice would:
   - Risk a 7 (which is likely bad with Red holding 6 cards)
   - Potentially produce more resources, but with my wheat hex blocked
   - Delay handling the robber problem

**Decision Logic:**
The knight card provides immediate tactical advantages:
- Unblocks my critical wheat production (value 6)
- Disrupts Red's strong wood production (value 8)
- Likely gives me a useful resource from Red's hand
- Puts me in position to claim largest army (2 VP) with just one more knight

This is clearly better than rolling with my wheat hex blocked.

<plan>
1. Play knight card to unblock wheat and place robber on Red's wood hex
2. Target obtaining more development cards to secure largest army bonus
3. Focus on upgrading settlements to cities with my ore production
4. Consider breaking Red's longest road if opportunity arises
5. Aim to build another settlement in a high-value location
</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist focused on defeating the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRITICAL FOR SUCCESS):
- Above all else, target the highest probability numbers (6 & 8) - these produce resources 5/36 times each
- Strictly prioritize access to all five resources between your two settlements
- Aim for numerical diversity - try to cover 5-6 different dice numbers across your settlements
- Never place initial settlements without analyzing future expansion opportunities
- Prioritize placement on hexes with complementary resources: ore/wheat and brick/wood
- Position roads toward high-value unoccupied areas the opponent cannot easily block
- Choose second settlement to complement your first settlement's resource weaknesses
- Consider 3:1 ports if you can't access a specific resource through settlements
- Analyze opponent placement to avoid contested expansion paths
- ALWAYS calculate production value using probability dots (5-6-8-9 are top priority numbers)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-10):
- Build at least one new settlement by turn 10 - expansion is your TOP priority
- Calculate and build along the fastest path to your next settlement location
- Secure missing resources through strategic settlement placement
- Build roads that secure critical expansion paths before the opponent blocks them
- Avoid development cards completely until you have at least 3 total settlements
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1) to complete critical builds
- Target resource diversity through your expansion locations
- Create a minimum 2-turn expansion plan and stick to it

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT AND PRODUCTION (CORE STRATEGY):
- Early game: Focus on wood/brick to expand with roads and settlements
- Mid game: Transition to ore/wheat focus for cities and development cards
- Calculate the resource production value of every potential build
- Only make 4:1 trades when they enable an immediate important build
- Cycle through "build phases" - expansion phase, then city upgrade phase
- Plan resource collection 2 turns ahead to minimize wasteful trades
- Never accumulate 7+ cards before dice rolls
- Diversify production to minimize dependency on any single resource
- Target a minimum of 4 total settlements before prioritizing city upgrades

COUNTERING ALPHABETA ALGORITHM:
- AlphaBeta looks ahead only 2 steps, so plan your moves 3-4 steps ahead
- Create deceptive game states that appear less threatening than they are
- Block the opponent's highest-probability expansion paths immediately
- Play defensively during early game, then aggressively in mid-game
- When opponent has 7+ points, disrupt their highest-producing hex with the robber
- Track opponent's resources and block their most likely next build
- Secure resources that the opponent depends on heavily
- Place roads to cut off opponent from accessing high-value settlement locations
- Position settlements to deny opponent access to key resource hex intersections

ROBBER PLACEMENT AND KNIGHT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-producing hex of your opponent
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat in mid-game when cities are being built
- Target the specific resource the opponent needs for their next likely build
- Use knight cards reactively when the robber blocks your best production
- Save knight cards for the late game if pursuing largest army
- When stealing, select resources that complete your immediate build needs
- Keep track of opponent cards and target resources they've been collecting
- Balance robber placement between disruption and resource acquisition

DEVELOPMENT CARDS VS. BUILDING:
- Only buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and cannot build
- Buy development cards when you're 1-2 knights away from largest army
- Use knight cards immediately when advantageous (don't save unless close to largest army)
- Victory point cards should only supplement your main strategy, not replace it
- Road Building cards are most valuable when you're cut off or racing to a key location
- Monopoly is best used after high-probability dice rolls to collect opponent's stockpile
- Year of Plenty is ideal to complete a high-value build (settlement or city)
- NEVER delay settlement/city building to purchase development cards unless 1 VP from winning

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY FOCUS):
- Aim for 5 total settlements (2 upgraded to cities) = 9 VP
- Then secure largest army OR longest road for the final point
- Always calculate the fastest path to 10 VP in terms of resource costs
- For each potential build, calculate how many turns closer it gets you to victory
- Determine which victory paths are still viable based on board state
- Switch strategies when your primary path is blocked
- Plan for the end-game by turn 10 (know exactly how you will reach 10 points)
- Track opponent's path to victory and actively disrupt with roads or robber

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Trade at ports even at 4:1 ratio if it enables immediate critical build
- NEVER trade with opponent unless it enables an immediate settlement/city build
- Avoid trades that allow opponent to build immediately after you
- Calculate the net VP gain of each potential trade
- Use trades to dispose of resources when at risk from robber
- Combine multiple port trades to convert unwanted resources into needed ones
- Be willing to overpay through port trades to secure critical positional advantage

DECISION FRAMEWORK (APPLY TO EVERY TURN):
1. What is my immediate build priority? (settlement > city > longest road/largest army)
2. What resource do I need to complete my highest priority build?
3. What is the fastest way to acquire that resource? (production, trading, development cards)
4. How will this action position me for the next 3 turns?
5. Will this action disrupt my opponent's path to victory?
6. Is there a way to combine multiple actions this turn for greater efficiency?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 63 | Player: BLUE | Action: MOVE_ROBBER

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Play knight card to unblock wheat and place robber on Red's wood hex
2. Target obtaining more development cards to secure largest army bonus

Based on this information, which action number do you choose? Think step by step about your options, then put the final action number in a box like \boxed{1}.
RESPONSE:
I'll analyze this move robber scenario carefully and determine the optimal hex to place the robber.

First, let me understand what's happening:
- I currently have 5 VP (3 settlements + largest army bonus)
- Red has 6 VP (2 cities + longest road bonus)
- I need to move the robber and can potentially steal from Red
- The robber is currently on (-1, 1, 0) which is a wheat hex with a 6 value

Let me examine each option:

[0] Move robber to (0, 0, 0) and steal from RED
- This is a sheep hex with value 9 (⭐⭐)
- Red's city at node 1 produces from this hex
- Blocking this would reduce Red's sheep production

[1] Move robber to (1, -1, 0) and steal from RED
- This is an ore hex with value 10 (⭐)
- Red's city at node 1 produces from this hex
- Blocking this would reduce Red's ore production

[2] Move robber to (0, -1, 1)
- This is a brick hex with value 5 (⭐⭐)
- My settlement at node 10 produces from this hex
- Placing robber here would block my own brick production

[3] Move robber to (-1, 0, 1)
- This is a desert hex with no production value
- Placing robber here would be wasteful as it blocks nothing

[4] Move robber to (0, 1, -1) and steal from RED
- This is a wheat hex with value 4 (⭐)
- Red's city at node 20 produces from this hex
- Blocking this would reduce Red's wheat production

[5] Move robber to (1, 0, -1) and steal from RED
- This is a wood hex with value 8 (⭐⭐⭐)
- Both of Red's cities (nodes 1 and 20) produce from this hex
- This is Red's highest-value resource hex

My strategic thinking:
1. I should not block my own resources, so option [2] is out
2. Option [3] wastes the robber on desert, which has no impact
3. Among the options to block Red, I should prioritize:
   - Highest production value
   - Resources Red needs most
   - Resources that produce for multiple buildings

Option [5] is clearly the strongest choice as:
- Wood has high production value (8 = ⭐⭐⭐)
- It blocks both of Red's cities, meaning double impact
- Wood is critical for road building, which could help Red extend their longest road

<plan>
1. Move robber to Red's wood hex to severely hamper their production
2. Continue focusing on development cards to maintain largest army 
3. Look to build a city with my ore production
4. Consider breaking Red's longest road if the opportunity arises
5. Build another settlement in a high-value location when resources allow

# Analysis of Current Game State

## Victory Point Assessment
- I'm at 5/10 points (3 settlements = 3 points, largest army = 2 points)
- Opponent is at 6/10 points (2 cities = 4 points, longest road = 2 points)
- I'm 1 point behind, but need 5 more points to win

## Resource Assessment
I currently have:
- 2 🧱 Brick
- 1 🐑 Sheep
- 1 🌾 Wheat
- 3 ⛏️ Ore
- No wood

## Production Analysis
I have:
- 🐑9 (2 dots) - decent sheep production
- 🌾6 (3 dots) - excellent wheat production but currently blocked by robber
- 🌾4 (1 dot) - poor wheat production
- 🧱5 (2 dots) - decent brick production
- ⛏️10 (1 dot) - poor ore production
- No wood production at all

## Available Actions
I only have two options:
1. Buy a development card (I have exactly the required resources: 1 sheep, 1 wheat, 1 ore)
2. End my turn

## Strategic Decision Analysis
Buying a development card could yield:
- Victory point card (25% chance): Would bring me to 6/10 points, tying with opponent
- Knight (40% chance): Would extend my largest army lead and allow me to move the robber off my wheat hex
- Road building (20% chance): Valuable since I need roads and have brick
- Year of Plenty (10% chance): Helpful for gaining missing resources
- Monopoly (5% chance): Could be game-changing later

Ending my turn with my resources:
- Keeps 2 brick, 1 sheep, 1 wheat, and 3 ore for next turn
- Risks losing resources to a 7 roll (I have 7 cards)
- Will allow me to build a city next turn if I get 1 more ore and 1 more wheat

The robber is currently on my best production hex (wheat 6), and buying a development card gives me a 40% chance of drawing a knight to remove it.

<plan>
1. Buy a development card now to potentially get a knight or VP
2. Next turn, either play the knight if obtained to unblock wheat production, or work toward city upgrade (need 1 more wheat and 1 more ore)
3. Continue development card strategy to solidify largest army advantage
4. Look to expand toward better wood production
5. Plan to eventually break opponent's longest road
</plan>

I'll buy a development card for three key reasons:
1. I have 7 cards, risking loss to robber
2. 40% chance for knight to unblock my wheat production
3. 25% chance for immediate VP

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist focused on defeating the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRITICAL FOR SUCCESS):
- Above all else, target the highest probability numbers (6 & 8) - these produce resources 5/36 times each
- Strictly prioritize access to all five resources between your two settlements
- Aim for numerical diversity - try to cover 5-6 different dice numbers across your settlements
- Never place initial settlements without analyzing future expansion opportunities
- Prioritize placement on hexes with complementary resources: ore/wheat and brick/wood
- Position roads toward high-value unoccupied areas the opponent cannot easily block
- Choose second settlement to complement your first settlement's resource weaknesses
- Consider 3:1 ports if you can't access a specific resource through settlements
- Analyze opponent placement to avoid contested expansion paths
- ALWAYS calculate production value using probability dots (5-6-8-9 are top priority numbers)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-10):
- Build at least one new settlement by turn 10 - expansion is your TOP priority
- Calculate and build along the fastest path to your next settlement location
- Secure missing resources through strategic settlement placement
- Build roads that secure critical expansion paths before the opponent blocks them
- Avoid development cards completely until you have at least 3 total settlements
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1) to complete critical builds
- Target resource diversity through your expansion locations
- Create a minimum 2-turn expansion plan and stick to it

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT AND PRODUCTION (CORE STRATEGY):
- Early game: Focus on wood/brick to expand with roads and settlements
- Mid game: Transition to ore/wheat focus for cities and development cards
- Calculate the resource production value of every potential build
- Only make 4:1 trades when they enable an immediate important build
- Cycle through "build phases" - expansion phase, then city upgrade phase
- Plan resource collection 2 turns ahead to minimize wasteful trades
- Never accumulate 7+ cards before dice rolls
- Diversify production to minimize dependency on any single resource
- Target a minimum of 4 total settlements before prioritizing city upgrades

COUNTERING ALPHABETA ALGORITHM:
- AlphaBeta looks ahead only 2 steps, so plan your moves 3-4 steps ahead
- Create deceptive game states that appear less threatening than they are
- Block the opponent's highest-probability expansion paths immediately
- Play defensively during early game, then aggressively in mid-game
- When opponent has 7+ points, disrupt their highest-producing hex with the robber
- Track opponent's resources and block their most likely next build
- Secure resources that the opponent depends on heavily
- Place roads to cut off opponent from accessing high-value settlement locations
- Position settlements to deny opponent access to key resource hex intersections

ROBBER PLACEMENT AND KNIGHT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-producing hex of your opponent
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat in mid-game when cities are being built
- Target the specific resource the opponent needs for their next likely build
- Use knight cards reactively when the robber blocks your best production
- Save knight cards for the late game if pursuing largest army
- When stealing, select resources that complete your immediate build needs
- Keep track of opponent cards and target resources they've been collecting
- Balance robber placement between disruption and resource acquisition

DEVELOPMENT CARDS VS. BUILDING:
- Only buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and cannot build
- Buy development cards when you're 1-2 knights away from largest army
- Use knight cards immediately when advantageous (don't save unless close to largest army)
- Victory point cards should only supplement your main strategy, not replace it
- Road Building cards are most valuable when you're cut off or racing to a key location
- Monopoly is best used after high-probability dice rolls to collect opponent's stockpile
- Year of Plenty is ideal to complete a high-value build (settlement or city)
- NEVER delay settlement/city building to purchase development cards unless 1 VP from winning

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY FOCUS):
- Aim for 5 total settlements (2 upgraded to cities) = 9 VP
- Then secure largest army OR longest road for the final point
- Always calculate the fastest path to 10 VP in terms of resource costs
- For each potential build, calculate how many turns closer it gets you to victory
- Determine which victory paths are still viable based on board state
- Switch strategies when your primary path is blocked
- Plan for the end-game by turn 10 (know exactly how you will reach 10 points)
- Track opponent's path to victory and actively disrupt with roads or robber

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Trade at ports even at 4:1 ratio if it enables immediate critical build
- NEVER trade with opponent unless it enables an immediate settlement/city build
- Avoid trades that allow opponent to build immediately after you
- Calculate the net VP gain of each potential trade
- Use trades to dispose of resources when at risk from robber
- Combine multiple port trades to convert unwanted resources into needed ones
- Be willing to overpay through port trades to secure critical positional advantage

DECISION FRAMEWORK (APPLY TO EVERY TURN):
1. What is my immediate build priority? (settlement > city > longest road/largest army)
2. What resource do I need to complete my highest priority build?
3. What is the fastest way to acquire that resource? (production, trading, development cards)
4. How will this action position me for the next 3 turns?
5. Will this action disrupt my opponent's path to victory?
6. Is there a way to combine multiple actions this turn for greater efficiency?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game Analysis

Let me analyze the current state of the game and determine the optimal action.

## Game State Summary
- I have 5 VPs (3 settlements + largest army)
- Opponent has 6 VPs (2 cities + longest road)
- My resources: 2 Brick, 2 Ore
- My development cards: 1 Monopoly card
- Robber is on wheat hex (-1, 1, 0) which is my highest production hex (6 dots)
- I have 3 settlements, no cities yet

## Available Actions
I can either:
- Roll the dice [5]
- Play Monopoly card targeting one resource type [0-4]

## Strategic Considerations

1. **Resource Analysis**:
   - I need more resources to continue my plan
   - My wheat production is currently blocked by the robber
   - The robber blocks my best production hex (wheat 6)

2. **Monopoly Card Value**:
   - Monopoly is most valuable when the opponent has accumulated a specific resource
   - RED has 5 cards in hand, but I don't know what they are
   - Playing Monopoly now means not having it for later when I might know more about RED's hand

3. **Rolling the Dice**:
   - Rolling gives me a chance to collect more resources
   - I need wheat and ore to progress toward a city
   - Rolling preserves my Monopoly card for a more strategic moment

## Decision Logic
Playing Monopoly without knowing which resources RED has accumulated is risky. Since I already have 2 ore and 2 brick, I can't build anything immediately with my current resources, so collecting more through rolling is the better option. The Monopoly card will be more valuable when I have better information about RED's hand or after a particularly productive roll.

<plan>
1. Roll the dice to collect resources
2. If I get wheat, work toward upgrading a settlement to a city (need 3 ore, 2 wheat total)
3. Save the Monopoly card for when I have better information about RED's hand
4. Continue development card strategy to maintain largest army advantage
5. Plan to break opponent's longest road in the future
</plan>

The optimal action is to roll the dice.

# Game Analysis for Turn 71

I need to carefully analyze my options to make the optimal move for maximizing my chances of winning.

## Current Game State Assessment
- I currently have 5 VPs (3 settlements + 2 from Largest Army)
- RED has 6 VPs (2 cities + 2 from Longest Road + additional VPs potentially from development cards)
- I have 2 Brick, 2 Ore, and a Monopoly card
- The robber is on wheat at (-1, 1, 0), which blocks one of my wheat production hexes

## Resource Analysis
To win, I need 5 more VPs:
- Upgrading all 3 settlements to cities would give 3 more VPs (needing 9 Ore, 6 Wheat total)
- Building 2 more settlements would give 2 more VPs (needing 2 Wood, 2 Brick, 2 Wheat, 2 Sheep)
- Development cards could provide victory points or knights for maintaining largest army

## Monopoly Card Evaluation
Let's assess each monopoly option:
1. **Wood**: Needed for settlements and roads. RED likely needs this for maintaining longest road.
2. **Brick**: I already have 2, needed for settlements and roads.
3. **Sheep**: Needed for settlements and development cards.
4. **Wheat**: Critical resource needed for cities, settlements, and development cards. My production is currently blocked by robber.
5. **Ore**: I already have 2, needed primarily for cities and development cards.

RED has 9 hidden cards. Given they have 2 cities (one on a wood hex with value 8), they likely have been collecting wood efficiently. With their longest road, they may be stockpiling brick and wood.

Wheat is critical for my strategy since I need it for settlements and city upgrades, and one of my wheat hexes is blocked by the robber. However, RED doesn't have settlements on wheat hexes, so they may not have much.

Ore is valuable for cities, which is my main path to victory. RED has a settlement on ore, so they might have collected some.

## Strategic Decision
Playing the Monopoly card now is strategic since:
1. RED has 9 cards - this is a large hand and likely has resources I need
2. I should focus on city upgrades (ore/wheat) for the fastest path to victory
3. Ore seems most valuable for my immediate goal of upgrading settlements to cities

<plan>
1. Use Monopoly to collect ore from RED
2. Work toward upgrading settlements to cities (need 9 ore, 6 wheat total)
3. Maintain largest army advantage
4. In future turns, try to break opponent's longest road
5. Build cities as priority over new settlements
</plan>

Based on this analysis, I'll play the Monopoly card to collect all ORE from other players, which should help me work toward city upgrades.

- Road Building cards are most valuable when you're cut off or racing to a key location
- Monopoly is best used after high-probability dice rolls to collect opponent's stockpile
- Year of Plenty is ideal to complete a high-value build (settlement or city)
- NEVER delay settlement/city building to purchase development cards unless 1 VP from winning

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY FOCUS):
- Aim for 5 total settlements (2 upgraded to cities) = 9 VP
- Then secure largest army OR longest road for the final point
- Always calculate the fastest path to 10 VP in terms of resource costs
- For each potential build, calculate how many turns closer it gets you to victory
- Determine which victory paths are still viable based on board state
- Switch strategies when your primary path is blocked
- Plan for the end-game by turn 10 (know exactly how you will reach 10 points)
- Track opponent's path to victory and actively disrupt with roads or robber

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Trade at ports even at 4:1 ratio if it enables immediate critical build
- NEVER trade with opponent unless it enables an immediate settlement/city build
- Avoid trades that allow opponent to build immediately after you
- Calculate the net VP gain of each potential trade
- Use trades to dispose of resources when at risk from robber
- Combine multiple port trades to convert unwanted resources into needed ones
- Be willing to overpay through port trades to secure critical positional advantage

DECISION FRAMEWORK (APPLY TO EVERY TURN):
1. What is my immediate build priority? (settlement > city > longest road/largest army)
2. What resource do I need to complete my highest priority build?
3. What is the fastest way to acquire that resource? (production, trading, development cards)
4. How will this action position me for the next 3 turns?
5. Will this action disrupt my opponent's path to victory?
6. Is there a way to combine multiple actions this turn for greater efficiency?

- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game Analysis for Turn 71

Let me analyze the current game state and determine the optimal action.

## Current Situation
- I have 5 VP: 3 settlements (3 VP) + Largest Army (2 VP)
- RED has 6 VP: 2 cities (4 VP) + Longest Road (2 VP)
- I have 2 BRICK and 5 ORE
- The robber is on the wheat hex (-1, 1, 0), blocking one of my wheat productions
- Available actions: End turn or maritime trade options

## Resource Assessment
What do I need for my next build?
- City upgrade: 3 ORE + 2 WHEAT (I have 5 ORE but no WHEAT)
- Settlement: 1 BRICK + 1 WOOD + 1 WHEAT + 1 SHEEP (I have 2 BRICK but lack the others)
- Development card: 1 ORE + 1 WHEAT + 1 SHEEP (I have 1 ORE but no WHEAT or SHEEP)

## Strategic Options
1. **End turn**: Preserve my 5 ORE and 2 BRICK for future builds
2. **Trade for WHEAT**: Convert 4 ORE to 1 WHEAT, getting closer to a city upgrade
3. **Trade for other resources**: Less optimal given my current build priorities

## Decision Making
Given my current plan to focus on city upgrades, trading for WHEAT seems logical. However, I have 5 ORE and need 3 for a city. If I trade 4 ORE for 1 WHEAT, I'll be left with just 1 ORE and 1 WHEAT, still needing 2 more ORE and 1 more WHEAT for a city.

If I end my turn, I maintain my 5 ORE, which is a significant portion of what I need for a city. I'll need to collect 2 WHEAT through dice rolls or future trades. Given my settlement on node 5 has access to two wheat hexes (though one is currently blocked by the robber), I have a reasonable chance of collecting wheat in upcoming turns.

<plan>
1. Preserve ORE for city upgrades (need 9 total for 3 cities)
2. Collect WHEAT through dice rolls for city upgrades (need 6 total)
3. Consider moving the robber off my wheat hex when I play my next knight
4. Work toward breaking opponent's longest road when possible
5. Prioritize city upgrades over new settlements
</plan>

The most strategic choice is to end my turn, preserving my valuable ORE stockpile that's crucial for my city upgrade strategy.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist focused on defeating the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRITICAL FOR SUCCESS):
- Above all else, target the highest probability numbers (6 & 8) - these produce resources 5/36 times each
- Strictly prioritize access to all five resources between your two settlements
- Aim for numerical diversity - try to cover 5-6 different dice numbers across your settlements
- Never place initial settlements without analyzing future expansion opportunities
- Prioritize placement on hexes with complementary resources: ore/wheat and brick/wood
- Position roads toward high-value unoccupied areas the opponent cannot easily block
- Choose second settlement to complement your first settlement's resource weaknesses
- Consider 3:1 ports if you can't access a specific resource through settlements
- Analyze opponent placement to avoid contested expansion paths
- ALWAYS calculate production value using probability dots (5-6-8-9 are top priority numbers)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-10):
- Build at least one new settlement by turn 10 - expansion is your TOP priority
- Calculate and build along the fastest path to your next settlement location
- Secure missing resources through strategic settlement placement
- Build roads that secure critical expansion paths before the opponent blocks them
- Avoid development cards completely until you have at least 3 total settlements
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1) to complete critical builds
- Target resource diversity through your expansion locations
- Create a minimum 2-turn expansion plan and stick to it

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT AND PRODUCTION (CORE STRATEGY):
- Early game: Focus on wood/brick to expand with roads and settlements
- Mid game: Transition to ore/wheat focus for cities and development cards
- Calculate the resource production value of every potential build
- Only make 4:1 trades when they enable an immediate important build
- Cycle through "build phases" - expansion phase, then city upgrade phase
- Plan resource collection 2 turns ahead to minimize wasteful trades
- Never accumulate 7+ cards before dice rolls
- Diversify production to minimize dependency on any single resource
- Target a minimum of 4 total settlements before prioritizing city upgrades

COUNTERING ALPHABETA ALGORITHM:
- AlphaBeta looks ahead only 2 steps, so plan your moves 3-4 steps ahead
- Create deceptive game states that appear less threatening than they are
- Block the opponent's highest-probability expansion paths immediately
- Play defensively during early game, then aggressively in mid-game
- When opponent has 7+ points, disrupt their highest-producing hex with the robber
- Track opponent's resources and block their most likely next build
- Secure resources that the opponent depends on heavily
- Place roads to cut off opponent from accessing high-value settlement locations
- Position settlements to deny opponent access to key resource hex intersections

ROBBER PLACEMENT AND KNIGHT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-producing hex of your opponent
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat in mid-game when cities are being built
- Target the specific resource the opponent needs for their next likely build
- Use knight cards reactively when the robber blocks your best production
- Save knight cards for the late game if pursuing largest army
- When stealing, select resources that complete your immediate build needs
- Keep track of opponent cards and target resources they've been collecting
- Balance robber placement between disruption and resource acquisition

DEVELOPMENT CARDS VS. BUILDING:
- Only buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and cannot build
- Buy development cards when you're 1-2 knights away from largest army
- Use knight cards immediately when advantageous (don't save unless close to largest army)
- Victory point cards should only supplement your main strategy, not replace it
- Road Building cards are most valuable when you're cut off or racing to a key location
- Monopoly is best used after high-probability dice rolls to collect opponent's stockpile
- Year of Plenty is ideal to complete a high-value build (settlement or city)
- NEVER delay settlement/city building to purchase development cards unless 1 VP from winning

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY FOCUS):
- Aim for 5 total settlements (2 upgraded to cities) = 9 VP
- Then secure largest army OR longest road for the final point
- Always calculate the fastest path to 10 VP in terms of resource costs
- For each potential build, calculate how many turns closer it gets you to victory
- Determine which victory paths are still viable based on board state
- Switch strategies when your primary path is blocked
- Plan for the end-game by turn 10 (know exactly how you will reach 10 points)
- Track opponent's path to victory and actively disrupt with roads or robber

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Trade at ports even at 4:1 ratio if it enables immediate critical build
- NEVER trade with opponent unless it enables an immediate settlement/city build
- Avoid trades that allow opponent to build immediately after you
- Calculate the net VP gain of each potential trade
- Use trades to dispose of resources when at risk from robber
- Combine multiple port trades to convert unwanted resources into needed ones
- Be willing to overpay through port trades to secure critical positional advantage

DECISION FRAMEWORK (APPLY TO EVERY TURN):
1. What is my immediate build priority? (settlement > city > longest road/largest army)
2. What resource do I need to complete my highest priority build?
3. What is the fastest way to acquire that resource? (production, trading, development cards)
4. How will this action position me for the next 3 turns?

# Game Analysis for Settlers of Catan

Let me analyze the current game state and determine the optimal move:

## Current Status Assessment
- **Victory Points**: I have 5/10 VPs (3 settlements + largest army bonus)
- **Resources**: 3 🧱BRICK, 1 🐑SHEEP, 5 ⛏️ORE, and no WHEAT or WOOD
- **Opponent**: RED has 7/10 VPs (1 settlement, 2 cities, longest road bonus)
- I need 5 more points to win, which could come from:
  - Upgrading my 3 settlements to cities (6 more points, but only need 5)
  - Each city upgrade costs 3 ORE + 2 WHEAT

## Resource Analysis
- I have 5 ORE, which is enough for 1 city upgrade but missing the WHEAT
- My settlements produce BRICK, SHEEP, ORE, and WHEAT, but not WOOD
- The robber is on my WHEAT hex (-1, 1, 0), blocking my best WHEAT production
- I cannot build a city this turn due to lack of WHEAT

## Available Actions Assessment
1. End turn without action
2. Maritime trades (4:1) to convert ORE to other resources

## Strategic Considerations
- I need to focus on city upgrades as per my plan
- Each city requires 3 ORE + 2 WHEAT
- My opponent is 3 points away from winning (7/10)
- Trading 4 ORE for 1 WHEAT would allow me to be closer to a city upgrade
- I'm producing WHEAT at node 5 when the robber isn't blocking
- The robber is currently on my WHEAT hex, limiting my WHEAT production

<plan>
1. Trade for WHEAT to prepare for city upgrades (need wheat urgently)
2. Upgrade settlements to cities on next turns (need 3 total for victory)
3. Move the robber off my wheat hex when I play my next knight
4. Focus on city upgrades rather than new settlements or development cards
5. Look for opportunities to break opponent's longest road when possible
</plan>

Given my current resources and need for WHEAT to upgrade cities, the optimal move is to trade 4 ORE for 1 WHEAT. This will position me to potentially build a city on my next turn if I get another WHEAT through production.

# Game Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state and my available options.

## Victory Points
- RED: 7/10 VP (3 settlements/cities = 5 VP + Longest Road = 2 VP)
- BLUE (me): 5/10 VP (3 settlements = 3 VP + Largest Army = 2 VP)

## My Resources
- 3 BRICK, 1 SHEEP, 1 WHEAT, 1 ORE

## Options
1. Buy a development card (1 SHEEP, 1 WHEAT, 1 ORE)
2. End turn

## Strategic Considerations

My current plan focuses on upgrading settlements to cities. To upgrade a settlement, I need 2 WHEAT and 3 ORE. I currently have 1 WHEAT and 1 ORE, so I'm not able to build a city this turn.

If I buy a development card:
- PROS:
  - Could get a Victory Point card (immediate hidden VP)
  - Could get a Knight to strengthen my Largest Army advantage
  - Could get Year of Plenty to help get resources for a city upgrade
  - Could get Monopoly or Road Building for strategic advantage
- CONS:
  - Uses my only WHEAT and ORE, which I need for city upgrades
  - Delays my primary victory path of upgrading settlements to cities

If I end my turn:
- PROS:
  - Keep my WHEAT and ORE for future city upgrades
  - Will collect more resources on next dice rolls
- CONS:
  - No immediate progress toward victory this turn

Given that RED has 7 VP already, I need to make efficient progress toward 10 VP. My path to victory requires upgrading at least 2 settlements to cities, giving me +2 VP (reaching 7 VP total). Then I would need either another city upgrade or another development card VP.

Looking at my production:
- The robber is on my WHEAT hex (-1,1,0) which is a 6 (high probability)
- I have limited ORE production (just one settlement on a 10)

<plan>
1. Save my WHEAT and ORE for city upgrade
2. Work on getting the robber off my wheat hex
3. Focus on producing/trading for more ORE and WHEAT for city upgrades
4. Maintain largest army advantage
5. Aim for 3 cities total to reach 10 VP (with largest army bonus)
</plan>

Since buying a development card would delay my main path to victory by using my crucial city-building resources, I should end my turn and continue collecting resources.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist focused on defeating the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRITICAL FOR SUCCESS):
- Above all else, target the highest probability numbers (6 & 8) - these produce resources 5/36 times each
- Strictly prioritize access to all five resources between your two settlements
- Aim for numerical diversity - try to cover 5-6 different dice numbers across your settlements
- Never place initial settlements without analyzing future expansion opportunities
- Prioritize placement on hexes with complementary resources: ore/wheat and brick/wood
- Position roads toward high-value unoccupied areas the opponent cannot easily block
- Choose second settlement to complement your first settlement's resource weaknesses
- Consider 3:1 ports if you can't access a specific resource through settlements
- Analyze opponent placement to avoid contested expansion paths
- ALWAYS calculate production value using probability dots (5-6-8-9 are top priority numbers)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-10):
- Build at least one new settlement by turn 10 - expansion is your TOP priority
- Calculate and build along the fastest path to your next settlement location
- Secure missing resources through strategic settlement placement
- Build roads that secure critical expansion paths before the opponent blocks them
- Avoid development cards completely until you have at least 3 total settlements
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1) to complete critical builds
- Target resource diversity through your expansion locations
- Create a minimum 2-turn expansion plan and stick to it

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT AND PRODUCTION (CORE STRATEGY):
- Early game: Focus on wood/brick to expand with roads and settlements
- Mid game: Transition to ore/wheat focus for cities and development cards
- Calculate the resource production value of every potential build
- Only make 4:1 trades when they enable an immediate important build
- Cycle through "build phases" - expansion phase, then city upgrade phase
- Plan resource collection 2 turns ahead to minimize wasteful trades
- Never accumulate 7+ cards before dice rolls
- Diversify production to minimize dependency on any single resource
- Target a minimum of 4 total settlements before prioritizing city upgrades

COUNTERING ALPHABETA ALGORITHM:
- AlphaBeta looks ahead only 2 steps, so plan your moves 3-4 steps ahead
- Create deceptive game states that appear less threatening than they are
- Block the opponent's highest-probability expansion paths immediately
- Play defensively during early game, then aggressively in mid-game
- When opponent has 7+ points, disrupt their highest-producing hex with the robber
- Track opponent's resources and block their most likely next build
- Secure resources that the opponent depends on heavily
- Place roads to cut off opponent from accessing high-value settlement locations
- Position settlements to deny opponent access to key resource hex intersections

ROBBER PLACEMENT AND KNIGHT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-producing hex of your opponent
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat in mid-game when cities are being built
- Target the specific resource the opponent needs for their next likely build
- Use knight cards reactively when the robber blocks your best production
- Save knight cards for the late game if pursuing largest army
- When stealing, select resources that complete your immediate build needs
- Keep track of opponent cards and target resources they've been collecting
- Balance robber placement between disruption and resource acquisition

DEVELOPMENT CARDS VS. BUILDING:
- Only buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and cannot build
- Buy development cards when you're 1-2 knights away from largest army
- Use knight cards immediately when advantageous (don't save unless close to largest army)
- Victory point cards should only supplement your main strategy, not replace it
- Road Building cards are most valuable when you're cut off or racing to a key location
- Monopoly is best used after high-probability dice rolls to collect opponent's stockpile
- Year of Plenty is ideal to complete a high-value build (settlement or city)
- NEVER delay settlement/city building to purchase development cards unless 1 VP from winning

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY FOCUS):
- Aim for 5 total settlements (2 upgraded to cities) = 9 VP
- Then secure largest army OR longest road for the final point
- Always calculate the fastest path to 10 VP in terms of resource costs
- For each potential build, calculate how many turns closer it gets you to victory
- Determine which victory paths are still viable based on board state
- Switch strategies when your primary path is blocked
- Plan for the end-game by turn 10 (know exactly how you will reach 10 points)
- Track opponent's path to victory and actively disrupt with roads or robber

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Trade at ports even at 4:1 ratio if it enables immediate critical build
- NEVER trade with opponent unless it enables an immediate settlement/city build
- Avoid trades that allow opponent to build immediately after you
- Calculate the net VP gain of each potential trade
- Use trades to dispose of resources when at risk from robber
- Combine multiple port trades to convert unwanted resources into needed ones
- Be willing to overpay through port trades to secure critical positional advantage

DECISION FRAMEWORK (APPLY TO EVERY TURN):
1. What is my immediate build priority? (settlement > city > longest road/largest army)
2. What resource do I need to complete my highest priority build?
3. What is the fastest way to acquire that resource? (production, trading, development cards)
4. How will this action position me for the next 3 turns?
5. Will this action disrupt my opponent's path to victory?
6. Is there a way to combine multiple actions this turn for greater efficiency?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

RESPONSE:
I'll analyze the current game state and make the best strategic decision.

## Game State Assessment

- I have 5 VP total: 3 settlements (3 VP) + Largest Army (2 VP)
- My resources: 3 🧱BRICK, 2 🐑SHEEP, 1 🌾WHEAT, 1 ⛏️ORE
- RED has 7 VP: 1 settlement (1 VP) + 2 cities (4 VP) + Longest Road (2 VP)
- The robber is on my wheat hex (-1, 1, 0), blocking my most valuable number (6)

## Available Options

1. [0] End Turn - This means doing nothing this turn
2. [1] Buy Development Card (costs 1 🐑SHEEP, 1 🌾WHEAT, 1 ⛏️ORE)

## Strategic Analysis

My current plan focused on upgrading settlements to cities to reach 10 VP (with largest army). However, I need to evaluate if buying a development card is better than saving resources.

To upgrade a settlement to a city requires 2 🌾WHEAT and 3 ⛏️ORE. I only have 1 WHEAT and 1 ORE currently, so I'm not close to a city upgrade this turn.

Buying a development card could provide:
- Victory Point card (25% chance) - Gets me directly closer to victory
- Knight card (14/19 remaining cards) - Strengthens my largest army advantage and can move the robber
- Year of Plenty - Could help me get needed WHEAT and ORE
- Road Building - Less valuable now as I'm focused on city upgrades
- Monopoly - Already played one, another could be useful

The robber is currently on my wheat hex, which is a 6 (high probability). Moving it would be advantageous.

RED is 2 knights away from potentially taking my largest army bonus, which would be a 4-point swing.

<plan>
1. Buy development card this turn, hoping for VP or Knight
2. If Knight, use it to move robber off my wheat hex
3. Continue focusing on ORE and WHEAT collection for city upgrades
4. Maintain largest army advantage
5. Aim for 2 city upgrades + largest army to reach 10 VP
</plan>

Given I'm not close to a city upgrade and buying a development card could both protect my largest army advantage and possibly give me a victory point, I should buy a development card.

# Game Analysis for Turn 77

Let me analyze the current game state and my available options carefully.

## Current Game State
- I have 5 VP: 3 settlements (3 VP) + Largest Army (2 VP)
- RED has 7 VP: 1 settlement (1 VP) + 2 cities (4 VP) + Longest Road (2 VP)
- My resources: 4 🧱BRICK, 2 🐑SHEEP
- I have 1 VICTORY_POINT development card
- The robber is on my wheat hex (-1, 1, 0), blocking a key resource

## Strategic Assessment
RED is ahead by 2 VP and needs 3 more to win. I need 5 more VP to reach 10.

My current production is limited:
- 🧱BRICK from node 10 (5 pips)
- 🐑SHEEP from node 5 (9 pips)
- Wheat (6) is blocked by the robber
- Limited ORE (10 pips) from node 8

To reach 10 VP, I need:
1. Upgrade 3 settlements to cities (+3 VP)
2. Keep largest army (+2 VP already counted)
3. Use my victory point card (+1 VP)
= Total 9 VP, so I'll still need one more VP

## Analyzing Available Options
1. End turn without action
2-5. Trade brick for other resources

My key bottleneck resources are ORE and WHEAT for city upgrades.
- For a city upgrade: 3 ORE + 2 WHEAT
- For a development card: 1 ORE + 1 WHEAT + 1 SHEEP

Looking at my current resources (4 BRICK, 2 SHEEP), I cannot build anything significant this turn. The only sensible trade would be for ORE or WHEAT to work toward a city upgrade or development card.

## Decision Process
Upgrading settlements to cities is my best path to victory given my current position. I need to focus on acquiring ORE and WHEAT.

Option [2] - Trading 4 BRICK for 1 ORE would start accumulating resources for a city upgrade, which costs 3 ORE + 2 WHEAT.

Option [4] - Trading 4 BRICK for 1 WHEAT is also viable, but with the robber on my wheat hex, focusing on wheat production next turn is risky.

Moving the robber off my wheat hex should be a priority, which means getting a knight card would be valuable. However, I can't afford a development card this turn.

<plan>
1. Trade brick for ore this turn to begin collecting city upgrade resources
2. Next turn focus on moving the robber off my wheat hex (if I get a knight)
3. Continue building toward city upgrades (need 3 ORE + 2 WHEAT per city)
4. Maintain largest army advantage
5. Aim for 3 city upgrades + largest army + VP card to reach 10 VP
</plan>

Since I cannot build anything immediately and need to start collecting city upgrade resources, trading for ORE makes the most strategic sense.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist focused on defeating the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRITICAL FOR SUCCESS):
- Above all else, target the highest probability numbers (6 & 8) - these produce resources 5/36 times each
- Strictly prioritize access to all five resources between your two settlements
- Aim for numerical diversity - try to cover 5-6 different dice numbers across your settlements
- Never place initial settlements without analyzing future expansion opportunities
- Prioritize placement on hexes with complementary resources: ore/wheat and brick/wood
- Position roads toward high-value unoccupied areas the opponent cannot easily block
- Choose second settlement to complement your first settlement's resource weaknesses
- Consider 3:1 ports if you can't access a specific resource through settlements
- Analyze opponent placement to avoid contested expansion paths
- ALWAYS calculate production value using probability dots (5-6-8-9 are top priority numbers)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-10):
- Build at least one new settlement by turn 10 - expansion is your TOP priority
- Calculate and build along the fastest path to your next settlement location
- Secure missing resources through strategic settlement placement
- Build roads that secure critical expansion paths before the opponent blocks them
- Avoid development cards completely until you have at least 3 total settlements
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1) to complete critical builds
- Target resource diversity through your expansion locations
- Create a minimum 2-turn expansion plan and stick to it

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT AND PRODUCTION (CORE STRATEGY):
- Early game: Focus on wood/brick to expand with roads and settlements
- Mid game: Transition to ore/wheat focus for cities and development cards
- Calculate the resource production value of every potential build
- Only make 4:1 trades when they enable an immediate important build
- Cycle through "build phases" - expansion phase, then city upgrade phase
- Plan resource collection 2 turns ahead to minimize wasteful trades
- Never accumulate 7+ cards before dice rolls
- Diversify production to minimize dependency on any single resource
- Target a minimum of 4 total settlements before prioritizing city upgrades

COUNTERING ALPHABETA ALGORITHM:
- AlphaBeta looks ahead only 2 steps, so plan your moves 3-4 steps ahead
- Create deceptive game states that appear less threatening than they are
- Block the opponent's highest-probability expansion paths immediately
- Play defensively during early game, then aggressively in mid-game
- When opponent has 7+ points, disrupt their highest-producing hex with the robber
- Track opponent's resources and block their most likely next build
- Secure resources that the opponent depends on heavily
- Place roads to cut off opponent from accessing high-value settlement locations
- Position settlements to deny opponent access to key resource hex intersections

ROBBER PLACEMENT AND KNIGHT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-producing hex of your opponent
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat in mid-game when cities are being built
- Target the specific resource the opponent needs for their next likely build
- Use knight cards reactively when the robber blocks your best production
- Save knight cards for the late game if pursuing largest army
- When stealing, select resources that complete your immediate build needs
- Keep track of opponent cards and target resources they've been collecting
- Balance robber placement between disruption and resource acquisition

DEVELOPMENT CARDS VS. BUILDING:
- Only buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and cannot build
- Buy development cards when you're 1-2 knights away from largest army
- Use knight cards immediately when advantageous (don't save unless close to largest army)
- Victory point cards should only supplement your main strategy, not replace it
- Road Building cards are most valuable when you're cut off or racing to a key location
- Monopoly is best used after high-probability dice rolls to collect opponent's stockpile
- Year of Plenty is ideal to complete a high-value build (settlement or city)
- NEVER delay settlement/city building to purchase development cards unless 1 VP from winning

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY FOCUS):
- Aim for 5 total settlements (2 upgraded to cities) = 9 VP
- Then secure largest army OR longest road for the final point
- Always calculate the fastest path to 10 VP in terms of resource costs
- For each potential build, calculate how many turns closer it gets you to victory
- Determine which victory paths are still viable based on board state
- Switch strategies when your primary path is blocked
- Plan for the end-game by turn 10 (know exactly how you will reach 10 points)
- Track opponent's path to victory and actively disrupt with roads or robber

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Trade at ports even at 4:1 ratio if it enables immediate critical build
- NEVER trade with opponent unless it enables an immediate settlement/city build
- Avoid trades that allow opponent to build immediately after you
- Calculate the net VP gain of each potential trade
- Use trades to dispose of resources when at risk from robber
- Combine multiple port trades to convert unwanted resources into needed ones
- Be willing to overpay through port trades to secure critical positional advantage

DECISION FRAMEWORK (APPLY TO EVERY TURN):
1. What is my immediate build priority? (settlement > city > longest road/largest army)
2. What resource do I need to complete my highest priority build?
3. What is the fastest way to acquire that resource? (production, trading, development cards)
4. How will this action position me for the next 3 turns?
5. Will this action disrupt my opponent's path to victory?
6. Is there a way to combine multiple actions this turn for greater efficiency?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Robber Placement Analysis

I need to make a strategic robber placement decision that will disrupt RED's production while potentially gaining a useful resource.

Let me analyze each hex option:

## Option Analysis:
- [0] Move to (0, 0, 0): 🐑9 hex (2 dots) - Hits RED's city at node 1 and settlement at node 3
- [1] Move to (1, -1, 0): ⛏️10 hex (1 dot) - Hits RED's city at node 1
- [2] Move to (0, -1, 1): 🧱5 hex (2 dots) - Hits RED's settlement at node 3
- [3] Move to (-1, 0, 1): 🏜️ Desert hex - No production impact, less valuable
- [4] Move to (0, 1, -1): 🌾4 hex (1 dot) - Hits RED's city at node 20
- [5] Move to (1, 0, -1): 🌲8 hex (3 dots) - Hits BOTH of RED's cities (nodes 1 and 20)

## Strategic Considerations:
1. RED is at 7 VPs and ahead of me, so disruption should be my priority
2. RED likely needs wood, ore, wheat for development or city upgrades
3. Option [5] targets the 🌲8 hex which:
   - Is RED's highest production hex (3 dots = strongest probability)
   - Impacts BOTH of RED's cities at once
   - Denies them access to a critical expansion resource (wood)
4. I need to progress toward city upgrades per my plan (need ore and wheat)
5. RED has 5 hidden cards - there's a good chance they include wood from their strong wood production

<plan>
1. Block RED's wood production (8) to cripple their expansion capacity
2. Trade my brick for ore when possible to begin collecting city upgrade resources
3. Focus on upgrading at least one settlement to a city (need 3 ORE + 2 WHEAT per city)
4. Maintain largest army advantage if development cards become available
5. Final victory path: 3 settlements (3 VP) + 2 city upgrades (+2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + victory point card (1 VP) + possible additional settlement (2 VP) = 10 VP
</plan>

Option [5] is clearly optimal as it blocks RED's strongest production (wood on an 8) which feeds both their cities, significantly hampering their progress while possibly allowing me to steal wood or another resource I need.

❓ Select action by number (0-1):


Based on this information, which action number do you choose? Think step by step about your options, then put the final action number in a box like \boxed{1}.
RESPONSE:
I'll analyze the current game state and evaluate my options step-by-step:

## Current Assessment:
- I have 5 VP (3 settlements + largest army)
- RED has 7 VP (1 settlement + 2 cities + longest road)
- I have 2 BRICK, 3 SHEEP, 1 WHEAT, 1 ORE
- I also have 1 VICTORY_POINT card (which adds 1 VP to my total)
- The robber is currently on RED's wood production (hex 8)
- Available actions: End turn or Buy development card

## Resource Analysis:
- I can buy a development card with 1 SHEEP + 1 WHEAT + 1 ORE
- After buying, I would have 2 BRICK, 2 SHEEP remaining

## Development Card Analysis:
- Possible outcomes from buying a development card:
  - Knight: Would strengthen largest army advantage (already have 3 vs RED's 1)
  - Victory Point: Would give me another hidden VP (currently have 1)
  - Year of Plenty: Would help gather specific resources for my next build
  - Monopoly: Could acquire resources from RED depending on what they're collecting
  - Road Building: Could extend my road network for expansion

## Strategic Considerations:
- RED is 3 VP ahead and already has longest road
- I'm currently restricted in building options this turn
- RED has 7 cards - they may have accumulated resources for their next build
- Buying a development card could potentially get me closer to victory
- RED is only 3 VP from winning, so disrupting their strategy is crucial

## Decision Logic:
Buying a development card is my only build option and offers multiple advantages:
1. Could get me closer to victory (VP card)
2. Could strengthen my largest army advantage (Knight)
3. Could provide utility cards to accelerate future building
4. Prevents me from having too many cards if a 7 is rolled next turn

## Plan Update:
<plan>
1. Buy development card to potentially get closer to victory (VP or Knight)
2. Continue blocking RED's wood production with robber
3. Next turn, focus on upgrading a settlement to a city (need more ORE + WHEAT)
4. Final victory path: 3 settlements (3 VP) + 2 city upgrades (+2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 victory point cards (2 VP) + possible additional settlement (1 VP) = 10 VP
</plan>

- Place roads to cut off opponent from accessing high-value settlement locations
- Position settlements to deny opponent access to key resource hex intersections

ROBBER PLACEMENT AND KNIGHT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-producing hex of your opponent
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat in mid-game when cities are being built
- Target the specific resource the opponent needs for their next likely build
- Use knight cards reactively when the robber blocks your best production
- Save knight cards for the late game if pursuing largest army
- When stealing, select resources that complete your immediate build needs
- Keep track of opponent cards and target resources they've been collecting
- Balance robber placement between disruption and resource acquisition

DEVELOPMENT CARDS VS. BUILDING:
- Only buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and cannot build
- Buy development cards when you're 1-2 knights away from largest army
- Use knight cards immediately when advantageous (don't save unless close to largest army)
- Victory point cards should only supplement your main strategy, not replace it
- Road Building cards are most valuable when you're cut off or racing to a key location
- Monopoly is best used after high-probability dice rolls to collect opponent's stockpile
- Year of Plenty is ideal to complete a high-value build (settlement or city)
- NEVER delay settlement/city building to purchase development cards unless 1 VP from winning

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY FOCUS):
- Aim for 5 total settlements (2 upgraded to cities) = 9 VP
- Then secure largest army OR longest road for the final point
- Always calculate the fastest path to 10 VP in terms of resource costs
- For each potential build, calculate how many turns closer it gets you to victory
- Determine which victory paths are still viable based on board state
- Switch strategies when your primary path is blocked
- Plan for the end-game by turn 10 (know exactly how you will reach 10 points)
- Track opponent's path to victory and actively disrupt with roads or robber

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Trade at ports even at 4:1 ratio if it enables immediate critical build
- NEVER trade with opponent unless it enables an immediate settlement/city build
- Avoid trades that allow opponent to build immediately after you
- Calculate the net VP gain of each potential trade
- Use trades to dispose of resources when at risk from robber
- Combine multiple port trades to convert unwanted resources into needed ones
- Be willing to overpay through port trades to secure critical positional advantage

DECISION FRAMEWORK (APPLY TO EVERY TURN):
1. What is my immediate build priority? (settlement > city > longest road/largest army)
2. What resource do I need to complete my highest priority build?
3. What is the fastest way to acquire that resource? (production, trading, development cards)
4. How will this action position me for the next 3 turns?
5. Will this action disrupt my opponent's path to victory?
6. Is there a way to combine multiple actions this turn for greater efficiency?

- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Buy development card to potentially get closer to victory (VP or Knight)
2. Continue blocking RED's wood production with robber
3. Next turn, focus on upgrading a settlement to a city (need more ORE + WHEAT)
4. Final victory path: 3 settlements (3 VP) + 2 city upgrades (+2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 victory point cards (2 VP) + possible additional settlement (1 VP) = 10 VP

# Game State Analysis

I need to decide between playing a Knight card or rolling the dice. Let me analyze my current position:

## My Current Status
- 5 VP (3 from settlements, 2 from largest army)
- Resources: 2 Brick, 2 Sheep
- Development cards: 1 Knight, 1 Victory Point (worth 1 VP but hidden)
- Robber currently on Desert hex (-1, 0, 1)

## Opponent Status
- 8 VP (2 from settlements, 4 from cities, 2 from longest road)
- Only 2 VP away from winning
- 3 hidden resource cards

## Strategic Considerations

1. **Resource Production**: Rolling would potentially give me new resources for building. With the robber already on the desert (which doesn't produce resources), my production is not blocked.

2. **Knight Card Usage**: Playing the Knight would:
   - Allow me to move the robber to block key RED production
   - Let me steal one of RED's 3 cards
   - Not increase my army size (already have Largest Army with 3 knights)
   - Use a development card that could be saved for a future, possibly more critical turn

3. **Overall Strategy**: My plan mentions blocking RED's wood production, but the robber is on desert right now, not blocking anything. The Wood tile with 8 (high production) is a prime target, as RED has 3 settlements/cities around it.

4. **Risk Assessment**: RED needs only 2 more VP to win. They have 3 cards, which could include resources to build another settlement or development cards.

## Decision Logic

Since I can't build anything with my current resources (2 Brick, 2 Sheep), rolling first makes the most sense. If I roll and get needed resources, I'll have more options next turn. I can still play the Knight card later in my turn if needed.

Playing the Knight now before rolling would waste the opportunity to gain resources first, and doesn't add any strategic advantage.

<plan>
1. Roll to acquire more resources
2. If roll is 7, use robber to block RED's wood (8) production
3. If not 7 and I don't get enough resources to build, consider playing Knight to block RED's wood and potentially steal a useful resource
4. Focus on getting ore and wheat to upgrade a settlement to a city
5. Final victory path: 3 settlements (3 VP) + 2 city upgrades (+2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 victory point cards (2 VP) + possible additional settlement (1 VP) = 10 VP
</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist focused on defeating the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRITICAL FOR SUCCESS):
- Above all else, target the highest probability numbers (6 & 8) - these produce resources 5/36 times each
- Strictly prioritize access to all five resources between your two settlements
- Aim for numerical diversity - try to cover 5-6 different dice numbers across your settlements
- Never place initial settlements without analyzing future expansion opportunities
- Prioritize placement on hexes with complementary resources: ore/wheat and brick/wood
- Position roads toward high-value unoccupied areas the opponent cannot easily block
- Choose second settlement to complement your first settlement's resource weaknesses
- Consider 3:1 ports if you can't access a specific resource through settlements
- Analyze opponent placement to avoid contested expansion paths
- ALWAYS calculate production value using probability dots (5-6-8-9 are top priority numbers)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-10):
- Build at least one new settlement by turn 10 - expansion is your TOP priority
- Calculate and build along the fastest path to your next settlement location
- Secure missing resources through strategic settlement placement
- Build roads that secure critical expansion paths before the opponent blocks them
- Avoid development cards completely until you have at least 3 total settlements
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1) to complete critical builds
- Target resource diversity through your expansion locations
- Create a minimum 2-turn expansion plan and stick to it

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT AND PRODUCTION (CORE STRATEGY):
- Early game: Focus on wood/brick to expand with roads and settlements
- Mid game: Transition to ore/wheat focus for cities and development cards
- Calculate the resource production value of every potential build
- Only make 4:1 trades when they enable an immediate important build
- Cycle through "build phases" - expansion phase, then city upgrade phase
- Plan resource collection 2 turns ahead to minimize wasteful trades
- Never accumulate 7+ cards before dice rolls
- Diversify production to minimize dependency on any single resource
- Target a minimum of 4 total settlements before prioritizing city upgrades

COUNTERING ALPHABETA ALGORITHM:
- AlphaBeta looks ahead only 2 steps, so plan your moves 3-4 steps ahead
- Create deceptive game states that appear less threatening than they are
- Block the opponent's highest-probability expansion paths immediately
- Play defensively during early game, then aggressively in mid-game
- When opponent has 7+ points, disrupt their highest-producing hex with the robber
- Track opponent's resources and block their most likely next build
- Secure resources that the opponent depends on heavily
- Place roads to cut off opponent from accessing high-value settlement locations
- Position settlements to deny opponent access to key resource hex intersections

ROBBER PLACEMENT AND KNIGHT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-producing hex of your opponent
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat in mid-game when cities are being built

# Game Analysis for Settlers of Catan Turn 83

Let me analyze the current game state and my available options:

## Current Game State
- I'm BLUE with 5/10 victory points: 3 settlements (3 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 1 hidden VP card
- RED has 8/10 victory points: 2 settlements (2 VP) + 2 cities (4 VP) + longest road (2 VP)
- RED is only 2 VP away from winning
- I have 2 brick and 2 sheep, plus 1 Knight card and 1 Victory Point card
- The robber is currently on the desert hex (-1, 0, 1), not blocking any production

## Strategy Analysis
RED is close to winning with 8 VP. They need just 2 more points, which they could get by:
1. Building 2 more settlements
2. Upgrading 1 more settlement to a city + playing a VP card
3. Playing 2 VP cards if they have them

Looking at my resources, I can't immediately build anything significant. I have:
- 2 brick and 2 sheep
- A knight card that I could play
- A victory point card (already factored into my strategy)

Playing the knight would:
1. Move the robber to a productive hex for RED
2. Allow me to steal a resource from RED (who has 8 cards)
3. Not change my army size (I already have largest army with 3 knights)

## Decision Logic
Since RED has 8 cards, they likely have resources for their next build. The robber is currently on a desert hex, not hindering anyone's production. RED's strongest production is the wood (8) hex which produces for multiple of their settlements/cities.

Playing the knight is clearly the superior move because:
1. It allows me to block RED's most productive hex (wood on 8)
2. I can steal a resource from RED, potentially disrupting their build plan
3. It doesn't cost me any additional resources
4. If I don't disrupt RED now, they might win on their next turn

<plan>
1. Play knight to block RED's wood production (8) - this is critical since it's their highest production
2. Steal a resource from RED, hopefully ore or wheat they might be saving for a city
3. Continue focusing on getting ore and wheat to upgrade a settlement to a city
4. Victory path: 3 settlements (3 VP) + 2 cities (+2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 victory point cards (2 VP) + possible additional settlement (1 VP) = 10 VP
</plan>

Therefore, my optimal action is to play the knight card.

# Game Analysis for Robber Movement

I need to decide where to place the robber to maximize my advantage while disrupting RED's strategy. Let me analyze each option carefully.

## Current Game State Assessment
- RED has 8 VP (2 settlements, 2 cities, longest road)
- I have 5 VP (3 settlements, largest army, 1 VP card)
- I need to disrupt RED's production as they're close to winning (8/10 VP)
- RED has 8 cards in hand - a significant number

## Robber Placement Options Analysis

[0] Move robber to (0, 0, 0) - Sheep 9
- This blocks 🐑9 which RED produces at node 1 (city) and node 3 (settlement)
- This is a fairly good production tile for RED

[1] Move robber to (1, -1, 0) - Ore 10
- This blocks ⛏️10 which RED produces at node 1 (city) 
- This is a low probability number (10), so not as disruptive

[2] Move robber to (0, -1, 1) - Brick 5
- This blocks 🧱5 which RED produces at node 3 (settlement)
- Brick may not be crucial for RED at this stage as they have longest road already

[3] Move robber to (-1, 1, 0) - Wheat 6
- This blocks 🌾6 but RED doesn't have any settlements on this hex
- Would be wasting my robber move since it doesn't affect RED

[4] Move robber to (0, 1, -1) - Wheat 4
- This blocks 🌾4 which RED produces at node 20 (city)
- Low probability number (4), not highly impactful

[5] Move robber to (1, 0, -1) - Wood 8
- This blocks 🌲8 which RED produces at THREE locations:
  * node 1 (city)
  * node 20 (city) 
  * node 23 (settlement)
- Wood 8 is RED's highest production tile with a high probability (8)
- This is extremely impactful, blocking three settlements/cities at once

## Strategic Decision

Option [5] is clearly the optimal choice for several reasons:
1. It blocks RED's highest-producing hex (Wood 8 - high probability)
2. It disrupts THREE of RED's settlements/cities simultaneously
3. Wood is still valuable in mid-game for roads and settlements
4. RED likely needs wood for their next build with 8 cards in hand

<plan>
1. Move robber to Wood 8 hex (1, 0, -1) to block RED's highest production
2. Steal a resource from RED, hopefully ore or wheat
3. Continue saving for ore and wheat to build a city (need 3 ore, 2 wheat)
4. Victory path: 3 settlements (3 VP) + 1 city (+1 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards (2 VP) + 2 more settlements (2 VP) = 10 VP
</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist focused on defeating the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRITICAL FOR SUCCESS):
- Above all else, target the highest probability numbers (6 & 8) - these produce resources 5/36 times each
- Strictly prioritize access to all five resources between your two settlements
- Aim for numerical diversity - try to cover 5-6 different dice numbers across your settlements
- Never place initial settlements without analyzing future expansion opportunities
- Prioritize placement on hexes with complementary resources: ore/wheat and brick/wood
- Position roads toward high-value unoccupied areas the opponent cannot easily block
- Choose second settlement to complement your first settlement's resource weaknesses
- Consider 3:1 ports if you can't access a specific resource through settlements
- Analyze opponent placement to avoid contested expansion paths
- ALWAYS calculate production value using probability dots (5-6-8-9 are top priority numbers)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-10):
- Build at least one new settlement by turn 10 - expansion is your TOP priority
- Calculate and build along the fastest path to your next settlement location
- Secure missing resources through strategic settlement placement
- Build roads that secure critical expansion paths before the opponent blocks them
- Avoid development cards completely until you have at least 3 total settlements
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1) to complete critical builds
- Target resource diversity through your expansion locations
- Create a minimum 2-turn expansion plan and stick to it

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT AND PRODUCTION (CORE STRATEGY):
- Early game: Focus on wood/brick to expand with roads and settlements
- Mid game: Transition to ore/wheat focus for cities and development cards
- Calculate the resource production value of every potential build
- Only make 4:1 trades when they enable an immediate important build
- Cycle through "build phases" - expansion phase, then city upgrade phase
- Plan resource collection 2 turns ahead to minimize wasteful trades
- Never accumulate 7+ cards before dice rolls
- Diversify production to minimize dependency on any single resource
- Target a minimum of 4 total settlements before prioritizing city upgrades

COUNTERING ALPHABETA ALGORITHM:
- AlphaBeta looks ahead only 2 steps, so plan your moves 3-4 steps ahead
- Create deceptive game states that appear less threatening than they are
- Block the opponent's highest-probability expansion paths immediately
- Play defensively during early game, then aggressively in mid-game
- When opponent has 7+ points, disrupt their highest-producing hex with the robber
- Track opponent's resources and block their most likely next build
- Secure resources that the opponent depends on heavily
- Place roads to cut off opponent from accessing high-value settlement locations
- Position settlements to deny opponent access to key resource hex intersections

ROBBER PLACEMENT AND KNIGHT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-producing hex of your opponent
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat in mid-game when cities are being built
- Target the specific resource the opponent needs for their next likely build
- Use knight cards reactively when the robber blocks your best production
- Save knight cards for the late game if pursuing largest army
- When stealing, select resources that complete your immediate build needs
- Keep track of opponent cards and target resources they've been collecting
- Balance robber placement between disruption and resource acquisition

DEVELOPMENT CARDS VS. BUILDING:
- Only buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and cannot build
- Buy development cards when you're 1-2 knights away from largest army
- Use knight cards immediately when advantageous (don't save unless close to largest army)
- Victory point cards should only supplement your main strategy, not replace it
- Road Building cards are most valuable when you're cut off or racing to a key location
- Monopoly is best used after high-probability dice rolls to collect opponent's stockpile
- Year of Plenty is ideal to complete a high-value build (settlement or city)
- NEVER delay settlement/city building to purchase development cards unless 1 VP from winning

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY FOCUS):
- Aim for 5 total settlements (2 upgraded to cities) = 9 VP
- Then secure largest army OR longest road for the final point
- Always calculate the fastest path to 10 VP in terms of resource costs
- For each potential build, calculate how many turns closer it gets you to victory
- Determine which victory paths are still viable based on board state
- Switch strategies when your primary path is blocked
- Plan for the end-game by turn 10 (know exactly how you will reach 10 points)
- Track opponent's path to victory and actively disrupt with roads or robber

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Trade at ports even at 4:1 ratio if it enables immediate critical build
- NEVER trade with opponent unless it enables an immediate settlement/city build
- Avoid trades that allow opponent to build immediately after you
- Calculate the net VP gain of each potential trade
- Use trades to dispose of resources when at risk from robber
- Combine multiple port trades to convert unwanted resources into needed ones
- Be willing to overpay through port trades to secure critical positional advantage

DECISION FRAMEWORK (APPLY TO EVERY TURN):
1. What is my immediate build priority? (settlement > city > longest road/largest army)
2. What resource do I need to complete my highest priority build?
3. What is the fastest way to acquire that resource? (production, trading, development cards)
4. How will this action position me for the next 3 turns?
5. Will this action disrupt my opponent's path to victory?
6. Is there a way to combine multiple actions this turn for greater efficiency?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 83 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Move robber to Wood 8 hex (1, 0, -1) to block RED's highest production
2. Steal a resource from RED, hopefully ore or wheat
3. Continue saving for ore and wheat to build a city (need 3 ore, 2 wheat)
4. Victory path: 3 settlements (3 VP) + 1 city (+1 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards (2 VP) + 2 more settlements (2 VP) = 10 VP
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.

# Game State Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state to make the optimal decision:

## Victory Points Status
- BLUE (me): 5/10 VP (3 settlements + Largest Army bonus)
- RED: 8/10 VP (2 settlements + 2 cities + Longest Road bonus)

RED is ahead by 3 points and is only 2 points away from winning. This is critical - I need to act quickly.

## Current Resources
I have:
- 1 Wood
- 2 Brick
- 2 Sheep
- 0 Wheat
- 0 Ore
- 1 Victory point card (hidden)

## Possible Actions
I can build a road in one of 4 locations, or end my turn.

## Strategic Assessment

1. **Urgency Level**: Very high. RED is at 8/10 VP and could win soon.

2. **Resource Analysis**: I have enough resources (1 wood, 2 brick) to build one road. Since I have 2 brick, I should use these resources now rather than risk losing them to the robber.

3. **Road Placement Value**:
   - I need to evaluate which road placement provides the best strategic value
   - My current position is weak and I need to establish better access to resources
   - Particularly, I need ore and wheat for cities, which I currently lack

4. **Road Building Options**:
   - Edge (4,5): Connects to node 4, could lead toward access to the empty desert (-1,0,1)
   - Edge (5,16): Connects node 5 (where I have a settlement) to node 16, potentially giving access to wheat hex (-1,1,0)
   - Edge (7,8): Connects to node 7, near the ore hex (1,-1,0)
   - Edge (10,11): Extends from my settlement at node 10, moving toward brick hex (0,-1,1)

5. **Road Value Analysis**:
   - Option [2] (Edge 5,16) seems most valuable - it extends from my existing settlement at node 5 toward wheat production (hex -1,1,0), which I currently lack
   - This could position me for a future settlement with wheat access, a critical resource I need

## Plan Update

<plan>
1. Build road at edge (5,16) to move toward wheat access
2. Focus on gaining ore and wheat next to build cities
3. Continue developing toward node 16/17 to access the wheat hex
4. Convert settlement to city when I have 3 ore, 2 wheat
5. Victory path: 3 settlements (3 VP) + cities (convert existing settlements, +3 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 1 VP card + 1 additional settlement (1 VP) = 10 VP
</plan>

## Final Decision
I should build a road to extend my network toward wheat access, which I critically need. The best option is to build at edge (5,16).

# Initial Settlement Placement Analysis

I need to select the optimal position for my first settlement in this initial placement phase of Catan. This is a critical decision that will significantly impact the entire game.

## Analyzing the Board

First, I'll examine the resource hexes and their numbers:
- 🌾 Wheat (8) - Excellent probability (5/36)
- 🌲 Wood (6) - Excellent probability (5/36)
- 🐑 Sheep (4) - Below average probability (3/36)
- 🧱 Brick (5) - Average probability (4/36)
- ⛏️ Ore (10) - Average probability (3/36)
- 🏜️ Desert - No production, currently has robber

## Settlement Priority Factors
1. Access to high-probability numbers (6 & 8)
2. Resource diversity
3. Future expansion potential
4. Complementary resources (wood/brick for early game, ore/wheat for cities later)

## Node Analysis
Looking at intersections of high-value hexes:
- Node 2: Access to Wheat(8), Wood(6), and Brick(5) - three different resources with excellent numbers
- Node 1: Access to Wood(6), Brick(5), and Ore(10) - three different resources with good diversity
- Node 9: Access to Wheat(8) and Wood(6) - two high-probability resources

Node 2 is clearly the optimal choice as it provides:
1. Access to 3 different resources
2. Two high-probability numbers (8 and 6)
3. A combination of early game resources (wood/brick) and wheat for later city development
4. Strong total probability dots (5+5+4=14 dots)

This position will provide a solid foundation for my initial resource production and sets me up for future expansion with road-building resources (wood/brick).

<plan>
1. Place first settlement at node 2 to access Wheat(8), Wood(6), and Brick(5)
2. For second settlement, target a node with Ore and Sheep access to complete my resource diversity
3. Focus initial roads toward high-value expansion areas
4. Start with roads and settlements for early expansion
5. Transition to city upgrades once I have 3+ settlements
</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist focused on defeating the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRITICAL FOR SUCCESS):
- Above all else, target the highest probability numbers (6 & 8) - these produce resources 5/36 times each
- Strictly prioritize access to all five resources between your two settlements
- Aim for numerical diversity - try to cover 5-6 different dice numbers across your settlements
- Never place initial settlements without analyzing future expansion opportunities
- Prioritize placement on hexes with complementary resources: ore/wheat and brick/wood
- Position roads toward high-value unoccupied areas the opponent cannot easily block
- Choose second settlement to complement your first settlement's resource weaknesses
- Consider 3:1 ports if you can't access a specific resource through settlements
- Analyze opponent placement to avoid contested expansion paths
- ALWAYS calculate production value using probability dots (5-6-8-9 are top priority numbers)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-10):
- Build at least one new settlement by turn 10 - expansion is your TOP priority
- Calculate and build along the fastest path to your next settlement location
- Secure missing resources through strategic settlement placement
- Build roads that secure critical expansion paths before the opponent blocks them
- Avoid development cards completely until you have at least 3 total settlements
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1) to complete critical builds
- Target resource diversity through your expansion locations
- Create a minimum 2-turn expansion plan and stick to it

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT AND PRODUCTION (CORE STRATEGY):
- Early game: Focus on wood/brick to expand with roads and settlements
- Mid game: Transition to ore/wheat focus for cities and development cards
- Calculate the resource production value of every potential build
- Only make 4:1 trades when they enable an immediate important build
- Cycle through "build phases" - expansion phase, then city upgrade phase
- Plan resource collection 2 turns ahead to minimize wasteful trades
- Never accumulate 7+ cards before dice rolls
- Diversify production to minimize dependency on any single resource
- Target a minimum of 4 total settlements before prioritizing city upgrades

COUNTERING ALPHABETA ALGORITHM:
- AlphaBeta looks ahead only 2 steps, so plan your moves 3-4 steps ahead
- Create deceptive game states that appear less threatening than they are
- Block the opponent's highest-probability expansion paths immediately
- Play defensively during early game, then aggressively in mid-game
- When opponent has 7+ points, disrupt their highest-producing hex with the robber
- Track opponent's resources and block their most likely next build
- Secure resources that the opponent depends on heavily
- Place roads to cut off opponent from accessing high-value settlement locations
- Position settlements to deny opponent access to key resource hex intersections

ROBBER PLACEMENT AND KNIGHT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-producing hex of your opponent
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat in mid-game when cities are being built
- Target the specific resource the opponent needs for their next likely build
- Use knight cards reactively when the robber blocks your best production
- Save knight cards for the late game if pursuing largest army
- When stealing, select resources that complete your immediate build needs
- Keep track of opponent cards and target resources they've been collecting
- Balance robber placement between disruption and resource acquisition

DEVELOPMENT CARDS VS. BUILDING:
- Only buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and cannot build
- Buy development cards when you're 1-2 knights away from largest army
- Use knight cards immediately when advantageous (don't save unless close to largest army)
- Victory point cards should only supplement your main strategy, not replace it
- Road Building cards are most valuable when you're cut off or racing to a key location
- Monopoly is best used after high-probability dice rolls to collect opponent's stockpile
- Year of Plenty is ideal to complete a high-value build (settlement or city)
- NEVER delay settlement/city building to purchase development cards unless 1 VP from winning

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY FOCUS):
- Aim for 5 total settlements (2 upgraded to cities) = 9 VP
- Then secure largest army OR longest road for the final point
- Always calculate the fastest path to 10 VP in terms of resource costs
- For each potential build, calculate how many turns closer it gets you to victory
- Determine which victory paths are still viable based on board state
- Switch strategies when your primary path is blocked
- Plan for the end-game by turn 10 (know exactly how you will reach 10 points)
- Track opponent's path to victory and actively disrupt with roads or robber

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Trade at ports even at 4:1 ratio if it enables immediate critical build
- NEVER trade with opponent unless it enables an immediate settlement/city build
- Avoid trades that allow opponent to build immediately after you
- Calculate the net VP gain of each potential trade
- Use trades to dispose of resources when at risk from robber
- Combine multiple port trades to convert unwanted resources into needed ones
- Be willing to overpay through port trades to secure critical positional advantage

DECISION FRAMEWORK (APPLY TO EVERY TURN):
1. What is my immediate build priority? (settlement > city > longest road/largest army)
2. What resource do I need to complete my highest priority build?
3. What is the fastest way to acquire that resource? (production, trading, development cards)
4. How will this action position me for the next 3 turns?
5. Will this action disrupt my opponent's path to victory?
6. Is there a way to combine multiple actions this turn for greater efficiency?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Analyzing Turn 0: Initial Road Placement

I need to carefully consider my first road placement as it will determine my expansion options. This is part of the initial setup phase where I place my first settlement and road.

## Analyzing the Options:
- [0] Road at edge (2, 3): Goes east from my settlement
- [1] Road at edge (2, 9): Goes southwest from my settlement 
- [2] Road at edge (1, 2): Goes northwest from my settlement

## Strategic Considerations:
1. My first settlement at node 2 gives me access to Wheat(8), Wood(6), and Brick(5) - excellent high-probability resources for early expansion.
2. I need to position my road toward where I want to place my second settlement.
3. I should aim for access to the missing resources: Ore and Sheep.

## Analyzing the Board:
- Looking at the visible part of the map, there's a Sheep(4) hex to the west and an Ore(10) hex to the east.
- I should position my road toward potential areas that would give me access to these missing resources.
- Edge (2, 9) heads southwest, which could lead toward the Sheep(4) hex.
- Edge (1, 2) heads northwest, which also might lead toward Sheep access.
- Edge (2, 3) heads east, which could lead toward the Ore(10) hex.

## Expansion Planning:
The best direction would be toward nodes that give me access to my missing resources (Ore and Sheep). Based on the visible map:
- Option [1] (edge 2, 9) moves southwest toward the Sheep(4) hex, which is a good direction for resource diversity.
- Option [2] (edge 1, 2) moves northwest, potentially toward other resource hexes.
- Option [0] (edge 2, 3) moves east toward an area that includes the Ore(10) hex.

Since my second settlement should ideally provide Ore and Sheep, and looking at the visible hexes, I see that heading east with option [0] might give the best path toward the Ore(10) hex, while still keeping options open for my second settlement.

<plan>
1. Place first settlement at node 2 (already done)
2. Build initial road east toward the Ore(10) hex
3. For my second settlement, target a node that gives me access to both Ore and Sheep
4. Focus early game on road building to secure key expansion paths
5. Aim for at least 3 settlements before transitioning to city upgrades
</plan>

# Analyzing Initial Settlement Placement

I need to place my second initial settlement, which will greatly impact my success in the game. Let me analyze the options carefully.

First, let me understand what resources I'm already getting from my first settlement:
- Settlement at node 2: Produces Brick(5), Wood(6), Wheat(8)
- These are excellent numbers with high probability (especially 6 and 8)
- I'm missing Sheep and Ore completely

## Evaluating the Available Nodes

Looking at each available node to understand what resources and probability dots they offer:

Node 0: Connected to Brick(5), Ore(10), and the Desert
- Adds: Ore
- Adds numbers: 10 (low probability)
- Desert hex provides no resources

Node 8: Connected to Wood(6) (already have this)
- No significant new resources

Node 10: Connected to Wheat(8) (already have this)
- No significant new resources

Node 11: Connected to Wheat(8) (already have this)
- No significant new resources

Node 12: Connected to Wheat(8), Sheep(4)
- Adds: Sheep (completing all resources)
- Adds numbers: 4 (low probability)

Node 13: Connected to Sheep(4)
- Adds: Sheep
- Adds numbers: 4 (low probability)

Node 14: Connected to Sheep(4)
- Adds: Sheep
- Adds numbers: 4 (low probability)

Node 16: Connected to Wheat(9), Desert
- Adds: Wheat(9), which I already have as Wheat(8)
- Desert provides no resources

Node 17: Connected to Wheat(9)
- Adds: Wheat(9), which I already have as Wheat(8)

Node 18: Connected to Wheat(9)
- Adds: Wheat(9), which I already have as Wheat(8)

Node 19: Connected to Desert
- Desert provides no resources

Node 20: Connected to Ore(10), Desert
- Adds: Ore
- Adds numbers: 10 (low probability)

Node 21: Connected to Desert
- Desert provides no resources

Node 22: Connected to Ore(10)
- Adds: Ore
- Adds numbers: 10 (low probability)

## Strategic Decision

For my second settlement, I need to prioritize:
1. Getting access to my missing resources (Sheep and Ore)
2. Covering different probability numbers
3. Having good future expansion opportunities

Node 12 stands out because:
- It gives me access to Sheep (4), completing my resource collection
- It gives me access to another Wheat (8) hex, which is a high-probability number
- It's positioned well for future expansion

Node 0 or Node 22 would give me access to Ore, but the Ore(10) has lower probability than ideal.

Based on the INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY guidelines, completing my resource collection is a top priority, and Node 12 accomplishes this while also giving me additional production from the high-value Wheat(8) hex.

<plan>
1. Place second initial settlement at node 12 to gain Sheep access
2. Build roads toward Ore access as my next priority
3. Focus early game on expanding to a settlement with Ore production
4. Then transition to city upgrades once all resources are accessible
</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist focused on defeating the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRITICAL FOR SUCCESS):
- Above all else, target the highest probability numbers (6 & 8) - these produce resources 5/36 times each
- Strictly prioritize access to all five resources between your two settlements
- Aim for numerical diversity - try to cover 5-6 different dice numbers across your settlements
- Never place initial settlements without analyzing future expansion opportunities
- Prioritize placement on hexes with complementary resources: ore/wheat and brick/wood
- Position roads toward high-value unoccupied areas the opponent cannot easily block
- Choose second settlement to complement your first settlement's resource weaknesses
- Consider 3:1 ports if you can't access a specific resource through settlements
- Analyze opponent placement to avoid contested expansion paths
- ALWAYS calculate production value using probability dots (5-6-8-9 are top priority numbers)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-10):
- Build at least one new settlement by turn 10 - expansion is your TOP priority
- Calculate and build along the fastest path to your next settlement location
- Secure missing resources through strategic settlement placement
- Build roads that secure critical expansion paths before the opponent blocks them
- Avoid development cards completely until you have at least 3 total settlements
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1) to complete critical builds
- Target resource diversity through your expansion locations
- Create a minimum 2-turn expansion plan and stick to it

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT AND PRODUCTION (CORE STRATEGY):
- Early game: Focus on wood/brick to expand with roads and settlements
- Mid game: Transition to ore/wheat focus for cities and development cards
- Calculate the resource production value of every potential build
- Only make 4:1 trades when they enable an immediate important build
- Cycle through "build phases" - expansion phase, then city upgrade phase
- Plan resource collection 2 turns ahead to minimize wasteful trades
- Never accumulate 7+ cards before dice rolls
- Diversify production to minimize dependency on any single resource
- Target a minimum of 4 total settlements before prioritizing city upgrades

COUNTERING ALPHABETA ALGORITHM:
- AlphaBeta looks ahead only 2 steps, so plan your moves 3-4 steps ahead
- Create deceptive game states that appear less threatening than they are
- Block the opponent's highest-probability expansion paths immediately
- Play defensively during early game, then aggressively in mid-game
- When opponent has 7+ points, disrupt their highest-producing hex with the robber
- Track opponent's resources and block their most likely next build
- Secure resources that the opponent depends on heavily
- Place roads to cut off opponent from accessing high-value settlement locations
- Position settlements to deny opponent access to key resource hex intersections

ROBBER PLACEMENT AND KNIGHT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-producing hex of your opponent
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat in mid-game when cities are being built
- Target the specific resource the opponent needs for their next likely build
- Use knight cards reactively when the robber blocks your best production
- Save knight cards for the late game if pursuing largest army
- When stealing, select resources that complete your immediate build needs
- Keep track of opponent cards and target resources they've been collecting
- Balance robber placement between disruption and resource acquisition

DEVELOPMENT CARDS VS. BUILDING:
- Only buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and cannot build
- Buy development cards when you're 1-2 knights away from largest army
- Use knight cards immediately when advantageous (don't save unless close to largest army)
- Victory point cards should only supplement your main strategy, not replace it
- Road Building cards are most valuable when you're cut off or racing to a key location
- Monopoly is best used after high-probability dice rolls to collect opponent's stockpile
- Year of Plenty is ideal to complete a high-value build (settlement or city)
- NEVER delay settlement/city building to purchase development cards unless 1 VP from winning

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY FOCUS):
- Aim for 5 total settlements (2 upgraded to cities) = 9 VP
- Then secure largest army OR longest road for the final point
- Always calculate the fastest path to 10 VP in terms of resource costs
- For each potential build, calculate how many turns closer it gets you to victory
- Determine which victory paths are still viable based on board state
- Switch strategies when your primary path is blocked
- Plan for the end-game by turn 10 (know exactly how you will reach 10 points)
- Track opponent's path to victory and actively disrupt with roads or robber

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Trade at ports even at 4:1 ratio if it enables immediate critical build
- NEVER trade with opponent unless it enables an immediate settlement/city build
- Avoid trades that allow opponent to build immediately after you
- Calculate the net VP gain of each potential trade
- Use trades to dispose of resources when at risk from robber
- Combine multiple port trades to convert unwanted resources into needed ones
- Be willing to overpay through port trades to secure critical positional advantage

DECISION FRAMEWORK (APPLY TO EVERY TURN):
1. What is my immediate build priority? (settlement > city > longest road/largest army)
2. What resource do I need to complete my highest priority build?
3. What is the fastest way to acquire that resource? (production, trading, development cards)
4. How will this action position me for the next 3 turns?
5. Will this action disrupt my opponent's path to victory?
6. Is there a way to combine multiple actions this turn for greater efficiency?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 2 | Player: BLUE | Action: BUILD_INITIAL_ROAD

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Place second initial settlement at node 12 to gain Sheep access
2. Build roads toward Ore access as my next priority
3. Focus early game on expanding to a settlement with Ore production
4. Then transition to city upgrades once all resources are accessible
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.

# Initial Road Placement Decision Analysis

I need to carefully analyze my initial road placement options as this will set the foundation for my early game expansion strategy.

## Current Situation Analysis
- I have two settlements:
  - Settlement at node 2: Produces Brick(5), Wood(6), Wheat(8) - excellent production numbers
  - Settlement at node 12: Produces Wheat(8), Sheep(4) - gives me access to sheep
- I have access to Wood, Brick, Wheat, and Sheep, but I'm missing Ore
- Since this is initial road placement, I don't need resources to build it

## Available Options
[0] Build at edge (12, 13) - This extends east from my settlement at 12
[1] Build at edge (11, 12) - This extends west from my settlement at 12
[2] Build at edge (3, 12) - This connects my two settlements

## Strategic Considerations for Each Option

### Option [0]: Road at edge (12, 13)
- This leads toward node 13, which is on Sheep(4) hex
- Continuing east from here could eventually lead to other nodes, but not toward Ore
- This appears to be a suboptimal expansion path initially

### Option [1]: Road at edge (11, 12)
- This leads west from my settlement at 12
- Node 11 connects to Wheat(8) which I already have access to
- This direction doesn't immediately help with accessing new resources

### Option [2]: Road at edge (3, 12)
- This connects my two settlements, creating a stronger network
- This builds toward the center of the board
- From node 3, I can continue toward nodes that might access Ore
- Creating a connected network early provides more flexibility for future expansion
- This creates more options for building the longest road later

## Strategic Plan Revision
<plan>
1. Connect my settlements with a road from node 3 to node 12
2. Build my next road toward node 15 or another path that could lead to Ore access
3. Focus on acquiring and building a third settlement with Ore production
4. Then transition to city upgrades once all resources are accessible
</plan>

Connecting my settlements is the most strategic option as it creates a cohesive network and opens more expansion possibilities. The central position will give me more flexibility for future moves.

# Game State Analysis

Let me analyze my current position and available options:

**My Resources**: 1 🧱BRICK, 1 🐑SHEEP, 5 🌾WHEAT
**Production**: My settlements produce brick, wood, wheat, and sheep, but I lack ore production
**Current Plan**: Connect settlements and expand toward ore access

## Strategic Considerations

1. I can't build anything productive this turn with my current resources
2. I'm missing wood and ore for any meaningful build (road, settlement, development card)
3. I have excess wheat (5) that I could trade at the 4:1 port rate
4. My priority should be getting wood to build roads for expansion

## Trade Analysis

I need wood most urgently to continue my expansion plan. Trading 4 wheat for 1 wood would allow me to:
- Keep 1 wheat + 1 brick + 1 sheep (diverse resource base)
- Get 1 wood which combined with my 1 brick would allow me to build a road next turn
- This road would help execute my expansion plan toward ore access

The other trade options (sheep, brick, ore) are less optimal because:
- I already have 1 sheep and 1 brick
- I can't use ore effectively yet without a settlement location that produces ore

## Action Decision

I should trade 4 wheat for 1 wood (option 3) to position myself for a road build next turn. This aligns with my expansion strategy toward ore access.

<plan>
1. Trade 4 wheat for 1 wood now
2. Build a road next turn toward node 15 (which could eventually give access to ore)
3. Focus on acquiring resources for a third settlement with ore production
4. Then transition to city upgrades once all resources are accessible

- Secure missing resources through strategic settlement placement
- Build roads that secure critical expansion paths before the opponent blocks them
- Avoid development cards completely until you have at least 3 total settlements
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1) to complete critical builds
- Target resource diversity through your expansion locations
- Create a minimum 2-turn expansion plan and stick to it

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT AND PRODUCTION (CORE STRATEGY):
- Early game: Focus on wood/brick to expand with roads and settlements
- Mid game: Transition to ore/wheat focus for cities and development cards
- Calculate the resource production value of every potential build
- Only make 4:1 trades when they enable an immediate important build
- Cycle through "build phases" - expansion phase, then city upgrade phase
- Plan resource collection 2 turns ahead to minimize wasteful trades
- Never accumulate 7+ cards before dice rolls
- Diversify production to minimize dependency on any single resource
- Target a minimum of 4 total settlements before prioritizing city upgrades

COUNTERING ALPHABETA ALGORITHM:
- AlphaBeta looks ahead only 2 steps, so plan your moves 3-4 steps ahead
- Create deceptive game states that appear less threatening than they are
- Block the opponent's highest-probability expansion paths immediately
- Play defensively during early game, then aggressively in mid-game
- When opponent has 7+ points, disrupt their highest-producing hex with the robber
- Track opponent's resources and block their most likely next build
- Secure resources that the opponent depends on heavily
- Place roads to cut off opponent from accessing high-value settlement locations
- Position settlements to deny opponent access to key resource hex intersections

ROBBER PLACEMENT AND KNIGHT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-producing hex of your opponent
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat in mid-game when cities are being built
- Target the specific resource the opponent needs for their next likely build
- Use knight cards reactively when the robber blocks your best production
- Save knight cards for the late game if pursuing largest army
- When stealing, select resources that complete your immediate build needs
- Keep track of opponent cards and target resources they've been collecting
- Balance robber placement between disruption and resource acquisition

DEVELOPMENT CARDS VS. BUILDING:
- Only buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and cannot build
- Buy development cards when you're 1-2 knights away from largest army
- Use knight cards immediately when advantageous (don't save unless close to largest army)
- Victory point cards should only supplement your main strategy, not replace it
- Road Building cards are most valuable when you're cut off or racing to a key location
- Monopoly is best used after high-probability dice rolls to collect opponent's stockpile
- Year of Plenty is ideal to complete a high-value build (settlement or city)
- NEVER delay settlement/city building to purchase development cards unless 1 VP from winning

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY FOCUS):
- Aim for 5 total settlements (2 upgraded to cities) = 9 VP
- Then secure largest army OR longest road for the final point
- Always calculate the fastest path to 10 VP in terms of resource costs
- For each potential build, calculate how many turns closer it gets you to victory
- Determine which victory paths are still viable based on board state
- Switch strategies when your primary path is blocked
- Plan for the end-game by turn 10 (know exactly how you will reach 10 points)
- Track opponent's path to victory and actively disrupt with roads or robber

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Trade at ports even at 4:1 ratio if it enables immediate critical build
- NEVER trade with opponent unless it enables an immediate settlement/city build
- Avoid trades that allow opponent to build immediately after you
- Calculate the net VP gain of each potential trade
- Use trades to dispose of resources when at risk from robber
- Combine multiple port trades to convert unwanted resources into needed ones
- Be willing to overpay through port trades to secure critical positional advantage

DECISION FRAMEWORK (APPLY TO EVERY TURN):
1. What is my immediate build priority? (settlement > city > longest road/largest army)
2. What resource do I need to complete my highest priority build?
3. What is the fastest way to acquire that resource? (production, trading, development cards)
4. How will this action position me for the next 3 turns?
5. Will this action disrupt my opponent's path to victory?
6. Is there a way to combine multiple actions this turn for greater efficiency?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 6 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Trade 4 wheat for 1 wood now
2. Build a road next turn toward node 15 (which could eventually give access to ore)
3. Focus on acquiring resources for a third settlement with ore production
4. Then transition to city upgrades once all resources are accessible
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.

# Game Analysis - Turn 6

## Current Situation Assessment
I'm playing as BLUE with 2 VP, same as RED. I currently have:
- 1 wood, 1 brick, 1 sheep, 1 wheat
- Settlements at nodes 2 and 12
- Strong production of wheat (node 2, 12), brick (node 2), and wood (node 2)
- Weak/missing production of sheep (only node 12 with low probability) and ore (none)

## Resource Production Analysis
My current production by probability:
- Wood: 5/36 (from the 6 on node 2)
- Brick: 4/36 (from the 5 on node 2) 
- Wheat: 5/36 (from the 8 on nodes 2 and 12)
- Sheep: 3/36 (from the 4 on node 12)
- Ore: 0/36 (no access)

## Expansion Opportunities
Looking at potential road builds:
1. Edge (1, 2): Moves toward node 1 (ore hex)
2. Edge (3, 4): Moves toward node 4 (already occupied by RED)
3. Edge (12, 13): Moves toward node 13 and potentially node 15 (sheep production)
4. Edge (11, 12): Moves toward node 11 (wheat production, but I already have good wheat)
5. Edge (2, 9): Moves toward node 9 (wheat/wood, but I already produce these)

## Strategic Priority Analysis
My main strategic weakness is lack of ore production. I need to build toward a location with ore.

Looking at the board, edge (1, 2) leads toward node 1 which borders the ore hex with number 10. This is a critical resource I'm missing. Although 10 is a lower probability (3/36), having access to all resources is essential for building cities later.

The current plan mentioned building toward node 15 (for ore), but I don't see node 15 connected to any ore hex on the board. Node 15 appears to be connected to sheep (4) and wheat (9) hexes.

<plan>
1. Build a road at edge (1, 2) this turn to move toward node 1 (which has access to ore)
2. Continue expanding toward node 1 to establish a settlement there, gaining access to ore
3. Once I have access to all resources, focus on city upgrades
4. Consider development cards if excess ore/wheat/sheep becomes available
</plan>

Given my need for ore access and the available options, building a road at edge (1, 2) is the optimal move to position myself for access to the ore hex.

PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist focused on defeating the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRITICAL FOR SUCCESS):
- Above all else, target the highest probability numbers (6 & 8) - these produce resources 5/36 times each
- Strictly prioritize access to all five resources between your two settlements
- Aim for numerical diversity - try to cover 5-6 different dice numbers across your settlements
- Never place initial settlements without analyzing future expansion opportunities
- Prioritize placement on hexes with complementary resources: ore/wheat and brick/wood
- Position roads toward high-value unoccupied areas the opponent cannot easily block
- Choose second settlement to complement your first settlement's resource weaknesses
- Consider 3:1 ports if you can't access a specific resource through settlements
- Analyze opponent placement to avoid contested expansion paths
- ALWAYS calculate production value using probability dots (5-6-8-9 are top priority numbers)

# Game State Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state and plan my next move:

## Resource Inventory
- I have: 2 Wood, 1 Brick, 2 Sheep, 1 Wheat
- Missing: Ore (critical for cities and development cards)
- I can build one road with my current Wood and Brick

## Board Position
- I have settlements at nodes 2 and 12
- My current production: Brick(5), Wood(6), Wheat(8), Sheep(4)
- My roads are connected around nodes 1, 2, 3, and 12
- Opponent has settlements at nodes 4 and 6 with access to Ore
- Robber is currently on the desert hex (not affecting production)

## Available Road Building Options
1. Edge (0, 1): Extends toward node 0, which connects to Ore(10)
2. Edge (3, 4): Extends toward Red's settlement at 4
3. Edge (12, 13): Extends from my settlement at 12 toward node 13
4. Edge (11, 12): Extends from my settlement at 12 toward node 11
5. Edge (2, 9): Extends from my settlement at 2 toward node 9
6. Edge (1, 6): Extends from node 1 toward node 6 (Red's settlement)

## Strategic Considerations
1. I need Ore access for long-term development
2. Nodes 0, 20, 22, and 23 all connect to the Ore(10) hex
3. Node 0 is the closest ore access point from my current position
4. Building toward node 0 supports my current plan
5. Red already has Ore access, so I need to catch up

## Road Building Analysis
- Option 1 (edge 0, 1): Directly advances my path to Ore access at node 0
- Option 6 (edge 1, 6): Extends toward Red's settlement, not productive
- Options 3, 4, 5: Extend in other directions without clear resource advantage
- Option 2: Extends toward Red's territory without strategic benefit

<plan>
1. Build a road at edge (0, 1) to continue advancing toward node 0 for Ore access
2. Target a settlement at node 0 to gain Ore production from the 10 hex
3. After securing Ore access, focus on upgrading settlements to cities
4. Consider development cards once I have consistent ore production
</plan>

Based on my analysis, the optimal move is to build a road at edge (0, 1), which continues my path toward gaining Ore access at node 0.

- Be willing to overpay through port trades to secure critical positional advantage

DECISION FRAMEWORK (APPLY TO EVERY TURN):
1. What is my immediate build priority? (settlement > city > longest road/largest army)
2. What resource do I need to complete my highest priority build?
3. What is the fastest way to acquire that resource? (production, trading, development cards)
4. How will this action position me for the next 3 turns?
5. Will this action disrupt my opponent's path to victory?
6. Is there a way to combine multiple actions this turn for greater efficiency?

# Game Analysis for Turn 18

I'll carefully analyze the current game state and available options to determine my optimal move.

## Current State Assessment
- I have 2 victory points (2 settlements)
- Resources: 3 wood, 3 sheep, 5 wheat (no brick or ore)
- My opponent has 3 victory points (3 settlements)

## Resource Production Analysis
My settlements produce:
- Wood from a 6 (good probability)
- Wheat from an 8 (excellent probability)
- Brick from a 5 (decent probability)
- Sheep from a 4 (low probability)

I'm notably lacking ore production, which is essential for city upgrades and development cards.

## Current Plan Evaluation
My current plan involves:
1. Building a road at edge (0, 1) to advance toward node 0 for ore access
2. Targeting a settlement at node 0 for ore production from the 10 hex

However, I've already built this road at (0, 1) according to my road list. My next step would be to build at node 0, but I need brick for this, which I don't currently have.

## Available Actions Analysis
1. End Turn [0]
2. Trade 4 wheat for 1 sheep [1]
3. Trade 4 wheat for 1 brick [2] - This would help with my settlement plan
4. Trade 4 wheat for 1 wood [3]
5. Trade 4 wheat for 1 ore [4]

## Strategic Decision
Looking at my resources (3 wood, 3 sheep, 5 wheat), I'm missing brick to build a settlement at node 0. Trading 4 wheat for 1 brick would allow me to progress toward my goal of accessing ore production, which is critical for my mid-game strategy.

While the 4:1 trade is inefficient, securing brick now will allow me to build a settlement on my next turn (assuming I get at least 1 more wood from production). This settlement at node 0 would give me access to ore (10) which is a crucial missing resource.

<plan>
1. Trade 4 wheat for 1 brick to prepare for settlement building
2. On next turn, build settlement at node 0 to gain ore production (10)
3. Once ore production is secured, focus on city upgrades and development cards
4. Target ore/wheat production to advance toward 10 victory points through city upgrades
</plan>

Therefore, I'll choose to trade wheat for brick:

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist focused on defeating the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRITICAL FOR SUCCESS):
- Above all else, target the highest probability numbers (6 & 8) - these produce resources 5/36 times each
- Strictly prioritize access to all five resources between your two settlements
- Aim for numerical diversity - try to cover 5-6 different dice numbers across your settlements
- Never place initial settlements without analyzing future expansion opportunities
- Prioritize placement on hexes with complementary resources: ore/wheat and brick/wood
- Position roads toward high-value unoccupied areas the opponent cannot easily block
- Choose second settlement to complement your first settlement's resource weaknesses
- Consider 3:1 ports if you can't access a specific resource through settlements
- Analyze opponent placement to avoid contested expansion paths
- ALWAYS calculate production value using probability dots (5-6-8-9 are top priority numbers)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-10):
- Build at least one new settlement by turn 10 - expansion is your TOP priority
- Calculate and build along the fastest path to your next settlement location
- Secure missing resources through strategic settlement placement
- Build roads that secure critical expansion paths before the opponent blocks them
- Avoid development cards completely until you have at least 3 total settlements
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1) to complete critical builds
- Target resource diversity through your expansion locations
- Create a minimum 2-turn expansion plan and stick to it

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT AND PRODUCTION (CORE STRATEGY):
- Early game: Focus on wood/brick to expand with roads and settlements
- Mid game: Transition to ore/wheat focus for cities and development cards
- Calculate the resource production value of every potential build
- Only make 4:1 trades when they enable an immediate important build
- Cycle through "build phases" - expansion phase, then city upgrade phase
- Plan resource collection 2 turns ahead to minimize wasteful trades
- Never accumulate 7+ cards before dice rolls
- Diversify production to minimize dependency on any single resource
- Target a minimum of 4 total settlements before prioritizing city upgrades

COUNTERING ALPHABETA ALGORITHM:
- AlphaBeta looks ahead only 2 steps, so plan your moves 3-4 steps ahead
- Create deceptive game states that appear less threatening than they are
- Block the opponent's highest-probability expansion paths immediately
- Play defensively during early game, then aggressively in mid-game
- When opponent has 7+ points, disrupt their highest-producing hex with the robber
- Track opponent's resources and block their most likely next build
- Secure resources that the opponent depends on heavily
- Place roads to cut off opponent from accessing high-value settlement locations
- Position settlements to deny opponent access to key resource hex intersections

ROBBER PLACEMENT AND KNIGHT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-producing hex of your opponent
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat in mid-game when cities are being built
- Target the specific resource the opponent needs for their next likely build
- Use knight cards reactively when the robber blocks your best production
- Save knight cards for the late game if pursuing largest army
- When stealing, select resources that complete your immediate build needs
- Keep track of opponent cards and target resources they've been collecting
- Balance robber placement between disruption and resource acquisition

DEVELOPMENT CARDS VS. BUILDING:
- Only buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and cannot build
- Buy development cards when you're 1-2 knights away from largest army
- Use knight cards immediately when advantageous (don't save unless close to largest army)
- Victory point cards should only supplement your main strategy, not replace it
- Road Building cards are most valuable when you're cut off or racing to a key location
- Monopoly is best used after high-probability dice rolls to collect opponent's stockpile
- Year of Plenty is ideal to complete a high-value build (settlement or city)
- NEVER delay settlement/city building to purchase development cards unless 1 VP from winning

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY FOCUS):
- Aim for 5 total settlements (2 upgraded to cities) = 9 VP
- Then secure largest army OR longest road for the final point
- Always calculate the fastest path to 10 VP in terms of resource costs
- For each potential build, calculate how many turns closer it gets you to victory
- Determine which victory paths are still viable based on board state
- Switch strategies when your primary path is blocked
- Plan for the end-game by turn 10 (know exactly how you will reach 10 points)
- Track opponent's path to victory and actively disrupt with roads or robber

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Trade at ports even at 4:1 ratio if it enables immediate critical build
- NEVER trade with opponent unless it enables an immediate settlement/city build
- Avoid trades that allow opponent to build immediately after you
- Calculate the net VP gain of each potential trade
- Use trades to dispose of resources when at risk from robber
- Combine multiple port trades to convert unwanted resources into needed ones
- Be willing to overpay through port trades to secure critical positional advantage

DECISION FRAMEWORK (APPLY TO EVERY TURN):
1. What is my immediate build priority? (settlement > city > longest road/largest army)
2. What resource do I need to complete my highest priority build?
3. What is the fastest way to acquire that resource? (production, trading, development cards)
4. How will this action position me for the next 3 turns?
5. Will this action disrupt my opponent's path to victory?
6. Is there a way to combine multiple actions this turn for greater efficiency?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 18 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

❓ Select action by number (0-8):


Based on this information, which action number do you choose? Think step by step about your options, then put the final action number in a box like \boxed{1}.
RESPONSE:
I'll analyze this game state carefully and select the optimal action.

## Current Situation Assessment
- I have 2 VPs (2 settlements), while RED has 3 VPs (3 settlements)
- My resources: 3 wood, 1 brick, 3 sheep, 1 wheat
- I can build either a road or a settlement at node 0

## Resource Production Analysis
- My settlements produce wood (6), brick (5), sheep (4), and wheat (8)
- I'm missing ore production completely, which is critical for city upgrades
- Node 0 connects to ore (10) hex - this would give me access to all five resources

## Action Analysis

**Option 0: End Turn**
- Doesn't advance my position
- Wastes current resources
- Not optimal when I can make a build

**Options 1-7: Building Roads**
- Building roads alone doesn't give me victory points
- Would use my only brick, making settlement building impossible this turn

**Option 8: Build Settlement at node 0**
- Costs 1 wood, 1 brick, 1 wheat, 1 sheep (I have all these)
- Would give me access to ore production (10)
- Immediate +1 victory point (bringing me to 3 VP, tied with RED)
- Completes my resource diversity by adding ore production
- Aligns perfectly with my current plan

Building a settlement at node 0 is clearly the optimal move as it:
1. Increases my victory points immediately
2. Gives me access to ore production, which I critically need for city upgrades
3. Uses resources efficiently
4. Positions me better for the mid-game city upgrade strategy

<plan>
1. Build settlement at node 0 to gain ore production (10)
2. Focus on collecting ore/wheat for city upgrades at my high-producing settlements
3. Target development cards if excess ore/wheat/sheep accumulates
4. Build toward longest road if appropriate opportunities arise
5. Aim for 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road/largest army (2 VP) + development card VP (1 VP) = 10 VP
</plan>

# Robber Placement Analysis

I need to strategically place the robber to maximize my advantage against RED. Let me analyze each option carefully:

## Evaluating Hex Production Values:
- (0, 0, 0): 🧱5 [⭐⭐] - Brick hex with production value 2
- (1, -1, 0): 🌲6 [⭐⭐⭐] - Wood hex with production value 3
- (0, -1, 1): 🌾8 [⭐⭐⭐] - Wheat hex with production value 3
- (-1, 0, 1): 🐑4 [⭐] - Sheep hex with production value 1
- (-1, 1, 0): 🌾9 [⭐⭐] - Wheat hex with production value 2
- (1, 0, -1): ⛏️10 [⭐] - Ore hex with production value 1

## Considering Opponent Impact:
- (0, 0, 0): Blocks RED's 5 Brick at node 4
- (1, -1, 0): Blocks RED's 6 Wood at node 6
- (0, -1, 1): Blocks no RED settlements directly
- (-1, 0, 1): Blocks RED's 4 Sheep at node 4
- (-1, 1, 0): Blocks RED's 9 Wheat at nodes 4 and 16
- (1, 0, -1): Blocks RED's 10 Ore at node 6

## Self-Impact Analysis:
I must be careful not to block my own high-value resources:
- (0, -1, 1) would block my 8 Wheat at nodes 2 and 12
- (1, -1, 0) would block my 6 Wood at node 2
- (0, 0, 0) would block my 5 Brick at nodes 0 and 2

## Resource Consideration:
RED has 5 hidden cards. At this stage, ore and wheat are crucial for city development, while wood and brick are important for continued expansion.

## Strategic Decision:
Option [4] (placing the robber on (-1, 1, 0)) is optimal because:
1. It blocks a wheat hex (9) that RED depends on at TWO settlements (nodes 4 and 16)
2. It doesn't block any of my important production
3. Wheat is a critical resource for cities and development cards
4. I get to steal from RED, potentially getting a valuable resource
5. This disrupts RED's most likely path to city upgrades

<plan>
1. Block RED's wheat production with robber placement
2. Focus on collecting ore/wheat for city upgrades at my high-producing settlements
3. Use my wood and sheep (plus whatever I steal) to acquire more needed resources
4. Build toward development cards for potential victory points
5. Aim for 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + development cards (2 VP) + longest road (1 VP) = 10 VP
</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist focused on defeating the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRITICAL FOR SUCCESS):
- Above all else, target the highest probability numbers (6 & 8) - these produce resources 5/36 times each
- Strictly prioritize access to all five resources between your two settlements
- Aim for numerical diversity - try to cover 5-6 different dice numbers across your settlements
- Never place initial settlements without analyzing future expansion opportunities
- Prioritize placement on hexes with complementary resources: ore/wheat and brick/wood
- Position roads toward high-value unoccupied areas the opponent cannot easily block
- Choose second settlement to complement your first settlement's resource weaknesses
- Consider 3:1 ports if you can't access a specific resource through settlements
- Analyze opponent placement to avoid contested expansion paths
- ALWAYS calculate production value using probability dots (5-6-8-9 are top priority numbers)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-10):
- Build at least one new settlement by turn 10 - expansion is your TOP priority
- Calculate and build along the fastest path to your next settlement location
- Secure missing resources through strategic settlement placement
- Build roads that secure critical expansion paths before the opponent blocks them
- Avoid development cards completely until you have at least 3 total settlements
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1) to complete critical builds
- Target resource diversity through your expansion locations
- Create a minimum 2-turn expansion plan and stick to it

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT AND PRODUCTION (CORE STRATEGY):
- Early game: Focus on wood/brick to expand with roads and settlements
- Mid game: Transition to ore/wheat focus for cities and development cards
- Calculate the resource production value of every potential build
- Only make 4:1 trades when they enable an immediate important build
- Cycle through "build phases" - expansion phase, then city upgrade phase
- Plan resource collection 2 turns ahead to minimize wasteful trades
- Never accumulate 7+ cards before dice rolls
- Diversify production to minimize dependency on any single resource
- Target a minimum of 4 total settlements before prioritizing city upgrades

COUNTERING ALPHABETA ALGORITHM:
- AlphaBeta looks ahead only 2 steps, so plan your moves 3-4 steps ahead
- Create deceptive game states that appear less threatening than they are
- Block the opponent's highest-probability expansion paths immediately
- Play defensively during early game, then aggressively in mid-game
- When opponent has 7+ points, disrupt their highest-producing hex with the robber
- Track opponent's resources and block their most likely next build
- Secure resources that the opponent depends on heavily
- Place roads to cut off opponent from accessing high-value settlement locations
- Position settlements to deny opponent access to key resource hex intersections

ROBBER PLACEMENT AND KNIGHT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-producing hex of your opponent
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat in mid-game when cities are being built
- Target the specific resource the opponent needs for their next likely build
- Use knight cards reactively when the robber blocks your best production
- Save knight cards for the late game if pursuing largest army
- When stealing, select resources that complete your immediate build needs
- Keep track of opponent cards and target resources they've been collecting
- Balance robber placement between disruption and resource acquisition

DEVELOPMENT CARDS VS. BUILDING:
- Only buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and cannot build
- Buy development cards when you're 1-2 knights away from largest army
- Use knight cards immediately when advantageous (don't save unless close to largest army)
- Victory point cards should only supplement your main strategy, not replace it
- Road Building cards are most valuable when you're cut off or racing to a key location
- Monopoly is best used after high-probability dice rolls to collect opponent's stockpile
- Year of Plenty is ideal to complete a high-value build (settlement or city)
- NEVER delay settlement/city building to purchase development cards unless 1 VP from winning

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY FOCUS):
- Aim for 5 total settlements (2 upgraded to cities) = 9 VP
- Then secure largest army OR longest road for the final point
- Always calculate the fastest path to 10 VP in terms of resource costs
- For each potential build, calculate how many turns closer it gets you to victory
- Determine which victory paths are still viable based on board state
- Switch strategies when your primary path is blocked
- Plan for the end-game by turn 10 (know exactly how you will reach 10 points)
- Track opponent's path to victory and actively disrupt with roads or robber

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Trade at ports even at 4:1 ratio if it enables immediate critical build
- NEVER trade with opponent unless it enables an immediate settlement/city build
- Avoid trades that allow opponent to build immediately after you
- Calculate the net VP gain of each potential trade
- Use trades to dispose of resources when at risk from robber
- Combine multiple port trades to convert unwanted resources into needed ones
- Be willing to overpay through port trades to secure critical positional advantage

DECISION FRAMEWORK (APPLY TO EVERY TURN):
1. What is my immediate build priority? (settlement > city > longest road/largest army)
2. What resource do I need to complete my highest priority build?
3. What is the fastest way to acquire that resource? (production, trading, development cards)
4. How will this action position me for the next 3 turns?
5. Will this action disrupt my opponent's path to victory?
6. Is there a way to combine multiple actions this turn for greater efficiency?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game Analysis for Catan Turn 26

Let me analyze the current game state and determine my best move:

## Current Resources
- 3 Wood, 2 Brick, 2 Sheep, 1 Ore
- I have enough resources to build a road (1 Wood + 1 Brick)

## Victory Points Situation
- I have 3 VP (3 settlements)
- Opponent has 3 VP (3 settlements)
- Game is tied, early-mid game stage

## My Production
- Settlement at node 2: Brick(5), Wood(6), Wheat(8) - high value!
- Settlement at node 12: Wheat(8), Sheep(4)
- Settlement at node 0: Brick(5), Ore(10)
- Good number distribution (4,5,6,8,10) but missing reliable wheat production due to robber

## Road Building Options Analysis
1. Edge (0,20): Extends toward desert/ore area
2. Edge (3,4): Moves toward sheep/wheat region
3. Edge (12,13): Extends from settlement 12 toward sheep area
4. Edge (11,12): Different path from settlement 12
5. Edge (2,9): Extends from high-value settlement 2 toward wheat/wood
6. Edge (0,5): Extends from settlement 0 toward desert
7. Edge (1,6): Connects toward opponent's settlement

## Strategic Priorities
1. Secure longest road potential (currently at 4, need 5 for longest road)
2. Position for next settlement at high-value location
3. Block opponent's expansion paths

Looking at road options, I need to determine which road gives me the best positioning for future expansion and potential longest road. Option #5 (edge 2,9) extends from my highest producing settlement towards good wheat production and allows me to potentially claim longest road while positioning for a new settlement.

<plan>
1. Build road at edge (2,9) to extend from my best settlement
2. Continue focusing on securing longest road (5+ segments)
3. Position for a new settlement near high wheat/wood production
4. Gather ore/wheat for city upgrades at my best settlements
5. Path to victory: 3 settlements (3 VP) + 2 cities (4 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + dev card VP (1 VP) = 10 VP
</plan>

The road at edge (2,9) gives me the best position to extend toward valuable resources while working toward longest road and blocking opponent expansion.

# Game Analysis for Turn 26

I'll analyze the current game state to determine my optimal move.

## Current Position Assessment
- I have 3 VP from 3 settlements
- My resources: 2 Wood, 1 Brick, 2 Sheep, 1 Ore
- I can build a road this turn (costs 1 Wood, 1 Brick)
- Both players have 3 VP and 5 built roads
- Robber is on wheat hex (0,-1,1), blocking one of my key production tiles

## Available Road Building Options
I need to analyze each potential road location to determine which provides the greatest strategic advantage:

1. Edge (9,10): Extends from settlement at node 9 (not my settlement)
2. Edge (0,20): Extends toward desert hex, connects to my settlement at node 0
3. Edge (3,4): Connects toward opponent's settlement at node 4
4. Edge (12,13): Extends from my settlement at node 12 toward sheep
5. Edge (11,12): Connects to my settlement at node 12 
6. Edge (8,9): Connects nodes 8 and 9
7. Edge (0,5): Connects my settlement at node 0 toward desert
8. Edge (1,6): Connects toward opponent's settlement at node 6

## Strategic Considerations
1. Longest Road potential: I need to focus on building a continuous road network
2. Future settlement locations: Need to identify high-value spots for expansion
3. Blocking opponent: Prevent RED from claiming longest road
4. Path to victory: Need to get to 10 VP with limited resources

## Road Network Analysis
Looking at my current roads, I need to build strategically to create a longer continuous path. Without seeing the exact positions of all my roads, I need to choose a road that likely extends my current network.

The most strategically valuable road appears to be at edge (12,13), as it:
1. Extends from my settlement at node 12
2. Moves toward resource diversity (sheep)
3. Likely continues my existing road network
4. Creates options for future settlement placement
5. Could contribute to longest road achievement

<plan>
1. Build road at edge (12,13) to extend from my settlement at node 12
2. Continue focusing on securing longest road (working toward 5+ segments)
3. Position for a new settlement near node 13 to get better sheep access
4. Gather ore/wheat for city upgrades at my best settlements
5. Path to victory: 3 settlements (3 VP) + 2 cities (4 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + future dev card VP (1 VP) = 10 VP
</plan>

With the available resources and after careful analysis of strategic positions, I choose to:

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist focused on defeating the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRITICAL FOR SUCCESS):
- Above all else, target the highest probability numbers (6 & 8) - these produce resources 5/36 times each
- Strictly prioritize access to all five resources between your two settlements
- Aim for numerical diversity - try to cover 5-6 different dice numbers across your settlements
- Never place initial settlements without analyzing future expansion opportunities
- Prioritize placement on hexes with complementary resources: ore/wheat and brick/wood
- Position roads toward high-value unoccupied areas the opponent cannot easily block
- Choose second settlement to complement your first settlement's resource weaknesses
- Consider 3:1 ports if you can't access a specific resource through settlements
- Analyze opponent placement to avoid contested expansion paths
- ALWAYS calculate production value using probability dots (5-6-8-9 are top priority numbers)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-10):
- Build at least one new settlement by turn 10 - expansion is your TOP priority
- Calculate and build along the fastest path to your next settlement location
- Secure missing resources through strategic settlement placement
- Build roads that secure critical expansion paths before the opponent blocks them
- Avoid development cards completely until you have at least 3 total settlements
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1) to complete critical builds
- Target resource diversity through your expansion locations
- Create a minimum 2-turn expansion plan and stick to it

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT AND PRODUCTION (CORE STRATEGY):
- Early game: Focus on wood/brick to expand with roads and settlements
- Mid game: Transition to ore/wheat focus for cities and development cards
- Calculate the resource production value of every potential build
- Only make 4:1 trades when they enable an immediate important build
- Cycle through "build phases" - expansion phase, then city upgrade phase
- Plan resource collection 2 turns ahead to minimize wasteful trades
- Never accumulate 7+ cards before dice rolls
- Diversify production to minimize dependency on any single resource
- Target a minimum of 4 total settlements before prioritizing city upgrades

COUNTERING ALPHABETA ALGORITHM:
- AlphaBeta looks ahead only 2 steps, so plan your moves 3-4 steps ahead
- Create deceptive game states that appear less threatening than they are
- Block the opponent's highest-probability expansion paths immediately
- Play defensively during early game, then aggressively in mid-game
- When opponent has 7+ points, disrupt their highest-producing hex with the robber
- Track opponent's resources and block their most likely next build
- Secure resources that the opponent depends on heavily
- Place roads to cut off opponent from accessing high-value settlement locations
- Position settlements to deny opponent access to key resource hex intersections

ROBBER PLACEMENT AND KNIGHT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-producing hex of your opponent
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat in mid-game when cities are being built
- Target the specific resource the opponent needs for their next likely build
- Use knight cards reactively when the robber blocks your best production
- Save knight cards for the late game if pursuing largest army
- When stealing, select resources that complete your immediate build needs
- Keep track of opponent cards and target resources they've been collecting
- Balance robber placement between disruption and resource acquisition

DEVELOPMENT CARDS VS. BUILDING:
- Only buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and cannot build
- Buy development cards when you're 1-2 knights away from largest army
- Use knight cards immediately when advantageous (don't save unless close to largest army)
- Victory point cards should only supplement your main strategy, not replace it
- Road Building cards are most valuable when you're cut off or racing to a key location
- Monopoly is best used after high-probability dice rolls to collect opponent's stockpile
- Year of Plenty is ideal to complete a high-value build (settlement or city)
- NEVER delay settlement/city building to purchase development cards unless 1 VP from winning

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY FOCUS):
- Aim for 5 total settlements (2 upgraded to cities) = 9 VP
- Then secure largest army OR longest road for the final point
- Always calculate the fastest path to 10 VP in terms of resource costs
- For each potential build, calculate how many turns closer it gets you to victory
- Determine which victory paths are still viable based on board state
- Switch strategies when your primary path is blocked
- Plan for the end-game by turn 10 (know exactly how you will reach 10 points)
- Track opponent's path to victory and actively disrupt with roads or robber

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Trade at ports even at 4:1 ratio if it enables immediate critical build
- NEVER trade with opponent unless it enables an immediate settlement/city build
- Avoid trades that allow opponent to build immediately after you
- Calculate the net VP gain of each potential trade
- Use trades to dispose of resources when at risk from robber
- Combine multiple port trades to convert unwanted resources into needed ones
- Be willing to overpay through port trades to secure critical positional advantage

DECISION FRAMEWORK (APPLY TO EVERY TURN):
1. What is my immediate build priority? (settlement > city > longest road/largest army)
2. What resource do I need to complete my highest priority build?
3. What is the fastest way to acquire that resource? (production, trading, development cards)
4. How will this action position me for the next 3 turns?
5. Will this action disrupt my opponent's path to victory?
6. Is there a way to combine multiple actions this turn for greater efficiency?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game Analysis - Turn 28

I'll analyze the current game state and determine the optimal move to maximize my chances of winning as the Blue player.

## Game State Assessment:
- I have 5/10 VP: 3 from settlements + 2 from longest road
- I have 1 wood, 2 brick, 2 sheep, 1 ore
- Resources needed for builds: 
  * Road: 1 wood + 1 brick
  * Settlement: 1 wood + 1 brick + 1 sheep + 1 wheat (missing wheat)
  * City: 3 ore + 2 wheat (missing wheat, need 2 more ore)
- The robber is on the wheat hex (0,-1,1) with value 8, blocking one of my best production sources
- I have longest road (5 segments), which is vital to maintain

## Strategic Priorities:
1. Maintain longest road advantage (critical for my 2 VP)
2. Expand toward new settlement locations
3. Prepare for city upgrades when resources allow
4. Block opponent's expansion where possible

## Road Build Options Analysis:
Let me analyze each road option in terms of strategic value:

[1] Edge (9,10): Extends toward nodes 10/11, but doesn't immediately threaten RED's position
[2] Edge (13,14): Extends toward node 14, moving toward sheep territory
[3] Edge (0,20): Extends from my settlement at node 0 toward node 20, potentially blocking RED from expanding
[4] Edge (3,4): Connects toward RED's settlement at node 4 - not strategically valuable
[5] Edge (11,12): Connects back to my settlement at node 12 - creates a loop but doesn't extend network
[6] Edge (8,9): Extends road network but doesn't open immediate settlement opportunities
[7] Edge (0,5): Extends from my settlement at node 0 toward node 5
[8] Edge (1,6): Would extend toward node 6, which is already occupied by RED

Looking at the options, I should prioritize roads that:
1. Strengthen my longest road position
2. Move toward viable settlement locations
3. Block RED's expansion paths

Edge (0,20) looks particularly valuable as it extends toward node 20, which is adjacent to the ore hex (important for city upgrades) and could potentially block RED's expansion. This aligns with my need to maintain longest road while positioning for future settlements.

<plan>
1. Build road at edge (0,20) to extend toward node 20/22/23 area
2. Continue focusing on securing longest road advantage (currently 5 segments vs RED's 4)
3. Gather resources for a new settlement near node 20 for better ore access
4. Work toward upgrading settlements to cities once wheat production improves
5. Path to victory: 3 settlements (3 VP) + 2 cities (4 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + potential dev card VP (1 VP) = 10 VP
</plan>

After careful consideration, I choose to build a road at edge (0,20) to extend my network toward valuable ore resources while maintaining my longest road advantage.

# Game Analysis for Turn 32

I'll analyze the current game state and determine the optimal action.

## Current State Assessment
- I have 5/10 victory points (3 from settlements + 2 from longest road)
- Resource holdings: 1 Wood, 3 Brick, 1 Sheep, 2 Ore (critically low on wood)
- RED has 8 hidden cards, which is concerning (could be planning a major build)
- I have longest road with 6 segments vs RED's 4 segments
- I need to reach 10 VP: current path is 3 settlements + 2 cities + longest road + possibly 1 VP dev card

## Road Building Options Analysis
Looking at the available road building options:

1. Edge (9, 10): Does not appear to advance toward valuable settlement locations
2. Edge (13, 14): Similar to option 1
3. Edge (3, 4): Connects toward RED's settlement at node 4, not useful
4. Edge (19, 20): Extends toward node 20 area, which aligns with my current plan
5. Edge (11, 12): Not in a strategic direction for expansion
6. Edge (8, 9): Not critical for expansion
7. Edge (0, 5): Connects toward the (0, 1, -1) hex with robber
8. Edge (20, 22): Extends toward nodes 22/23 for potential settlement with ore access
9. Edge (1, 6): Moves toward RED's settlement at node 6, not useful

Option 8 (edge 20, 22) directly supports my current plan by moving toward nodes 22/23 area where I could potentially build a settlement with access to ore. This area appears to be a high-priority expansion target based on my current plan.

Option 4 (edge 19, 20) also aligns with my plan by moving toward node 20, but option 8 seems to be moving one step further in that direction.

## Strategic Considerations
1. **Maintaining Longest Road**: Building any road helps secure my longest road advantage
2. **Resource Access**: Building toward nodes 22/23 could give me better ore access
3. **Opponent Threat**: RED has 8 cards, which is concerning - they might be planning something significant
4. **Path to Victory**: I need to focus on upgrading settlements to cities (need wheat and ore)

## Optimal Decision
Building a road at edge (20, 22) is the best option as it:
1. Maintains my longest road advantage
2. Advances toward potential settlement locations with ore access
3. Follows my existing plan to expand in that direction

<plan>
1. Build road at edge (20, 22) to extend toward potential settlement location
2. Continue focusing on securing longest road advantage (currently 6 segments vs RED's 4)
3. Work toward building a settlement near node 22/23 for better ore access
4. Begin saving for city upgrades once wheat production improves
5. Path to victory: 3 settlements (3 VP) + 2 cities (4 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + potential dev card VP (1 VP) = 10 VP
</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist focused on defeating the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRITICAL FOR SUCCESS):
- Above all else, target the highest probability numbers (6 & 8) - these produce resources 5/36 times each
- Strictly prioritize access to all five resources between your two settlements
- Aim for numerical diversity - try to cover 5-6 different dice numbers across your settlements
- Never place initial settlements without analyzing future expansion opportunities
- Prioritize placement on hexes with complementary resources: ore/wheat and brick/wood
- Position roads toward high-value unoccupied areas the opponent cannot easily block
- Choose second settlement to complement your first settlement's resource weaknesses
- Consider 3:1 ports if you can't access a specific resource through settlements
- Analyze opponent placement to avoid contested expansion paths
- ALWAYS calculate production value using probability dots (5-6-8-9 are top priority numbers)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-10):
- Build at least one new settlement by turn 10 - expansion is your TOP priority
- Calculate and build along the fastest path to your next settlement location
- Secure missing resources through strategic settlement placement
- Build roads that secure critical expansion paths before the opponent blocks them
- Avoid development cards completely until you have at least 3 total settlements
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1) to complete critical builds
- Target resource diversity through your expansion locations
- Create a minimum 2-turn expansion plan and stick to it

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT AND PRODUCTION (CORE STRATEGY):
- Early game: Focus on wood/brick to expand with roads and settlements
- Mid game: Transition to ore/wheat focus for cities and development cards
- Calculate the resource production value of every potential build
- Only make 4:1 trades when they enable an immediate important build
- Cycle through "build phases" - expansion phase, then city upgrade phase
- Plan resource collection 2 turns ahead to minimize wasteful trades
- Never accumulate 7+ cards before dice rolls
- Diversify production to minimize dependency on any single resource
- Target a minimum of 4 total settlements before prioritizing city upgrades

COUNTERING ALPHABETA ALGORITHM:
- AlphaBeta looks ahead only 2 steps, so plan your moves 3-4 steps ahead
- Create deceptive game states that appear less threatening than they are
- Block the opponent's highest-probability expansion paths immediately
- Play defensively during early game, then aggressively in mid-game
- When opponent has 7+ points, disrupt their highest-producing hex with the robber
- Track opponent's resources and block their most likely next build
- Secure resources that the opponent depends on heavily
- Place roads to cut off opponent from accessing high-value settlement locations
- Position settlements to deny opponent access to key resource hex intersections

ROBBER PLACEMENT AND KNIGHT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-producing hex of your opponent
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat in mid-game when cities are being built
- Target the specific resource the opponent needs for their next likely build
- Use knight cards reactively when the robber blocks your best production
- Save knight cards for the late game if pursuing largest army
- When stealing, select resources that complete your immediate build needs
- Keep track of opponent cards and target resources they've been collecting
- Balance robber placement between disruption and resource acquisition

DEVELOPMENT CARDS VS. BUILDING:
- Only buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and cannot build
- Buy development cards when you're 1-2 knights away from largest army
- Use knight cards immediately when advantageous (don't save unless close to largest army)
- Victory point cards should only supplement your main strategy, not replace it
- Road Building cards are most valuable when you're cut off or racing to a key location
- Monopoly is best used after high-probability dice rolls to collect opponent's stockpile
- Year of Plenty is ideal to complete a high-value build (settlement or city)
- NEVER delay settlement/city building to purchase development cards unless 1 VP from winning

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY FOCUS):
- Aim for 5 total settlements (2 upgraded to cities) = 9 VP
- Then secure largest army OR longest road for the final point
- Always calculate the fastest path to 10 VP in terms of resource costs
- For each potential build, calculate how many turns closer it gets you to victory
- Determine which victory paths are still viable based on board state
- Switch strategies when your primary path is blocked
- Plan for the end-game by turn 10 (know exactly how you will reach 10 points)
- Track opponent's path to victory and actively disrupt with roads or robber

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Trade at ports even at 4:1 ratio if it enables immediate critical build
- NEVER trade with opponent unless it enables an immediate settlement/city build
- Avoid trades that allow opponent to build immediately after you
- Calculate the net VP gain of each potential trade
- Use trades to dispose of resources when at risk from robber
- Combine multiple port trades to convert unwanted resources into needed ones
- Be willing to overpay through port trades to secure critical positional advantage

DECISION FRAMEWORK (APPLY TO EVERY TURN):
1. What is my immediate build priority? (settlement > city > longest road/largest army)
2. What resource do I need to complete my highest priority build?
3. What is the fastest way to acquire that resource? (production, trading, development cards)
4. How will this action position me for the next 3 turns?
5. Will this action disrupt my opponent's path to victory?
6. Is there a way to combine multiple actions this turn for greater efficiency?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game Analysis for Turn 34

I'll evaluate the current game state and available actions to determine the optimal move.

## Current Game Status
- I have 5 victory points (3 settlements + longest road bonus)
- RED has 4 victory points (4 settlements)
- My resources: 4 🧱, 1 🐑, 2 🌾, 2 ⛏️
- RED has 5 hidden resource cards
- The robber is on a desert hex, so not affecting production

## Resource Evaluation
I have good brick reserves but am limited in other resources. For future builds:
- Settlement costs: 1 🧱, 1 🌲, 1 🌾, 1 🐑 (missing wood)
- City costs: 2 🌾, 3 ⛏️ (need 1 more ore)
- Development card costs: 1 🐑, 1 🌾, 1 ⛏️ (have enough)

## Path to Victory Analysis
Currently I have 5 VP, needing 5 more to win. Potential paths:
1. Convert my 3 settlements to cities (+3 VP) + maintain longest road (+2 VP) = 10 VP
2. Build 1 more settlement (+1 VP), convert 2 settlements to cities (+2 VP), maintain longest road (+2 VP) = 10 VP
3. Build 1 more settlement (+1 VP), convert 1 settlement to city (+1 VP), maintain longest road (+2 VP), get 1 VP from development card = 10 VP

## Available Options
- [0] End turn (passive)
- [1] Buy development card (possible VP or Knight)
- [2-5] Maritime trades (suboptimal 4:1 ratio)

## Action Analysis
1. **End Turn**: Conserves resources but doesn't advance my position
2. **Buy Development Card**: Could yield immediate VP, Knight (for largest army), or utility cards
   - 25% chance of VP card (immediate value)
   - Knights help secure largest army (long-term value)
   - Year of Plenty/Monopoly could get me needed resources
   - Road Building saves valuable brick for future settlements
3. **Maritime Trades**: All 4:1 trades are inefficient and don't enable immediate builds

## Decision Logic
The development card is the most strategic option because:
1. I have the exact resources needed (1 🐑, 1 🌾, 1 ⛏️)
2. I'd retain my 4 brick for future road/settlement expansion
3. A VP card would put me at 6/10 points
4. Even non-VP cards advance my position (Knights, Road Building, Year of Plenty)
5. Development cards are hidden information, making it harder for AlphaBeta to counter my strategy

<plan>
1. Buy development card now (hoping for VP or utility)
2. Use brick reserves next turn for road expansion toward settlement location
3. Target city upgrades when sufficient wheat/ore are acquired
4. Maintain longest road advantage (currently 7 vs 4)
5. Path to victory: 3 settlements (3 VP) + 2-3 cities (4-6 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + potential dev card VP (1 VP) = 10-12 VP
</plan>

Therefore, my optimal action is:

\boxed{1}

# Game State Analysis

Let me analyze my current position in Catan and determine the optimal action:

## Current Status
- I have 5 VPs (3 settlements + 2 for longest road)
- Resources: 4 🧱BRICK, 1 🌾WHEAT, 1 ⛏️ORE
- Development Cards: 1 YEAR_OF_PLENTY
- Opponent has 4 VPs (4 settlements)

## Available Actions
0. End turn
1-4. Trade 4 brick for other resources

## Strategic Assessment

My current plan involves buying a development card, but I don't have enough resources for that (need 1 sheep, 1 wheat, 1 ore - I'm missing sheep).

Looking at my resource situation:
- I have excess brick (4)
- I'm lacking sheep completely (needed for development cards)
- I have some wheat and ore but not enough for a city

Since I already have longest road and 3 settlements, my path to victory involves:
1. Upgrading settlements to cities (2 ore + 3 wheat each)
2. Potentially getting VPs from development cards
3. Maintaining longest road

I could trade 4 brick for 1 sheep, which would allow me to buy a development card on a future turn when I get one more wheat. However, I already have a YEAR_OF_PLENTY card that could be used to get resources I need.

Looking at the bigger picture, I should focus on getting resources for city upgrades (ore and wheat). Trading for ore seems most valuable since I only have 1 currently.

<plan>
1. Trade brick for ore now to start accumulating city resources
2. Use YEAR_OF_PLENTY card strategically when I'm close to building a city
3. Focus on upgrading settlements to cities (need ore/wheat)
4. Maintain longest road advantage
5. Path to victory: 3 settlements (3 VP) + 2 cities (4 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + potential dev card VP (1 VP) = 10 VP
</plan>

Based on this analysis, I should trade my excess brick for ore to work toward city upgrades.

PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist focused on defeating the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRITICAL FOR SUCCESS):
- Above all else, target the highest probability numbers (6 & 8) - these produce resources 5/36 times each
- Strictly prioritize access to all five resources between your two settlements
- Aim for numerical diversity - try to cover 5-6 different dice numbers across your settlements
- Never place initial settlements without analyzing future expansion opportunities
- Prioritize placement on hexes with complementary resources: ore/wheat and brick/wood
- Position roads toward high-value unoccupied areas the opponent cannot easily block
- Choose second settlement to complement your first settlement's resource weaknesses
- Consider 3:1 ports if you can't access a specific resource through settlements
- Analyze opponent placement to avoid contested expansion paths
- ALWAYS calculate production value using probability dots (5-6-8-9 are top priority numbers)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-10):
- Build at least one new settlement by turn 10 - expansion is your TOP priority
- Calculate and build along the fastest path to your next settlement location
- Secure missing resources through strategic settlement placement
- Build roads that secure critical expansion paths before the opponent blocks them
- Avoid development cards completely until you have at least 3 total settlements
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1) to complete critical builds
- Target resource diversity through your expansion locations
- Create a minimum 2-turn expansion plan and stick to it

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT AND PRODUCTION (CORE STRATEGY):
- Early game: Focus on wood/brick to expand with roads and settlements
- Mid game: Transition to ore/wheat focus for cities and development cards
- Calculate the resource production value of every potential build
- Only make 4:1 trades when they enable an immediate important build
- Cycle through "build phases" - expansion phase, then city upgrade phase
- Plan resource collection 2 turns ahead to minimize wasteful trades
- Never accumulate 7+ cards before dice rolls
- Diversify production to minimize dependency on any single resource
- Target a minimum of 4 total settlements before prioritizing city upgrades

COUNTERING ALPHABETA ALGORITHM:
- AlphaBeta looks ahead only 2 steps, so plan your moves 3-4 steps ahead
- Create deceptive game states that appear less threatening than they are
- Block the opponent's highest-probability expansion paths immediately
- Play defensively during early game, then aggressively in mid-game
- When opponent has 7+ points, disrupt their highest-producing hex with the robber
- Track opponent's resources and block their most likely next build
- Secure resources that the opponent depends on heavily
- Place roads to cut off opponent from accessing high-value settlement locations
- Position settlements to deny opponent access to key resource hex intersections

ROBBER PLACEMENT AND KNIGHT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-producing hex of your opponent
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat in mid-game when cities are being built
- Target the specific resource the opponent needs for their next likely build
- Use knight cards reactively when the robber blocks your best production
- Save knight cards for the late game if pursuing largest army
- When stealing, select resources that complete your immediate build needs
- Keep track of opponent cards and target resources they've been collecting
- Balance robber placement between disruption and resource acquisition

DEVELOPMENT CARDS VS. BUILDING:
- Only buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and cannot build
- Buy development cards when you're 1-2 knights away from largest army
- Use knight cards immediately when advantageous (don't save unless close to largest army)
- Victory point cards should only supplement your main strategy, not replace it
- Road Building cards are most valuable when you're cut off or racing to a key location
- Monopoly is best used after high-probability dice rolls to collect opponent's stockpile
- Year of Plenty is ideal to complete a high-value build (settlement or city)
- NEVER delay settlement/city building to purchase development cards unless 1 VP from winning

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY FOCUS):
- Aim for 5 total settlements (2 upgraded to cities) = 9 VP
- Then secure largest army OR longest road for the final point
- Always calculate the fastest path to 10 VP in terms of resource costs
- For each potential build, calculate how many turns closer it gets you to victory
- Determine which victory paths are still viable based on board state
- Switch strategies when your primary path is blocked
- Plan for the end-game by turn 10 (know exactly how you will reach 10 points)
- Track opponent's path to victory and actively disrupt with roads or robber

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Trade at ports even at 4:1 ratio if it enables immediate critical build
- NEVER trade with opponent unless it enables an immediate settlement/city build
- Avoid trades that allow opponent to build immediately after you
- Calculate the net VP gain of each potential trade
- Use trades to dispose of resources when at risk from robber
- Combine multiple port trades to convert unwanted resources into needed ones
- Be willing to overpay through port trades to secure critical positional advantage

DECISION FRAMEWORK (APPLY TO EVERY TURN):
1. What is my immediate build priority? (settlement > city > longest road/largest army)
2. What resource do I need to complete my highest priority build?
3. What is the fastest way to acquire that resource? (production, trading, development cards)
4. How will this action position me for the next 3 turns?
5. Will this action disrupt my opponent's path to victory?
6. Is there a way to combine multiple actions this turn for greater efficiency?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game Analysis for Settlers of Catan - Turn 36

I'll analyze the current game state and determine the optimal action to maximize my chances of winning.

## Current Game State Summary
- I (BLUE) have 5/10 victory points: 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP)
- Opponent (RED) has 4/10 victory points with 4 settlements
- My resources: 1 WHEAT, 3 ORE
- I have 1 YEAR_OF_PLENTY development card
- I need to reach 10 VP to win

## Path to Victory Assessment
My current plan focuses on upgrading settlements to cities:
- Each city upgrade costs 3 ORE + 2 WHEAT
- I currently have 3 ORE + 1 WHEAT
- I need 1 more WHEAT to build my first city

## Action Options Analysis
I have two main choices:
1. Use YEAR_OF_PLENTY card now to get resources
2. Roll the dice to potentially gain more resources

### Option 1: Use YEAR_OF_PLENTY
If I use the card, what combination of resources would be best?
- I need 1 more WHEAT to build a city (with my existing 3 ORE, 1 WHEAT)
- Getting WHEAT + WHEAT or WHEAT + ORE would allow immediate city build
- Option [14] (WHEAT, WHEAT) or [11] (WHEAT, ORE) would enable a city upgrade

### Option 2: Roll Dice
If I roll:
- I risk the robber with 7
- I could potentially get the WHEAT I need naturally
- I preserve my YEAR_OF_PLENTY for a more critical situation

## Strategic Decision
The safest path to my first city is to use YEAR_OF_PLENTY for WHEAT + ORE:
- This guarantees a city upgrade this turn
- Cities provide double resource production
- This accelerates my path to victory
- Option [11] gets me WHEAT + ORE, which with my current resources makes 4 ORE + 2 WHEAT, allowing me to build a city

<plan>
1. Use YEAR_OF_PLENTY for WHEAT + ORE to build a city this turn
2. Prioritize city upgrades to increase resource production
3. Maintain longest road advantage
4. Path to victory: 3 settlements (3 VP) + 2 cities (4 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + potential dev card VP (1 VP) = 10 VP
</plan>

PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist focused on defeating the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRITICAL FOR SUCCESS):
- Above all else, target the highest probability numbers (6 & 8) - these produce resources 5/36 times each
- Strictly prioritize access to all five resources between your two settlements
- Aim for numerical diversity - try to cover 5-6 different dice numbers across your settlements
- Never place initial settlements without analyzing future expansion opportunities
- Prioritize placement on hexes with complementary resources: ore/wheat and brick/wood
- Position roads toward high-value unoccupied areas the opponent cannot easily block
- Choose second settlement to complement your first settlement's resource weaknesses
- Consider 3:1 ports if you can't access a specific resource through settlements

# Game Analysis for Turn 36

I need to thoroughly analyze the game state and make the optimal decision to maximize my winning chances.

## Current Status Assessment
- I have 5/10 victory points (3 settlements + longest road bonus)
- Resources: 2 Wheat, 4 Ore
- Red has 4 points with 4 settlements
- I hold longest road with 7 segments vs Red's 4 segments
- No largest army established yet

## Available Actions Analysis
My options are:
1. Upgrade settlement at node 2 (🧱5, 🌲6, 🌾8) - highest producing settlement
2. Upgrade settlement at node 12 (🌾8, 🐑4) - medium producing settlement
3. Upgrade settlement at node 0 (🧱5, ⛏️10) - lower producing settlement
4-7. Various trade options using my Ore (not useful since I need ore for city upgrades)
0. End turn

## Strategic Considerations

1. **Production Maximization**:
   - Node 2 is my highest producing settlement with 8 probability dots (6, 8 numbers)
   - Upgrading it would double this production to help fund future developments

2. **Path to Victory**:
   - Current: 5 VP (3 settlements + longest road)
   - After city upgrade: 6 VP (2 settlements + 1 city + longest road)
   - Path to 10 VP: Need 4 more points (could come from another city upgrade + 2 more points)

3. **Resource Analysis**:
   - I have exactly enough resources (2 Wheat, 4 Ore) to build one city
   - Building a city now uses all resources but positions me better for future turns

4. **Opponent Analysis**:
   - Red has 4 points but 4 settlements, making city upgrades their likely next step
   - Red lacks longest road so I maintain that advantage

## Decision Logic
Since I can build a city, I should absolutely do so rather than ending my turn. The question is which settlement to upgrade.

- Node 2 has numbers 5, 6, and 8 (total 8 dots) - highest production value
- Node 12 has numbers 4 and 8 (total 4 dots)
- Node 0 has numbers 5 and 10 (total 3 dots)

The clear choice is to upgrade Node 2 to maximize future resource production, especially since it includes the valuable 6 and 8 numbers.

<plan>
1. Upgrade settlement at node 2 to city this turn
2. Continue focus on city upgrades at node 12 next (need to gather resources)
3. Maintain longest road advantage
4. Path to victory: 2 settlements (2 VP) + 2 cities (4 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + potential dev card VP (1-2 VP) = 10 VP
</plan>

- Victory point cards should only supplement your main strategy, not replace it
- Road Building cards are most valuable when you're cut off or racing to a key location
- Monopoly is best used after high-probability dice rolls to collect opponent's stockpile
- Year of Plenty is ideal to complete a high-value build (settlement or city)
- NEVER delay settlement/city building to purchase development cards unless 1 VP from winning

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY FOCUS):
- Aim for 5 total settlements (2 upgraded to cities) = 9 VP
- Then secure largest army OR longest road for the final point
- Always calculate the fastest path to 10 VP in terms of resource costs
- For each potential build, calculate how many turns closer it gets you to victory
- Determine which victory paths are still viable based on board state
- Switch strategies when your primary path is blocked
- Plan for the end-game by turn 10 (know exactly how you will reach 10 points)
- Track opponent's path to victory and actively disrupt with roads or robber

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Trade at ports even at 4:1 ratio if it enables immediate critical build
- NEVER trade with opponent unless it enables an immediate settlement/city build
- Avoid trades that allow opponent to build immediately after you
- Calculate the net VP gain of each potential trade
- Use trades to dispose of resources when at risk from robber
- Combine multiple port trades to convert unwanted resources into needed ones
- Be willing to overpay through port trades to secure critical positional advantage

DECISION FRAMEWORK (APPLY TO EVERY TURN):
1. What is my immediate build priority? (settlement > city > longest road/largest army)
2. What resource do I need to complete my highest priority build?
3. What is the fastest way to acquire that resource? (production, trading, development cards)
4. How will this action position me for the next 3 turns?
5. Will this action disrupt my opponent's path to victory?
6. Is there a way to combine multiple actions this turn for greater efficiency?

# Game State Analysis

Let me carefully analyze the current game state to determine my optimal move:

## Victory Point Status
- I (BLUE) have 6 VP: 2 settlements (2 VP) + 1 city (2 VP) + longest road (2 VP)
- RED has 4 VP: 4 settlements (4 VP)
- I need 4 more VP to win

## Resources
- I have 4 🌲WOOD and 1 ⛏️ORE
- To upgrade a settlement to a city costs: 2 ORE + 3 WHEAT
- I'm short 1 ORE and need 3 WHEAT for a city upgrade

## Current Plan Evaluation
My current plan is to upgrade settlement at node 2 to a city. However, this is incorrect as node 2 is already a city according to the board state. The plan needs to be updated.

## Settlement/City Analysis
- Node 12 has a settlement (producing 🌾8[⭐⭐⭐], 🐑4[⭐]) - high wheat production
- Node 0 has a settlement (producing 🧱5[⭐⭐], ⛏️10[⭐]) - ore production

## Available Actions
1. End Turn
2-5. Maritime trades with 4 WOOD

## Strategic Decision

Given that:
1. I don't have enough resources to build anything immediately
2. I have 4 WOOD which can be traded for another needed resource
3. My path to victory requires upgrading settlements to cities
4. For city upgrades, I need ORE and WHEAT

The most strategic move would be to trade for a resource I need for city upgrades. Since I already have 1 ORE, trading for another ORE would bring me closer to being able to upgrade one of my settlements to a city next turn.

<plan>
1. Trade WOOD for ORE this turn to prepare for city upgrade at node 12
2. Continue gathering WHEAT (need 3) for the city upgrade
3. Maintain longest road advantage (currently 7 segments)
4. Path to victory: 2 settlements (2 VP) + 2 cities (4 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + potential dev cards (1-2 VP) = 10 VP
</plan>

Trading 4 WOOD for 1 ORE (option 4) is the optimal choice to prepare for my next city upgrade.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist focused on defeating the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRITICAL FOR SUCCESS):
- Above all else, target the highest probability numbers (6 & 8) - these produce resources 5/36 times each
- Strictly prioritize access to all five resources between your two settlements
- Aim for numerical diversity - try to cover 5-6 different dice numbers across your settlements
- Never place initial settlements without analyzing future expansion opportunities
- Prioritize placement on hexes with complementary resources: ore/wheat and brick/wood
- Position roads toward high-value unoccupied areas the opponent cannot easily block
- Choose second settlement to complement your first settlement's resource weaknesses
- Consider 3:1 ports if you can't access a specific resource through settlements
- Analyze opponent placement to avoid contested expansion paths
- ALWAYS calculate production value using probability dots (5-6-8-9 are top priority numbers)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-10):
- Build at least one new settlement by turn 10 - expansion is your TOP priority
- Calculate and build along the fastest path to your next settlement location
- Secure missing resources through strategic settlement placement
- Build roads that secure critical expansion paths before the opponent blocks them
- Avoid development cards completely until you have at least 3 total settlements
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1) to complete critical builds
- Target resource diversity through your expansion locations
- Create a minimum 2-turn expansion plan and stick to it

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT AND PRODUCTION (CORE STRATEGY):
- Early game: Focus on wood/brick to expand with roads and settlements
- Mid game: Transition to ore/wheat focus for cities and development cards
- Calculate the resource production value of every potential build
- Only make 4:1 trades when they enable an immediate important build
- Cycle through "build phases" - expansion phase, then city upgrade phase
- Plan resource collection 2 turns ahead to minimize wasteful trades
- Never accumulate 7+ cards before dice rolls
- Diversify production to minimize dependency on any single resource
- Target a minimum of 4 total settlements before prioritizing city upgrades

COUNTERING ALPHABETA ALGORITHM:
- AlphaBeta looks ahead only 2 steps, so plan your moves 3-4 steps ahead
- Create deceptive game states that appear less threatening than they are
- Block the opponent's highest-probability expansion paths immediately
- Play defensively during early game, then aggressively in mid-game
- When opponent has 7+ points, disrupt their highest-producing hex with the robber
- Track opponent's resources and block their most likely next build
- Secure resources that the opponent depends on heavily
- Place roads to cut off opponent from accessing high-value settlement locations
- Position settlements to deny opponent access to key resource hex intersections

ROBBER PLACEMENT AND KNIGHT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-producing hex of your opponent
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat in mid-game when cities are being built
- Target the specific resource the opponent needs for their next likely build
- Use knight cards reactively when the robber blocks your best production
- Save knight cards for the late game if pursuing largest army
- When stealing, select resources that complete your immediate build needs
- Keep track of opponent cards and target resources they've been collecting
- Balance robber placement between disruption and resource acquisition

DEVELOPMENT CARDS VS. BUILDING:
- Only buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and cannot build
- Buy development cards when you're 1-2 knights away from largest army
- Use knight cards immediately when advantageous (don't save unless close to largest army)
- Victory point cards should only supplement your main strategy, not replace it
- Road Building cards are most valuable when you're cut off or racing to a key location
- Monopoly is best used after high-probability dice rolls to collect opponent's stockpile
- Year of Plenty is ideal to complete a high-value build (settlement or city)
- NEVER delay settlement/city building to purchase development cards unless 1 VP from winning

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY FOCUS):
- Aim for 5 total settlements (2 upgraded to cities) = 9 VP
- Then secure largest army OR longest road for the final point
- Always calculate the fastest path to 10 VP in terms of resource costs
- For each potential build, calculate how many turns closer it gets you to victory
- Determine which victory paths are still viable based on board state
- Switch strategies when your primary path is blocked
- Plan for the end-game by turn 10 (know exactly how you will reach 10 points)
- Track opponent's path to victory and actively disrupt with roads or robber

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Trade at ports even at 4:1 ratio if it enables immediate critical build
- NEVER trade with opponent unless it enables an immediate settlement/city build
- Avoid trades that allow opponent to build immediately after you
- Calculate the net VP gain of each potential trade
- Use trades to dispose of resources when at risk from robber
- Combine multiple port trades to convert unwanted resources into needed ones
- Be willing to overpay through port trades to secure critical positional advantage

DECISION FRAMEWORK (APPLY TO EVERY TURN):
1. What is my immediate build priority? (settlement > city > longest road/largest army)
2. What resource do I need to complete my highest priority build?
3. What is the fastest way to acquire that resource? (production, trading, development cards)
4. How will this action position me for the next 3 turns?
5. Will this action disrupt my opponent's path to victory?
6. Is there a way to combine multiple actions this turn for greater efficiency?

# Game State Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state to determine my optimal move:

## Current Game Status
- BLUE (me): 6 VP (2 settlements + 1 city + 2 VP for longest road)
- RED: 5 VP (5 settlements)
- My resources: 2 WOOD, 3 WHEAT, 3 ORE
- Available actions: End turn, build city at node 12, build city at node 0

## Victory Path Assessment
Currently I have 6 VP and need 4 more to win. RED has 5 VP.
- If I can upgrade both my settlements to cities, that's +2 VP
- I already have longest road (+2 VP)
- Future development cards could provide additional VP

## Resource Analysis
To build a city, I need 2 WHEAT and 3 ORE.
I currently have 3 WHEAT and 3 ORE, which is exactly enough to build one city.

## Strategic Considerations:
1. Node 12 produces WHEAT (8) and SHEEP (4)
   - The 8 is a high-value production number
   - Upgrading would double my WHEAT production on this valuable hex

2. Node 0 produces BRICK (5) and ORE (10)
   - Less valuable production numbers
   - ORE is important for future city upgrades

3. RED has 5 VP already and is catching up with 5 settlements
   - I need to accelerate my VP gain

## Decision Logic
I should build a city this turn rather than ending my turn because:
1. I have exactly the resources needed for a city
2. City upgrades are critical to my victory path
3. It immediately gives me +1 VP, increasing my lead over RED

Between the two city options, node 12 is clearly superior because:
- It's on an "8" which is one of the highest probability rolls
- Doubling WHEAT production helps with future city upgrades
- WHEAT is a key resource I need for further development

<plan>
1. Build city at node 12 this turn to reach 7 VP
2. Continue maintaining longest road advantage (7 segments)
3. Focus on gathering resources for second city upgrade at node 0
4. Path to victory: 1 settlement (1 VP) + 2 cities (4 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + potential dev cards (1-2 VP) = 10 VP
</plan>

# Game State Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state and available options:

## Victory Point Status
- I (BLUE) have 7/10 VP: 1 settlement (1 VP) + 2 cities (4 VP) + longest road (2 VP)
- RED has 5/10 VP from 5 settlements

## Resources
I have: 1 🌲WOOD, 3 🧱BRICK, 2 🐑SHEEP, 1 🌾WHEAT

## Available Actions
- End turn [0]
- Build roads (options 1-9) - Cost: 1 🌲WOOD, 1 🧱BRICK
- Build settlement at node 22 [10] - Cost: 1 🌲WOOD, 1 🧱BRICK, 1 🌾WHEAT, 1 🐑SHEEP

## Strategic Considerations

1. **VP Calculation**: Building a new settlement would increase my VP to 8/10, getting closer to victory.
2. **Resource Production**: Node 22 appears to be on the ⛏️10 hex, which would improve my ore production.
3. **I have exactly the resources needed** to build a settlement at node 22.
4. **Opponent Status**: RED has 5 VP and already has 5 settlements but no cities. They'll likely focus on upgrading to cities or development cards next.
5. **Position on Board**: Building at node 22 expands my territory and provides resource diversity.

## Decision Analysis
Building a settlement at node 22 provides immediate benefits:
- Increases VPs from 7 to 8
- Provides additional production (including ore which I need)
- Uses resources efficiently
- Strengthens my position toward victory

Analyzing other options:
- Building additional roads [1-9] doesn't provide immediate VP gains and isn't necessary since I already have longest road.
- Ending turn [0] wastes this opportunity to advance toward victory.

<plan>
1. Build settlement at node 22 to reach 8 VP
2. Continue maintaining longest road advantage
3. Next focus on gathering resources for city upgrade at node 0 to reach 9 VP
4. Then secure one more VP through development card or another settlement for victory
</plan>

The optimal action is to build a settlement at node 22, which advances my victory point count and improves resource production.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist focused on defeating the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRITICAL FOR SUCCESS):
- Above all else, target the highest probability numbers (6 & 8) - these produce resources 5/36 times each
- Strictly prioritize access to all five resources between your two settlements
- Aim for numerical diversity - try to cover 5-6 different dice numbers across your settlements
- Never place initial settlements without analyzing future expansion opportunities
- Prioritize placement on hexes with complementary resources: ore/wheat and brick/wood
- Position roads toward high-value unoccupied areas the opponent cannot easily block
- Choose second settlement to complement your first settlement's resource weaknesses
- Consider 3:1 ports if you can't access a specific resource through settlements
- Analyze opponent placement to avoid contested expansion paths
- ALWAYS calculate production value using probability dots (5-6-8-9 are top priority numbers)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-10):
- Build at least one new settlement by turn 10 - expansion is your TOP priority
- Calculate and build along the fastest path to your next settlement location
- Secure missing resources through strategic settlement placement
- Build roads that secure critical expansion paths before the opponent blocks them
- Avoid development cards completely until you have at least 3 total settlements
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1) to complete critical builds
- Target resource diversity through your expansion locations
- Create a minimum 2-turn expansion plan and stick to it

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT AND PRODUCTION (CORE STRATEGY):
- Early game: Focus on wood/brick to expand with roads and settlements
- Mid game: Transition to ore/wheat focus for cities and development cards
- Calculate the resource production value of every potential build
- Only make 4:1 trades when they enable an immediate important build
- Cycle through "build phases" - expansion phase, then city upgrade phase
- Plan resource collection 2 turns ahead to minimize wasteful trades
- Never accumulate 7+ cards before dice rolls
- Diversify production to minimize dependency on any single resource
- Target a minimum of 4 total settlements before prioritizing city upgrades

COUNTERING ALPHABETA ALGORITHM:
- AlphaBeta looks ahead only 2 steps, so plan your moves 3-4 steps ahead
- Create deceptive game states that appear less threatening than they are
- Block the opponent's highest-probability expansion paths immediately
- Play defensively during early game, then aggressively in mid-game
- When opponent has 7+ points, disrupt their highest-producing hex with the robber
- Track opponent's resources and block their most likely next build
- Secure resources that the opponent depends on heavily
- Place roads to cut off opponent from accessing high-value settlement locations
- Position settlements to deny opponent access to key resource hex intersections

ROBBER PLACEMENT AND KNIGHT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-producing hex of your opponent
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat in mid-game when cities are being built
- Target the specific resource the opponent needs for their next likely build
- Use knight cards reactively when the robber blocks your best production
- Save knight cards for the late game if pursuing largest army
- When stealing, select resources that complete your immediate build needs
- Keep track of opponent cards and target resources they've been collecting
- Balance robber placement between disruption and resource acquisition

DEVELOPMENT CARDS VS. BUILDING:
- Only buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and cannot build
- Buy development cards when you're 1-2 knights away from largest army
- Use knight cards immediately when advantageous (don't save unless close to largest army)
- Victory point cards should only supplement your main strategy, not replace it
- Road Building cards are most valuable when you're cut off or racing to a key location
- Monopoly is best used after high-probability dice rolls to collect opponent's stockpile
- Year of Plenty is ideal to complete a high-value build (settlement or city)
- NEVER delay settlement/city building to purchase development cards unless 1 VP from winning

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY FOCUS):
- Aim for 5 total settlements (2 upgraded to cities) = 9 VP
- Then secure largest army OR longest road for the final point
- Always calculate the fastest path to 10 VP in terms of resource costs
- For each potential build, calculate how many turns closer it gets you to victory
- Determine which victory paths are still viable based on board state
- Switch strategies when your primary path is blocked
- Plan for the end-game by turn 10 (know exactly how you will reach 10 points)
- Track opponent's path to victory and actively disrupt with roads or robber

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Trade at ports even at 4:1 ratio if it enables immediate critical build
- NEVER trade with opponent unless it enables an immediate settlement/city build
- Avoid trades that allow opponent to build immediately after you
- Calculate the net VP gain of each potential trade
- Use trades to dispose of resources when at risk from robber
- Combine multiple port trades to convert unwanted resources into needed ones
- Be willing to overpay through port trades to secure critical positional advantage

DECISION FRAMEWORK (APPLY TO EVERY TURN):
1. What is my immediate build priority? (settlement > city > longest road/largest army)
2. What resource do I need to complete my highest priority build?
3. What is the fastest way to acquire that resource? (production, trading, development cards)
4. How will this action position me for the next 3 turns?
5. Will this action disrupt my opponent's path to victory?
6. Is there a way to combine multiple actions this turn for greater efficiency?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 52 | Player: BLUE | Action: MOVE_ROBBER

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Build settlement at node 22 to reach 8 VP
2. Continue maintaining longest road advantage
3. Next focus on gathering resources for city upgrade at node 0 to reach 9 VP
4. Then secure one more VP through development card or another settlement for victory
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.

# Robber Placement Analysis

I need to carefully consider where to place the robber to maximize my advantage while disrupting my opponent's production.

Let me analyze each hex option:

## Analyzing Robber Placement Options:

**[0] Move robber to (0, 0, 0) - BRICK tile with number 5**
- This would block RED's settlement at node 4
- RED has 1 settlement producing brick here
- This is a good probability tile (5 dots)
- DOWNSIDE: This would also block my own city at node 2 and settlement at node 0

**[1] Move robber to (1, -1, 0) - WOOD tile with number 6**
- This would block RED's settlement at node 6
- Wood has high production value (number 6 = 5 dots)
- DOWNSIDE: This would also block my own city at node 2

**[2] Move robber to (-1, 0, 1) - SHEEP tile with number 4**
- This would block RED's settlements at nodes 4 and 14
- RED has 2 settlements producing sheep here
- DOWNSIDE: Low production value (number 4 = only 3 dots)
- DOWNSIDE: Would block my city at node 12

**[3] Move robber to (-1, 1, 0) - WHEAT tile with number 9**
- This would block RED's settlements at nodes 4, 16, and 17
- RED has 3 settlements producing wheat here!
- Decent production value (number 9 = 4 dots)
- No impact on my production (I don't have settlements on this hex)

**[4] Move robber to (0, 1, -1) - DESERT tile**
- This has no production value
- Placing robber here would waste my robber move

**[5] Move robber to (1, 0, -1) - ORE tile with number 10**
- This would block RED's settlement at node 6
- Would also block my own settlements at nodes 0 and 22
- Lower production value (number 10 = 3 dots)
- This would hurt my ore production significantly

## Strategic Decision:

Option [3] is clearly the best choice:
1. It blocks RED's wheat production from 3 different settlements
2. Wheat is critical for settlements, cities, and development cards
3. It doesn't affect any of my production
4. It targets a decent probability tile (9 = 4 dots)
5. At this stage of the game, RED needs wheat to build cities to catch up

<plan>
1. Block RED's wheat production to slow their city development
2. Continue maintaining longest road advantage
3. Next focus on gathering resources for city upgrade at node 0 to reach 9 VP
4. Then secure one more VP through development card or another settlement for victory

# Game Analysis: Turn 52

Let me analyze the current game state and available options carefully.

## Current Game Status
- I (BLUE) have 8/10 victory points
- RED has 5/10 victory points
- I have longest road (+2 VP)
- I have resources: 2 WOOD, 2 BRICK, 1 SHEEP, 1 WHEAT
- Available actions: End turn or build a road at one of 8 possible locations

## Victory Point Analysis
My 8 VP come from:
- 2 settlements (2 VP)
- 2 cities (4 VP) 
- Longest road bonus (2 VP)
- Need 2 more VP to win

## Resource Analysis
With 2 WOOD and 2 BRICK, I can build exactly one more road.

## Strategic Considerations

1. **Maintain Longest Road**: Currently I have the longest road at 7 segments vs RED's 4. RED is unlikely to overtake this soon, so maintaining it isn't an immediate concern.

2. **Path to Victory**: My current plan involves upgrading a settlement to a city (at node 0) which requires 3 ORE and 2 WHEAT. I currently only have 1 WHEAT and 0 ORE. 

3. **Defensive Position**: I should evaluate if any of the road placements can block RED's potential expansion.

4. **Future Growth**: Which road placement positions me best for future builds?

## Road Placement Options Analysis

Looking at the board, I need to assess which road placement:
- Protects my longest road status
- Sets me up for future expansion
- Blocks RED's potential expansion

Without a detailed map showing all existing roads and potential settlement spots, I'll analyze based on the limited information:

- Building at edge (19, 20) or (22, 23) could potentially extend toward unexplored territory.
- Building at edge (0, 5) would connect my settlement at node 0 to new paths.
- Building at edge (1, 6) might block RED's expansion as they have a settlement at node 6.

Since I already have significant lead over RED (8 VP vs 5 VP) and a strong longest road advantage, my priority should be positioning for either:
1) A new settlement location with good resources (ideally ore/wheat for city building)
2) Blocking RED from expanding into valuable territory

Based on the limited visualization of the board, I believe edge (0, 5) provides the best strategic advantage as it connects to my settlement at node 0 and opens new expansion paths.

<plan>
1. Build road at edge (0, 5) to open expansion opportunities
2. Focus on gathering ore and wheat for city upgrade at node 0
3. If I can't get a city built quickly, look to build a new settlement as another path to 10 VP
4. Continue to block RED's expansion where possible
</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist focused on defeating the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRITICAL FOR SUCCESS):
- Above all else, target the highest probability numbers (6 & 8) - these produce resources 5/36 times each
- Strictly prioritize access to all five resources between your two settlements
- Aim for numerical diversity - try to cover 5-6 different dice numbers across your settlements
- Never place initial settlements without analyzing future expansion opportunities
- Prioritize placement on hexes with complementary resources: ore/wheat and brick/wood
- Position roads toward high-value unoccupied areas the opponent cannot easily block
- Choose second settlement to complement your first settlement's resource weaknesses
- Consider 3:1 ports if you can't access a specific resource through settlements
- Analyze opponent placement to avoid contested expansion paths
- ALWAYS calculate production value using probability dots (5-6-8-9 are top priority numbers)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-10):
- Build at least one new settlement by turn 10 - expansion is your TOP priority
- Calculate and build along the fastest path to your next settlement location
- Secure missing resources through strategic settlement placement
- Build roads that secure critical expansion paths before the opponent blocks them
- Avoid development cards completely until you have at least 3 total settlements
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1) to complete critical builds
- Target resource diversity through your expansion locations
- Create a minimum 2-turn expansion plan and stick to it

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT AND PRODUCTION (CORE STRATEGY):
- Early game: Focus on wood/brick to expand with roads and settlements
- Mid game: Transition to ore/wheat focus for cities and development cards
- Calculate the resource production value of every potential build
- Only make 4:1 trades when they enable an immediate important build
- Cycle through "build phases" - expansion phase, then city upgrade phase
- Plan resource collection 2 turns ahead to minimize wasteful trades
- Never accumulate 7+ cards before dice rolls
- Diversify production to minimize dependency on any single resource
- Target a minimum of 4 total settlements before prioritizing city upgrades

COUNTERING ALPHABETA ALGORITHM:
- AlphaBeta looks ahead only 2 steps, so plan your moves 3-4 steps ahead
- Create deceptive game states that appear less threatening than they are
- Block the opponent's highest-probability expansion paths immediately
- Play defensively during early game, then aggressively in mid-game
- When opponent has 7+ points, disrupt their highest-producing hex with the robber
- Track opponent's resources and block their most likely next build
- Secure resources that the opponent depends on heavily
- Place roads to cut off opponent from accessing high-value settlement locations
- Position settlements to deny opponent access to key resource hex intersections

ROBBER PLACEMENT AND KNIGHT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-producing hex of your opponent
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat in mid-game when cities are being built
- Target the specific resource the opponent needs for their next likely build
- Use knight cards reactively when the robber blocks your best production
- Save knight cards for the late game if pursuing largest army
- When stealing, select resources that complete your immediate build needs
- Keep track of opponent cards and target resources they've been collecting
- Balance robber placement between disruption and resource acquisition

DEVELOPMENT CARDS VS. BUILDING:
- Only buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and cannot build
- Buy development cards when you're 1-2 knights away from largest army
- Use knight cards immediately when advantageous (don't save unless close to largest army)
- Victory point cards should only supplement your main strategy, not replace it
- Road Building cards are most valuable when you're cut off or racing to a key location
- Monopoly is best used after high-probability dice rolls to collect opponent's stockpile
- Year of Plenty is ideal to complete a high-value build (settlement or city)
- NEVER delay settlement/city building to purchase development cards unless 1 VP from winning

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY FOCUS):
- Aim for 5 total settlements (2 upgraded to cities) = 9 VP
- Then secure largest army OR longest road for the final point
- Always calculate the fastest path to 10 VP in terms of resource costs
- For each potential build, calculate how many turns closer it gets you to victory
- Determine which victory paths are still viable based on board state
- Switch strategies when your primary path is blocked
- Plan for the end-game by turn 10 (know exactly how you will reach 10 points)
- Track opponent's path to victory and actively disrupt with roads or robber

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Trade at ports even at 4:1 ratio if it enables immediate critical build
- NEVER trade with opponent unless it enables an immediate settlement/city build
- Avoid trades that allow opponent to build immediately after you
- Calculate the net VP gain of each potential trade
- Use trades to dispose of resources when at risk from robber
- Combine multiple port trades to convert unwanted resources into needed ones
- Be willing to overpay through port trades to secure critical positional advantage

DECISION FRAMEWORK (APPLY TO EVERY TURN):
1. What is my immediate build priority? (settlement > city > longest road/largest army)
2. What resource do I need to complete my highest priority build?
3. What is the fastest way to acquire that resource? (production, trading, development cards)
4. How will this action position me for the next 3 turns?
5. Will this action disrupt my opponent's path to victory?
6. Is there a way to combine multiple actions this turn for greater efficiency?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game State Analysis

I need to carefully analyze my position and available actions to make the optimal move.

## Current Position:
- I have 8 VP (2 settlements, 2 cities, longest road)
- I need 2 more VP to win
- I have 1 wood, 1 brick, 1 sheep, 1 wheat - enough resources to build a road
- RED has 5 VP (5 settlements), and is expanding their network

## Victory Path Options:
1. Build a new settlement (+1 VP) and upgrade an existing settlement to city (+1 VP)
2. Build a new settlement (+1 VP) and acquire a VP from a development card
3. Maintain longest road (+2 VP) while continuing to strengthen my position

## Available Actions Analysis:
I can only build roads with my current resources. Let me evaluate each road option:

- [1] Edge (9, 10): Connects toward nodes 9 and 10 near wheat and wood hexes
- [2] Edge (13, 14): Connects toward RED's settlement at node 14 - not useful
- [3] Edge (3, 4): Connects near RED's settlement at node 4 - defensive but not helpful
- [4] Edge (19, 20): Extends toward the desert hex area
- [5] Edge (22, 23): Extends from my settlement at node 22
- [6] Edge (11, 12): Connects near my city at node 12
- [7] Edge (1, 6): Connects toward RED's settlement at node 6 - not beneficial

For optimal play, I should determine which road:
1. Secures longest road status (already have it with 7 segments vs RED's 4)
2. Opens up the best expansion options for new settlements
3. Blocks RED from potential expansion

Looking at the node connectivity and my current settlements, I need to identify expansion opportunities while maintaining longest road advantage.

## Decision

Edge (22, 23) appears most valuable as it extends from my settlement at node 22, creating expansion potential in an area I already have presence. It helps maintain my longest road while positioning me for future settlement placement.

<plan>
1. Build road at edge (22, 23) to strengthen my position near settlement at node 22
2. Continue gathering resources for city upgrade or new settlement
3. Maintain longest road advantage to preserve 2 VP
4. Target ore/wheat for city upgrades as my primary path to 10 VP

# Analyzing Turn 54: Robber Movement Decision

I need to analyze where to place the robber to maximize my advantage while disrupting RED's production.

## Game State Analysis:
- I'm BLUE with 8 VP (2 cities, 2 settlements, longest road)
- RED has 5 VP (5 settlements, no cities)
- I have few resources (1 sheep, 1 wheat)
- RED has 4 hidden cards

## Robber Placement Options Analysis:

**[0] Move robber to (0, 0, 0) - Brick 5 hex**
- Blocks RED's settlement at node 4 (🧱5)
- Also blocks my own settlement at node 0 (🧱5) and city at node 2 (🧱5)
- Disadvantage: Hurts my own brick production significantly

**[1] Move robber to (1, -1, 0) - Wood 6 hex**
- Blocks RED's settlement at node 6 (🌲6)
- Also blocks my own city at node 2 (🌲6)
- 6 is a high-probability number (⭐⭐⭐)
- Disadvantage: Blocks my own valuable wood production

**[2] Move robber to (0, -1, 1) - Wheat 8 hex**
- This would block both my cities at nodes 2 and 12 (🌾8)
- 8 is a high-probability number (⭐⭐⭐)
- No RED settlements affected
- Disadvantage: Severely hurts my own high-value wheat production

**[3] Move robber to (-1, 0, 1) - Sheep 4 hex**
- Blocks RED settlements at nodes 4 and 14 (🐑4)
- Also blocks my city at node 12 (🐑4)
- Low probability number (⭐)
- Advantage: Blocks multiple RED settlements 

**[4] Move robber to (0, 1, -1) - Desert hex**
- No production blocked (desert has no resource)
- Disadvantage: Wastes the robber move completely

**[5] Move robber to (1, 0, -1) - Ore 10 hex**
- Blocks RED settlement at node 6 (⛏️10)
- Also blocks my settlement at nodes 0 and 22 (⛏️10)
- Medium probability number (⭐)
- Disadvantage: Blocks my own ore production which I'll need for city upgrades

## Strategic Decision:
Option [3] is optimal because:
- It blocks TWO of RED's settlements (nodes 4 and 14)
- Blocks only sheep production which is less critical for city upgrades
- The hex has low production value (4 is low probability)
- I can steal one of RED's 4 cards
- This disrupts RED while minimizing impact on my critical resources

<plan>
1. Block RED's sheep production at (-1,0,1) to disrupt multiple RED settlements
2. Continue gathering resources for city upgrades (focus on ore/wheat)
3. Maintain longest road advantage to preserve 2 VP
4. Look to upgrade one of my settlements to a city when I gather enough resources
</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist focused on defeating the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRITICAL FOR SUCCESS):
- Above all else, target the highest probability numbers (6 & 8) - these produce resources 5/36 times each
- Strictly prioritize access to all five resources between your two settlements
- Aim for numerical diversity - try to cover 5-6 different dice numbers across your settlements
- Never place initial settlements without analyzing future expansion opportunities
- Prioritize placement on hexes with complementary resources: ore/wheat and brick/wood
- Position roads toward high-value unoccupied areas the opponent cannot easily block
- Choose second settlement to complement your first settlement's resource weaknesses
- Consider 3:1 ports if you can't access a specific resource through settlements
- Analyze opponent placement to avoid contested expansion paths
- ALWAYS calculate production value using probability dots (5-6-8-9 are top priority numbers)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-10):
- Build at least one new settlement by turn 10 - expansion is your TOP priority
- Calculate and build along the fastest path to your next settlement location
- Secure missing resources through strategic settlement placement
- Build roads that secure critical expansion paths before the opponent blocks them
- Avoid development cards completely until you have at least 3 total settlements
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1) to complete critical builds
- Target resource diversity through your expansion locations
- Create a minimum 2-turn expansion plan and stick to it

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT AND PRODUCTION (CORE STRATEGY):
- Early game: Focus on wood/brick to expand with roads and settlements
- Mid game: Transition to ore/wheat focus for cities and development cards
- Calculate the resource production value of every potential build
- Only make 4:1 trades when they enable an immediate important build
- Cycle through "build phases" - expansion phase, then city upgrade phase
- Plan resource collection 2 turns ahead to minimize wasteful trades
- Never accumulate 7+ cards before dice rolls
- Diversify production to minimize dependency on any single resource
- Target a minimum of 4 total settlements before prioritizing city upgrades

COUNTERING ALPHABETA ALGORITHM:
- AlphaBeta looks ahead only 2 steps, so plan your moves 3-4 steps ahead
- Create deceptive game states that appear less threatening than they are
- Block the opponent's highest-probability expansion paths immediately
- Play defensively during early game, then aggressively in mid-game
- When opponent has 7+ points, disrupt their highest-producing hex with the robber
- Track opponent's resources and block their most likely next build
- Secure resources that the opponent depends on heavily
- Place roads to cut off opponent from accessing high-value settlement locations
- Position settlements to deny opponent access to key resource hex intersections

ROBBER PLACEMENT AND KNIGHT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-producing hex of your opponent
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat in mid-game when cities are being built
- Target the specific resource the opponent needs for their next likely build
- Use knight cards reactively when the robber blocks your best production
- Save knight cards for the late game if pursuing largest army
- When stealing, select resources that complete your immediate build needs
- Keep track of opponent cards and target resources they've been collecting
- Balance robber placement between disruption and resource acquisition

DEVELOPMENT CARDS VS. BUILDING:
- Only buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and cannot build
- Buy development cards when you're 1-2 knights away from largest army
- Use knight cards immediately when advantageous (don't save unless close to largest army)
- Victory point cards should only supplement your main strategy, not replace it
- Road Building cards are most valuable when you're cut off or racing to a key location
- Monopoly is best used after high-probability dice rolls to collect opponent's stockpile
- Year of Plenty is ideal to complete a high-value build (settlement or city)
- NEVER delay settlement/city building to purchase development cards unless 1 VP from winning

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY FOCUS):
- Aim for 5 total settlements (2 upgraded to cities) = 9 VP
- Then secure largest army OR longest road for the final point
- Always calculate the fastest path to 10 VP in terms of resource costs
- For each potential build, calculate how many turns closer it gets you to victory
- Determine which victory paths are still viable based on board state
- Switch strategies when your primary path is blocked
- Plan for the end-game by turn 10 (know exactly how you will reach 10 points)
- Track opponent's path to victory and actively disrupt with roads or robber

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Trade at ports even at 4:1 ratio if it enables immediate critical build
- NEVER trade with opponent unless it enables an immediate settlement/city build
- Avoid trades that allow opponent to build immediately after you
- Calculate the net VP gain of each potential trade
- Use trades to dispose of resources when at risk from robber
- Combine multiple port trades to convert unwanted resources into needed ones
- Be willing to overpay through port trades to secure critical positional advantage

DECISION FRAMEWORK (APPLY TO EVERY TURN):
1. What is my immediate build priority? (settlement > city > longest road/largest army)
2. What resource do I need to complete my highest priority build?
3. What is the fastest way to acquire that resource? (production, trading, development cards)
4. How will this action position me for the next 3 turns?
5. Will this action disrupt my opponent's path to victory?
6. Is there a way to combine multiple actions this turn for greater efficiency?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game Analysis for Turn 60

I need to analyze my position, resources, and available options to determine the optimal move.

## Current Game State Assessment
- I have 8/10 victory points (2 cities, 2 settlements, longest road)
- RED has 5/10 victory points (5 settlements)
- I have 2 wood, 3 brick, 1 sheep, 1 wheat, 2 ore
- The robber is currently on wheat hex (0, -1, 1)

## Resource Production Analysis
- I have good production of wood, brick, and wheat
- RED has strong wheat production with 3 settlements on wheat hexes
- RED has limited ore production, which will constrain their city upgrades

## Victory Path Analysis
My fastest path to victory (2 more VP) would be:
1. Upgrade another settlement to city (+1 VP)
2. Maintain longest road (+2 VP already secured)

## Action Options Analysis

### Option 0: End Turn
- Not optimal as I have resources to build

### Options 1-6: Build Road
- I already have longest road with 8 segments vs RED's 4
- Building another road would primarily protect my longest road status
- Given I have 3 brick and 2 wood, I can afford a road without compromising other builds
- Roads could potentially open future settlement opportunities

### Option 7: Buy Development Card
- Cost: 1 sheep, 1 wheat, 1 ore
- Could be a victory point card (25% chance)
- Could be a knight (50% chance) - helpful for moving robber
- Could be a progress card (25% chance) - potentially useful

## Strategic Decision

Looking at my resources, I have 2 ore, which is halfway to a city upgrade (3 ore + 2 wheat). Building a road preserves my brick and wood resources which don't help with cities. Buying a development card uses my limited ore which would delay city building.

Since I'm at 8VP, my primary goal should be getting to 10VP as quickly as possible. RED is at 5VP, so I have a significant lead. I should focus on securing ore and wheat for a city upgrade.

<plan>
1. Build a strategic road to protect longest road and potentially block RED
2. Continue gathering resources (especially ore and wheat) for city upgrade
3. Maintain longest road advantage to preserve 2 VP
4. Move the robber to block RED's wheat production when possible
</plan>

For road placement, edges that could block RED's expansion or create strategic advantage are most valuable. Looking at the connected nodes, building at edge (3, 4) would connect to node 4 where RED has a settlement, potentially blocking them while strengthening my network.

Considering all factors, I'll build a road to protect my longest road status without using my critical ore resources needed for city upgrades.

# Game State Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state and available actions to determine the optimal move.

## Victory Point Status
- BLUE (me): 8/10 VP (2 cities = 4 VP, 2 settlements = 2 VP, Longest Road = 2 VP)
- RED: 5/10 VP (5 settlements = 5 VP)
- I'm 2 VP away from winning

## Resources
- I have: 1 WOOD, 2 BRICK, 1 SHEEP, 1 WHEAT, 2 ORE
- RED has 5 hidden cards

## Available Actions
0. End turn
1-5. Build roads at various locations (Cost: 1 WOOD, 1 BRICK each)
6. Buy development card (Cost: 1 SHEEP, 1 WHEAT, 1 ORE)

## Strategic Analysis

1. **Victory Path Assessment:**
   - I'm at 8 VP, need 2 more to win
   - I can win by: (a) building a new settlement + maintaining longest road, or (b) upgrading both settlements to cities

2. **Development Card Option:**
   - Using my SHEEP, WHEAT, and 1 ORE would get me a development card
   - Possible outcomes: Knight (0 VP), VP card (1 VP), Road Building, Year of Plenty, or Monopoly
   - Only a VP card directly helps me win, and the chances are small
   - Would leave me with 1 ORE but no other resources to build with

3. **Road Building Option:**
   - I have enough resources (1 WOOD, 2 BRICK) to build one road
   - This doesn't immediately get me closer to 10 VP
   - However, it could strengthen my longest road position or set up for future settlement

4. **Protecting Longest Road:**
   - My longest road (2 VP) is critical - losing it would drop me to 6 VP
   - I need to assess if any of the road placement options help secure this advantage

Let me examine the road options more carefully:

- Option 1: Road at edge (13, 14) - Need to understand if this strengthens longest road
- Option 2: Road at edge (19, 20) - Need to understand if this strengthens longest road
- Option 3: Road at edge (11, 12) - Need to understand if this strengthens longest road
- Option 4: Road at edge (6, 23) - Connects to node 6 (where RED has a settlement)
- Option 5: Road at edge (1, 6) - Also connects to node 6 (where RED has a settlement)

Without the exact road layout visualization, I need to make a reasonable assessment. Options 4 and 5 connect to RED's settlement, which doesn't seem ideal. Options 1-3 likely help secure or extend my road network.

Since I need to protect my longest road advantage (worth 2 VP) and can't immediately build a settlement or city this turn, my best option is to build a road that best secures my longest road position, which is likely one of options 1-3.

<plan>
1. Build a road to protect longest road advantage (2 VP)
2. Continue gathering resources (especially ore and wheat) for city upgrades
3. Target acquiring resources for another settlement if good locations remain
4. Use the robber to disrupt RED's resource production
</plan>

Based on available information and the critical importance of maintaining longest road, I believe building a road at edge (11, 12) is most strategic as it likely strengthens my road network near my city at node 12.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist focused on defeating the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRITICAL FOR SUCCESS):
- Above all else, target the highest probability numbers (6 & 8) - these produce resources 5/36 times each
- Strictly prioritize access to all five resources between your two settlements
- Aim for numerical diversity - try to cover 5-6 different dice numbers across your settlements
- Never place initial settlements without analyzing future expansion opportunities
- Prioritize placement on hexes with complementary resources: ore/wheat and brick/wood
- Position roads toward high-value unoccupied areas the opponent cannot easily block
- Choose second settlement to complement your first settlement's resource weaknesses
- Consider 3:1 ports if you can't access a specific resource through settlements
- Analyze opponent placement to avoid contested expansion paths
- ALWAYS calculate production value using probability dots (5-6-8-9 are top priority numbers)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-10):
- Build at least one new settlement by turn 10 - expansion is your TOP priority
- Calculate and build along the fastest path to your next settlement location
- Secure missing resources through strategic settlement placement
- Build roads that secure critical expansion paths before the opponent blocks them
- Avoid development cards completely until you have at least 3 total settlements
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1) to complete critical builds
- Target resource diversity through your expansion locations
- Create a minimum 2-turn expansion plan and stick to it

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT AND PRODUCTION (CORE STRATEGY):
- Early game: Focus on wood/brick to expand with roads and settlements
- Mid game: Transition to ore/wheat focus for cities and development cards
- Calculate the resource production value of every potential build
- Only make 4:1 trades when they enable an immediate important build
- Cycle through "build phases" - expansion phase, then city upgrade phase
- Plan resource collection 2 turns ahead to minimize wasteful trades
- Never accumulate 7+ cards before dice rolls
- Diversify production to minimize dependency on any single resource
- Target a minimum of 4 total settlements before prioritizing city upgrades

COUNTERING ALPHABETA ALGORITHM:
- AlphaBeta looks ahead only 2 steps, so plan your moves 3-4 steps ahead
- Create deceptive game states that appear less threatening than they are
- Block the opponent's highest-probability expansion paths immediately
- Play defensively during early game, then aggressively in mid-game
- When opponent has 7+ points, disrupt their highest-producing hex with the robber
- Track opponent's resources and block their most likely next build
- Secure resources that the opponent depends on heavily
- Place roads to cut off opponent from accessing high-value settlement locations
- Position settlements to deny opponent access to key resource hex intersections

ROBBER PLACEMENT AND KNIGHT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-producing hex of your opponent
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat in mid-game when cities are being built
- Target the specific resource the opponent needs for their next likely build
- Use knight cards reactively when the robber blocks your best production
- Save knight cards for the late game if pursuing largest army
- When stealing, select resources that complete your immediate build needs
- Keep track of opponent cards and target resources they've been collecting
- Balance robber placement between disruption and resource acquisition

DEVELOPMENT CARDS VS. BUILDING:
- Only buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and cannot build
- Buy development cards when you're 1-2 knights away from largest army
- Use knight cards immediately when advantageous (don't save unless close to largest army)
- Victory point cards should only supplement your main strategy, not replace it
- Road Building cards are most valuable when you're cut off or racing to a key location
- Monopoly is best used after high-probability dice rolls to collect opponent's stockpile
- Year of Plenty is ideal to complete a high-value build (settlement or city)
- NEVER delay settlement/city building to purchase development cards unless 1 VP from winning

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY FOCUS):
- Aim for 5 total settlements (2 upgraded to cities) = 9 VP
- Then secure largest army OR longest road for the final point
- Always calculate the fastest path to 10 VP in terms of resource costs
- For each potential build, calculate how many turns closer it gets you to victory
- Determine which victory paths are still viable based on board state
- Switch strategies when your primary path is blocked
- Plan for the end-game by turn 10 (know exactly how you will reach 10 points)
- Track opponent's path to victory and actively disrupt with roads or robber

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Trade at ports even at 4:1 ratio if it enables immediate critical build
- NEVER trade with opponent unless it enables an immediate settlement/city build
- Avoid trades that allow opponent to build immediately after you
- Calculate the net VP gain of each potential trade
- Use trades to dispose of resources when at risk from robber
- Combine multiple port trades to convert unwanted resources into needed ones
- Be willing to overpay through port trades to secure critical positional advantage

DECISION FRAMEWORK (APPLY TO EVERY TURN):
1. What is my immediate build priority? (settlement > city > longest road/largest army)
2. What resource do I need to complete my highest priority build?
3. What is the fastest way to acquire that resource? (production, trading, development cards)
4. How will this action position me for the next 3 turns?
5. Will this action disrupt my opponent's path to victory?
6. Is there a way to combine multiple actions this turn for greater efficiency?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 60 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Build a road to protect longest road advantage (2 VP)
2. Continue gathering resources (especially ore and wheat) for city upgrades
3. Target acquiring resources for another settlement if good locations remain
4. Use the robber to disrupt RED's resource production
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.

# Game State Analysis

Let me analyze the current game situation and my available options:

## Victory Points Status
- I (BLUE) have 8/10 VP (2 cities = 4 VP, 2 settlements = 2 VP, longest road = 2 VP)
- RED has 5/10 VP (5 settlements = 5 VP)
- I need 2 more VP to win

## Resources
- I have: 1 🧱BRICK, 1 🐑SHEEP, 1 🌾WHEAT, 2 ⛏️ORE
- My only two available actions are:
  - [0] End my turn
  - [1] Buy a development card (costs 1 🐑, 1 🌾, 1 ⛏️)

## Strategic Analysis

Development card analysis:
- Benefits of buying a dev card:
  1. 1/5 chance of getting a Victory Point card (immediate hidden VP)
  2. Knights would help establish Largest Army (potential 2 VP)
  3. Monopoly/Year of Plenty/Road Building could be useful
- I already have 8 VP, so a Victory Point card would put me at 9 VP
- I'm close to winning and any development card could help

End turn analysis:
- If I end my turn, I keep my resources for the next round
- This preserves my ore which is valuable for city upgrades
- But I won't make immediate progress toward victory

Risk assessment:
- RED has 5 VP but 5 settlements, so they could quickly build cities
- The robber is currently blocking my wheat production at (0, -1, 1)
- If I don't use my resources now, I risk losing them to a "7" roll

Looking at my current plan, I need to continue gathering resources for city upgrades, and I need to protect my longest road advantage. However, since I'm at 8 VP, getting a development card could be crucial - especially if it's a Victory Point card.

<plan>
1. Buy a development card hoping for a Victory Point card or knight
2. If it's a VP card, I'll be at 9 VP and just need 1 more
3. If it's a knight, save it to potentially get Largest Army (2 VP)
4. Continue gathering resources for another city or settlement
5. Protect longest road advantage
</plan>

Considering I'm 2 VP away from winning, and a development card gives me a chance at immediate progress toward victory, I should buy the development card.

# Game State Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state and my options:

## Victory Points Status
- I (BLUE) have 8 VP: 2 settlements (2 VP), 2 cities (4 VP), and Longest Road (2 VP)
- RED has 5 VP from 5 settlements
- I need 2 more VP to win

## Resources
- I have: 1 🧱BRICK, 1 ⛏️ORE
- Not enough for any immediate builds (city, settlement, or development card)

## Development Cards
- I have 1 KNIGHT card available to play
- The robber is currently on the wheat hex (0, -1, 1) with 8 (high production value)
- This hex produces for both of my cities, so the robber is significantly hurting my production

## Available Actions
- [0] Play Knight card - Move the robber and steal a resource
- [1] Roll the dice

## Strategic Considerations

1. **Robber Impact**: The robber is currently on my highest-producing hex (Wheat-8), which serves both of my cities. This is severely limiting my wheat production, which is critical for development cards and cities.

2. **Resource Needs**: With only 1 brick and 1 ore, I need more resources regardless of my next build target.

3. **Knight Usage**: Playing the knight would:
   - Remove the robber from my wheat production
   - Allow me to place it on one of the opponent's productive hexes
   - Potentially steal a useful resource
   - Move me 1 knight closer to Largest Army (would need 2 more knights)

4. **Rolling First**: Rolling first would:
   - Potentially give me more resources to work with
   - But the robber would remain on my critical wheat production

<plan>
1. Play my knight card to remove the robber from my wheat-8 hex
2. Place the robber on opponent's wheat-9 hex (affects their 3 settlements)
3. Steal a resource from RED
4. Continue gathering resources for another development card or city
5. Maintain my longest road advantage while working toward largest army
</plan>

Playing the knight now is clearly the optimal move since:
1. It removes the robber from my most productive hex
2. It allows me to disrupt opponent's production and steal a resource
3. It puts me one step closer to largest army (2 VP)
4. It improves my future dice rolls by unblocking my wheat production

Therefore, I choose:

- NEVER delay settlement/city building to purchase development cards unless 1 VP from winning

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY FOCUS):
- Aim for 5 total settlements (2 upgraded to cities) = 9 VP
- Then secure largest army OR longest road for the final point
- Always calculate the fastest path to 10 VP in terms of resource costs
- For each potential build, calculate how many turns closer it gets you to victory
- Determine which victory paths are still viable based on board state
- Switch strategies when your primary path is blocked
- Plan for the end-game by turn 10 (know exactly how you will reach 10 points)
- Track opponent's path to victory and actively disrupt with roads or robber

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Trade at ports even at 4:1 ratio if it enables immediate critical build
- NEVER trade with opponent unless it enables an immediate settlement/city build
- Avoid trades that allow opponent to build immediately after you
- Calculate the net VP gain of each potential trade
- Use trades to dispose of resources when at risk from robber
- Combine multiple port trades to convert unwanted resources into needed ones
- Be willing to overpay through port trades to secure critical positional advantage

DECISION FRAMEWORK (APPLY TO EVERY TURN):
1. What is my immediate build priority? (settlement > city > longest road/largest army)
2. What resource do I need to complete my highest priority build?
3. What is the fastest way to acquire that resource? (production, trading, development cards)
4. How will this action position me for the next 3 turns?
5. Will this action disrupt my opponent's path to victory?
6. Is there a way to combine multiple actions this turn for greater efficiency?

# Analyzing Robber Placement Options

Let me carefully analyze each possible robber placement to determine the optimal move:

## Current Game State Assessment
- I have 8 VP: 4 from settlements/cities, 2 from longest road, 2 additional
- Opponent has 5 VP from 5 settlements
- I need 2 more VP to win
- The robber is currently on my wheat-8 hex (0, -1, 1) which is hurting my production significantly
- I have very limited resources: just 1 brick and 1 ore

## Robber Placement Options Analysis

**[0] Move to (0, 0, 0) - Brick-5**
- Affects RED's settlement at node 4
- Blocks brick production which I need for roads
- Also blocks some of my own brick production (node 2)
- Not ideal since I might need brick to maintain longest road

**[1] Move to (1, -1, 0) - Wood-6**
- Affects RED's settlement at node 6
- Blocks a high-probability (⭐⭐⭐) wood resource from RED
- Would also block my own wood production at node 2
- Wood is crucial for road building to maintain longest road advantage

**[2] Move to (-1, 0, 1) - Sheep-4**
- Affects RED's settlements at nodes 4 and 14
- Blocks only a low-probability (⭐) resource
- Not very impactful

**[3] Move to (-1, 1, 0) - Wheat-9**
- Affects RED's settlements at nodes 4, 16, and 17
- Blocks three settlements with a good probability resource (⭐⭐)
- Doesn't block any of my resources
- Very strong option as it disrupts multiple settlements

**[4] Move to (0, 1, -1) - Desert**
- This is a desert hex with no production
- Placing the robber here would be ineffective

**[5] Move to (1, 0, -1) - Ore-10**
- Affects RED's settlement at node 6
- Blocks low-probability (⭐) ore
- Would also block my own ore production at nodes 0 and 22
- Not ideal since I need ore for city upgrades and development cards

## Strategic Decision

Looking at all options, placing the robber on the wheat-9 hex (-1, 1, 0) is clearly optimal because:
1. It disrupts THREE of RED's settlements (nodes 4, 16, 17)
2. It blocks a moderate-high probability resource (wheat with ⭐⭐)
3. It doesn't block any of my own production
4. Wheat is crucial for cities and development cards, which RED will need to catch up

<plan>
1. Place the robber on RED's wheat-9 hex to disrupt three settlements
2. Steal a resource from RED (hopefully ore or wheat)
3. Work toward another development card (possibly knight) to progress toward largest army 
4. Continue maintaining longest road advantage
5. Save resources for a city upgrade to reach 10 VP
</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist focused on defeating the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRITICAL FOR SUCCESS):
- Above all else, target the highest probability numbers (6 & 8) - these produce resources 5/36 times each
- Strictly prioritize access to all five resources between your two settlements
- Aim for numerical diversity - try to cover 5-6 different dice numbers across your settlements
- Never place initial settlements without analyzing future expansion opportunities
- Prioritize placement on hexes with complementary resources: ore/wheat and brick/wood
- Position roads toward high-value unoccupied areas the opponent cannot easily block
- Choose second settlement to complement your first settlement's resource weaknesses
- Consider 3:1 ports if you can't access a specific resource through settlements
- Analyze opponent placement to avoid contested expansion paths
- ALWAYS calculate production value using probability dots (5-6-8-9 are top priority numbers)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-10):
- Build at least one new settlement by turn 10 - expansion is your TOP priority
- Calculate and build along the fastest path to your next settlement location
- Secure missing resources through strategic settlement placement
- Build roads that secure critical expansion paths before the opponent blocks them
- Avoid development cards completely until you have at least 3 total settlements
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1) to complete critical builds
- Target resource diversity through your expansion locations
- Create a minimum 2-turn expansion plan and stick to it

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT AND PRODUCTION (CORE STRATEGY):
- Early game: Focus on wood/brick to expand with roads and settlements
- Mid game: Transition to ore/wheat focus for cities and development cards
- Calculate the resource production value of every potential build
- Only make 4:1 trades when they enable an immediate important build
- Cycle through "build phases" - expansion phase, then city upgrade phase
- Plan resource collection 2 turns ahead to minimize wasteful trades
- Never accumulate 7+ cards before dice rolls
- Diversify production to minimize dependency on any single resource
- Target a minimum of 4 total settlements before prioritizing city upgrades

COUNTERING ALPHABETA ALGORITHM:
- AlphaBeta looks ahead only 2 steps, so plan your moves 3-4 steps ahead
- Create deceptive game states that appear less threatening than they are
- Block the opponent's highest-probability expansion paths immediately
- Play defensively during early game, then aggressively in mid-game
- When opponent has 7+ points, disrupt their highest-producing hex with the robber
- Track opponent's resources and block their most likely next build
- Secure resources that the opponent depends on heavily
- Place roads to cut off opponent from accessing high-value settlement locations
- Position settlements to deny opponent access to key resource hex intersections

ROBBER PLACEMENT AND KNIGHT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-producing hex of your opponent
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat in mid-game when cities are being built
- Target the specific resource the opponent needs for their next likely build
- Use knight cards reactively when the robber blocks your best production
- Save knight cards for the late game if pursuing largest army
- When stealing, select resources that complete your immediate build needs
- Keep track of opponent cards and target resources they've been collecting
- Balance robber placement between disruption and resource acquisition

DEVELOPMENT CARDS VS. BUILDING:
- Only buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and cannot build
- Buy development cards when you're 1-2 knights away from largest army
- Use knight cards immediately when advantageous (don't save unless close to largest army)
- Victory point cards should only supplement your main strategy, not replace it
- Road Building cards are most valuable when you're cut off or racing to a key location
- Monopoly is best used after high-probability dice rolls to collect opponent's stockpile
- Year of Plenty is ideal to complete a high-value build (settlement or city)
- NEVER delay settlement/city building to purchase development cards unless 1 VP from winning

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY FOCUS):
- Aim for 5 total settlements (2 upgraded to cities) = 9 VP
- Then secure largest army OR longest road for the final point
- Always calculate the fastest path to 10 VP in terms of resource costs
- For each potential build, calculate how many turns closer it gets you to victory

# Game Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state carefully to make the optimal decision:

## Current Status
- I have 8 VP: 2 initial settlements (2 VP), 2 cities (4 VP), and longest road (2 VP)
- I need 2 more VP to win
- I have 1 🧱BRICK and 4 ⛏️ORE as resources
- My opponent has 5 VP and 5 hidden resources

## Victory Path Options
1. **Build a settlement**: Need 1 brick (have it), 1 wood (don't have), 1 sheep (don't have), 1 wheat (don't have)
2. **Upgrade a settlement to city**: Need 3 ore (have 4) and 2 wheat (don't have)
3. **Buy a development card**: Need 1 ore (have 4), 1 sheep (don't have), 1 wheat (don't have)

## Available Actions
- [0] End turn
- [1-4] Trade 4 ore for various resources at 4:1 rate

## Decision Analysis

With 4 ore, I could potentially trade for a wheat or sheep, but that would leave me still needing additional resources to complete any meaningful build. Trading the ore inefficiently at 4:1 when I don't have a clear immediate build opportunity would be wasteful.

Since I already have the robber on my opponent's wheat-9 hex (which is disrupting three of their settlements), my previous strategy is working well to limit their wheat production. My longest road advantage is secure (8 vs 4).

The most logical move is to hold my resources for now. With 4 ore, I'm positioned to quickly upgrade to a city once I acquire 2 wheat, which would give me the final 2 VP needed to win. Trading away my ore now at a poor 4:1 ratio without enabling a complete build would weaken my position.

<plan>
1. End turn and continue holding resources
2. Continue blocking RED's wheat production with the robber
3. Work toward collecting wheat (2) for a city upgrade to reach 10 VP
4. Maintain longest road advantage
5. Consider development card if I collect sheep and wheat before additional ore
</plan>

The optimal move is to end my turn and preserve my resources for a more efficient future use.

# Analyzing Robber Placement Options

I need to analyze where to place the robber to maximize my advantage and disrupt RED's strategy.

## Current Game State Analysis
- I (BLUE) have 8/10 victory points with 2 cities, 2 settlements, and longest road
- RED has 5/10 victory points with 5 settlements
- I need 2 more points to win - likely from upgrading a settlement to a city (needs 3 ore + 2 wheat)
- I currently have 2 ore and 2 wheat, so I need 1 more ore for this upgrade

## Robber Placement Options Analysis:

**[0] Move robber to (0, 0, 0) and steal from RED**
- This is a brick hex with number 5 (medium probability)
- RED has one settlement here
- Blocks my own city's brick production
- Not ideal since brick isn't critical for me now

**[1] Move robber to (1, -1, 0) and steal from RED**
- This is a wood hex with number 6 (high probability)
- RED has one settlement here
- Blocks my own city's wood production
- Not ideal since I need ore/wheat more than blocking wood

**[2] Move robber to (0, -1, 1)**
- This is a wheat hex with number 8 (high probability) 
- Blocks my own two settlements' wheat production
- No RED settlements here
- Terrible option for me

**[3] Move robber to (-1, 0, 1) and steal from RED**
- This is a sheep hex with number 4 (low probability)
- RED has two settlements here
- I gain nothing from blocking sheep production

**[4] Move robber to (0, 1, -1) and steal from RED**
- This is a desert hex with no production
- Completely wasted robber placement

**[5] Move robber to (1, 0, -1) and steal from RED**
- This is an ore hex with number 10 (low-medium probability)
- RED has one settlement here
- I have two settlements producing ore here
- This would block my own ore production while I need 1 more ore

## Strategic Decision

The best options are likely targeting RED's settlements without hurting my production. Looking at the options:

- Option [3] blocks sheep from RED with minimal impact to my strategy
- RED has two settlements on this hex, increasing chances I steal a useful card
- Sheep isn't critical for my city strategy, so blocking my own production here isn't a concern
- Since RED has 5 cards, there's a good chance I can steal something valuable

<plan>
1. Block RED's sheep production and steal a card, hoping for ore
2. Continue working toward collecting 1 more ore for city upgrade to reach 10 VP
3. Maintain longest road advantage
4. If I don't get ore from stealing, wait until next production roll
</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist focused on defeating the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRITICAL FOR SUCCESS):
- Above all else, target the highest probability numbers (6 & 8) - these produce resources 5/36 times each
- Strictly prioritize access to all five resources between your two settlements
- Aim for numerical diversity - try to cover 5-6 different dice numbers across your settlements
- Never place initial settlements without analyzing future expansion opportunities
- Prioritize placement on hexes with complementary resources: ore/wheat and brick/wood
- Position roads toward high-value unoccupied areas the opponent cannot easily block
- Choose second settlement to complement your first settlement's resource weaknesses
- Consider 3:1 ports if you can't access a specific resource through settlements
- Analyze opponent placement to avoid contested expansion paths
- ALWAYS calculate production value using probability dots (5-6-8-9 are top priority numbers)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-10):
- Build at least one new settlement by turn 10 - expansion is your TOP priority
- Calculate and build along the fastest path to your next settlement location
- Secure missing resources through strategic settlement placement
- Build roads that secure critical expansion paths before the opponent blocks them
- Avoid development cards completely until you have at least 3 total settlements
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1) to complete critical builds
- Target resource diversity through your expansion locations
- Create a minimum 2-turn expansion plan and stick to it

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT AND PRODUCTION (CORE STRATEGY):
- Early game: Focus on wood/brick to expand with roads and settlements
- Mid game: Transition to ore/wheat focus for cities and development cards
- Calculate the resource production value of every potential build
- Only make 4:1 trades when they enable an immediate important build
- Cycle through "build phases" - expansion phase, then city upgrade phase
- Plan resource collection 2 turns ahead to minimize wasteful trades
- Never accumulate 7+ cards before dice rolls
- Diversify production to minimize dependency on any single resource
- Target a minimum of 4 total settlements before prioritizing city upgrades

COUNTERING ALPHABETA ALGORITHM:
- AlphaBeta looks ahead only 2 steps, so plan your moves 3-4 steps ahead
- Create deceptive game states that appear less threatening than they are
- Block the opponent's highest-probability expansion paths immediately
- Play defensively during early game, then aggressively in mid-game
- When opponent has 7+ points, disrupt their highest-producing hex with the robber
- Track opponent's resources and block their most likely next build
- Secure resources that the opponent depends on heavily
- Place roads to cut off opponent from accessing high-value settlement locations
- Position settlements to deny opponent access to key resource hex intersections

ROBBER PLACEMENT AND KNIGHT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-producing hex of your opponent
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat in mid-game when cities are being built
- Target the specific resource the opponent needs for their next likely build
- Use knight cards reactively when the robber blocks your best production
- Save knight cards for the late game if pursuing largest army
- When stealing, select resources that complete your immediate build needs
- Keep track of opponent cards and target resources they've been collecting
- Balance robber placement between disruption and resource acquisition

DEVELOPMENT CARDS VS. BUILDING:
- Only buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and cannot build
- Buy development cards when you're 1-2 knights away from largest army
- Use knight cards immediately when advantageous (don't save unless close to largest army)
- Victory point cards should only supplement your main strategy, not replace it
- Road Building cards are most valuable when you're cut off or racing to a key location
- Monopoly is best used after high-probability dice rolls to collect opponent's stockpile
- Year of Plenty is ideal to complete a high-value build (settlement or city)
- NEVER delay settlement/city building to purchase development cards unless 1 VP from winning

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY FOCUS):
- Aim for 5 total settlements (2 upgraded to cities) = 9 VP
- Then secure largest army OR longest road for the final point
- Always calculate the fastest path to 10 VP in terms of resource costs
- For each potential build, calculate how many turns closer it gets you to victory
- Determine which victory paths are still viable based on board state
- Switch strategies when your primary path is blocked
- Plan for the end-game by turn 10 (know exactly how you will reach 10 points)
- Track opponent's path to victory and actively disrupt with roads or robber

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Trade at ports even at 4:1 ratio if it enables immediate critical build
- NEVER trade with opponent unless it enables an immediate settlement/city build
- Avoid trades that allow opponent to build immediately after you
- Calculate the net VP gain of each potential trade
- Use trades to dispose of resources when at risk from robber
- Combine multiple port trades to convert unwanted resources into needed ones
- Be willing to overpay through port trades to secure critical positional advantage

DECISION FRAMEWORK (APPLY TO EVERY TURN):
1. What is my immediate build priority? (settlement > city > longest road/largest army)
2. What resource do I need to complete my highest priority build?
3. What is the fastest way to acquire that resource? (production, trading, development cards)
4. How will this action position me for the next 3 turns?
5. Will this action disrupt my opponent's path to victory?
6. Is there a way to combine multiple actions this turn for greater efficiency?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 64 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Block RED's sheep production and steal a card, hoping for ore
2. Continue working toward collecting 1 more ore for city upgrade to reach 10 VP
3. Maintain longest road advantage
4. If I don't get ore from stealing, wait until next production roll
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.

# Game Analysis for Settlers of Catan Turn 64

I'll carefully analyze my position and available actions to determine the optimal move.

## Current Game State Assessment:
- I have 8 VP (2 cities + 2 settlements + longest road bonus)
- RED has 5 VP (5 settlements)
- I need 2 more VP to win, which I can get by upgrading a settlement to a city
- Resources: 1 🧱BRICK, 2 🌾WHEAT, 3 ⛏️ORE

## Available Actions Analysis:
- [0] End turn - This doesn't advance my position
- [1] Upgrade settlement at node 0 to a city - Costs 2 🌾WHEAT, 3 ⛏️ORE
- [2] Upgrade settlement at node 22 to a city - Costs 2 🌾WHEAT, 3 ⛏️ORE

## Resource Evaluation:
I have exactly the resources needed for a city upgrade (2 wheat, 3 ore). This is a perfect opportunity to immediately gain 1 VP and reach 9 total.

## Strategic Considerations:
1. Node 0 produces brick (5) and ore (10) - moderately valuable production
2. Node 22 produces only ore (10) - less valuable production
3. If I upgrade to 9 VP, I'm just 1 VP away from winning

## Decision Logic:
- Upgrading either settlement to a city will increase my VP count to 9/10
- Node 0 has better production value (both brick and ore) compared to node 22 (only ore)
- Better to upgrade the settlement with higher resource production potential

<plan>
1. Upgrade settlement at node 0 to a city for optimal resource production
2. This puts me at 9 VP, just 1 VP away from winning
3. My next goal will be to get resources for another city upgrade or a VP development card
4. Maintain longest road advantage (current +2 VP)
</plan>

Therefore, I choose to:

# Game State Analysis

I need to make a strategic decision about where to move the robber. Let me analyze the current state:

## Current Game Status
- I (BLUE) have 9/10 VP (3 cities = 6 VP, 1 settlement = 1 VP, longest road = 2 VP)
- RED has 5/10 VP (5 settlements = 5 VP)
- I'm just 1 VP away from winning
- I have 1 BRICK and 4 WHEAT in my hand
- The robber is currently on the sheep hex (-1, 0, 1)

## My Resource Needs
To reach 10 VP, I need either:
1. Upgrade my remaining settlement to a city (need 3 ORE + 2 WHEAT)
2. Buy a development card hoping for a victory point (need 1 ORE + 1 SHEEP + 1 WHEAT)

## Analyzing RED's Production
RED's settlements produce:
- Node 4: BRICK (5), SHEEP (4), WHEAT (9)
- Node 6: WOOD (6), ORE (10)
- Node 14: SHEEP (4)
- Node 16 & 17: WHEAT (9)

## Available Robber Placement Options
[0] Move to BRICK (5) - affects my city at node 0 and 2, RED at node 4
[1] Move to WOOD (6) - affects my city at node 2, RED at node 6
[2] Move to WHEAT (8) - affects my cities at nodes 2 and 12
[3] Move to WHEAT (9) - affects RED nodes 4, 16, 17
[4] Move to DESERT - no impact on production
[5] Move to ORE (10) - affects my settlement at node 22, city at node 0, and RED at node 6

## Strategic Decision
Since I'm focused on winning, I need to:
1. Block RED's most valuable production
2. Potentially steal a resource I need (ORE or SHEEP)
3. Avoid hampering my own production too much

Looking at RED's settlements, they have double production on WHEAT (9) with nodes 16 & 17, making option [3] particularly strong for disruption.

The WHEAT (9) hex is producing for 3 of RED's settlements. Blocking this will significantly hamper RED's resource collection while not affecting any of my buildings.

<plan>
1. Move robber to WHEAT (9) hex and steal from RED
2. Focus on collecting ORE to upgrade my settlement at node 22 to city
3. Keep my longest road advantage and reach 10 VP
</plan>

Therefore, my best choice is to move the robber to the WHEAT (9) hex and steal from RED.

PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist focused on defeating the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRITICAL FOR SUCCESS):
- Above all else, target the highest probability numbers (6 & 8) - these produce resources 5/36 times each
- Strictly prioritize access to all five resources between your two settlements
- Aim for numerical diversity - try to cover 5-6 different dice numbers across your settlements
- Never place initial settlements without analyzing future expansion opportunities
- Prioritize placement on hexes with complementary resources: ore/wheat and brick/wood
- Position roads toward high-value unoccupied areas the opponent cannot easily block
- Choose second settlement to complement your first settlement's resource weaknesses
- Consider 3:1 ports if you can't access a specific resource through settlements
- Analyze opponent placement to avoid contested expansion paths
- ALWAYS calculate production value using probability dots (5-6-8-9 are top priority numbers)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-10):
- Build at least one new settlement by turn 10 - expansion is your TOP priority
- Calculate and build along the fastest path to your next settlement location
- Secure missing resources through strategic settlement placement
- Build roads that secure critical expansion paths before the opponent blocks them
- Avoid development cards completely until you have at least 3 total settlements
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1) to complete critical builds
- Target resource diversity through your expansion locations
- Create a minimum 2-turn expansion plan and stick to it

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT AND PRODUCTION (CORE STRATEGY):
- Early game: Focus on wood/brick to expand with roads and settlements
- Mid game: Transition to ore/wheat focus for cities and development cards
- Calculate the resource production value of every potential build
- Only make 4:1 trades when they enable an immediate important build
- Cycle through "build phases" - expansion phase, then city upgrade phase
- Plan resource collection 2 turns ahead to minimize wasteful trades
- Never accumulate 7+ cards before dice rolls
- Diversify production to minimize dependency on any single resource
- Target a minimum of 4 total settlements before prioritizing city upgrades

COUNTERING ALPHABETA ALGORITHM:
- AlphaBeta looks ahead only 2 steps, so plan your moves 3-4 steps ahead
- Create deceptive game states that appear less threatening than they are
- Block the opponent's highest-probability expansion paths immediately
- Play defensively during early game, then aggressively in mid-game
- When opponent has 7+ points, disrupt their highest-producing hex with the robber
- Track opponent's resources and block their most likely next build
- Secure resources that the opponent depends on heavily
- Place roads to cut off opponent from accessing high-value settlement locations
- Position settlements to deny opponent access to key resource hex intersections

ROBBER PLACEMENT AND KNIGHT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-producing hex of your opponent
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat in mid-game when cities are being built
- Target the specific resource the opponent needs for their next likely build
- Use knight cards reactively when the robber blocks your best production
- Save knight cards for the late game if pursuing largest army
- When stealing, select resources that complete your immediate build needs
- Keep track of opponent cards and target resources they've been collecting
- Balance robber placement between disruption and resource acquisition

DEVELOPMENT CARDS VS. BUILDING:
- Only buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and cannot build
- Buy development cards when you're 1-2 knights away from largest army
- Use knight cards immediately when advantageous (don't save unless close to largest army)
- Victory point cards should only supplement your main strategy, not replace it
- Road Building cards are most valuable when you're cut off or racing to a key location
- Monopoly is best used after high-probability dice rolls to collect opponent's stockpile
- Year of Plenty is ideal to complete a high-value build (settlement or city)
- NEVER delay settlement/city building to purchase development cards unless 1 VP from winning

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY FOCUS):
- Aim for 5 total settlements (2 upgraded to cities) = 9 VP
- Then secure largest army OR longest road for the final point
- Always calculate the fastest path to 10 VP in terms of resource costs
- For each potential build, calculate how many turns closer it gets you to victory
- Determine which victory paths are still viable based on board state
- Switch strategies when your primary path is blocked
- Plan for the end-game by turn 10 (know exactly how you will reach 10 points)
- Track opponent's path to victory and actively disrupt with roads or robber

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Trade at ports even at 4:1 ratio if it enables immediate critical build
- NEVER trade with opponent unless it enables an immediate settlement/city build
- Avoid trades that allow opponent to build immediately after you
- Calculate the net VP gain of each potential trade
- Use trades to dispose of resources when at risk from robber
- Combine multiple port trades to convert unwanted resources into needed ones
- Be willing to overpay through port trades to secure critical positional advantage

DECISION FRAMEWORK (APPLY TO EVERY TURN):
1. What is my immediate build priority? (settlement > city > longest road/largest army)
2. What resource do I need to complete my highest priority build?
3. What is the fastest way to acquire that resource? (production, trading, development cards)
4. How will this action position me for the next 3 turns?
5. Will this action disrupt my opponent's path to victory?
6. Is there a way to combine multiple actions this turn for greater efficiency?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game Analysis for Turn 66

I'll analyze the current game state to make the optimal move:

## Victory Point Status
- I (BLUE) have 9/10 VP (3 cities = 6 VP, 1 settlement = 1 VP, longest road = 2 VP)
- RED has only 5/10 VP (5 settlements = 5 VP)
- I'm only 1 VP away from winning!

## My Resources
- 1 WOOD, 1 BRICK, 4 WHEAT
- No development cards in hand

## Available Options
1. End turn
2. Build a road (have enough resources: 1 WOOD, 1 BRICK)
3. Trade 4 WHEAT for another resource

## Strategic Assessment

My plan was to upgrade the settlement at node 22 to a city, but I'm missing ORE. With my current resources, I can:
- Build a road (but I already have longest road secured with 8 segments vs. RED's 4)
- Trade 4 WHEAT for 1 ORE to get closer to upgrading my settlement to city

Let me review each option carefully:

### Option 1: End Turn
- No direct progress toward victory
- Waste opportunity to use resources
- Not optimal

### Option 2: Build Road
- I already have longest road secured (8 vs 4)
- RED would need 5 more roads to match me, which is unlikely
- Using my WOOD and BRICK now means I can't use them for future expansion
- Not necessary for victory

### Option 3: Trade 4 WHEAT for 1 ORE (Action #9)
- Gets me 1 ORE closer to upgrading settlement at node 22
- A city upgrade would give me the 10th victory point I need
- I need 3 ORE + 2 WHEAT total for the city upgrade
- This puts me at 1/3 ORE needed

This is clearly the best option. I should trade for ORE to progress toward my victory condition of upgrading my settlement to a city.

<plan>
1. Trade 4 WHEAT for 1 ORE now
2. Continue collecting ORE (need 2 more) to upgrade settlement at node 22 to city
3. Maintain longest road advantage to ensure those 2 VP remain secure
4. Reach 10 VP with the city upgrade
</plan>

The optimal action is to trade 4 WHEAT for 1 ORE:

# Game Analysis and Decision

Let me analyze the current game state and the available options to make the optimal decision.

## Current Game Status
- I have 9/10 victory points, needing just 1 more VP to win
- I have Longest Road bonus (+2 VP)
- I own 3 cities (6 VP) and 1 settlement (1 VP), which totals 9 VP with Longest Road
- Resources: 1 WOOD, 1 BRICK, 1 ORE
- Opponent has 5/10 victory points

## Victory Path Analysis
My current plan is to upgrade my settlement at node 22 to a city to reach 10 VP and win. This requires 3 ORE and 2 WHEAT. I currently have 1 ORE, so I need 2 more ORE and 2 WHEAT.

## Action Options
1. Build a road (costs 1 WOOD, 1 BRICK) at various locations
2. End turn (and continue collecting resources)

## Strategic Considerations
1. **Resource Situation**: I have exactly enough resources to build one road (1 WOOD, 1 BRICK)
2. **Longest Road Security**: I currently have 8 road segments versus opponent's 4, so my Longest Road bonus is secure for now
3. **Victory Path**: I need 2 more ORE and 2 WHEAT to upgrade to a city and win
4. **Risk Assessment**: If I don't build the road, I'll have resources that could be lost to a 7 roll or stolen

Looking at my current plan, I need to:
1. Trade 4 WHEAT for 1 ORE (but I don't have 4 WHEAT currently)
2. Collect 2 more ORE to upgrade the settlement
3. Maintain longest road advantage

Since I don't have the resources for my immediate goal (city upgrade), and I have exactly the resources needed for a road, building a road would:
1. Empty my hand to avoid robber losses
2. Further secure my longest road advantage
3. Set up potential future expansion options

Of the road options, I should examine which provides the most strategic value. Without a detailed map view, I'll assess based on described locations and board position.

<plan>
1. Build a road to strengthen longest road security and empty my hand of resources
2. Continue collecting ORE (need 2 more) and WHEAT (need 2) to upgrade settlement at node 22 to city
3. Reach 10 VP with the city upgrade
</plan>

Since my primary goal is to secure my position while working toward my victory condition, and I have exactly the resources to build a road, I'll build a road to protect myself from the robber and further secure my longest road advantage.

\boxed{0}

Actually, I need to reconsider. Building a road doesn't advance my victory condition directly. Since I already have a very secure longest road advantage (8 vs 4), and I only need 1 more VP to win, adding another road provides minimal strategic value.

Instead, ending my turn will:
1. Allow me to collect more resources on the next dice roll
2. Keep my focus on my victory path - upgrading settlement to city
3. Avoid using resources that don't directly contribute to my win condition

Since I'm so close to victory and my longest road is secure, I should end my turn and focus on collecting the resources needed for my city upgrade.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist focused on defeating the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRITICAL FOR SUCCESS):
- Above all else, target the highest probability numbers (6 & 8) - these produce resources 5/36 times each
- Strictly prioritize access to all five resources between your two settlements
- Aim for numerical diversity - try to cover 5-6 different dice numbers across your settlements
- Never place initial settlements without analyzing future expansion opportunities
- Prioritize placement on hexes with complementary resources: ore/wheat and brick/wood
- Position roads toward high-value unoccupied areas the opponent cannot easily block
- Choose second settlement to complement your first settlement's resource weaknesses
- Consider 3:1 ports if you can't access a specific resource through settlements
- Analyze opponent placement to avoid contested expansion paths
- ALWAYS calculate production value using probability dots (5-6-8-9 are top priority numbers)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-10):
- Build at least one new settlement by turn 10 - expansion is your TOP priority
- Calculate and build along the fastest path to your next settlement location
- Secure missing resources through strategic settlement placement
- Build roads that secure critical expansion paths before the opponent blocks them
- Avoid development cards completely until you have at least 3 total settlements
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1) to complete critical builds
- Target resource diversity through your expansion locations
- Create a minimum 2-turn expansion plan and stick to it

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT AND PRODUCTION (CORE STRATEGY):
- Early game: Focus on wood/brick to expand with roads and settlements
- Mid game: Transition to ore/wheat focus for cities and development cards
- Calculate the resource production value of every potential build
- Only make 4:1 trades when they enable an immediate important build
- Cycle through "build phases" - expansion phase, then city upgrade phase
- Plan resource collection 2 turns ahead to minimize wasteful trades
- Never accumulate 7+ cards before dice rolls
- Diversify production to minimize dependency on any single resource
- Target a minimum of 4 total settlements before prioritizing city upgrades

COUNTERING ALPHABETA ALGORITHM:
- AlphaBeta looks ahead only 2 steps, so plan your moves 3-4 steps ahead
- Create deceptive game states that appear less threatening than they are
- Block the opponent's highest-probability expansion paths immediately
- Play defensively during early game, then aggressively in mid-game
- When opponent has 7+ points, disrupt their highest-producing hex with the robber
- Track opponent's resources and block their most likely next build
- Secure resources that the opponent depends on heavily
- Place roads to cut off opponent from accessing high-value settlement locations
- Position settlements to deny opponent access to key resource hex intersections

ROBBER PLACEMENT AND KNIGHT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-producing hex of your opponent
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat in mid-game when cities are being built
- Target the specific resource the opponent needs for their next likely build
- Use knight cards reactively when the robber blocks your best production
- Save knight cards for the late game if pursuing largest army
- When stealing, select resources that complete your immediate build needs
- Keep track of opponent cards and target resources they've been collecting
- Balance robber placement between disruption and resource acquisition

DEVELOPMENT CARDS VS. BUILDING:
- Only buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and cannot build
- Buy development cards when you're 1-2 knights away from largest army
- Use knight cards immediately when advantageous (don't save unless close to largest army)
- Victory point cards should only supplement your main strategy, not replace it
- Road Building cards are most valuable when you're cut off or racing to a key location
- Monopoly is best used after high-probability dice rolls to collect opponent's stockpile
- Year of Plenty is ideal to complete a high-value build (settlement or city)
- NEVER delay settlement/city building to purchase development cards unless 1 VP from winning

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY FOCUS):
- Aim for 5 total settlements (2 upgraded to cities) = 9 VP
- Then secure largest army OR longest road for the final point
- Always calculate the fastest path to 10 VP in terms of resource costs
- For each potential build, calculate how many turns closer it gets you to victory
- Determine which victory paths are still viable based on board state
- Switch strategies when your primary path is blocked
- Plan for the end-game by turn 10 (know exactly how you will reach 10 points)
- Track opponent's path to victory and actively disrupt with roads or robber

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Trade at ports even at 4:1 ratio if it enables immediate critical build
- NEVER trade with opponent unless it enables an immediate settlement/city build
- Avoid trades that allow opponent to build immediately after you
- Calculate the net VP gain of each potential trade
- Use trades to dispose of resources when at risk from robber
- Combine multiple port trades to convert unwanted resources into needed ones
- Be willing to overpay through port trades to secure critical positional advantage

DECISION FRAMEWORK (APPLY TO EVERY TURN):
1. What is my immediate build priority? (settlement > city > longest road/largest army)
2. What resource do I need to complete my highest priority build?
3. What is the fastest way to acquire that resource? (production, trading, development cards)
4. How will this action position me for the next 3 turns?
5. Will this action disrupt my opponent's path to victory?
6. Is there a way to combine multiple actions this turn for greater efficiency?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game Analysis for Robber Placement

Let me analyze the current game state and determine the optimal robber placement:

## Current Game State Assessment
- I have 9/10 VP (3 cities = 6 VP, 1 settlement = 1 VP, longest road = 2 VP)
- I need 1 more VP to win, which I plan to get by upgrading my settlement at node 22 to a city
- For this upgrade, I need 2 more ore and 2 wheat (I have 4 ore currently, need 3 total)
- The opponent (RED) has 5 VP and is far behind

## Robber Placement Strategy
I need to analyze which robber placement:
1. Hurts RED's production most effectively
2. Potentially gives me resources I need (wheat)
3. Protects my longest road if necessary

Let's assess each option:

**[0] Move robber to (0, 0, 0) and steal from RED**
- This is a brick hex with value 5 (⭐⭐)
- RED has a settlement at node 4 producing from this hex
- This would disrupt RED's brick production

**[1] Move robber to (1, -1, 0) and steal from RED**
- This is a wood hex with value 6 (⭐⭐⭐)
- RED has a settlement at node 6 producing from this hex
- This would disrupt RED's high-probability wood production

**[2] Move robber to (0, -1, 1)**
- This is a wheat hex with value 8 (⭐⭐⭐)
- I have settlements at nodes 2 and 12 producing from this hex
- This would hurt my own production significantly - absolutely avoid

**[3] Move robber to (-1, 0, 1) and steal from RED**
- This is a sheep hex with value 4 (⭐)
- RED has settlements at nodes 4 and 14 producing from this hex
- Low value target due to low probability

**[4] Move robber to (0, 1, -1) and steal from RED**
- This is a desert hex
- No production happens here, wasting the robber

**[5] Move robber to (1, 0, -1) and steal from RED**
- This is an ore hex with value 10 (⭐)
- RED has a settlement at node 6 producing from this hex
- I also have settlements at nodes 0 and 22 producing ore from this hex
- Hurting my own ore production would delay my city upgrade

## Optimal Decision
Option [1] is clearly best - it blocks RED's high probability (⭐⭐⭐) wood production from the 6 value hex, and doesn't affect my own production. Additionally, stealing from RED gives me a chance to get resources I need or resources I can trade.

<plan>
1. Place robber on wood hex (1, -1, 0) to disrupt RED's high-probability production
2. Continue collecting ORE (need 2 more after stealing) and WHEAT (need 2) to upgrade settlement at node 22 to city
3. Win the game with 10 VP after the city upgrade

# Game Analysis: Turn 68

## Current Status Assessment
- I have 9/10 victory points (3 cities = 6 VP, 1 settlement = 1 VP, Longest Road = 2 VP)
- I need just 1 more VP to win
- I currently have 1 🌲WOOD, 1 🧱BRICK, 1 🐑SHEEP, 4 ⛏️ORE
- The robber is already on RED's wood production hex

## Victory Path Options
1. Upgrade my settlement at node 22 to a city (+1 VP)
   - Requires 3 ⛏️ORE and 2 🌾WHEAT
   - I have 4 ⛏️ORE but 0 🌾WHEAT
   
2. Build a development card hoping for a Victory Point card
   - Requires 1 ⛏️ORE, 1 🌾WHEAT, 1 🐑SHEEP
   - I have 0 🌾WHEAT so this isn't possible right now

## Action Analysis
Since I'm at 9 VP and need just 1 more to win, my priority must be acquiring wheat to upgrade my settlement to a city.

Looking at the available actions:
- Options 1-5: Building more roads (costs 🌲WOOD + 🧱BRICK)
  - I already have longest road, so additional roads don't help me win
  - Using my only wood and brick would prevent other strategic trades

- Options 6-9: Maritime trades with the bank at 4:1 ratio
  - Option 9: Trade 4 ⛏️ORE for 1 🌾WHEAT

The clear path forward is to trade for wheat. I need 2 wheat total for the city upgrade, so getting 1 wheat now moves me halfway there.

<plan>
1. Trade 4 ORE for 1 WHEAT (action 9)
2. Next turn aim to acquire 1 more WHEAT to upgrade settlement at node 22 to city
3. Win the game with 10 VP after city upgrade
</plan>

Since acquiring wheat is the critical step toward my win condition, and I have excess ore (4), the optimal choice is to trade 4 ore for 1 wheat.

- Avoid development cards completely until you have at least 3 total settlements
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1) to complete critical builds
- Target resource diversity through your expansion locations
- Create a minimum 2-turn expansion plan and stick to it

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT AND PRODUCTION (CORE STRATEGY):
- Early game: Focus on wood/brick to expand with roads and settlements
- Mid game: Transition to ore/wheat focus for cities and development cards
- Calculate the resource production value of every potential build
- Only make 4:1 trades when they enable an immediate important build
- Cycle through "build phases" - expansion phase, then city upgrade phase
- Plan resource collection 2 turns ahead to minimize wasteful trades
- Never accumulate 7+ cards before dice rolls
- Diversify production to minimize dependency on any single resource
- Target a minimum of 4 total settlements before prioritizing city upgrades

COUNTERING ALPHABETA ALGORITHM:
- AlphaBeta looks ahead only 2 steps, so plan your moves 3-4 steps ahead
- Create deceptive game states that appear less threatening than they are
- Block the opponent's highest-probability expansion paths immediately
- Play defensively during early game, then aggressively in mid-game
- When opponent has 7+ points, disrupt their highest-producing hex with the robber
- Track opponent's resources and block their most likely next build
- Secure resources that the opponent depends on heavily
- Place roads to cut off opponent from accessing high-value settlement locations
- Position settlements to deny opponent access to key resource hex intersections

ROBBER PLACEMENT AND KNIGHT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-producing hex of your opponent
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat in mid-game when cities are being built
- Target the specific resource the opponent needs for their next likely build
- Use knight cards reactively when the robber blocks your best production
- Save knight cards for the late game if pursuing largest army
- When stealing, select resources that complete your immediate build needs
- Keep track of opponent cards and target resources they've been collecting
- Balance robber placement between disruption and resource acquisition

DEVELOPMENT CARDS VS. BUILDING:
- Only buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and cannot build
- Buy development cards when you're 1-2 knights away from largest army
- Use knight cards immediately when advantageous (don't save unless close to largest army)
- Victory point cards should only supplement your main strategy, not replace it
- Road Building cards are most valuable when you're cut off or racing to a key location
- Monopoly is best used after high-probability dice rolls to collect opponent's stockpile
- Year of Plenty is ideal to complete a high-value build (settlement or city)
- NEVER delay settlement/city building to purchase development cards unless 1 VP from winning

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY FOCUS):
- Aim for 5 total settlements (2 upgraded to cities) = 9 VP
- Then secure largest army OR longest road for the final point
- Always calculate the fastest path to 10 VP in terms of resource costs
- For each potential build, calculate how many turns closer it gets you to victory
- Determine which victory paths are still viable based on board state
- Switch strategies when your primary path is blocked
- Plan for the end-game by turn 10 (know exactly how you will reach 10 points)
- Track opponent's path to victory and actively disrupt with roads or robber

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Trade at ports even at 4:1 ratio if it enables immediate critical build
- NEVER trade with opponent unless it enables an immediate settlement/city build
- Avoid trades that allow opponent to build immediately after you
- Calculate the net VP gain of each potential trade
- Use trades to dispose of resources when at risk from robber
- Combine multiple port trades to convert unwanted resources into needed ones
- Be willing to overpay through port trades to secure critical positional advantage

DECISION FRAMEWORK (APPLY TO EVERY TURN):
1. What is my immediate build priority? (settlement > city > longest road/largest army)
2. What resource do I need to complete my highest priority build?
3. What is the fastest way to acquire that resource? (production, trading, development cards)
4. How will this action position me for the next 3 turns?
5. Will this action disrupt my opponent's path to victory?
6. Is there a way to combine multiple actions this turn for greater efficiency?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game State Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state and available options:

## Victory Point Status:
- I have 9/10 VP (3 cities = 6 VP, 1 settlement = 1 VP, longest road = 2 VP)
- RED has 5/10 VP (5 settlements = 5 VP)
- I'm just 1 VP away from winning!

## Resource Inventory:
- I have: 1 🌲WOOD, 1 🧱BRICK, 1 🐑SHEEP, 1 🌾WHEAT
- I need 3 ORE, 2 WHEAT to upgrade my settlement to a city (which would give me 10 VP and win the game)

## Available Actions:
- End turn [0]
- Build roads at various locations [1-5] (Cost: 1 WOOD, 1 BRICK each)

## Strategic Analysis:

My current plan is to trade 4 ORE for 1 WHEAT and then upgrade my settlement at node 22 to a city once I get another WHEAT. However, I don't currently have any ORE to execute this trade.

Looking at my resources, I have exactly what I need to build a road (1 WOOD, 1 BRICK), but building a road doesn't directly help me get the resources I need to win. Since I already have the longest road bonus and don't need to defend it, building additional roads provides minimal strategic value at this point.

The most efficient path to victory is to end my turn now, keep my current resources, and hope to produce the ORE and WHEAT I need in the next few turns. Building a road would deplete my WOOD and BRICK without moving me closer to victory.

<plan>
1. End turn [0] and preserve my WOOD and BRICK
2. Collect resources in subsequent turns
3. Aim to acquire 3 ORE and 1 more WHEAT to upgrade settlement at node 22 to city
4. Win with 10 VP after city upgrade
</plan>

Since none of the available actions bring me closer to upgrading my settlement to a city (which would give me the winning 10th point), the optimal move is to end my turn.

PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist focused on defeating the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRITICAL FOR SUCCESS):
- Above all else, target the highest probability numbers (6 & 8) - these produce resources 5/36 times each
- Strictly prioritize access to all five resources between your two settlements
- Aim for numerical diversity - try to cover 5-6 different dice numbers across your settlements
- Never place initial settlements without analyzing future expansion opportunities
- Prioritize placement on hexes with complementary resources: ore/wheat and brick/wood
- Position roads toward high-value unoccupied areas the opponent cannot easily block
- Choose second settlement to complement your first settlement's resource weaknesses
- Consider 3:1 ports if you can't access a specific resource through settlements
- Analyze opponent placement to avoid contested expansion paths
- ALWAYS calculate production value using probability dots (5-6-8-9 are top priority numbers)

# Game State Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state and my options:

## Victory Point Status
- I (BLUE) have 9/10 victory points, just 1 VP away from winning!
- RED has 5/10 victory points, so they're not an immediate threat

## My Resources
- 1 WOOD, 1 BRICK, 3 SHEEP
- No development cards

## Current Plan Review
My current plan is to:
1. End turn and preserve WOOD and BRICK
2. Collect resources in subsequent turns
3. Acquire 3 ORE and 1 more WHEAT to upgrade settlement at node 22 to city
4. Win with 10 VP after that city upgrade

## Available Options
- Option 0: End turn, preserving my WOOD and BRICK
- Options 1-5: Build various roads using my WOOD and BRICK

## Decision Analysis
The key decision is whether to use my WOOD and BRICK now for a road or save them.

If I build a road:
- Pros: Could potentially block RED player from expansion
- Cons: I would lose the WOOD and BRICK I need for future builds
- Impact: Would delay my ability to complete my critical path to victory

If I end my turn:
- Pros: Preserve WOOD and BRICK for future strategic builds
- Pros: Still on track with my plan to upgrade settlement to city
- Cons: RED might build in areas I could have blocked

My current plan is sound - I'm just 1 VP away from winning, and the fastest path is upgrading my settlement at node 22 to a city. This requires 3 ORE and 2 WHEAT. I already have longest road secured, and I just need to focus on gathering the resources for the city upgrade.

Since I'm already at 9 VP and RED is only at 5 VP, there's no immediate threat. Building another road doesn't help me reach 10 VP faster, and would actually delay my victory by using up resources I may need.

<plan>
End turn and preserve my WOOD and BRICK
Continue collecting resources in subsequent turns
Focus on acquiring 3 ORE and 1 more WHEAT to upgrade settlement at node 22 to city
Win with 10 VP after city upgrade
</plan>

The optimal action is to end my turn and continue with my plan.

# Robber Placement Analysis

I need to analyze where to place the robber to maximize my advantage while disrupting my opponent's production.

## Current Game State
- I (BLUE) have 9/10 VP with longest road
- RED has 5/10 VP
- I need 3 ORE and 1 WHEAT to upgrade my settlement at node 22 to a city, which would give me my 10th VP and win the game
- I currently have 1 WOOD, 1 BRICK, 3 SHEEP

## Robber Placement Options Analysis

Let me analyze each hex and its impact:

**[0] Move robber to (0, 0, 0) - BRICK hex (5)**
- Blocks RED's settlement at node 4 (BRICK production)
- Would also block my own city at node 0 and node 2
- Blocking my own BRICK isn't ideal since I need to maintain versatility

**[1] Move robber to (1, -1, 0) - WOOD hex (6)**
- Blocks RED's settlement at node 6 (WOOD production)
- Would also block my own city at node 2
- Blocking my own WOOD production isn't ideal either

**[2] Move robber to (-1, 0, 1) - SHEEP hex (4)**
- Blocks RED's settlements at nodes 4 and 14 (both SHEEP)
- I already have 3 SHEEP, so disrupting RED's SHEEP is not critical

**[3] Move robber to (-1, 1, 0) - WHEAT hex (9)**
- Blocks RED's settlements at nodes 4, 16, and 17 (all WHEAT)
- This is excellent as it disrupts THREE of RED's WHEAT-producing settlements
- WHEAT is a critical resource for settlements, cities, and development cards
- This would severely limit RED's ability to expand or develop

**[4] Move robber to (0, 1, -1) - DESERT**
- There's no production here to block, making this a wasted placement

**[5] Move robber to (1, 0, -1) - ORE hex (10)**
- Blocks RED's settlement at node 6 (ORE production)
- Would also block my own settlement at node 22 and city at node 0
- Since I need ORE to upgrade my settlement to a city, this would be counterproductive

## Decision

The optimal placement is clearly option [3], moving the robber to (-1, 1, 0) WHEAT hex (9). This blocks THREE of RED's settlements that produce WHEAT, severely hampering their production capabilities without affecting my own resource collection. Additionally, stealing a card from RED might give me a resource I need for my upgrade path.

<plan>
Place robber on WHEAT hex (-1, 1, 0) to block RED's three WHEAT-producing settlements
Continue collecting resources to acquire 3 ORE and 1 WHEAT to upgrade settlement at node 22
Win with 10 VP after city upgrade
</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist focused on defeating the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRITICAL FOR SUCCESS):
- Above all else, target the highest probability numbers (6 & 8) - these produce resources 5/36 times each
- Strictly prioritize access to all five resources between your two settlements
- Aim for numerical diversity - try to cover 5-6 different dice numbers across your settlements
- Never place initial settlements without analyzing future expansion opportunities
- Prioritize placement on hexes with complementary resources: ore/wheat and brick/wood
- Position roads toward high-value unoccupied areas the opponent cannot easily block
- Choose second settlement to complement your first settlement's resource weaknesses
- Consider 3:1 ports if you can't access a specific resource through settlements
- Analyze opponent placement to avoid contested expansion paths
- ALWAYS calculate production value using probability dots (5-6-8-9 are top priority numbers)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-10):
- Build at least one new settlement by turn 10 - expansion is your TOP priority
- Calculate and build along the fastest path to your next settlement location
- Secure missing resources through strategic settlement placement
- Build roads that secure critical expansion paths before the opponent blocks them
- Avoid development cards completely until you have at least 3 total settlements
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1) to complete critical builds
- Target resource diversity through your expansion locations
- Create a minimum 2-turn expansion plan and stick to it

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT AND PRODUCTION (CORE STRATEGY):
- Early game: Focus on wood/brick to expand with roads and settlements
- Mid game: Transition to ore/wheat focus for cities and development cards
- Calculate the resource production value of every potential build
- Only make 4:1 trades when they enable an immediate important build
- Cycle through "build phases" - expansion phase, then city upgrade phase
- Plan resource collection 2 turns ahead to minimize wasteful trades
- Never accumulate 7+ cards before dice rolls
- Diversify production to minimize dependency on any single resource
- Target a minimum of 4 total settlements before prioritizing city upgrades

COUNTERING ALPHABETA ALGORITHM:
- AlphaBeta looks ahead only 2 steps, so plan your moves 3-4 steps ahead
- Create deceptive game states that appear less threatening than they are
- Block the opponent's highest-probability expansion paths immediately
- Play defensively during early game, then aggressively in mid-game
- When opponent has 7+ points, disrupt their highest-producing hex with the robber
- Track opponent's resources and block their most likely next build
- Secure resources that the opponent depends on heavily
- Place roads to cut off opponent from accessing high-value settlement locations
- Position settlements to deny opponent access to key resource hex intersections

ROBBER PLACEMENT AND KNIGHT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-producing hex of your opponent
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat in mid-game when cities are being built
- Target the specific resource the opponent needs for their next likely build
- Use knight cards reactively when the robber blocks your best production
- Save knight cards for the late game if pursuing largest army
- When stealing, select resources that complete your immediate build needs
- Keep track of opponent cards and target resources they've been collecting
- Balance robber placement between disruption and resource acquisition

DEVELOPMENT CARDS VS. BUILDING:
- Only buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and cannot build
- Buy development cards when you're 1-2 knights away from largest army
- Use knight cards immediately when advantageous (don't save unless close to largest army)
- Victory point cards should only supplement your main strategy, not replace it
- Road Building cards are most valuable when you're cut off or racing to a key location
- Monopoly is best used after high-probability dice rolls to collect opponent's stockpile
- Year of Plenty is ideal to complete a high-value build (settlement or city)
- NEVER delay settlement/city building to purchase development cards unless 1 VP from winning

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY FOCUS):
- Aim for 5 total settlements (2 upgraded to cities) = 9 VP
- Then secure largest army OR longest road for the final point
- Always calculate the fastest path to 10 VP in terms of resource costs
- For each potential build, calculate how many turns closer it gets you to victory
- Determine which victory paths are still viable based on board state
- Switch strategies when your primary path is blocked
- Plan for the end-game by turn 10 (know exactly how you will reach 10 points)
- Track opponent's path to victory and actively disrupt with roads or robber

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Trade at ports even at 4:1 ratio if it enables immediate critical build
- NEVER trade with opponent unless it enables an immediate settlement/city build
- Avoid trades that allow opponent to build immediately after you
- Calculate the net VP gain of each potential trade
- Use trades to dispose of resources when at risk from robber
- Combine multiple port trades to convert unwanted resources into needed ones
- Be willing to overpay through port trades to secure critical positional advantage

DECISION FRAMEWORK (APPLY TO EVERY TURN):
1. What is my immediate build priority? (settlement > city > longest road/largest army)
2. What resource do I need to complete my highest priority build?
3. What is the fastest way to acquire that resource? (production, trading, development cards)
4. How will this action position me for the next 3 turns?
5. Will this action disrupt my opponent's path to victory?
6. Is there a way to combine multiple actions this turn for greater efficiency?

# Game Analysis and Strategic Decision

## Current Game State
- I have 9/10 victory points (3 cities, 1 settlement, longest road)
- I need just 1 more VP to win
- Resources: 1 wood, 1 brick, 4 sheep
- My goal is to upgrade my settlement at node 22 to a city (need 3 ore, 2 wheat)

## Evaluating Available Options

### Option 0: End Turn
- This doesn't advance my position and wastes the opportunity to use my resources.

### Options 1-5: Build Road
- I can build one road using my 1 wood and 1 brick
- But I already have longest road, so building more roads doesn't help me reach 10 VP
- Road building would only waste valuable resources I could use for trading

### Options 6-9: Maritime Trade
- Using my 4 sheep to trade for another resource
- Option 6: Get 1 ore - This helps toward city upgrade (need 3 ore total)
- Option 7: Get 1 brick - Not useful since I already have 1 brick
- Option 8: Get 1 wood - Not useful since I already have 1 wood
- Option 9: Get 1 wheat - This helps toward city upgrade (need 2 wheat total)

## Strategic Decision
Since I need 3 ore and 2 wheat to upgrade my settlement at node 22 to a city, and I currently have 0 of each, I need to start collecting these resources. The most efficient path to victory is to trade my excess sheep for either ore or wheat.

Looking at the board state:
- ORE is produced on hex (1, 0, -1) which is a 10 (low probability)
- WHEAT is produced on hexes (0, -1, 1) and (-1, 1, 0), with values 8 and 9
- The robber is currently blocking the WHEAT hex (-1, 1, 0)

<plan>Trade 4 sheep for 1 ore to start collecting resources for city upgrade at node 22. Continue collecting ore and wheat on subsequent turns to reach the 3 ore and 2 wheat needed.</plan>

Since ore is harder for me to obtain (I only have one settlement that produces ore and it's on a low-probability hex), I'll prioritize getting ore through trading.

# Game Analysis: Turn 72

Let me carefully analyze the current game state to determine the optimal move.

## Victory Point Status
- I (BLUE) have 9 VP (3 cities = 6 VP, 1 settlement = 1 VP, Longest Road = 2 VP)
- RED has 5 VP (5 settlements = 5 VP)
- I'm just 1 VP away from winning the game

## Resource Analysis
Current resources:
- 1 wood
- 1 brick
- 1 ore

## Strategic Options

1. **End Turn (Option 0)**
   - This would collect more resources on the next roll
   - Current plan involves upgrading settlement at node 22 to a city (3 ore, 2 wheat needed)
   - I have only 1 ore currently, need 2 more ore and 2 wheat

2. **Build Road (Options 1-5)**
   - Would use my wood and brick resources
   - Extends my road network but doesn't directly contribute to victory points
   - Could potentially block RED's expansion

## Path to Victory Analysis
I need 1 more VP to win. The fastest way would be:
- Upgrade settlement at node 22 to city (+1 VP)
- Need 2 more ore and 2 wheat for this

However, I don't have enough resources currently for this plan. Building a road doesn't get me closer to victory and uses up resources that could be traded.

## Trading Possibilities
With the maritime trade ratio (assuming 4:1), I could potentially:
- Trade 4 wood for 1 ore (but I only have 1 wood)
- Trade 4 brick for 1 ore (but I only have 1 brick)

I don't have enough resources for a beneficial trade.

## Optimal Decision
Since I don't have enough resources to make progress toward my city upgrade and building a road doesn't advance my position significantly (I already have longest road), the best option is to end my turn and collect more resources on the next roll.

<plan>End turn and continue collecting resources (ore and wheat) for city upgrade at node 22. With 9 VP already, upgrading this settlement will give me the winning 10th VP.</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist focused on defeating the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRITICAL FOR SUCCESS):
- Above all else, target the highest probability numbers (6 & 8) - these produce resources 5/36 times each
- Strictly prioritize access to all five resources between your two settlements
- Aim for numerical diversity - try to cover 5-6 different dice numbers across your settlements
- Never place initial settlements without analyzing future expansion opportunities
- Prioritize placement on hexes with complementary resources: ore/wheat and brick/wood
- Position roads toward high-value unoccupied areas the opponent cannot easily block
- Choose second settlement to complement your first settlement's resource weaknesses
- Consider 3:1 ports if you can't access a specific resource through settlements
- Analyze opponent placement to avoid contested expansion paths
- ALWAYS calculate production value using probability dots (5-6-8-9 are top priority numbers)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-10):
- Build at least one new settlement by turn 10 - expansion is your TOP priority
- Calculate and build along the fastest path to your next settlement location
- Secure missing resources through strategic settlement placement
- Build roads that secure critical expansion paths before the opponent blocks them
- Avoid development cards completely until you have at least 3 total settlements
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1) to complete critical builds
- Target resource diversity through your expansion locations
- Create a minimum 2-turn expansion plan and stick to it

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT AND PRODUCTION (CORE STRATEGY):
- Early game: Focus on wood/brick to expand with roads and settlements
- Mid game: Transition to ore/wheat focus for cities and development cards
- Calculate the resource production value of every potential build
- Only make 4:1 trades when they enable an immediate important build
- Cycle through "build phases" - expansion phase, then city upgrade phase
- Plan resource collection 2 turns ahead to minimize wasteful trades
- Never accumulate 7+ cards before dice rolls
- Diversify production to minimize dependency on any single resource
- Target a minimum of 4 total settlements before prioritizing city upgrades

COUNTERING ALPHABETA ALGORITHM:
- AlphaBeta looks ahead only 2 steps, so plan your moves 3-4 steps ahead
- Create deceptive game states that appear less threatening than they are
- Block the opponent's highest-probability expansion paths immediately
- Play defensively during early game, then aggressively in mid-game
- When opponent has 7+ points, disrupt their highest-producing hex with the robber
- Track opponent's resources and block their most likely next build
- Secure resources that the opponent depends on heavily
- Place roads to cut off opponent from accessing high-value settlement locations
- Position settlements to deny opponent access to key resource hex intersections

ROBBER PLACEMENT AND KNIGHT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-producing hex of your opponent
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat in mid-game when cities are being built
- Target the specific resource the opponent needs for their next likely build
- Use knight cards reactively when the robber blocks your best production
- Save knight cards for the late game if pursuing largest army
- When stealing, select resources that complete your immediate build needs
- Keep track of opponent cards and target resources they've been collecting
- Balance robber placement between disruption and resource acquisition

DEVELOPMENT CARDS VS. BUILDING:
- Only buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and cannot build
- Buy development cards when you're 1-2 knights away from largest army
- Use knight cards immediately when advantageous (don't save unless close to largest army)
- Victory point cards should only supplement your main strategy, not replace it
- Road Building cards are most valuable when you're cut off or racing to a key location
- Monopoly is best used after high-probability dice rolls to collect opponent's stockpile
- Year of Plenty is ideal to complete a high-value build (settlement or city)
- NEVER delay settlement/city building to purchase development cards unless 1 VP from winning

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY FOCUS):
- Aim for 5 total settlements (2 upgraded to cities) = 9 VP
- Then secure largest army OR longest road for the final point
- Always calculate the fastest path to 10 VP in terms of resource costs
- For each potential build, calculate how many turns closer it gets you to victory
- Determine which victory paths are still viable based on board state
- Switch strategies when your primary path is blocked
- Plan for the end-game by turn 10 (know exactly how you will reach 10 points)
- Track opponent's path to victory and actively disrupt with roads or robber

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Trade at ports even at 4:1 ratio if it enables immediate critical build
- NEVER trade with opponent unless it enables an immediate settlement/city build
- Avoid trades that allow opponent to build immediately after you
- Calculate the net VP gain of each potential trade
- Use trades to dispose of resources when at risk from robber
- Combine multiple port trades to convert unwanted resources into needed ones
- Be willing to overpay through port trades to secure critical positional advantage

DECISION FRAMEWORK (APPLY TO EVERY TURN):
1. What is my immediate build priority? (settlement > city > longest road/largest army)
2. What resource do I need to complete my highest priority build?
3. What is the fastest way to acquire that resource? (production, trading, development cards)
4. How will this action position me for the next 3 turns?
5. Will this action disrupt my opponent's path to victory?
6. Is there a way to combine multiple actions this turn for greater efficiency?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 74 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  End turn and continue collecting resources (ore and wheat) for city upgrade at node 22. With 9 VP already, upgrading this settlement will give me the winning 10th VP.

# Game Analysis for Settlers of Catan Turn 74

I'll thoroughly analyze my position to determine the optimal move in this critical stage of the game.

## Current Game State Assessment
- I have 9 victory points (3 cities = 6 VP, 1 settlement = 1 VP, longest road = 2 VP)
- I need only 1 more VP to win
- I have 1 wood, 1 brick, 4 wheat, and 1 ore
- The simplest path to victory is upgrading my settlement at node 22 to a city (2 ore + 3 wheat)

## Resource Analysis
To upgrade my settlement at node 22 to a city and win the game, I need:
- Current: 1 ore, 4 wheat
- Required: 2 ore, 3 wheat
- Missing: 1 ore

## Possible Actions
1. End my turn (option 0)
2. Build a road at one of several locations (options 1-5)
3. Trade 4 wheat for 1 ore through maritime trade (option 9)

## Strategic Decision Process

If I trade 4 wheat for 1 ore using option 9, I would then have:
- 1 wood, 1 brick, 0 wheat, 2 ore
- This would give me exactly enough to build a city next turn (if I roll and get at least 1 wheat)
- This is a direct path to victory

If I end my turn (option 0):
- I preserve resources but delay potential victory
- I'd need to wait for a favorable dice roll to get the missing ore
- There's a risk of losing resources to a 7 or knight

Building roads (options 1-5):
- Uses my wood and brick
- Doesn't advance me toward the immediate victory condition
- Only worthwhile if I wanted to secure additional settlement locations for a different victory path

## Optimal Decision
I should trade 4 wheat for 1 ore (option 9). This gives me the second ore I need for a city upgrade on my next turn, which will give me my 10th victory point and win the game. This is the fastest and most direct path to victory given my current resources and position.

<plan>Trade 4 wheat for 1 ore now, giving me 2 ore total. On my next turn, I'll upgrade the settlement at node 22 to a city, giving me my 10th VP and winning the game.</plan>

# Game State Analysis

Let's carefully analyze the current game state:

- I have 9 victory points: 3 cities (6 VP), 1 settlement (1 VP), and longest road (2 VP)
- I need just 1 more VP to win the game
- My current resources: 1 wood, 1 brick, 1 ore
- My plan involves upgrading the settlement at node 22 to a city, which would give me my 10th VP
- To upgrade to a city, I need 3 ore and 2 wheat, but I only have 1 ore (and no wheat)

## Available Actions Review
- [0] End turn - This would simply pass play to the opponent
- [1-5] Build roads at various locations - Each costs 1 wood and 1 brick

## Strategic Evaluation

Looking at my current situation, I have exactly enough resources (1 wood, 1 brick) to build one additional road. However, building a road doesn't directly help me win since:
1. I already have longest road bonus
2. I need ore and wheat to upgrade my settlement to a city

My current plan states: "Trade 4 wheat for 1 ore now, giving me 2 ore total." However, I don't currently have any wheat to trade.

Given that:
- I can't upgrade my settlement now (insufficient resources)
- Building a road doesn't get me closer to victory 
- I don't have resources to trade as planned

The best action is to end my turn and wait for resource production on the next dice roll.

<plan>
Wait for resource production (particularly ore and wheat) from future dice rolls. I need 2 more ore and 2 wheat to upgrade my settlement at node 22 to a city. I'll build no roads now and conserve my wood/brick for potential trades later if needed.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist focused on defeating the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRITICAL FOR SUCCESS):
- Above all else, target the highest probability numbers (6 & 8) - these produce resources 5/36 times each
- Strictly prioritize access to all five resources between your two settlements
- Aim for numerical diversity - try to cover 5-6 different dice numbers across your settlements
- Never place initial settlements without analyzing future expansion opportunities
- Prioritize placement on hexes with complementary resources: ore/wheat and brick/wood
- Position roads toward high-value unoccupied areas the opponent cannot easily block
- Choose second settlement to complement your first settlement's resource weaknesses
- Consider 3:1 ports if you can't access a specific resource through settlements
- Analyze opponent placement to avoid contested expansion paths
- ALWAYS calculate production value using probability dots (5-6-8-9 are top priority numbers)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-10):
- Build at least one new settlement by turn 10 - expansion is your TOP priority
- Calculate and build along the fastest path to your next settlement location
- Secure missing resources through strategic settlement placement
- Build roads that secure critical expansion paths before the opponent blocks them
- Avoid development cards completely until you have at least 3 total settlements
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1) to complete critical builds
- Target resource diversity through your expansion locations
- Create a minimum 2-turn expansion plan and stick to it

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT AND PRODUCTION (CORE STRATEGY):
- Early game: Focus on wood/brick to expand with roads and settlements
- Mid game: Transition to ore/wheat focus for cities and development cards
- Calculate the resource production value of every potential build
- Only make 4:1 trades when they enable an immediate important build
- Cycle through "build phases" - expansion phase, then city upgrade phase
- Plan resource collection 2 turns ahead to minimize wasteful trades
- Never accumulate 7+ cards before dice rolls
- Diversify production to minimize dependency on any single resource
- Target a minimum of 4 total settlements before prioritizing city upgrades

COUNTERING ALPHABETA ALGORITHM:
- AlphaBeta looks ahead only 2 steps, so plan your moves 3-4 steps ahead
- Create deceptive game states that appear less threatening than they are
- Block the opponent's highest-probability expansion paths immediately
- Play defensively during early game, then aggressively in mid-game
- When opponent has 7+ points, disrupt their highest-producing hex with the robber
- Track opponent's resources and block their most likely next build
- Secure resources that the opponent depends on heavily
- Place roads to cut off opponent from accessing high-value settlement locations
- Position settlements to deny opponent access to key resource hex intersections

ROBBER PLACEMENT AND KNIGHT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-producing hex of your opponent
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat in mid-game when cities are being built
- Target the specific resource the opponent needs for their next likely build
- Use knight cards reactively when the robber blocks your best production
- Save knight cards for the late game if pursuing largest army
- When stealing, select resources that complete your immediate build needs
- Keep track of opponent cards and target resources they've been collecting
- Balance robber placement between disruption and resource acquisition

DEVELOPMENT CARDS VS. BUILDING:
- Only buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and cannot build
- Buy development cards when you're 1-2 knights away from largest army
- Use knight cards immediately when advantageous (don't save unless close to largest army)
- Victory point cards should only supplement your main strategy, not replace it
- Road Building cards are most valuable when you're cut off or racing to a key location
- Monopoly is best used after high-probability dice rolls to collect opponent's stockpile
- Year of Plenty is ideal to complete a high-value build (settlement or city)
- NEVER delay settlement/city building to purchase development cards unless 1 VP from winning

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY FOCUS):
- Aim for 5 total settlements (2 upgraded to cities) = 9 VP
- Then secure largest army OR longest road for the final point
- Always calculate the fastest path to 10 VP in terms of resource costs
- For each potential build, calculate how many turns closer it gets you to victory
- Determine which victory paths are still viable based on board state
- Switch strategies when your primary path is blocked
- Plan for the end-game by turn 10 (know exactly how you will reach 10 points)
- Track opponent's path to victory and actively disrupt with roads or robber

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Trade at ports even at 4:1 ratio if it enables immediate critical build
- NEVER trade with opponent unless it enables an immediate settlement/city build
- Avoid trades that allow opponent to build immediately after you
- Calculate the net VP gain of each potential trade
- Use trades to dispose of resources when at risk from robber
- Combine multiple port trades to convert unwanted resources into needed ones
- Be willing to overpay through port trades to secure critical positional advantage

DECISION FRAMEWORK (APPLY TO EVERY TURN):
1. What is my immediate build priority? (settlement > city > longest road/largest army)
2. What resource do I need to complete my highest priority build?
3. What is the fastest way to acquire that resource? (production, trading, development cards)
4. How will this action position me for the next 3 turns?
5. Will this action disrupt my opponent's path to victory?
6. Is there a way to combine multiple actions this turn for greater efficiency?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 76 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  Wait for resource production (particularly ore and wheat) from future dice rolls. I need 2 more ore and 2 wheat to upgrade my settlement at node 22 to a city. I'll build no roads now and conserve my wood/brick for potential trades later if needed.
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.

# Game Analysis and Decision Process

I'll analyze the current game state to determine my optimal move:

## Current Game Status
- I have 9/10 VP (3 cities + 1 settlement + longest road)
- My resources: 1 Wood, 5 Brick, 4 Wheat, 2 Ore
- I need one more VP to win
- My opponent has only 5/10 VP

## Possible Victory Paths
1. **Upgrade settlement at node 22 to a city**: Need 3 Ore + 2 Wheat (I have 2 Ore + 4 Wheat already)
2. **Build a development card**: Need 1 Ore + 1 Wheat + 1 Sheep (I have 2 Ore + 4 Wheat but no Sheep)

## Resource Analysis
- I need 1 more Ore to upgrade my settlement at node 22
- I have no Sheep to build development cards
- I can trade 4 Brick for 1 Ore through port trade

## Strategic Considerations
- I'm at 9 VP and need just 1 more to win
- My opponent is at 5 VP, so I don't need to worry about them winning immediately
- The fastest path to victory is upgrading my settlement to a city
- I don't need to build more roads since I already have longest road

## Decision
The optimal move is to trade 4 Brick for 1 Ore (Action #7). This gives me the 3 Ore I need to upgrade my settlement to a city on my next turn.

<plan>Trade 4 Brick for 1 Ore this turn. On my next turn, upgrade my settlement at node 22 to a city using 3 Ore + 2 Wheat to secure the victory with 10 VP.</plan>

# Game Analysis for Turn 76

Let me analyze the current game state and available actions to determine the optimal move.

## Current Situation
- I have 9 VP (3 cities = 6 VP, 1 settlement = 1 VP, longest road = 2 VP)
- I need 1 more VP to win
- My resources: 1 🌲WOOD, 1 🧱BRICK, 4 🌾WHEAT, 3 ⛏️ORE
- Opponent has 5 VP and is not an immediate threat

## Victory Path Analysis
My current plan is to upgrade my settlement at node 22 to a city, which would give me the 10th VP needed to win. This requires 2 WHEAT and 3 ORE.

I currently have 4 WHEAT and 3 ORE, so I have enough WHEAT but exactly the right amount of ORE. I can directly execute the upgrade action.

## Action Evaluation
1. **Option 6: Upgrade settlement to city at node 22** (Cost: 2 🌾WHEAT, 3 ⛏️ORE)
   - This immediately gives me 10 VP and wins the game
   - I have exactly the resources needed
   - This is clearly the optimal move

2. **Options 1-5: Build roads**
   - No benefit since I already have longest road
   - Would delay victory

3. **Options 7-10: Maritime trades**
   - Not needed since I already have the resources for victory

4. **Option 0: End turn**
   - Suboptimal as I can win this turn

## Decision
Since I have exactly the resources needed to upgrade my settlement to a city (2 WHEAT and 3 ORE) and this will give me my 10th victory point, the choice is clear. I should immediately upgrade to a city.

<plan>Upgrade settlement at node 22 to a city, achieving 10 victory points and winning the game.</plan>

- Secure missing resources through strategic settlement placement
- Build roads that secure critical expansion paths before the opponent blocks them
- Avoid development cards completely until you have at least 3 total settlements
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1) to complete critical builds
- Target resource diversity through your expansion locations
- Create a minimum 2-turn expansion plan and stick to it

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT AND PRODUCTION (CORE STRATEGY):
- Early game: Focus on wood/brick to expand with roads and settlements
- Mid game: Transition to ore/wheat focus for cities and development cards
- Calculate the resource production value of every potential build
- Only make 4:1 trades when they enable an immediate important build
- Cycle through "build phases" - expansion phase, then city upgrade phase
- Plan resource collection 2 turns ahead to minimize wasteful trades
- Never accumulate 7+ cards before dice rolls
- Diversify production to minimize dependency on any single resource
- Target a minimum of 4 total settlements before prioritizing city upgrades

COUNTERING ALPHABETA ALGORITHM:
- AlphaBeta looks ahead only 2 steps, so plan your moves 3-4 steps ahead
- Create deceptive game states that appear less threatening than they are
- Block the opponent's highest-probability expansion paths immediately
- Play defensively during early game, then aggressively in mid-game
- When opponent has 7+ points, disrupt their highest-producing hex with the robber
- Track opponent's resources and block their most likely next build
- Secure resources that the opponent depends on heavily
- Place roads to cut off opponent from accessing high-value settlement locations
- Position settlements to deny opponent access to key resource hex intersections

ROBBER PLACEMENT AND KNIGHT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-producing hex of your opponent
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat in mid-game when cities are being built
- Target the specific resource the opponent needs for their next likely build
- Use knight cards reactively when the robber blocks your best production
- Save knight cards for the late game if pursuing largest army
- When stealing, select resources that complete your immediate build needs
- Keep track of opponent cards and target resources they've been collecting
- Balance robber placement between disruption and resource acquisition

DEVELOPMENT CARDS VS. BUILDING:
- Only buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and cannot build
- Buy development cards when you're 1-2 knights away from largest army
- Use knight cards immediately when advantageous (don't save unless close to largest army)
- Victory point cards should only supplement your main strategy, not replace it
- Road Building cards are most valuable when you're cut off or racing to a key location
- Monopoly is best used after high-probability dice rolls to collect opponent's stockpile
- Year of Plenty is ideal to complete a high-value build (settlement or city)
- NEVER delay settlement/city building to purchase development cards unless 1 VP from winning

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY FOCUS):
- Aim for 5 total settlements (2 upgraded to cities) = 9 VP
- Then secure largest army OR longest road for the final point
- Always calculate the fastest path to 10 VP in terms of resource costs
- For each potential build, calculate how many turns closer it gets you to victory
- Determine which victory paths are still viable based on board state
- Switch strategies when your primary path is blocked
- Plan for the end-game by turn 10 (know exactly how you will reach 10 points)
- Track opponent's path to victory and actively disrupt with roads or robber

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Trade at ports even at 4:1 ratio if it enables immediate critical build
- NEVER trade with opponent unless it enables an immediate settlement/city build
- Avoid trades that allow opponent to build immediately after you
- Calculate the net VP gain of each potential trade
- Use trades to dispose of resources when at risk from robber
- Combine multiple port trades to convert unwanted resources into needed ones
- Be willing to overpay through port trades to secure critical positional advantage

DECISION FRAMEWORK (APPLY TO EVERY TURN):
1. What is my immediate build priority? (settlement > city > longest road/largest army)
2. What resource do I need to complete my highest priority build?
3. What is the fastest way to acquire that resource? (production, trading, development cards)
4. How will this action position me for the next 3 turns?
5. Will this action disrupt my opponent's path to victory?
6. Is there a way to combine multiple actions this turn for greater efficiency?

# Initial Settlement Placement Analysis

I need to carefully analyze the best location for my first settlement. This is a critical decision that will greatly impact the entire game.

## Resource Analysis
Let me analyze the resource hexes and their probability values:
- 🌲Wood (8): High probability (5/36)
- 🧱Brick (10): Medium probability (3/36)
- 🌾Wheat (9): Medium-high probability (4/36)
- 🌾Wheat (5): Medium probability (4/36)
- 🐑Sheep (3): Low probability (2/36)
- ⛏️Ore (4): Low probability (3/36)
- 🏜️Desert with robber: No production

## Node Value Analysis
The most valuable nodes would be at intersections of high-probability tiles:
- Node 1: Connects to 🌲Wood (8), ⛏️Ore (4), 🌾Wheat (9) - excellent mix with strong probabilities
- Node 0: Connects to 🌲Wood (8), ⛏️Ore (4), 🌾Wheat (5) - good mix
- Node 3: Connects to 🌲Wood (8), 🧱Brick (10), 🏜️Desert - decent but includes desert
- Node 2: Connects to 🌲Wood (8), 🧱Brick (10), 🌾Wheat (9) - excellent mix with strong probabilities

## Strategic Evaluation
Among these options:
- Node 1 gives wood (8), ore (4), and wheat (9) - strong probabilities and complementary resources
- Node 2 gives wood (8), brick (10), and wheat (9) - excellent for early expansion with wood/brick combo

Since initial expansion is critical, and the wood (8) + brick (10) combination at node 2 will allow me to build roads and settlements quickly, while also providing wheat (9) for growth, node 2 is the optimal choice. This covers three different resources with good probability numbers (8,9,10).

<plan>Place first settlement at node 2 to secure wood, brick, and wheat. For second settlement, look to secure ore, sheep, and possibly another wheat or high probability resource to complement.</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist focused on defeating the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRITICAL FOR SUCCESS):
- Above all else, target the highest probability numbers (6 & 8) - these produce resources 5/36 times each
- Strictly prioritize access to all five resources between your two settlements
- Aim for numerical diversity - try to cover 5-6 different dice numbers across your settlements
- Never place initial settlements without analyzing future expansion opportunities
- Prioritize placement on hexes with complementary resources: ore/wheat and brick/wood
- Position roads toward high-value unoccupied areas the opponent cannot easily block
- Choose second settlement to complement your first settlement's resource weaknesses
- Consider 3:1 ports if you can't access a specific resource through settlements
- Analyze opponent placement to avoid contested expansion paths
- ALWAYS calculate production value using probability dots (5-6-8-9 are top priority numbers)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-10):
- Build at least one new settlement by turn 10 - expansion is your TOP priority
- Calculate and build along the fastest path to your next settlement location

# Analysis of Initial Road Placement

I need to place my first road after placing my initial settlement at node 2. This is a critical decision that will determine my future expansion options.

First, let me analyze my current settlement position:
- Node 2 gives me access to wood (hex 8 - excellent probability) and wheat (hex 9 - good probability)
- I still need to secure ore, sheep, and brick with my second settlement

Now, let me examine each road option:

**Option 0: Build road at edge (2, 3)**
- Direction: Toward the brick hex (10)
- This would allow me to expand toward nodes 3, 12, 13, etc.
- Good for securing brick resource which I'll need for early expansion
- Could potentially access the desert hex area

**Option 1: Build road at edge (2, 9)**
- Direction: Toward wheat hex (9) 
- This would allow me to expand toward nodes 6, 7, 8, etc.
- May lead to ore hex (4) which I need

**Option 2: Build road at edge (1, 2)**
- Direction: Toward wheat hex (5) and sheep hex (3)
- This would allow me to expand toward nodes 0, 5, 16, etc.
- Could help secure sheep which I'm missing

Looking at the overall board connectivity and my future needs:
- I should prioritize expanding toward resources I don't have yet: ore, sheep, and brick
- Option 2 seems most promising as it heads toward sheep (hex 3) and potentially access to ore
- This direction also leads to a wider area of the board with more settlement opportunities
- Building toward nodes 0, 5, and potentially 16 gives me access to multiple resource types

<plan>Place road at edge (1, 2) to expand toward sheep and ore resources. For second settlement, aim for node 0 to secure ore (hex 4), wood (hex 8), and wheat (hex 5) - giving me access to 4 resource types total.</plan>

The optimal choice is option 2, as it provides the best path toward resource diversity and expansion opportunities.

# Analysis of Initial Settlement Placement

I'm currently in the initial setup phase where I need to place my second settlement. This is a crucial decision that will significantly impact my entire game strategy.

## Resource Assessment of Current Position
My first settlement is at node 2, which produces:
- 🌲Wood (8) - excellent production (3 dots)
- 🌾Wheat (9) - good production (2 dots)

## Missing Resources
I currently lack access to:
- 🧱Brick
- ⛏️Ore
- 🐑Sheep

## Node Analysis for Second Settlement

Looking at my options, I need to prioritize:
1. High probability numbers (especially 6 and 8)
2. Access to my missing resources (brick, ore, sheep)
3. Future expansion potential

Analyzing the available nodes:

- Node 14 stands out immediately as it provides:
  - 🧱Brick (10) - moderate production (1 dot)
  - 🐑Sheep (3) - low production (1 dot)

- Node 13 gives:
  - 🧱Brick (10) - moderate production (1 dot)

- Node 22 provides:
  - ⛏️Ore (4) - low production (1 dot)

The strongest option is node 14, which gives me access to both brick and sheep, two resources I'm currently missing. While the number probabilities aren't ideal (10 and 3), this gives me access to 4 out of 5 resource types (wood, wheat, brick, and sheep), leaving only ore missing.

This complements my first settlement and follows the rule of prioritizing access to all five resources between my two settlements.

<plan>
Place my second settlement at node 14 to gain access to brick and sheep. Then focus on expanding toward ore resources. Next steps will be to collect wood and brick to build roads toward an ore-producing hex for my third settlement.
</plan>

## Decision
I will place my second settlement at node 14, which gives me brick and sheep access to complement my first settlement's wood and wheat production.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist focused on defeating the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRITICAL FOR SUCCESS):
- Above all else, target the highest probability numbers (6 & 8) - these produce resources 5/36 times each
- Strictly prioritize access to all five resources between your two settlements
- Aim for numerical diversity - try to cover 5-6 different dice numbers across your settlements
- Never place initial settlements without analyzing future expansion opportunities
- Prioritize placement on hexes with complementary resources: ore/wheat and brick/wood
- Position roads toward high-value unoccupied areas the opponent cannot easily block
- Choose second settlement to complement your first settlement's resource weaknesses
- Consider 3:1 ports if you can't access a specific resource through settlements
- Analyze opponent placement to avoid contested expansion paths
- ALWAYS calculate production value using probability dots (5-6-8-9 are top priority numbers)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-10):
- Build at least one new settlement by turn 10 - expansion is your TOP priority
- Calculate and build along the fastest path to your next settlement location
- Secure missing resources through strategic settlement placement
- Build roads that secure critical expansion paths before the opponent blocks them
- Avoid development cards completely until you have at least 3 total settlements
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1) to complete critical builds
- Target resource diversity through your expansion locations
- Create a minimum 2-turn expansion plan and stick to it

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT AND PRODUCTION (CORE STRATEGY):
- Early game: Focus on wood/brick to expand with roads and settlements
- Mid game: Transition to ore/wheat focus for cities and development cards
- Calculate the resource production value of every potential build
- Only make 4:1 trades when they enable an immediate important build
- Cycle through "build phases" - expansion phase, then city upgrade phase
- Plan resource collection 2 turns ahead to minimize wasteful trades
- Never accumulate 7+ cards before dice rolls
- Diversify production to minimize dependency on any single resource
- Target a minimum of 4 total settlements before prioritizing city upgrades

COUNTERING ALPHABETA ALGORITHM:
- AlphaBeta looks ahead only 2 steps, so plan your moves 3-4 steps ahead
- Create deceptive game states that appear less threatening than they are
- Block the opponent's highest-probability expansion paths immediately
- Play defensively during early game, then aggressively in mid-game
- When opponent has 7+ points, disrupt their highest-producing hex with the robber
- Track opponent's resources and block their most likely next build
- Secure resources that the opponent depends on heavily
- Place roads to cut off opponent from accessing high-value settlement locations
- Position settlements to deny opponent access to key resource hex intersections

ROBBER PLACEMENT AND KNIGHT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-producing hex of your opponent
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat in mid-game when cities are being built
- Target the specific resource the opponent needs for their next likely build
- Use knight cards reactively when the robber blocks your best production
- Save knight cards for the late game if pursuing largest army
- When stealing, select resources that complete your immediate build needs
- Keep track of opponent cards and target resources they've been collecting
- Balance robber placement between disruption and resource acquisition

DEVELOPMENT CARDS VS. BUILDING:
- Only buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and cannot build
- Buy development cards when you're 1-2 knights away from largest army
- Use knight cards immediately when advantageous (don't save unless close to largest army)
- Victory point cards should only supplement your main strategy, not replace it
- Road Building cards are most valuable when you're cut off or racing to a key location
- Monopoly is best used after high-probability dice rolls to collect opponent's stockpile
- Year of Plenty is ideal to complete a high-value build (settlement or city)
- NEVER delay settlement/city building to purchase development cards unless 1 VP from winning

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY FOCUS):
- Aim for 5 total settlements (2 upgraded to cities) = 9 VP
- Then secure largest army OR longest road for the final point
- Always calculate the fastest path to 10 VP in terms of resource costs
- For each potential build, calculate how many turns closer it gets you to victory
- Determine which victory paths are still viable based on board state
- Switch strategies when your primary path is blocked
- Plan for the end-game by turn 10 (know exactly how you will reach 10 points)
- Track opponent's path to victory and actively disrupt with roads or robber

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Trade at ports even at 4:1 ratio if it enables immediate critical build
- NEVER trade with opponent unless it enables an immediate settlement/city build
- Avoid trades that allow opponent to build immediately after you
- Calculate the net VP gain of each potential trade
- Use trades to dispose of resources when at risk from robber
- Combine multiple port trades to convert unwanted resources into needed ones
- Be willing to overpay through port trades to secure critical positional advantage

DECISION FRAMEWORK (APPLY TO EVERY TURN):
1. What is my immediate build priority? (settlement > city > longest road/largest army)
2. What resource do I need to complete my highest priority build?
3. What is the fastest way to acquire that resource? (production, trading, development cards)
4. How will this action position me for the next 3 turns?
5. Will this action disrupt my opponent's path to victory?
6. Is there a way to combine multiple actions this turn for greater efficiency?

# Initial Settlement Analysis

First, I'll analyze my current position on the board:
- My first settlement is at node 2, producing wood (8) and wheat (9) - good productivity with 5 dots combined
- My second settlement is at node 14, producing only brick (10) - modest productivity with 2 dots
- I need to expand my resource variety and production

# Road Building Options

I have two options for placing my initial road:
- [0] Build road at edge (13, 14)
- [1] Build road at edge (14, 15)

Let me analyze both possibilities:

## Option 0: Build at edge (13, 14)
- This would extend toward node 13
- Node 13 connects to brick (10) hex which I already have access to
- This path doesn't immediately lead to new or diverse resources

## Option 1: Build at edge (14, 15)
- This extends toward node 15
- Node 15 connects to brick (10) and sheep (3) hexes
- Future expansion from node 15 could lead to node 16, which connects to sheep (3) and wheat (5)
- This direction gives me a path toward gaining sheep access and additional wheat

# Strategic Considerations

My current plan is to expand toward ore, but I notice:
- I currently lack sheep and ore resources
- The ore hex I can see has a low-probability number (4)
- The path toward edge (14, 15) leads to sheep access and eventually could help me reach other areas of the board

# Decision

I should place my road at edge (14, 15) which:
1. Gives me a path toward sheep resources
2. Creates better expansion opportunities
3. Provides more options for my third settlement location
4. Sets me up better for future growth

<plan>Build my initial road at (14, 15) to expand toward sheep resources. Next, collect wood/brick to continue road building toward node 16 for my next settlement, which will provide sheep and additional wheat access. Continue expanding to find ore resources for late-game city upgrades.</plan>

# Analysis of Robber Placement Options

Let me examine all options carefully to determine the optimal robber placement:

**Option 0**: Move robber to (0, 0, 0) [Wood hex, value 8]
- This blocks my own high-value wood production (8 = 5/36 probability)
- Would disrupt RED's access to wood, but also severely hampers my own development
- I'd steal a card from RED, but blocking my own best hex is counterproductive

**Option 1**: Move robber to (1, -1, 0) [Wheat hex, value 9]
- This blocks a wheat hex with good value (9 = 4/36 probability)
- Would disrupt my own settlement at node 2
- However, no one to steal from, reducing the benefit

**Option 2**: Move robber to (-1, 0, 1) [Brick hex, value 10]
- This blocks a brick hex with decent value (10 = 3/36 probability)
- Affects both me and RED (RED's settlement at node 4)
- I can steal from RED
- Brick is crucial for expansion (roads/settlements)

**Option 3**: Move robber to (-1, 1, 0) [Sheep hex, value 3]
- This blocks a sheep hex with low value (3 = 2/36 probability)
- Only affects RED's settlement at node 4
- I can steal from RED
- Low production impact since 3 is rare

**Option 4**: Move robber to (0, 1, -1) [Wheat hex, value 5]
- This blocks a wheat hex with moderate value (5 = 4/36 probability)
- Affects RED's settlement at node 0
- I can steal from RED
- Medium production impact

**Option 5**: Move robber to (1, 0, -1) [Ore hex, value 4]
- This blocks an ore hex with low value (4 = 3/36 probability)
- Affects RED's settlement at node 0
- I can steal from RED
- Low-medium production impact

## Strategic Decision

Looking at RED's buildings and roads:
- RED has settlements at high-value locations (especially node 0)
- RED has more roads built (3 vs my 2)
- RED likely needs wood/brick to continue road expansion

Given my current plan to expand toward node 16, I need to:
1. Disrupt RED's expansion capabilities
2. Target resources RED likely needs without hurting my own production
3. Choose a high-value hex to maximize disruption

The best option is to target RED's ability to expand by blocking either brick or wood. Since option 0 would severely hurt my own production, option 2 (brick hex) is the optimal choice. This hits RED's settlement at node 4 which produces brick, and brick is crucial for early expansion.

<plan>Continue road building from node 15 toward node 16 for my next settlement. Focus on collecting wood/brick to enable expansion. Block RED's brick production to slow their expansion while I develop mine. Next target is to secure sheep resources through a new settlement.</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist focused on defeating the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRITICAL FOR SUCCESS):
- Above all else, target the highest probability numbers (6 & 8) - these produce resources 5/36 times each
- Strictly prioritize access to all five resources between your two settlements
- Aim for numerical diversity - try to cover 5-6 different dice numbers across your settlements
- Never place initial settlements without analyzing future expansion opportunities
- Prioritize placement on hexes with complementary resources: ore/wheat and brick/wood
- Position roads toward high-value unoccupied areas the opponent cannot easily block
- Choose second settlement to complement your first settlement's resource weaknesses
- Consider 3:1 ports if you can't access a specific resource through settlements
- Analyze opponent placement to avoid contested expansion paths
- ALWAYS calculate production value using probability dots (5-6-8-9 are top priority numbers)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-10):
- Build at least one new settlement by turn 10 - expansion is your TOP priority
- Calculate and build along the fastest path to your next settlement location
- Secure missing resources through strategic settlement placement
- Build roads that secure critical expansion paths before the opponent blocks them
- Avoid development cards completely until you have at least 3 total settlements
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1) to complete critical builds
- Target resource diversity through your expansion locations
- Create a minimum 2-turn expansion plan and stick to it

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT AND PRODUCTION (CORE STRATEGY):
- Early game: Focus on wood/brick to expand with roads and settlements
- Mid game: Transition to ore/wheat focus for cities and development cards
- Calculate the resource production value of every potential build
- Only make 4:1 trades when they enable an immediate important build
- Cycle through "build phases" - expansion phase, then city upgrade phase
- Plan resource collection 2 turns ahead to minimize wasteful trades
- Never accumulate 7+ cards before dice rolls
- Diversify production to minimize dependency on any single resource
- Target a minimum of 4 total settlements before prioritizing city upgrades

COUNTERING ALPHABETA ALGORITHM:
- AlphaBeta looks ahead only 2 steps, so plan your moves 3-4 steps ahead
- Create deceptive game states that appear less threatening than they are
- Block the opponent's highest-probability expansion paths immediately
- Play defensively during early game, then aggressively in mid-game
- When opponent has 7+ points, disrupt their highest-producing hex with the robber
- Track opponent's resources and block their most likely next build
- Secure resources that the opponent depends on heavily
- Place roads to cut off opponent from accessing high-value settlement locations
- Position settlements to deny opponent access to key resource hex intersections

ROBBER PLACEMENT AND KNIGHT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-producing hex of your opponent
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat in mid-game when cities are being built
- Target the specific resource the opponent needs for their next likely build
- Use knight cards reactively when the robber blocks your best production
- Save knight cards for the late game if pursuing largest army
- When stealing, select resources that complete your immediate build needs
- Keep track of opponent cards and target resources they've been collecting
- Balance robber placement between disruption and resource acquisition

DEVELOPMENT CARDS VS. BUILDING:
- Only buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and cannot build
- Buy development cards when you're 1-2 knights away from largest army
- Use knight cards immediately when advantageous (don't save unless close to largest army)
- Victory point cards should only supplement your main strategy, not replace it
- Road Building cards are most valuable when you're cut off or racing to a key location
- Monopoly is best used after high-probability dice rolls to collect opponent's stockpile
- Year of Plenty is ideal to complete a high-value build (settlement or city)
- NEVER delay settlement/city building to purchase development cards unless 1 VP from winning

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY FOCUS):
- Aim for 5 total settlements (2 upgraded to cities) = 9 VP
- Then secure largest army OR longest road for the final point
- Always calculate the fastest path to 10 VP in terms of resource costs
- For each potential build, calculate how many turns closer it gets you to victory
- Determine which victory paths are still viable based on board state
- Switch strategies when your primary path is blocked
- Plan for the end-game by turn 10 (know exactly how you will reach 10 points)
- Track opponent's path to victory and actively disrupt with roads or robber

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Trade at ports even at 4:1 ratio if it enables immediate critical build
- NEVER trade with opponent unless it enables an immediate settlement/city build
- Avoid trades that allow opponent to build immediately after you
- Calculate the net VP gain of each potential trade
- Use trades to dispose of resources when at risk from robber
- Combine multiple port trades to convert unwanted resources into needed ones
- Be willing to overpay through port trades to secure critical positional advantage

DECISION FRAMEWORK (APPLY TO EVERY TURN):
1. What is my immediate build priority? (settlement > city > longest road/largest army)
2. What resource do I need to complete my highest priority build?
3. What is the fastest way to acquire that resource? (production, trading, development cards)
4. How will this action position me for the next 3 turns?
5. Will this action disrupt my opponent's path to victory?
6. Is there a way to combine multiple actions this turn for greater efficiency?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game Analysis for Turn 14

Let me carefully analyze the current game state and my available options to determine the optimal action.

## Current State Assessment
- I have 2 VP with 2 settlements
- I have 1 🌲WOOD, 1 🧱BRICK, 1 🌾WHEAT
- My opponent has 8 hidden cards, suggesting they may be building soon
- The robber is on the brick hex (-1, 0, 1), which is connected to my settlement at node 14

## Resource Production Analysis
- My settlement at node 2: 🌲8[⭐⭐⭐], 🌾9[⭐⭐] - good wood and wheat production
- My settlement at node 14: 🧱10[⭐] - brick production (currently blocked by robber)
- I need to enhance my resource diversity, particularly sheep and ore

## Available Road Building Options
I have exactly the resources needed (1 wood, 1 brick) to build one road. Let's analyze each option:

1. Edge (13, 14): This moves backward from my settlement at 14, offering no strategic advantage
2. Edge (15, 17): Extends toward node 16/17, potentially accessing sheep from the 3 hex
3. Edge (2, 3): Extends from my settlement at node 2 toward brick hex, but that's already blocked
4. Edge (2, 9): Extends from node 2 toward the desert, not strategically valuable
5. Edge (4, 15): Creates a connection between my two existing roads, but doesn't advance expansion

## Strategic Considerations
- I need to expand to gain more resources and victory points
- My current plan involves expanding toward node 16 for sheep access
- RED appears to be expanding aggressively with 8 cards and 3 roads
- I should prioritize securing valuable locations before RED can reach them

## Option Evaluation
Looking at the node grid, option [2] (building at edge 15, 17) clearly advances my expansion toward node 16, which would give me access to the sheep resource that I'm currently missing. This aligns with my stated plan and gets me one step closer to building my next settlement.

<plan>Continue expanding toward node 16 to gain access to sheep resources. After completing the road to node 17, I need one more road to reach node 16, then collect resources for a settlement there. This settlement would give me sheep production and improve my resource diversity. Once I have 3 settlements, I'll focus on city upgrades to accelerate toward the 10 VP goal.</plan>

After careful analysis, I'm selecting option 2 to build a road at edge (15, 17), which advances my position toward my next settlement location and follows my strategic expansion plan.

RESPONSE:
I need to analyze where to place the robber to maximize my strategic advantage while disrupting the RED player's position effectively.

Let me analyze each hex location option:

[0] Move robber to (0, 0, 0) - Wood hex with value 8
- This is the most productive hex (8 = ⭐⭐⭐)
- RED has 2 settlements getting resources from this hex
- I also have 1 settlement on this hex
- Blocking this would hurt RED more than me (they lose 2 production nodes, I lose 1)

[1] Move robber to (1, -1, 0) - Wheat hex with value 9
- Good productivity (9 = ⭐⭐)
- RED has 2 settlements getting wheat here
- I have 1 settlement on this hex
- Similar impact as option 0, but slightly less productive overall

[2] Move robber to (-1, 0, 1) - Brick hex with value 10
- Less productive (10 = ⭐)
- RED has 1 settlement getting brick here
- I have 1 settlement on this hex
- Would hurt us equally in brick production

[3] Move robber to (-1, 1, 0) - Sheep hex with value 3
- Lowest productivity (3 = ⭐)
- RED has 1 settlement getting sheep
- I have 0 settlements here
- Only blocks RED but targets a rarely rolled number

[4] Move robber to (0, 1, -1) - Wheat hex with value 5
- Medium productivity (5 = ⭐⭐)
- RED has 1 settlement here
- I have 0 settlements here
- Blocks only RED without hurting my production

[5] Move robber to (1, 0, -1) - Ore hex with value 4
- Low productivity (4 = ⭐)
- RED has 2 settlements here
- I have 0 settlements here
- Blocks only RED without hurting my production

Strategic considerations:
1. RED is ahead with 3 settlements vs my 2
2. I want to slow RED's production without hurting my own
3. I should target resources they need for expansion
4. In mid-game, ore and wheat become important for city building

Looking at RED's settlements, they have access to all resource types, but ore and wheat are crucial for city development. Moving the robber to hex (1, 0, -1), the ore hex, makes sense because:
- It blocks TWO of RED's settlements
- It doesn't affect my production at all
- Ore is critical for city upgrades which RED might be pursuing
- RED has 3 victory points and could be close to building cities

<plan>Continue expanding toward node 16 for sheep access, but also consider disrupting RED's ore production to prevent them from upgrading to cities. After placing the settlement at node 16, I'll focus on upgrading settlements to cities to catch up in victory points.</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist focused on defeating the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRITICAL FOR SUCCESS):
- Above all else, target the highest probability numbers (6 & 8) - these produce resources 5/36 times each
- Strictly prioritize access to all five resources between your two settlements
- Aim for numerical diversity - try to cover 5-6 different dice numbers across your settlements
- Never place initial settlements without analyzing future expansion opportunities
- Prioritize placement on hexes with complementary resources: ore/wheat and brick/wood
- Position roads toward high-value unoccupied areas the opponent cannot easily block
- Choose second settlement to complement your first settlement's resource weaknesses
- Consider 3:1 ports if you can't access a specific resource through settlements
- Analyze opponent placement to avoid contested expansion paths
- ALWAYS calculate production value using probability dots (5-6-8-9 are top priority numbers)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-10):
- Build at least one new settlement by turn 10 - expansion is your TOP priority
- Calculate and build along the fastest path to your next settlement location
- Secure missing resources through strategic settlement placement
- Build roads that secure critical expansion paths before the opponent blocks them
- Avoid development cards completely until you have at least 3 total settlements
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1) to complete critical builds
- Target resource diversity through your expansion locations
- Create a minimum 2-turn expansion plan and stick to it

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT AND PRODUCTION (CORE STRATEGY):
- Early game: Focus on wood/brick to expand with roads and settlements
- Mid game: Transition to ore/wheat focus for cities and development cards
- Calculate the resource production value of every potential build
- Only make 4:1 trades when they enable an immediate important build
- Cycle through "build phases" - expansion phase, then city upgrade phase
- Plan resource collection 2 turns ahead to minimize wasteful trades
- Never accumulate 7+ cards before dice rolls
- Diversify production to minimize dependency on any single resource
- Target a minimum of 4 total settlements before prioritizing city upgrades

COUNTERING ALPHABETA ALGORITHM:
- AlphaBeta looks ahead only 2 steps, so plan your moves 3-4 steps ahead
- Create deceptive game states that appear less threatening than they are
- Block the opponent's highest-probability expansion paths immediately
- Play defensively during early game, then aggressively in mid-game
- When opponent has 7+ points, disrupt their highest-producing hex with the robber
- Track opponent's resources and block their most likely next build
- Secure resources that the opponent depends on heavily
- Place roads to cut off opponent from accessing high-value settlement locations
- Position settlements to deny opponent access to key resource hex intersections

ROBBER PLACEMENT AND KNIGHT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-producing hex of your opponent
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat in mid-game when cities are being built
- Target the specific resource the opponent needs for their next likely build
- Use knight cards reactively when the robber blocks your best production
- Save knight cards for the late game if pursuing largest army
- When stealing, select resources that complete your immediate build needs
- Keep track of opponent cards and target resources they've been collecting
- Balance robber placement between disruption and resource acquisition

DEVELOPMENT CARDS VS. BUILDING:
- Only buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and cannot build
- Buy development cards when you're 1-2 knights away from largest army
- Use knight cards immediately when advantageous (don't save unless close to largest army)
- Victory point cards should only supplement your main strategy, not replace it
- Road Building cards are most valuable when you're cut off or racing to a key location
- Monopoly is best used after high-probability dice rolls to collect opponent's stockpile
- Year of Plenty is ideal to complete a high-value build (settlement or city)
- NEVER delay settlement/city building to purchase development cards unless 1 VP from winning

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY FOCUS):
- Aim for 5 total settlements (2 upgraded to cities) = 9 VP
- Then secure largest army OR longest road for the final point
- Always calculate the fastest path to 10 VP in terms of resource costs
- For each potential build, calculate how many turns closer it gets you to victory
- Determine which victory paths are still viable based on board state
- Switch strategies when your primary path is blocked
- Plan for the end-game by turn 10 (know exactly how you will reach 10 points)
- Track opponent's path to victory and actively disrupt with roads or robber

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Trade at ports even at 4:1 ratio if it enables immediate critical build
- NEVER trade with opponent unless it enables an immediate settlement/city build
- Avoid trades that allow opponent to build immediately after you
- Calculate the net VP gain of each potential trade
- Use trades to dispose of resources when at risk from robber
- Combine multiple port trades to convert unwanted resources into needed ones
- Be willing to overpay through port trades to secure critical positional advantage

DECISION FRAMEWORK (APPLY TO EVERY TURN):
1. What is my immediate build priority? (settlement > city > longest road/largest army)
2. What resource do I need to complete my highest priority build?
3. What is the fastest way to acquire that resource? (production, trading, development cards)
4. How will this action position me for the next 3 turns?
5. Will this action disrupt my opponent's path to victory?
6. Is there a way to combine multiple actions this turn for greater efficiency?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 34 | Player: BLUE | Action: MOVE_ROBBER

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  Continue expanding toward node 16 for sheep access, but also consider disrupting RED's ore production to prevent them from upgrading to cities. After placing the settlement at node 16, I'll focus on upgrading settlements to cities to catch up in victory points.

# Analyzing the Robber Placement Options

I need to carefully consider where to place the robber to maximize my advantage while disrupting RED's path to victory.

## Current Game State Analysis
- RED is ahead with 4 VP vs my 2 VP
- RED has a city (2 VP) and 2 settlements (2 VP)
- RED has strong production with a city on node 0 (high value 8 wood)
- I only have 2 settlements and 4 wood resources currently

## Analyzing Robber Placement Options

**[0] Move robber to (0, 0, 0) and steal from RED**
- This blocks the 8 wood hex
- This is extremely high value as it's a 3-dot number (high probability)
- RED has settlements/cities on nodes 0 and 4 that produce from this hex
- This would block RED's strongest production AND my own settlement at node 2

**[1] Move robber to (0, -1, 1)**
- This blocks the desert hex which produces nothing
- This would be a complete waste of the robber

**[2] Move robber to (-1, 0, 1) and steal from RED**
- This blocks the 10 brick hex
- RED has a settlement at node 4 that produces from this hex
- I also have a settlement at node 14 that produces from this hex
- This would hurt me as much as RED

**[3] Move robber to (-1, 1, 0) and steal from RED**
- This blocks the 3 sheep hex
- RED has a settlement at node 4 that produces from this hex
- 3 is a low probability number (1 dot)
- This would be a low-impact move

**[4] Move robber to (0, 1, -1) and steal from RED**
- This blocks the 5 wheat hex
- RED has a city at node 0 that produces from this hex
- 5 is a medium probability number (2 dots)
- Would disrupt RED's wheat production which is needed for cities

**[5] Move robber to (1, 0, -1) and steal from RED**
- This blocks the 4 ore hex
- RED has settlements at nodes 0 and 6 that produce from this hex
- 4 is a low probability number (1 dot)
- Blocks ore which is critical for city development

## Strategic Decision Making

Since RED is ahead with 4 VP to my 2 VP, I need to maximize disruption to their strongest production. Looking at the board:

1. RED's strongest production is from the 8 wood hex (3 dots) at (0,0,0) where RED has a city and a settlement.
2. Blocking this would significantly slow RED's production, but would also hurt my own settlement at node 2.
3. RED also has wheat production from the 5 hex (2 dots) and ore from the 4 hex (1 dot), which are needed for city upgrades.

The best strategic move is to block RED's strongest production at the 8 wood hex, even though it also impacts me. The disruption to RED is much greater since they have both a city and settlement producing from it, while I only have a single settlement. Additionally, I'll get to steal a resource from RED.

<plan>Block RED's strongest production by placing the robber on the wood 8 hex. This will significantly slow down RED's development even though it also impacts my own wood production. Continue expanding toward node 16 for sheep access, and focus on trading for resources to build roads toward this expansion. After securing node 16, I'll focus on upgrading settlements to cities.</plan>

# Game Analysis for Turn 34

I'll carefully analyze the current game state and determine the best action for my Blue player.

## Current Game State Assessment
- **Victory Points**: Blue has 2/10, Red has 4/10
- **Resources**: I have 5 wood, Red has 3 hidden resources
- **Board Position**: 
  - Red has a city (at node 0) and two settlements (nodes 4 and 6)
  - Blue has two settlements (nodes 2 and 14)
  - Red is ahead with 4 VP vs my 2 VP
  - Robber is currently on the wood 8 hex, which blocks production for both of us

## Resource Analysis
- I only have wood (5 of them)
- I need brick to build roads toward my expansion target (node 16)
- My current plan involves expanding toward node 16 for sheep access

## Available Options
0. End turn (no build possible with just wood)
1-4. Trade 4 wood for wheat, sheep, brick, or ore respectively

## Strategic Decision Process
1. I cannot build anything with just wood, so I either need to trade or end my turn.
2. According to my plan, I need to expand toward node 16, which requires roads.
3. Roads require wood AND brick, but I don't have any brick.
4. Trading 4 wood for 1 brick would allow me to build one road, advancing my expansion.
5. Other resources (wheat, sheep, ore) are less immediately useful since I can't build anything with them alone.

## Action Evaluation
- Option 0 (End Turn): Wastes my 5 wood, makes no progress toward my goals.
- Option 1-2, 4 (Trade for wheat/sheep/ore): Not immediately useful given my expansion priorities.
- Option 3 (Trade for brick): Allows me to build a road, making progress toward node 16 for expansion.

<plan>
Trade 4 wood for 1 brick, which will allow me to build a road advancing toward node 16. Once I reach node 16, I'll gain access to sheep production. My priority is to expand my settlement network to increase resource diversity and production. After securing sheep access, I'll focus on getting ore and wheat for city upgrades.
</plan>

The optimal action is to trade for brick, which directly supports my expansion strategy.

PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist focused on defeating the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRITICAL FOR SUCCESS):
- Above all else, target the highest probability numbers (6 & 8) - these produce resources 5/36 times each
- Strictly prioritize access to all five resources between your two settlements
- Aim for numerical diversity - try to cover 5-6 different dice numbers across your settlements
- Never place initial settlements without analyzing future expansion opportunities
- Prioritize placement on hexes with complementary resources: ore/wheat and brick/wood
- Position roads toward high-value unoccupied areas the opponent cannot easily block
- Choose second settlement to complement your first settlement's resource weaknesses
- Consider 3:1 ports if you can't access a specific resource through settlements
- Analyze opponent placement to avoid contested expansion paths
- ALWAYS calculate production value using probability dots (5-6-8-9 are top priority numbers)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-10):
- Build at least one new settlement by turn 10 - expansion is your TOP priority
- Calculate and build along the fastest path to your next settlement location
- Secure missing resources through strategic settlement placement
- Build roads that secure critical expansion paths before the opponent blocks them
- Avoid development cards completely until you have at least 3 total settlements
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1) to complete critical builds
- Target resource diversity through your expansion locations
- Create a minimum 2-turn expansion plan and stick to it

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT AND PRODUCTION (CORE STRATEGY):
- Early game: Focus on wood/brick to expand with roads and settlements
- Mid game: Transition to ore/wheat focus for cities and development cards
- Calculate the resource production value of every potential build
- Only make 4:1 trades when they enable an immediate important build
- Cycle through "build phases" - expansion phase, then city upgrade phase
- Plan resource collection 2 turns ahead to minimize wasteful trades
- Never accumulate 7+ cards before dice rolls
- Diversify production to minimize dependency on any single resource
- Target a minimum of 4 total settlements before prioritizing city upgrades

COUNTERING ALPHABETA ALGORITHM:
- AlphaBeta looks ahead only 2 steps, so plan your moves 3-4 steps ahead
- Create deceptive game states that appear less threatening than they are
- Block the opponent's highest-probability expansion paths immediately
- Play defensively during early game, then aggressively in mid-game
- When opponent has 7+ points, disrupt their highest-producing hex with the robber
- Track opponent's resources and block their most likely next build
- Secure resources that the opponent depends on heavily
- Place roads to cut off opponent from accessing high-value settlement locations
- Position settlements to deny opponent access to key resource hex intersections

ROBBER PLACEMENT AND KNIGHT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-producing hex of your opponent
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat in mid-game when cities are being built
- Target the specific resource the opponent needs for their next likely build
- Use knight cards reactively when the robber blocks your best production
- Save knight cards for the late game if pursuing largest army
- When stealing, select resources that complete your immediate build needs
- Keep track of opponent cards and target resources they've been collecting
- Balance robber placement between disruption and resource acquisition

DEVELOPMENT CARDS VS. BUILDING:
- Only buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and cannot build
- Buy development cards when you're 1-2 knights away from largest army
- Use knight cards immediately when advantageous (don't save unless close to largest army)
- Victory point cards should only supplement your main strategy, not replace it
- Road Building cards are most valuable when you're cut off or racing to a key location
- Monopoly is best used after high-probability dice rolls to collect opponent's stockpile
- Year of Plenty is ideal to complete a high-value build (settlement or city)
- NEVER delay settlement/city building to purchase development cards unless 1 VP from winning

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY FOCUS):
- Aim for 5 total settlements (2 upgraded to cities) = 9 VP
- Then secure largest army OR longest road for the final point
- Always calculate the fastest path to 10 VP in terms of resource costs
- For each potential build, calculate how many turns closer it gets you to victory
- Determine which victory paths are still viable based on board state
- Switch strategies when your primary path is blocked
- Plan for the end-game by turn 10 (know exactly how you will reach 10 points)
- Track opponent's path to victory and actively disrupt with roads or robber

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Trade at ports even at 4:1 ratio if it enables immediate critical build
- NEVER trade with opponent unless it enables an immediate settlement/city build
- Avoid trades that allow opponent to build immediately after you
- Calculate the net VP gain of each potential trade
- Use trades to dispose of resources when at risk from robber
- Combine multiple port trades to convert unwanted resources into needed ones
- Be willing to overpay through port trades to secure critical positional advantage

DECISION FRAMEWORK (APPLY TO EVERY TURN):
1. What is my immediate build priority? (settlement > city > longest road/largest army)
2. What resource do I need to complete my highest priority build?
3. What is the fastest way to acquire that resource? (production, trading, development cards)
4. How will this action position me for the next 3 turns?
5. Will this action disrupt my opponent's path to victory?
6. Is there a way to combine multiple actions this turn for greater efficiency?

TURN 34 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  Trade 4 wood for 1 brick, which will allow me to build a road advancing toward node 16. Once I reach node 16, I'll gain access to sheep production. My priority is to expand my settlement network to increase resource diversity and production. After securing sheep access, I'll focus on getting ore and wheat for city upgrades.

# Game Analysis for Turn 34

I'll analyze the current game state, available resources, and possible actions to determine the optimal move.

## Game State Assessment
- I have 2 VP (from 2 settlements) vs opponent's 4 VP (2 settlements + 1 city)
- I have 1 wood + 1 brick, exactly enough for 1 road
- The robber is on the wood hex (0,0,0), which is a high-value 8 - this affects both players
- I have settlements at nodes 2 and 14, producing wood, wheat, and brick
- The opponent has a city at node 0 and settlements at nodes 4 and 6

## Strategic Considerations
1. Current production is limited - I need to expand quickly
2. I need access to more resources, especially sheep and ore
3. I should evaluate which road placement gives the best expansion opportunity

## Road Options Analysis
Let me evaluate each available road placement:

- Option 1: Road at (13, 14) - Extends from my settlement at node 14
- Option 2: Road at (2, 3) - Extends from my settlement at node 2 toward the desert
- Option 3: Road at (2, 9) - Extends from my settlement at node 2 toward wheat
- Option 4: Road at (4, 15) - This doesn't connect to my existing network
- Option 5: Road at (17, 18) - Extends my current road from node 17

Looking at the map, I need to determine which path offers the best expansion potential. Option 5 (17, 18) seems to continue my current path toward node 16, which according to my previous plan would give me access to sheep (from the sheep hex at (-1, 1, 0)).

Checking the node connections on the sheep hex (-1, 1, 0), it connects to nodes 4, 5, 15, 16, 17, 18. Since I already have a road to node 17, building at edge (17, 18) brings me closer to node 16, which would give me access to sheep production.

<plan>
Continue building road network toward node 16 to access sheep production. After securing a settlement with sheep access, focus on finding ore production to enable city upgrades. My immediate goal is to build roads that position me for my next settlement, increasing both resource diversity and production capacity. The path from node 17 to node 16 via node 18 appears to be the most efficient expansion route.
</plan>

Given my current resources and expansion goals, building a road at edge (17, 18) is the optimal choice as it continues my path toward accessing sheep resources and setting up my next settlement location.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist focused on defeating the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRITICAL FOR SUCCESS):
- Above all else, target the highest probability numbers (6 & 8) - these produce resources 5/36 times each
- Strictly prioritize access to all five resources between your two settlements
- Aim for numerical diversity - try to cover 5-6 different dice numbers across your settlements
- Never place initial settlements without analyzing future expansion opportunities
- Prioritize placement on hexes with complementary resources: ore/wheat and brick/wood
- Position roads toward high-value unoccupied areas the opponent cannot easily block
- Choose second settlement to complement your first settlement's resource weaknesses
- Consider 3:1 ports if you can't access a specific resource through settlements
- Analyze opponent placement to avoid contested expansion paths
- ALWAYS calculate production value using probability dots (5-6-8-9 are top priority numbers)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-10):
- Build at least one new settlement by turn 10 - expansion is your TOP priority
- Calculate and build along the fastest path to your next settlement location
- Secure missing resources through strategic settlement placement
- Build roads that secure critical expansion paths before the opponent blocks them
- Avoid development cards completely until you have at least 3 total settlements
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1) to complete critical builds
- Target resource diversity through your expansion locations
- Create a minimum 2-turn expansion plan and stick to it

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT AND PRODUCTION (CORE STRATEGY):
- Early game: Focus on wood/brick to expand with roads and settlements
- Mid game: Transition to ore/wheat focus for cities and development cards
- Calculate the resource production value of every potential build
- Only make 4:1 trades when they enable an immediate important build
- Cycle through "build phases" - expansion phase, then city upgrade phase
- Plan resource collection 2 turns ahead to minimize wasteful trades
- Never accumulate 7+ cards before dice rolls
- Diversify production to minimize dependency on any single resource
- Target a minimum of 4 total settlements before prioritizing city upgrades

COUNTERING ALPHABETA ALGORITHM:
- AlphaBeta looks ahead only 2 steps, so plan your moves 3-4 steps ahead
- Create deceptive game states that appear less threatening than they are
- Block the opponent's highest-probability expansion paths immediately
- Play defensively during early game, then aggressively in mid-game
- When opponent has 7+ points, disrupt their highest-producing hex with the robber
- Track opponent's resources and block their most likely next build
- Secure resources that the opponent depends on heavily
- Place roads to cut off opponent from accessing high-value settlement locations
- Position settlements to deny opponent access to key resource hex intersections

ROBBER PLACEMENT AND KNIGHT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-producing hex of your opponent
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat in mid-game when cities are being built
- Target the specific resource the opponent needs for their next likely build
- Use knight cards reactively when the robber blocks your best production
- Save knight cards for the late game if pursuing largest army
- When stealing, select resources that complete your immediate build needs
- Keep track of opponent cards and target resources they've been collecting
- Balance robber placement between disruption and resource acquisition

DEVELOPMENT CARDS VS. BUILDING:
- Only buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and cannot build
- Buy development cards when you're 1-2 knights away from largest army
- Use knight cards immediately when advantageous (don't save unless close to largest army)
- Victory point cards should only supplement your main strategy, not replace it

# Analyzing Robber Placement Options

I need to determine the best hex to place the robber to maximize my chances of winning while disrupting the opponent's strategy.

## Game State Analysis
- I have 2 VP (2 settlements)
- RED has 6 VP (2 settlements, 1 city, longest road bonus)
- I have limited resources (1 wood, 1 brick)
- My current plan is to build roads toward node 16 for sheep access

## Evaluating Each Robber Placement Option

**[0] Move robber to (0, 0, 0) - Forest (8)**
- This is a wood-producing hex with a high-probability number (8)
- RED has 2 settlements here (nodes 0 and 4)
- I also have 1 settlement here (node 2)
- Blocking this would hurt BOTH of us significantly, cutting off my wood production

**[1] Move robber to (1, -1, 0) - Wheat (9)**
- This is a wheat-producing hex with decent probability
- RED has 1 settlement here (node 6)
- I have 1 settlement here (node 2)
- Blocking this would hurt both me and opponent

**[2] Move robber to (-1, 0, 1) - Brick (10)**
- This is a brick-producing hex with average probability
- RED has 1 settlement here (node 4)
- I have 1 settlement here (node 14)
- Blocking this would limit both our brick production

**[3] Move robber to (-1, 1, 0) - Sheep (3)**
- This is a sheep-producing hex with low probability (3)
- RED has 1 settlement here (node 4)
- I have no settlements here
- Blocking this has minimal impact on production but does target RED

**[4] Move robber to (0, 1, -1) - Wheat (5)**
- This is a wheat-producing hex with average probability
- RED has 1 city here (node 0)
- I have no settlements here
- This would block wheat production from RED's city

**[5] Move robber to (1, 0, -1) - Ore (4)**
- This is an ore-producing hex with low probability (4)
- RED has 2 buildings here (city at 0, settlement at 6)
- I have no settlements here
- This would block RED's ore production

## Strategic Considerations
1. RED is leading with 6 VP vs my 2 VP
2. RED likely needs ore/wheat for city upgrades to reach 10 VP
3. I should avoid blocking my own production
4. I should target RED's highest-value production that I don't rely on

<plan>
Block RED's ore production to slow down their city development. This will delay their path to victory while I continue expanding toward node 16 for sheep access. After securing sheep, I'll seek ore production for my own city upgrades. Immediate focus is road building with my wood and brick to reach node 16.
</plan>

## Decision
Option [5] is optimal because:
- It blocks ore which RED needs for city upgrades (critical for their victory path)
- It doesn't affect my production at all
- Ore is increasingly valuable in mid-game for city upgrades
- RED has both a city and settlement connected to this hex, making it highly disruptive

Therefore, I choose to move the robber to the ore hex and steal from RED.

  Block RED's ore production to slow down their city development. This will delay their path to victory while I continue expanding toward node 16 for sheep access. After securing sheep, I'll seek ore production for my own city upgrades. Immediate focus is road building with my wood and brick to reach node 16.
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.

# Game State Analysis

I'll first analyze the current board state, resource positions, and available options to determine the best move.

## Game Status Summary
- I (BLUE) have 2 VP (2 settlements)
- RED has 6 VP (2 settlements, 1 city, longest road bonus)
- I have 1 WOOD, 1 BRICK, 1 ORE
- RED is leading by 4 VP and has longest road

## Current Board Position
- My settlements are at nodes 2 and 14
- RED has settlements at nodes 4 and 6, plus a city at node 0
- The robber is on the ore hex (1,0,-1), blocking RED's ore production
- I have roads connecting nodes 1-2, 14-15, 15-17, and 17-18

## Strategic Assessment
1. RED is significantly ahead (6 VP vs my 2 VP)
2. I need to expand my network, increase production, and block RED's progress
3. With my current resources (1 wood, 1 brick), I can build a single road
4. I need to determine which road position offers the best strategic advantage

## Road Building Options Analysis

[1] Road at edge (13, 14):
- Connects to my settlement at node 14
- Would extend toward node 13, which connects to a brick hex
- Doesn't seem to provide immediate expansion value or block RED

[2] Road at edge (2, 3):
- Extends from my settlement at node 2
- Leads toward the brick hex and potentially node 12 for future settlement
- Provides expansion opportunity toward diverse resources

[3] Road at edge (2, 9):
- Extends from my settlement at node 2
- Leads toward the wheat hex
- Could later access node 8 for a future settlement

[4] Road at edge (4, 15):
- Would connect to node 15 where I already have a road
- However, node 4 is already occupied by RED's settlement
- This would be an inefficient use of resources

[5] Road at edge (16, 18):
- Connects to my existing road network through node 18
- Enables expansion toward node 16, which connects to the sheep hex
- Follows my current plan to access sheep production

## Decision Process

Looking at my current plan, I want to expand toward node 16 to gain access to sheep. Option [5] directly serves this purpose by building a road at edge (16, 18).

However, I should reconsider if this is still the optimal plan. RED is 4 VP ahead, so I need efficient expansion toward high-value locations.

Option [2] (edge 2-3) offers expansion toward brick production and the potential for a new settlement at node 12, connecting to desert, brick, and wheat hexes.

Option [3] (edge 2-9) offers expansion toward wheat production and potentially node 8, giving access to wheat.

Since my current settlements already produce wood, brick, and some wheat, securing additional wheat access seems valuable. However, checking the board connectivity, option [5] follows my established road network and gets me closer to sheep production, which I'm currently missing.

<plan>Continue expanding toward node 16 for sheep access via the road at edge (16, 18). This follows my existing road network and provides access to a resource I'm currently lacking. After securing sheep access, I'll focus on acquiring more wood and brick to continue expanding, while keeping the robber on RED's ore production to slow their progress.</plan>

Based on this analysis and the fact that it aligns with my existing plan to gain access to sheep (a resource I lack), I'll choose to build a road at edge (16, 18).

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist focused on defeating the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRITICAL FOR SUCCESS):
- Above all else, target the highest probability numbers (6 & 8) - these produce resources 5/36 times each
- Strictly prioritize access to all five resources between your two settlements
- Aim for numerical diversity - try to cover 5-6 different dice numbers across your settlements
- Never place initial settlements without analyzing future expansion opportunities
- Prioritize placement on hexes with complementary resources: ore/wheat and brick/wood
- Position roads toward high-value unoccupied areas the opponent cannot easily block
- Choose second settlement to complement your first settlement's resource weaknesses
- Consider 3:1 ports if you can't access a specific resource through settlements
- Analyze opponent placement to avoid contested expansion paths
- ALWAYS calculate production value using probability dots (5-6-8-9 are top priority numbers)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-10):
- Build at least one new settlement by turn 10 - expansion is your TOP priority
- Calculate and build along the fastest path to your next settlement location
- Secure missing resources through strategic settlement placement
- Build roads that secure critical expansion paths before the opponent blocks them
- Avoid development cards completely until you have at least 3 total settlements
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1) to complete critical builds
- Target resource diversity through your expansion locations
- Create a minimum 2-turn expansion plan and stick to it

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT AND PRODUCTION (CORE STRATEGY):
- Early game: Focus on wood/brick to expand with roads and settlements
- Mid game: Transition to ore/wheat focus for cities and development cards
- Calculate the resource production value of every potential build
- Only make 4:1 trades when they enable an immediate important build
- Cycle through "build phases" - expansion phase, then city upgrade phase
- Plan resource collection 2 turns ahead to minimize wasteful trades
- Never accumulate 7+ cards before dice rolls
- Diversify production to minimize dependency on any single resource
- Target a minimum of 4 total settlements before prioritizing city upgrades

COUNTERING ALPHABETA ALGORITHM:
- AlphaBeta looks ahead only 2 steps, so plan your moves 3-4 steps ahead
- Create deceptive game states that appear less threatening than they are
- Block the opponent's highest-probability expansion paths immediately
- Play defensively during early game, then aggressively in mid-game
- When opponent has 7+ points, disrupt their highest-producing hex with the robber
- Track opponent's resources and block their most likely next build
- Secure resources that the opponent depends on heavily
- Place roads to cut off opponent from accessing high-value settlement locations
- Position settlements to deny opponent access to key resource hex intersections

ROBBER PLACEMENT AND KNIGHT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-producing hex of your opponent
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat in mid-game when cities are being built
- Target the specific resource the opponent needs for their next likely build
- Use knight cards reactively when the robber blocks your best production
- Save knight cards for the late game if pursuing largest army
- When stealing, select resources that complete your immediate build needs
- Keep track of opponent cards and target resources they've been collecting
- Balance robber placement between disruption and resource acquisition

DEVELOPMENT CARDS VS. BUILDING:
- Only buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and cannot build
- Buy development cards when you're 1-2 knights away from largest army
- Use knight cards immediately when advantageous (don't save unless close to largest army)
- Victory point cards should only supplement your main strategy, not replace it
- Road Building cards are most valuable when you're cut off or racing to a key location
- Monopoly is best used after high-probability dice rolls to collect opponent's stockpile
- Year of Plenty is ideal to complete a high-value build (settlement or city)
- NEVER delay settlement/city building to purchase development cards unless 1 VP from winning

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY FOCUS):
- Aim for 5 total settlements (2 upgraded to cities) = 9 VP
- Then secure largest army OR longest road for the final point
- Always calculate the fastest path to 10 VP in terms of resource costs
- For each potential build, calculate how many turns closer it gets you to victory
- Determine which victory paths are still viable based on board state
- Switch strategies when your primary path is blocked
- Plan for the end-game by turn 10 (know exactly how you will reach 10 points)
- Track opponent's path to victory and actively disrupt with roads or robber

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Trade at ports even at 4:1 ratio if it enables immediate critical build
- NEVER trade with opponent unless it enables an immediate settlement/city build
- Avoid trades that allow opponent to build immediately after you
- Calculate the net VP gain of each potential trade
- Use trades to dispose of resources when at risk from robber
- Combine multiple port trades to convert unwanted resources into needed ones
- Be willing to overpay through port trades to secure critical positional advantage

DECISION FRAMEWORK (APPLY TO EVERY TURN):
1. What is my immediate build priority? (settlement > city > longest road/largest army)
2. What resource do I need to complete my highest priority build?
3. What is the fastest way to acquire that resource? (production, trading, development cards)
4. How will this action position me for the next 3 turns?
5. Will this action disrupt my opponent's path to victory?
6. Is there a way to combine multiple actions this turn for greater efficiency?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 48 | Player: BLUE | Action: MOVE_ROBBER

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  Continue expanding toward node 16 for sheep access via the road at edge (16, 18). This follows my existing road network and provides access to a resource I'm currently lacking.

# Game State Analysis

Let me analyze the current situation carefully to determine the optimal robber placement.

## Current Game State Summary
- I (BLUE) have 2 victory points with 2 settlements
- RED has 6 victory points (3 from settlements/cities + 2 from longest road)
- RED is far ahead at 6 VP vs my 2 VP
- I need to maximize my resource production while disrupting RED's progress

## Robber Placement Options Analysis

Let me evaluate each option:

[0] Move robber to (0, 0, 0) and steal from RED
- This targets the wood hex with value 8 (high probability)
- RED settlement at node 4 produces from this hex
- RED city at node 0 produces from this hex (double production)
- This would block my own settlement at node 2 which also produces from this hex
- Not optimal as it hurts my own production significantly

[1] Move robber to (1, -1, 0) and steal from RED
- This targets the wheat hex with value 9 (good probability)
- RED settlement at node 6 produces from this hex
- My own settlement at node 2 also produces from this hex
- Not optimal as it hurts my own wheat production

[2] Move robber to (0, -1, 1)
- This targets the desert hex which produces nothing
- This move would waste the robber's blocking potential
- No stealing opportunity
- Not a strategic choice at all

[3] Move robber to (-1, 0, 1) and steal from RED
- This targets the brick hex with value 10 (moderate probability)
- RED settlement at node 4 produces from this hex
- My settlement at node 14 also produces from this hex
- Not optimal as it blocks my own brick production

[4] Move robber to (-1, 1, 0) and steal from RED
- This targets the sheep hex with value 3 (very low probability)
- RED settlement at node 4 produces from this hex
- This is a low-impact choice since 3 is a rare roll
- Would steal from RED but blocks very little production

[5] Move robber to (0, 1, -1) and steal from RED
- This targets the wheat hex with value 5 (moderate probability)
- RED city at node 0 produces from this hex
- RED gets no other wheat production except from this and the 9 wheat
- This disrupts RED without affecting my production

## Strategic Considerations

1. RED is 4 points ahead of me, so disruption is critical
2. RED has a city at node 0 that produces from 3 different hexes
3. I need to maximize stealing potential while minimizing impact to my own production
4. RED likely needs ore and wheat for city upgrades
5. RED's city at node 0 produces from the wheat-5 hex, which is a valuable target

<plan>
Target RED's wheat production with the robber on hex (0, 1, -1) to slow their city building progress. Focus on expanding toward node 16 for sheep access, while disrupting RED's wheat which is essential for their city upgrades. Continue my road network and aim for a settlement at node 16 to increase my resource diversity.
</plan>

Option [5] is clearly optimal as it:
- Disrupts RED's wheat production from their city
- Allows me to steal a resource from RED
- Doesn't impact any of my own production
- May slow RED's city upgrade strategy
- Targets a moderately productive hex (value 5)

Therefore, I choose option 5.

# Game State Analysis

I need to evaluate my current position and available moves:

## Current Game State
- I have 2 victory points (RED has 6)
- I have 1 wood, 1 sheep, 2 wheat, and 1 ore
- RED is leading with 6 VP (2 settlements + 1 city + longest road)
- RED has 4 hidden resources
- The robber is on hex (0, 1, -1), which blocks wheat production

## Available Actions
- [0] End my turn
- [1] Buy a development card (1 sheep, 1 wheat, 1 ore)

## Resource Evaluation
I currently have exactly the resources needed to buy a development card. I can't build anything else with my current resources (no roads, settlements, or cities).

## Strategic Considerations
1. RED is at 6 VP, which is a significant lead
2. Development cards could provide:
   - Knight: Would allow me to move the robber and potentially block RED's production
   - Victory point: Direct progress toward winning
   - Road building, Year of Plenty, or Monopoly: Could help accelerate my development

3. Ending my turn means I keep my current resources but miss the opportunity to potentially gain an advantage

## Decision Making
Looking at my current plan, I wanted to expand toward node 16, but I don't have the resources for roads or settlements now. 

If I buy a development card:
- I might get a knight to disrupt RED's production
- I might get a victory point card
- I might get a helpful special card

If I end my turn:
- I'll keep my resources but won't make immediate progress
- I'll be vulnerable to losing resources if a 7 is rolled
- I'll be waiting for more resources to build toward my plan

Given RED's strong position (6 VP), I need to take action to catch up. The development card is my only build option and could provide significant advantages.

<plan>
Buy a development card to potentially gain a knight (to disrupt RED), a victory point, or a special card. Continue to target expansion toward node 16 for sheep access while disrupting RED's wheat production, which is essential for their city upgrades. After playing this development card (if appropriate), continue road network expansion and aim for settlement at node 16.
</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist focused on defeating the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRITICAL FOR SUCCESS):
- Above all else, target the highest probability numbers (6 & 8) - these produce resources 5/36 times each
- Strictly prioritize access to all five resources between your two settlements
- Aim for numerical diversity - try to cover 5-6 different dice numbers across your settlements
- Never place initial settlements without analyzing future expansion opportunities
- Prioritize placement on hexes with complementary resources: ore/wheat and brick/wood
- Position roads toward high-value unoccupied areas the opponent cannot easily block
- Choose second settlement to complement your first settlement's resource weaknesses
- Consider 3:1 ports if you can't access a specific resource through settlements
- Analyze opponent placement to avoid contested expansion paths
- ALWAYS calculate production value using probability dots (5-6-8-9 are top priority numbers)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-10):
- Build at least one new settlement by turn 10 - expansion is your TOP priority
- Calculate and build along the fastest path to your next settlement location
- Secure missing resources through strategic settlement placement
- Build roads that secure critical expansion paths before the opponent blocks them
- Avoid development cards completely until you have at least 3 total settlements
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1) to complete critical builds
- Target resource diversity through your expansion locations
- Create a minimum 2-turn expansion plan and stick to it

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT AND PRODUCTION (CORE STRATEGY):
- Early game: Focus on wood/brick to expand with roads and settlements
- Mid game: Transition to ore/wheat focus for cities and development cards
- Calculate the resource production value of every potential build
- Only make 4:1 trades when they enable an immediate important build
- Cycle through "build phases" - expansion phase, then city upgrade phase
- Plan resource collection 2 turns ahead to minimize wasteful trades
- Never accumulate 7+ cards before dice rolls
- Diversify production to minimize dependency on any single resource
- Target a minimum of 4 total settlements before prioritizing city upgrades

COUNTERING ALPHABETA ALGORITHM:
- AlphaBeta looks ahead only 2 steps, so plan your moves 3-4 steps ahead
- Create deceptive game states that appear less threatening than they are
- Block the opponent's highest-probability expansion paths immediately
- Play defensively during early game, then aggressively in mid-game
- When opponent has 7+ points, disrupt their highest-producing hex with the robber
- Track opponent's resources and block their most likely next build
- Secure resources that the opponent depends on heavily
- Place roads to cut off opponent from accessing high-value settlement locations
- Position settlements to deny opponent access to key resource hex intersections

ROBBER PLACEMENT AND KNIGHT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-producing hex of your opponent
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat in mid-game when cities are being built
- Target the specific resource the opponent needs for their next likely build
- Use knight cards reactively when the robber blocks your best production
- Save knight cards for the late game if pursuing largest army
- When stealing, select resources that complete your immediate build needs
- Keep track of opponent cards and target resources they've been collecting
- Balance robber placement between disruption and resource acquisition

DEVELOPMENT CARDS VS. BUILDING:
- Only buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and cannot build
- Buy development cards when you're 1-2 knights away from largest army
- Use knight cards immediately when advantageous (don't save unless close to largest army)
- Victory point cards should only supplement your main strategy, not replace it
- Road Building cards are most valuable when you're cut off or racing to a key location
- Monopoly is best used after high-probability dice rolls to collect opponent's stockpile
- Year of Plenty is ideal to complete a high-value build (settlement or city)
- NEVER delay settlement/city building to purchase development cards unless 1 VP from winning

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY FOCUS):
- Aim for 5 total settlements (2 upgraded to cities) = 9 VP
- Then secure largest army OR longest road for the final point
- Always calculate the fastest path to 10 VP in terms of resource costs
- For each potential build, calculate how many turns closer it gets you to victory
- Determine which victory paths are still viable based on board state
- Switch strategies when your primary path is blocked
- Plan for the end-game by turn 10 (know exactly how you will reach 10 points)
- Track opponent's path to victory and actively disrupt with roads or robber

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Trade at ports even at 4:1 ratio if it enables immediate critical build
- NEVER trade with opponent unless it enables an immediate settlement/city build
- Avoid trades that allow opponent to build immediately after you
- Calculate the net VP gain of each potential trade
- Use trades to dispose of resources when at risk from robber
- Combine multiple port trades to convert unwanted resources into needed ones
- Be willing to overpay through port trades to secure critical positional advantage

DECISION FRAMEWORK (APPLY TO EVERY TURN):
1. What is my immediate build priority? (settlement > city > longest road/largest army)
2. What resource do I need to complete my highest priority build?
3. What is the fastest way to acquire that resource? (production, trading, development cards)
4. How will this action position me for the next 3 turns?
5. Will this action disrupt my opponent's path to victory?
6. Is there a way to combine multiple actions this turn for greater efficiency?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 52 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  Buy a development card to potentially gain a knight (to disrupt RED), a victory point, or a special card. Continue to target expansion toward node 16 for sheep access while disrupting RED's wheat production, which is essential for their city upgrades. After playing this development card (if appropriate), continue road network expansion and aim for settlement at node 16.

# Game Analysis

Let me thoroughly analyze the current game state and my available options.

## Current State Assessment
- **Victory Points**: I have 2 VPs (2 settlements) plus 1 hidden VP (development card) = 3 VPs
- **RED has 7 VPs**: 3 settlements (3 VPs), 1 city (2 VPs), and longest road (2 VPs)
- **Resources**: I have 2 wood, 1 brick, 1 wheat
- **Possible build**: I can build a road (costs 1 wood, 1 brick)

## Game Situation
RED is significantly ahead with 7/10 VPs. I need to be strategic about my limited resources and catching up.

## Road Building Analysis
I have 4 road building options:
- [1] Edge (2, 3): This extends from my settlement at node 2
- [2] Edge (2, 9): This extends from my settlement at node 2 in a different direction
- [3] Edge (4, 15): This connects toward the sheep hex
- [4] Edge (13, 14): This extends from my settlement at node 14

Looking at the board:
- The sheep hex (🐑3) is important for me as I currently lack sheep access
- RED already has a settlement at node 16 (connected to the sheep hex)
- I need to expand my network to access more diverse resources

## Strategic Priority
1. I need to improve my position to catch up with RED
2. Building a road should position me for future settlements
3. I should consider which direction offers the best expansion potential

Edge (4, 15) connects toward the sheep hex (🐑3) and would give me potential access to sheep in the future. This appears to be the most strategically valuable option as it diversifies my resource access.

<plan>
Build a road at edge (4, 15) to expand toward the sheep hex. Next, focus on gathering resources for a settlement that can provide sheep access. Continue to disrupt RED's wheat production when possible, and work toward catching up in victory points by expanding my settlement network.
</plan>

Based on this analysis, I'll build a road at edge (4, 15) which helps me expand toward the sheep resource I currently lack.

# Robber Placement Analysis for Turn 54

Let me analyze the current game state and determine the optimal robber placement to maximize my chances of winning against the AlphaBeta algorithm player.

## Game State Assessment
- I'm significantly behind at 2 VP vs RED's 7 VP
- RED has longest road (+2 VP), 3 settlements, and 1 city
- I have 2 settlements, 1 victory point development card, and only 1 wood resource
- The robber is currently on the wheat hex (1, -1, 0) with value 9

## RED's Resource Production
- RED has strong wood production (triple dots on 8)
- RED has good wheat production (double dots on 5 and 9)
- RED has ore access (4)
- RED has sheep access (3)
- RED already has 5 hidden resources

## My Strategic Needs
- I need to catch up significantly in VP
- I need to disrupt RED's progress while maximizing my own production
- I need to set myself up for expansion

## Robber Placement Options Analysis

Option [0]: Move to wood hex (0, 0, 0) with value 8
- This is RED's strongest production hex (8 has triple probability dots)
- RED has two settlements on this hex (nodes 0 and 4)
- This would also block one of my settlements (node 2)
- PROS: Significantly reduces RED's wood production
- CONS: Also reduces my own wood production, which I need for expansion

Option [2]: Move to brick hex (-1, 0, 1) with value 10
- RED has one settlement on this hex (node 4)
- I also have one settlement on this hex (node 14)
- PROS: Disrupts RED's brick supply
- CONS: Also blocks my own brick production, which I need for roads

Option [3]: Move to sheep hex (-1, 1, 0) with value 3
- RED has two settlements on this hex (nodes 4 and 16)
- PROS: Blocks RED's sheep production
- CONS: Sheep is on a low-probability hex (3)

Option [4]: Move to wheat hex (0, 1, -1) with value 5
- RED has two settlements on this hex (nodes 0 and 16)
- PROS: Blocks RED's wheat production (double dots)
- CONS: Wheat on 5 is moderately productive

Option [5]: Move to ore hex (1, 0, -1) with value 4
- RED has two settlements on this hex (nodes 0 and 6)
- PROS: Blocks RED's ore production
- CONS: Ore is on a low-probability hex (4)

Option [1]: Move to desert hex (0, -1, 1)
- No production to block
- CONS: Wastes the robber placement completely

## Strategic Decision

Looking at these options:

- Option [0] would be very disruptive to RED but also hurts my own production
- Option [4] targets RED's wheat on a decent number (5) without harming my production
- Option [5] targets RED's ore which they need for cities without affecting me
- RED may be saving for a city (needs ore/wheat) or settlement (needs wheat/sheep/brick/wood)

Since RED already has 7 VP, they are likely trying to reach 10 VP quickly. The most common path would be:
- Building another city (+1 VP)
- Building another settlement (+1 VP)
- Maintaining longest road (+2 VP already secured)

To block city building, I should target ore. To block settlement expansion, I should target brick or wood.

Given that RED already has 5 hidden resources, they may be close to building something significant. The wood hex (8) is the highest probability resource they have, making option [0] the most disruptive, even though it hurts me as well.

<plan>
Block RED's strongest production (wood) to slow their progress, then focus on expanding my settlement network. Will need to trade at ports to compensate for my reduced wood production. Target building roads toward potential settlement locations, prioritizing access to sheep which I currently lack.
</plan>

Based on this analysis, I choose to place the robber on the wood hex to maximize disruption to RED's progress:

PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist focused on defeating the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRITICAL FOR SUCCESS):
- Above all else, target the highest probability numbers (6 & 8) - these produce resources 5/36 times each
- Strictly prioritize access to all five resources between your two settlements
- Aim for numerical diversity - try to cover 5-6 different dice numbers across your settlements
- Never place initial settlements without analyzing future expansion opportunities
- Prioritize placement on hexes with complementary resources: ore/wheat and brick/wood
- Position roads toward high-value unoccupied areas the opponent cannot easily block
- Choose second settlement to complement your first settlement's resource weaknesses
- Consider 3:1 ports if you can't access a specific resource through settlements
- Analyze opponent placement to avoid contested expansion paths
- ALWAYS calculate production value using probability dots (5-6-8-9 are top priority numbers)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-10):
- Build at least one new settlement by turn 10 - expansion is your TOP priority
- Calculate and build along the fastest path to your next settlement location
- Secure missing resources through strategic settlement placement
- Build roads that secure critical expansion paths before the opponent blocks them
- Avoid development cards completely until you have at least 3 total settlements
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1) to complete critical builds
- Target resource diversity through your expansion locations
- Create a minimum 2-turn expansion plan and stick to it

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT AND PRODUCTION (CORE STRATEGY):
- Early game: Focus on wood/brick to expand with roads and settlements
- Mid game: Transition to ore/wheat focus for cities and development cards
- Calculate the resource production value of every potential build
- Only make 4:1 trades when they enable an immediate important build
- Cycle through "build phases" - expansion phase, then city upgrade phase
- Plan resource collection 2 turns ahead to minimize wasteful trades
- Never accumulate 7+ cards before dice rolls
- Diversify production to minimize dependency on any single resource
- Target a minimum of 4 total settlements before prioritizing city upgrades

COUNTERING ALPHABETA ALGORITHM:
- AlphaBeta looks ahead only 2 steps, so plan your moves 3-4 steps ahead
- Create deceptive game states that appear less threatening than they are
- Block the opponent's highest-probability expansion paths immediately
- Play defensively during early game, then aggressively in mid-game
- When opponent has 7+ points, disrupt their highest-producing hex with the robber
- Track opponent's resources and block their most likely next build
- Secure resources that the opponent depends on heavily
- Place roads to cut off opponent from accessing high-value settlement locations
- Position settlements to deny opponent access to key resource hex intersections

ROBBER PLACEMENT AND KNIGHT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-producing hex of your opponent
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat in mid-game when cities are being built
- Target the specific resource the opponent needs for their next likely build
- Use knight cards reactively when the robber blocks your best production
- Save knight cards for the late game if pursuing largest army
- When stealing, select resources that complete your immediate build needs
- Keep track of opponent cards and target resources they've been collecting
- Balance robber placement between disruption and resource acquisition

DEVELOPMENT CARDS VS. BUILDING:
- Only buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and cannot build
- Buy development cards when you're 1-2 knights away from largest army
- Use knight cards immediately when advantageous (don't save unless close to largest army)
- Victory point cards should only supplement your main strategy, not replace it
- Road Building cards are most valuable when you're cut off or racing to a key location
- Monopoly is best used after high-probability dice rolls to collect opponent's stockpile
- Year of Plenty is ideal to complete a high-value build (settlement or city)
- NEVER delay settlement/city building to purchase development cards unless 1 VP from winning

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY FOCUS):
- Aim for 5 total settlements (2 upgraded to cities) = 9 VP
- Then secure largest army OR longest road for the final point
- Always calculate the fastest path to 10 VP in terms of resource costs
- For each potential build, calculate how many turns closer it gets you to victory
- Determine which victory paths are still viable based on board state
- Switch strategies when your primary path is blocked
- Plan for the end-game by turn 10 (know exactly how you will reach 10 points)
- Track opponent's path to victory and actively disrupt with roads or robber

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Trade at ports even at 4:1 ratio if it enables immediate critical build
- NEVER trade with opponent unless it enables an immediate settlement/city build
- Avoid trades that allow opponent to build immediately after you
- Calculate the net VP gain of each potential trade
- Use trades to dispose of resources when at risk from robber
- Combine multiple port trades to convert unwanted resources into needed ones
- Be willing to overpay through port trades to secure critical positional advantage

DECISION FRAMEWORK (APPLY TO EVERY TURN):
1. What is my immediate build priority? (settlement > city > longest road/largest army)
2. What resource do I need to complete my highest priority build?
3. What is the fastest way to acquire that resource? (production, trading, development cards)
4. How will this action position me for the next 3 turns?
5. Will this action disrupt my opponent's path to victory?
6. Is there a way to combine multiple actions this turn for greater efficiency?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game Analysis: Robber Placement Decision

I'll analyze the optimal robber placement based on the current game state, opponent's position, and my strategic goals.

## Current Game State Assessment
- I (BLUE) have 2 VP (2 settlements + 1 hidden VP card = 3 real VP)
- RED has 7 VP (3 settlements + 1 city + longest road)
- RED is significantly ahead and only needs 3 more points to win
- My wood production is currently blocked by the robber at hex (0,0,0)
- I need to maximize my chance of catching up while disrupting RED's progress

## Analyzing RED's Production
Let me review RED's production to identify their most valuable resources:
- RED gets wood from both node 0 (city) and node 4 (settlement) on the 8 roll (highest probability)
- RED gets sheep from nodes 4 and 16
- RED gets wheat from nodes 0, 6, and 16
- RED gets ore from nodes 0 and 6
- RED gets brick from node 4

RED's strongest production appears to be wood (8) from their city and settlement, followed by wheat.

## Robber Placement Options
1. [0] Move to (1, -1, 0) wheat-9: Blocks RED's production at nodes 6 (settlement) and potentially 1 (city)
2. [1] Move to (0, -1, 1) desert: No production impact
3. [2] Move to (-1, 0, 1) brick-10: Blocks RED's production at node 4 (settlement)
4. [3] Move to (-1, 1, 0) sheep-3: Blocks RED's production at nodes 4 and 16 (both settlements)
5. [4] Move to (0, 1, -1) wheat-5: Blocks RED's production at nodes 0 (city) and 16 (settlement)
6. [5] Move to (1, 0, -1) ore-4: Blocks RED's production at nodes 0 (city) and 6 (settlement)

## Strategic Evaluation
RED likely needs ore and wheat to upgrade settlements to cities, which is their fastest path to victory. Their wood production on the 8 roll is very strong and would let them build more roads to secure their longest road bonus.

The most impactful options are:
- Option [0] (wheat-9): Disrupts a solid 9 roll at RED's settlement
- Option [4] (wheat-5): Blocks wheat at RED's city and settlement
- Option [5] (ore-4): Blocks ore at RED's city and settlement

Given RED is at 7 points, I should target resources that help them reach 10 points fastest - ore and wheat for city upgrades.

## Decision
Option [5] seems most strategic as it blocks ore at both a city and settlement, while also allowing me to steal from RED. Ore is critical for city upgrades, which RED likely needs to reach 10 VP. While option [4] (wheat-5) also blocks wheat at RED's city and settlement, ore is more specialized and harder to trade for.

<plan>Block RED's ore production to prevent city upgrades, then focus on completing my road network to viable settlement locations. I'll need to leverage my wood to trade for other resources at ports. My priorities should be: 1) Get another settlement built to access sheep, 2) Work toward longest road, 3) Consider buying development cards if I get excess resources.</plan>

❓ Select action by number (0-5):


Based on this information, which action number do you choose? Think step by step about your options, then put the final action number in a box like \boxed{1}.
RESPONSE:
I'll analyze the best robber placement decision by examining each option's strategic impact:

1) First, let me understand the game state:
- RED is far ahead with 7 VP (3 settlements, 1 city, longest road bonus)
- I only have 2 VP from settlements + 1 hidden VP card = 3 VP total
- I have limited resources: 2 wood, 1 ore

2) Assessing robber placement options:
- Option 0: Place on (0,0,0) - Wood hex with roll 8 (high probability)
   - This blocks RED's settlement at node 4 and city at node 0
   - This would deny RED 3 production dots of wood
   - This also blocks my settlement at node 2 (hurting my wood production)

- Option 1: Place on (1,-1,0) - Wheat hex with roll 9
   - This blocks RED's settlements at nodes 6 and 16
   - This also blocks my settlement at node 2
   - Wheat is critical for city upgrades and development cards

- Option 2: Place on (0,-1,1) - Desert hex
   - This has no strategic value as desert produces nothing

- Option 3: Place on (-1,0,1) - Brick hex with roll 10
   - This blocks RED's settlement at node 4
   - This also blocks my settlement at node 14
   - Brick is important for road building

- Option 4: Place on (-1,1,0) - Sheep hex with roll 3
   - This blocks RED's settlements at nodes 4 and 16
   - Low probability number (3) makes this less impactful

- Option 5: Place on (0,1,-1) - Wheat hex with roll 5
   - This blocks RED's city at node 0 and settlement at node 16
   - Wheat is important for city upgrades and development cards

3) Strategic considerations:
- RED is close to winning (7/10 VP)
- I need to maximize disruption to RED's strongest production
- I should avoid blocking my own critical resources if possible
- I should target resources RED likely needs for their next build

<plan>Block RED's highest probability production that doesn't hurt me. Target wheat or ore to prevent city upgrades. Continue building my road network toward potential settlement locations, especially ones that would give me access to sheep which I'm missing. Next, I need to build a settlement at a strategic location to increase my resource diversity.</plan>

Looking at all options:
- Option 0 would block RED's valuable wood production but also block my own
- Option 1 blocks wheat which RED needs for development cards and cities
- Option 5 blocks wheat production at a slightly lower probability hex

The most damaging option to RED without significantly hurting myself is Option 1, which blocks wheat on a high probability hex (9). Additionally, I can steal a card from RED which might help me build.

- Position roads toward high-value unoccupied areas the opponent cannot easily block
- Choose second settlement to complement your first settlement's resource weaknesses
- Consider 3:1 ports if you can't access a specific resource through settlements
- Analyze opponent placement to avoid contested expansion paths
- ALWAYS calculate production value using probability dots (5-6-8-9 are top priority numbers)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-10):
- Build at least one new settlement by turn 10 - expansion is your TOP priority
- Calculate and build along the fastest path to your next settlement location
- Secure missing resources through strategic settlement placement
- Build roads that secure critical expansion paths before the opponent blocks them
- Avoid development cards completely until you have at least 3 total settlements
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1) to complete critical builds
- Target resource diversity through your expansion locations
- Create a minimum 2-turn expansion plan and stick to it

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT AND PRODUCTION (CORE STRATEGY):
- Early game: Focus on wood/brick to expand with roads and settlements
- Mid game: Transition to ore/wheat focus for cities and development cards
- Calculate the resource production value of every potential build
- Only make 4:1 trades when they enable an immediate important build
- Cycle through "build phases" - expansion phase, then city upgrade phase
- Plan resource collection 2 turns ahead to minimize wasteful trades
- Never accumulate 7+ cards before dice rolls
- Diversify production to minimize dependency on any single resource
- Target a minimum of 4 total settlements before prioritizing city upgrades

COUNTERING ALPHABETA ALGORITHM:
- AlphaBeta looks ahead only 2 steps, so plan your moves 3-4 steps ahead
- Create deceptive game states that appear less threatening than they are
- Block the opponent's highest-probability expansion paths immediately
- Play defensively during early game, then aggressively in mid-game
- When opponent has 7+ points, disrupt their highest-producing hex with the robber
- Track opponent's resources and block their most likely next build
- Secure resources that the opponent depends on heavily
- Place roads to cut off opponent from accessing high-value settlement locations
- Position settlements to deny opponent access to key resource hex intersections

ROBBER PLACEMENT AND KNIGHT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-producing hex of your opponent
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat in mid-game when cities are being built
- Target the specific resource the opponent needs for their next likely build
- Use knight cards reactively when the robber blocks your best production
- Save knight cards for the late game if pursuing largest army
- When stealing, select resources that complete your immediate build needs
- Keep track of opponent cards and target resources they've been collecting
- Balance robber placement between disruption and resource acquisition

DEVELOPMENT CARDS VS. BUILDING:
- Only buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and cannot build
- Buy development cards when you're 1-2 knights away from largest army
- Use knight cards immediately when advantageous (don't save unless close to largest army)
- Victory point cards should only supplement your main strategy, not replace it
- Road Building cards are most valuable when you're cut off or racing to a key location
- Monopoly is best used after high-probability dice rolls to collect opponent's stockpile
- Year of Plenty is ideal to complete a high-value build (settlement or city)
- NEVER delay settlement/city building to purchase development cards unless 1 VP from winning

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY FOCUS):
- Aim for 5 total settlements (2 upgraded to cities) = 9 VP
- Then secure largest army OR longest road for the final point
- Always calculate the fastest path to 10 VP in terms of resource costs
- For each potential build, calculate how many turns closer it gets you to victory
- Determine which victory paths are still viable based on board state
- Switch strategies when your primary path is blocked
- Plan for the end-game by turn 10 (know exactly how you will reach 10 points)
- Track opponent's path to victory and actively disrupt with roads or robber

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Trade at ports even at 4:1 ratio if it enables immediate critical build
- NEVER trade with opponent unless it enables an immediate settlement/city build
- Avoid trades that allow opponent to build immediately after you
- Calculate the net VP gain of each potential trade
- Use trades to dispose of resources when at risk from robber
- Combine multiple port trades to convert unwanted resources into needed ones
- Be willing to overpay through port trades to secure critical positional advantage

DECISION FRAMEWORK (APPLY TO EVERY TURN):
1. What is my immediate build priority? (settlement > city > longest road/largest army)
2. What resource do I need to complete my highest priority build?
3. What is the fastest way to acquire that resource? (production, trading, development cards)
4. How will this action position me for the next 3 turns?
5. Will this action disrupt my opponent's path to victory?
6. Is there a way to combine multiple actions this turn for greater efficiency?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 66 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  Block RED's highest probability production that doesn't hurt me. Target wheat or ore to prevent city upgrades. Continue building my road network toward potential settlement locations, especially ones that would give me access to sheep which I'm missing. Next, I need to build a settlement at a strategic location to increase my resource diversity.

# Game Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state carefully:

## Game Status Overview
- **My Position**: 2 VP (2 settlements + hidden VP card = 3 total)
- **Red's Position**: 7 VP (3 settlements + 1 city + Longest Road)
- **My Resources**: 3 Wood, 1 Brick, 1 Wheat, 1 Ore
- **Red's Status**: Nearly at winning (7/10 VP)

## Strategic Assessment
Red is dangerously close to winning with 7 VP already. I need to make smart moves to catch up and possibly slow them down. I have enough resources (3 wood, 1 brick) to build a road, which is one of my available options.

## Available Actions Analysis
1. **End Turn** - Not optimal as I can build with my current resources
2. **Build Road at edge (2, 3)** - From my settlement at node 2
3. **Build Road at edge (2, 9)** - Also from my settlement at node 2
4. **Build Road at edge (13, 14)** - Near my settlement at node 14

I need to determine which road position gives me the best strategic advantage.

## Road Placement Analysis
- Option 1 (edge 2,3): This would build toward my other existing settlement or resource hub
- Option 2 (edge 2,9): This appears to extend toward new territory
- Option 3 (edge 13,14): This builds out from my second settlement

Looking at the board structure, I need to focus on:
1. Expanding to new resource types (especially sheep which I'm missing)
2. Building toward potential settlement locations
3. Blocking Red's expansion paths

Option 2 (edge 2,9) seems most promising as it likely opens up new territory and potential settlement spots. Building from my node 2 settlement which is already on good production (8 wood, 9 wheat) makes this a strong expansion path.

## Updated Strategic Plan
<plan>
Focus on expanding from my settlement at node 2 toward new territory that can give me sheep access. Continue road building toward strategic settlement locations that can increase my resource diversity. I need to reach sheep resources and get to at least 3-4 settlements quickly. Then I'll focus on city upgrades to catch up on VP. I must also look for ways to break Red's longest road in future turns if possible.
</plan>

Based on this analysis, I'll build a road at edge (2, 9) to expand my network toward new territory.

# Game Analysis for Settlers of Catan Turn 68

I'll analyze the current game state to determine my optimal move:

## Game State Overview
- I (Blue) have 2 VP + 1 hidden VP card = 3 VP total
- Red has 7 VP (including +2 for longest road)
- I have 3 wood, 1 brick, 1 wheat, 1 ore
- Current settlements: node 2 (produces wood 8, wheat 9) and node 14 (produces brick 10)

## Key Challenges
1. Red is at 7 VP, just 3 away from winning
2. I have limited resource diversity - no sheep production
3. Red has longest road with 10 segments
4. Red has superior production with 4 settlements/cities vs my 2

## Available Actions Analysis
I can either end my turn [0] or build a road in one of four locations [1-4].

Let's assess each road option:
- [1] Road at edge (2, 3): Moves toward desert hex, limited expansion potential
- [2] Road at edge (13, 14): Not useful, as I already have a settlement at node 14
- [3] Road at edge (8, 9): Moves toward wheat 9 hex, creating a path for expansion
- [4] Road at edge (9, 10): Moves toward desert hex, but in a direction with less competition

## Strategic Considerations
1. I need to expand production by building new settlements
2. I desperately need sheep access for development cards and settlements
3. Looking at the board, building toward node 9 would help me reach locations with better resource diversity
4. Red is far ahead, so I need to maximize each turn's value

## Road Value Assessment
Option [3] (edge 8, 9) appears to be the most promising:
- It progresses toward wheat 9 hex which could lead to better settlement locations
- This area seems less contested by Red's existing networks
- Could potentially lead me toward sheep resources in future turns

<plan>Build road at edge (8, 9) to progress toward wheat production zone. Next moves should focus on reaching sheep resources and establishing a third settlement as fast as possible. Need to build a comprehensive road network to enable settlement expansion while preparing to block Red's progress when possible.</plan>

Based on my analysis, the optimal move is to build road at edge (8, 9):

# Analyzing Robber Placement Options

Let me carefully analyze the current game state and determine the optimal robber placement.

## Game State Assessment
- I have 2 VP with 2 settlements and 1 hidden VP card
- RED has 7 VP (3 settlements, 1 city, longest road bonus)
- RED has 7 hidden resource cards, putting them at robber risk
- I have limited resources: 1 wood, 1 wheat, 1 ore

## Opponent's Production Analysis:
- RED has strong production on several hexes:
  - Wood (8): 3 dots - RED has 2 settlements here
  - Wheat (5): 2 dots - RED has 2 settlements here
  - Wheat (9): 2 dots - RED has 1 settlement here
  - Ore (4): 1 dot - RED has 2 settlements here
  - Brick (10): 1 dot - RED has 1 settlement here
  - Sheep (3): 1 dot - RED has 2 settlements here

## Robber Placement Options:
[0] Move to wood (8) hex - Blocks RED's strongest production (2 settlements on a 3-dot hex)
[1] Move to wheat (9) hex - Blocks RED's wheat production (1 settlement on a 2-dot hex)
[2] Move to brick (10) hex - Blocks RED's brick production (1 settlement on a 1-dot hex)
[3] Move to sheep (3) hex - Blocks RED's sheep production (2 settlements on a 1-dot hex)
[4] Move to wheat (5) hex - Blocks RED's wheat production (2 settlements on a 2-dot hex)
[5] Move to ore (4) hex - Blocks RED's ore production (2 settlements on a 1-dot hex)

## Strategic Considerations:
1. RED is at 7 VP and needs 3 more to win
2. With 7 resources, RED may be accumulating for a major build
3. RED likely needs wood/brick for roads or wheat/ore for cities/development cards
4. Blocking RED's highest production hex will slow them down most effectively

## Decision Logic:
Option [0] is clearly optimal as it blocks the wood hex with number 8, which:
1. Has the highest probability (8 = 5/36 = highest along with 6)
2. RED has 2 settlements on this hex (maximizes disruption)
3. Wood is critical for road building (RED is going for longest road)
4. This is RED's strongest single production hex

<plan>Target RED's wood production to slow their expansion. Next focus on building another settlement to reach a sheep resource. I need to expand my road network to reach new productive nodes while blocking RED's path when possible. Consider saving for a development card to potentially disrupt longest road.</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist focused on defeating the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRITICAL FOR SUCCESS):
- Above all else, target the highest probability numbers (6 & 8) - these produce resources 5/36 times each
- Strictly prioritize access to all five resources between your two settlements
- Aim for numerical diversity - try to cover 5-6 different dice numbers across your settlements
- Never place initial settlements without analyzing future expansion opportunities
- Prioritize placement on hexes with complementary resources: ore/wheat and brick/wood
- Position roads toward high-value unoccupied areas the opponent cannot easily block
- Choose second settlement to complement your first settlement's resource weaknesses
- Consider 3:1 ports if you can't access a specific resource through settlements
- Analyze opponent placement to avoid contested expansion paths
- ALWAYS calculate production value using probability dots (5-6-8-9 are top priority numbers)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-10):
- Build at least one new settlement by turn 10 - expansion is your TOP priority
- Calculate and build along the fastest path to your next settlement location
- Secure missing resources through strategic settlement placement
- Build roads that secure critical expansion paths before the opponent blocks them
- Avoid development cards completely until you have at least 3 total settlements
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1) to complete critical builds
- Target resource diversity through your expansion locations
- Create a minimum 2-turn expansion plan and stick to it

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT AND PRODUCTION (CORE STRATEGY):
- Early game: Focus on wood/brick to expand with roads and settlements
- Mid game: Transition to ore/wheat focus for cities and development cards
- Calculate the resource production value of every potential build
- Only make 4:1 trades when they enable an immediate important build
- Cycle through "build phases" - expansion phase, then city upgrade phase
- Plan resource collection 2 turns ahead to minimize wasteful trades
- Never accumulate 7+ cards before dice rolls
- Diversify production to minimize dependency on any single resource
- Target a minimum of 4 total settlements before prioritizing city upgrades

COUNTERING ALPHABETA ALGORITHM:
- AlphaBeta looks ahead only 2 steps, so plan your moves 3-4 steps ahead
- Create deceptive game states that appear less threatening than they are
- Block the opponent's highest-probability expansion paths immediately
- Play defensively during early game, then aggressively in mid-game
- When opponent has 7+ points, disrupt their highest-producing hex with the robber
- Track opponent's resources and block their most likely next build
- Secure resources that the opponent depends on heavily
- Place roads to cut off opponent from accessing high-value settlement locations
- Position settlements to deny opponent access to key resource hex intersections

ROBBER PLACEMENT AND KNIGHT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-producing hex of your opponent
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat in mid-game when cities are being built
- Target the specific resource the opponent needs for their next likely build
- Use knight cards reactively when the robber blocks your best production
- Save knight cards for the late game if pursuing largest army
- When stealing, select resources that complete your immediate build needs
- Keep track of opponent cards and target resources they've been collecting
- Balance robber placement between disruption and resource acquisition

DEVELOPMENT CARDS VS. BUILDING:
- Only buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and cannot build
- Buy development cards when you're 1-2 knights away from largest army
- Use knight cards immediately when advantageous (don't save unless close to largest army)
- Victory point cards should only supplement your main strategy, not replace it
- Road Building cards are most valuable when you're cut off or racing to a key location
- Monopoly is best used after high-probability dice rolls to collect opponent's stockpile
- Year of Plenty is ideal to complete a high-value build (settlement or city)
- NEVER delay settlement/city building to purchase development cards unless 1 VP from winning

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY FOCUS):
- Aim for 5 total settlements (2 upgraded to cities) = 9 VP
- Then secure largest army OR longest road for the final point
- Always calculate the fastest path to 10 VP in terms of resource costs
- For each potential build, calculate how many turns closer it gets you to victory
- Determine which victory paths are still viable based on board state
- Switch strategies when your primary path is blocked
- Plan for the end-game by turn 10 (know exactly how you will reach 10 points)
- Track opponent's path to victory and actively disrupt with roads or robber

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Trade at ports even at 4:1 ratio if it enables immediate critical build
- NEVER trade with opponent unless it enables an immediate settlement/city build
- Avoid trades that allow opponent to build immediately after you
- Calculate the net VP gain of each potential trade
- Use trades to dispose of resources when at risk from robber
- Combine multiple port trades to convert unwanted resources into needed ones
- Be willing to overpay through port trades to secure critical positional advantage

DECISION FRAMEWORK (APPLY TO EVERY TURN):
1. What is my immediate build priority? (settlement > city > longest road/largest army)
2. What resource do I need to complete my highest priority build?
3. What is the fastest way to acquire that resource? (production, trading, development cards)
4. How will this action position me for the next 3 turns?
5. Will this action disrupt my opponent's path to victory?
6. Is there a way to combine multiple actions this turn for greater efficiency?

# Game Analysis for Robber Placement

I need to carefully analyze the best robber placement to disrupt RED who has 7 points and is close to winning.

## Analyzing RED's Production and Position
- RED has 7/10 victory points (3 settlements, 1 city, longest road)
- They need 3 more points to win which could come from:
  - Building 1-2 more cities (2-4 VP)
  - Building 1 more settlement (1 VP)
  - Development cards for VP or largest army

## Analyzing Each Robber Option

**[0] Move robber to (1, -1, 0) - Wheat 9 - and steal from RED**
- Blocks wheat (9) production
- Affects: RED's settlements at nodes 6 and BLUE at node 2
- Wheat is critical for both settlements and cities

**[1] Move robber to (0, -1, 1) - Desert**
- This is a desert with no production, so placing robber here has no effect
- This would be a wasted move

**[2] Move robber to (-1, 0, 1) - Brick 10 - and steal from RED**
- Blocks brick (10) production
- Affects RED's settlement at node 4 and BLUE at node 14
- Brick is important for road building and settlements

**[3] Move robber to (-1, 1, 0) - Sheep 3 - and steal from RED**
- Blocks sheep (3) production
- Affects RED's settlements at nodes 4 and 16
- Sheep is needed for settlements and development cards

**[4] Move robber to (0, 1, -1) - Wheat 5 - and steal from RED**
- Blocks wheat (5) production
- Affects RED's city at node 0 and settlement at node 16
- Wheat is critical for both settlements and cities

**[5] Move robber to (1, 0, -1) - Ore 4 - and steal from RED**
- Blocks ore (4) production
- Affects RED's city at node 0 and settlement at node 6
- Ore is essential for city upgrades

## Strategic Considerations
1. RED has 6 hidden resource cards - they may be close to another build
2. RED already has longest road with 10 segments (out of 12 total)
3. Most urgent need is to disrupt RED's path to victory by blocking key resources

## Decision Making
- RED's city at node 0 produces wood (8), wheat (5), and ore (4)
- Wheat and ore are critical for city building which is RED's likely next step
- Option [5] blocks ore at a low probability (4), but affects RED's city
- Option [4] blocks wheat at a better probability (5), and affects both RED's city and another settlement

<plan>Block RED's wheat production which they need for both settlements and cities. Then build roads toward potential settlement locations to secure more resources. Watch for opportunities to build settlements that could potentially break RED's longest road.</plan>

The best move is to place the robber on the wheat hex (0, 1, -1) which produces on a 5. This disrupts RED's city and another settlement, blocks a more probable number than the ore hex, and wheat is needed for almost all builds RED might pursue.

# Robber Placement Analysis

I need to analyze where to place the robber to maximize my strategic advantage against RED, who is at 7 VP and close to winning with their longest road.

## Game State Analysis
- RED has 7/10 victory points (3 settlements + 1 city + 2 for longest road)
- RED has 6 hidden resource cards
- I have only 2/10 victory points (2 settlements + 1 hidden VP card)
- RED's production is much stronger than mine with more buildings

## RED's Resource Production
Let me analyze RED's resource production by hex:
- 🌲8 (0,0,0): Produces for RED's city at node 0 and settlement at node 4 (double value at city)
- 🌾9 (1,-1,0): Produces for RED's settlement at node 6
- 🌾5 (0,1,-1): Produces for RED's city at node 0 and settlement at node 16
- ⛏️4 (1,0,-1): Produces for RED's city at node 0 and settlement at node 6
- 🐑3 (-1,1,0): Produces for RED's settlements at nodes 4 and 16
- 🧱10 (-1,0,1): Produces for RED's settlement at node 4

## Strategic Considerations
1. RED likely needs more 🌲WOOD and 🧱BRICK for additional roads to maintain longest road
2. RED might also be saving for settlements (🌲WOOD, 🧱BRICK, 🐑SHEEP, 🌾WHEAT) or cities (🌾WHEAT, ⛏️ORE)
3. The most valuable hex for RED is the 🌲8 (0,0,0) which produces for their city and a settlement

## Robber Placement Options
- [0] 🌲8 (0,0,0): Blocks RED's strongest production (6 dots combined) from city and settlement
- [1] 🌾9 (1,-1,0): Blocks RED's wheat production from one settlement
- [2] 🧱10 (-1,0,1): Blocks RED's brick production from one settlement
- [3] 🐑3 (-1,1,0): Blocks RED's sheep production from two settlements
- [4] 🌾5 (0,1,-1): Blocks RED's wheat production from city and settlement 
- [5] ⛏️4 (1,0,-1): Blocks RED's ore production from city and settlement

## Decision Logic
The most impactful option is clearly [0], placing the robber on the 🌲8 hex:
- It's RED's highest production value hex (8 is a frequent roll)
- It affects both a city and a settlement
- Wood is crucial for RED to maintain and extend their longest road
- Also blocks some of my own wood production, but disrupting RED is more important

<plan>
Block RED's wood production by placing robber on the 🌲8 hex. This will severely limit their ability to extend roads and maintain longest road advantage. Next, I need to build roads strategically to potentially break their longest road, while working toward placing my next settlement.
</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist focused on defeating the AlphaBeta algorithm player. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRITICAL FOR SUCCESS):
- Above all else, target the highest probability numbers (6 & 8) - these produce resources 5/36 times each
- Strictly prioritize access to all five resources between your two settlements
- Aim for numerical diversity - try to cover 5-6 different dice numbers across your settlements
- Never place initial settlements without analyzing future expansion opportunities
- Prioritize placement on hexes with complementary resources: ore/wheat and brick/wood
- Position roads toward high-value unoccupied areas the opponent cannot easily block
- Choose second settlement to complement your first settlement's resource weaknesses
- Consider 3:1 ports if you can't access a specific resource through settlements
- Analyze opponent placement to avoid contested expansion paths
- ALWAYS calculate production value using probability dots (5-6-8-9 are top priority numbers)

EARLY GAME EXPANSION (TURNS 1-10):
- Build at least one new settlement by turn 10 - expansion is your TOP priority
- Calculate and build along the fastest path to your next settlement location
- Secure missing resources through strategic settlement placement
- Build roads that secure critical expansion paths before the opponent blocks them
- Avoid development cards completely until you have at least 3 total settlements
- Trade aggressively at ports (4:1) to complete critical builds
- Target resource diversity through your expansion locations
- Create a minimum 2-turn expansion plan and stick to it

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT AND PRODUCTION (CORE STRATEGY):
- Early game: Focus on wood/brick to expand with roads and settlements
- Mid game: Transition to ore/wheat focus for cities and development cards
- Calculate the resource production value of every potential build
- Only make 4:1 trades when they enable an immediate important build
- Cycle through "build phases" - expansion phase, then city upgrade phase
- Plan resource collection 2 turns ahead to minimize wasteful trades
- Never accumulate 7+ cards before dice rolls
- Diversify production to minimize dependency on any single resource
- Target a minimum of 4 total settlements before prioritizing city upgrades

COUNTERING ALPHABETA ALGORITHM:
- AlphaBeta looks ahead only 2 steps, so plan your moves 3-4 steps ahead
- Create deceptive game states that appear less threatening than they are
- Block the opponent's highest-probability expansion paths immediately
- Play defensively during early game, then aggressively in mid-game
- When opponent has 7+ points, disrupt their highest-producing hex with the robber
- Track opponent's resources and block their most likely next build
- Secure resources that the opponent depends on heavily
- Place roads to cut off opponent from accessing high-value settlement locations
- Position settlements to deny opponent access to key resource hex intersections

ROBBER PLACEMENT AND KNIGHT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-producing hex of your opponent
- Prioritize blocking ore and wheat in mid-game when cities are being built
- Target the specific resource the opponent needs for their next likely build
- Use knight cards reactively when the robber blocks your best production
- Save knight cards for the late game if pursuing largest army
- When stealing, select resources that complete your immediate build needs
- Keep track of opponent cards and target resources they've been collecting
- Balance robber placement between disruption and resource acquisition

DEVELOPMENT CARDS VS. BUILDING:
- Only buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and cannot build
- Buy development cards when you're 1-2 knights away from largest army
- Use knight cards immediately when advantageous (don't save unless close to largest army)
- Victory point cards should only supplement your main strategy, not replace it
- Road Building cards are most valuable when you're cut off or racing to a key location
- Monopoly is best used after high-probability dice rolls to collect opponent's stockpile
- Year of Plenty is ideal to complete a high-value build (settlement or city)
- NEVER delay settlement/city building to purchase development cards unless 1 VP from winning

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY FOCUS):
- Aim for 5 total settlements (2 upgraded to cities) = 9 VP
- Then secure largest army OR longest road for the final point
- Always calculate the fastest path to 10 VP in terms of resource costs
- For each potential build, calculate how many turns closer it gets you to victory
- Determine which victory paths are still viable based on board state
- Switch strategies when your primary path is blocked
- Plan for the end-game by turn 10 (know exactly how you will reach 10 points)
- Track opponent's path to victory and actively disrupt with roads or robber

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Trade at ports even at 4:1 ratio if it enables immediate critical build
- NEVER trade with opponent unless it enables an immediate settlement/city build
- Avoid trades that allow opponent to build immediately after you
- Calculate the net VP gain of each potential trade
- Use trades to dispose of resources when at risk from robber
- Combine multiple port trades to convert unwanted resources into needed ones
- Be willing to overpay through port trades to secure critical positional advantage

DECISION FRAMEWORK (APPLY TO EVERY TURN):
1. What is my immediate build priority? (settlement > city > longest road/largest army)
2. What resource do I need to complete my highest priority build?
3. What is the fastest way to acquire that resource? (production, trading, development cards)
4. How will this action position me for the next 3 turns?
5. Will this action disrupt my opponent's path to victory?
6. Is there a way to combine multiple actions this turn for greater efficiency?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

❓ Select action by number (0-5):


Based on this information, which action number do you choose? Think step by step about your options, then put the final action number in a box like \boxed{1}.
RESPONSE:
I'll analyze the current game state and the robber placement options to make the optimal decision.

## Game Analysis
- RED has 7 VP (3 settlements + 1 city + longest road bonus), while I have only 2 VP
- RED is winning with a significant 5-point advantage
- RED has 10 segments for longest road, which gives them a crucial 2 VP bonus
- I need to disrupt RED's resource production to slow their progress

## Robber Placement Options
Let me evaluate each hex based on impact to RED's production:

0. (0, 0, 0) - 🌲8 (Wood): 
   - This blocks RED's strongest production - RED has TWO settlements on this 8 value hex
   - RED gets 6 wood production dots (⭐⭐⭐ × 2 settlements)
   - I also have a settlement here, but disrupting RED is more important at this stage

1. (1, -1, 0) - 🌾9 (Wheat):
   - RED has one settlement here with ⭐⭐ production
   - I also have a settlement here, so I'd hurt my own production

2. (-1, 0, 1) - 🧱10 (Brick):
   - RED has one settlement with ⭐ production
   - I also have a settlement here, so I'd hurt my own production

3. (-1, 1, 0) - 🐑3 (Sheep):
   - RED has one settlement with ⭐ production (low value)
   - Only impacts RED minimally

4. (0, 1, -1) - 🌾5 (Wheat):
   - RED has two settlements here with ⭐⭐ production each
   - Total ⭐⭐⭐⭐ production for RED from this hex

5. (1, 0, -1) - ⛏️4 (Ore):
   - RED has two settlements here with ⭐ production each
   - Total ⭐⭐ production for RED from this hex

## Strategic Decision
The most impactful robber placements would be:
- Option 0 (🌲8): Blocks 6 production dots of wood for RED
- Option 4 (🌾5): Blocks 4 production dots of wheat for RED

Since RED has longest road (10 segments), they are heavily dependent on wood to maintain and extend this advantage. Blocking their wood supply will severely limit their ability to protect their longest road. Additionally, wood is critical for building new settlements which RED may be planning.

<plan>
Block RED's wood production by placing robber on 🌲8 hex. This disrupts their strongest production resource and will hamper their road building ability. I'll use my wood and wheat to build roads strategically to try breaking their longest road, while working toward my next settlement.
</plan>

The optimal choice is to place the robber on the 🌲8 hex to significantly disrupt RED's wood production.

# Game State Analysis

First, I'll analyze the current game state:

- **Victory Points**:
  - BLUE (me): 2/10 VP (2 settlements)
  - RED: 7/10 VP (3 settlements + 1 city + longest road)

- **Resources**:
  - I have: 2 Wood, 1 Brick, 3 Wheat
  - RED has 7 hidden cards

- **Board Position**:
  - RED has longest road (10 segments)
  - RED is 3 VP ahead of me
  - The robber is currently on the 🌲8 hex

## Options Analysis

Let's examine each available option:

**[0] End Turn**
- Advantages: None apparent
- Disadvantages: Wastes resources, loses momentum

**[1] Build Road at Edge (2, 3)**
- This connects from my settlement at node 2
- Uses my wood and brick resources
- Could expand toward building a new settlement
- May help in eventually challenging longest road

**[2] Build Road at Edge (13, 14)**
- This connects from my settlement at node 14
- Uses my wood and brick resources
- Would extend my road network from my brick-producing settlement

**[3] Build Road at Edge (9, 10)**
- This appears to be extending a road not directly connected to my settlements
- Uses my wood and brick resources
- Unclear immediate strategic benefit based on visible information

## Strategic Assessment

RED is at 7/10 VP and has longest road, making them a significant threat to win soon. I need to:
1. Expand my road network to potentially break their longest road
2. Work toward placing new settlements for more resources and points
3. Make progress toward my own victory conditions

Looking at the available options, I should build a road that best positions me for future expansion and potentially disrupting RED's longest road.

<plan>
Build strategically to position for a new settlement while setting up to potentially break RED's longest road. Focus on getting more resource production to accelerate my development. Target high-probability numbers for my next settlement location.
</plan>

Based on the available information, option [1] (building a road at edge 2, 3) seems most beneficial as it expands from my settlement at node 2, which has good production (🌲8, 🌾9). This puts me in position to continue expanding my network and potentially contest important areas of the board.
