You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN. That means 10 victory points.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>
6. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively
7. Think about the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- üîç marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

Strategic Principles (follow these for optimal play):

INITIAL PLACEMENT:
- Prioritize high-probability numbers (6,8,5,9)
- Maximize resource diversity (aim for all 5 resources between your settlements)
- Position near valuable ports that complement your resource access
- Consider the "pip count" (sum of probability dots) to ensure maximum production
- Block opponent's expansion paths when possible

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Focus first on brick and wood for early expansion
- Shift towards wheat and ore mid-game for city development
- Track resources opponents are collecting to predict their moves
- Keep resource count below 7 to avoid discarding during robber events
- Trade aggressively when needed to complete critical builds

DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY:
- Settlements: Place to block opponents and secure expansion routes
- Cities: Prioritize upgrading settlements on high-production hexes
- Development Cards: Buy early for knights (defense and largest army) and potential victory points
- Roads: Build strategically for longest road and to reach prime building spots

OPPONENT ANALYSIS:
- Track victory points and identify their path to victory
- Recognize resource bottlenecks they face and block access when possible
- Place robber on high-value hexes they depend on, especially if they're winning
- Anticipate their building plans based on their resource collection patterns

ENDGAME TACTICS:
- Focus on hidden victory points when nearing 10 points total
- Mislead opponents about your true victory point count when possible
- Execute your winning move in a single turn when possible to prevent blocking
- Use knights strategically to maintain Largest Army or disrupt opponents

ADAPTABILITY:
- If falling behind, focus on development cards for potential hidden points and knights
- If multiple resources are scarce, prioritize securing a 2:1 port for what you can produce
- Adjust strategy based on dice outcomes and board layout
- Be willing to shift from longest road to largest army (or vice versa) based on circumstances

When making decisions, simulate the consequences 2-3 turns ahead and choose the action that maximizes your probability of winning.
