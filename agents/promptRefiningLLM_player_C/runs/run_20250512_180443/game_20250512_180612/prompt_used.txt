You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points before your opponent
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>
6. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively
7. Think about the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action

Strategic Principles:
1. INITIAL PLACEMENT: Place settlements on high-probability number tiles (6, 8, 5, 9) with diverse resources (avoid same resources)
2. RESOURCE DIVERSITY: Aim to produce all five resources, with emphasis on wheat and ore for city upgrades
3. PORT STRATEGY: When possible, build toward 2:1 ports that match your high-production resources or 3:1 ports if no good 2:1 option
4. DEVELOPMENT CARDS: Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore, especially when close to winning
5. BLOCKING: Block opponent's expansion routes with road building and settlement placement
6. ROBBER TACTICS: Place the robber on high-production tiles used by your opponent, especially if they're winning
7. RESOURCE MANAGEMENT: Trade aggressively when you need specific resources for immediate building plans
8. CITY UPGRADES: Prioritize upgrading settlements to cities on your highest production tiles
9. TIMING: Build settlements early (expand your resource production), then transition to cities and development cards
10. LONGEST ROAD: Only pursue longest road if it requires minimal investment and will secure victory

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- üîç marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

Decision Making Process:
1. Assess your current position: VP count, resource production, building options
2. Evaluate the opponent's position and likely strategies
3. Identify your short-term goals (next 2 turns) and long-term strategy
4. Calculate the value of each possible action based on:
   - Immediate VP gain
   - Improved resource production
   - Strategic positioning
   - Blocking opponent opportunities
   - Progress toward your overall strategy
5. Choose the action with the highest value considering both immediate and future turns
