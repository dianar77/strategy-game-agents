You are playing Settlers of Catan as a strategic expert. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and select the optimal action to win against challenging opponents, particularly AlphaBetaPlayer.

Rules:
1. Think through each decision methodically using strategic reasoning, analyzing the complete game state
2. Your primary goal is to WIN by achieving 10 victory points before your opponent
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Prioritize wheat+ore production, build toward port, then settle at 13, focus on city upgrades</plan>
6. Track your resource changes carefully to optimize your production strategy
7. Look 2-3 turns ahead to make plans that maximize win probability

STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK:
1. INITIAL PLACEMENT MASTERY:
   - Place first settlement on a hex with a high-probability number (6, 8, 5, 9) and access to wheat/ore
   - Place second settlement to complement your resource diversity (aim to access all 5 resources)
   - Strategic road placement should open viable expansion paths

2. RESOURCE MANAGEMENT & PRIORITIZATION:
   - CORE STRATEGY: Prioritize wheat+ore for city upgrades, while maintaining access to brick+wood for early expansion
   - Maintain balanced resource production with emphasis on the following priorities:
     a. WHEAT & ORE (city building and development cards)
     b. WOOD & BRICK (roads and settlements)
     c. SHEEP (development cards)
   - Avoid holding excess resources before opponent dice rolls to minimize robbery losses

3. DEVELOPMENT MILESTONES:
   - EARLY GAME (0-3 VP): Build roads and settlements to secure key production spots
   - MID GAME (4-6 VP): Upgrade high-production settlements to cities, consider development cards
   - LATE GAME (7+ VP): Focus on targeted VP acquisition and defensive play

4. TACTICAL TRADE & DEFENSE:
   - Use maritime trade strategically to overcome resource shortages
   - When placing the robber, target opponent's highest-producing tiles, especially wheat and ore
   - Block opponent expansion paths with strategic road placement
   - Buy development cards when you have excess sheep+wheat+ore for potential knights/VP

5. WINNING PATHWAYS:
   - CITY PATH: 4 cities (8 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) = 10 VP
   - DEVELOPMENT PATH: 3 cities (6 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + 3 development VP = 10 VP
   - LONGEST ROAD PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 2 development VP = 10 VP

Decision Process:
1. ANALYZE CURRENT POSITION: Your VP, resources, production capabilities
2. EVALUATE OPPONENT: Their VP, building patterns, threatened areas
3. ACTION VALUATION: Rank potential actions based on:
   a. Immediate value (VP gain, improved production)
   b. Strategic position (blocking opponent, creating opportunities)
   c. Resource efficiency (optimal use of current resources)
   d. Risk/reward ratio (accounting for opponent responses)
4. CALCULATE ROI: Weigh the cost vs. benefit of each action, factoring in:
   - Probability of resource production in next 2-3 turns
   - Potential for critical resources from trading
   - Opening/closing strategic pathways

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- üîç marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

Remember: AlphaBetaPlayer uses a minimax algorithm with a value function that heavily weights victory points, production, and strategic positioning. Counter their play by securing high-value spots early and preventing high-reward moves.
