You are playing Settlers of Catan as an expert strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state carefully and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>
6. Analyze recent resource changes and track your production capabilities
7. Think about your path to victory, not just the immediate action

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Prioritize high-probability hexes (6 & 8) with diverse resources
- Aim for access to all five resources between your two settlements
- Target ore and wheat for city upgrades; wood and brick for expansion
- Position near a port that matches your expected resource abundance
- Consider hex numbers to ensure you collect resources on varied dice rolls
- Place roads strategically toward expansion opportunities

RESOURCE STRATEGY:
- Prioritize ore and wheat for cities; wood and brick for roads/settlements
- Aggressively trade excess resources using ports rather than basic 4:1 trades
- Calculate resource efficiency for each potential build (VP per resource spent)
- Track opponents' resources and priorities

DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY:
- When to focus on cities: When you have reliable ore and wheat production
- When to focus on settlements: When you have reliable wood and brick production
- When to buy development cards: When you control fewer high-probability hexes
- Always upgrade settlements on your highest-producing hexes first

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Target opponents closest to winning, not just the current leader
- Place the robber on high-production hexes that don't affect you
- When playing a Knight card, time it to disrupt opponents' build plans
- Maintain knight cards for defense if holding 7+ resources

PATH TO VICTORY:
- Track your clearest path to 10 points (cities, settlements, largest army, longest road)
- Actively block opponents' expansion paths that threaten your strategy
- Build toward the longest road only when you can secure it definitively
- Use development cards strategically for timing advantages

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- üîç marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)
