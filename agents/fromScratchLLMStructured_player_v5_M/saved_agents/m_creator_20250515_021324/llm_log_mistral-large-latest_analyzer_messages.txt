ANALYZER OBJECTIVE:

If there is no syntax errors, I want you to return
    - The Scores of the foo_player.py player from the game_results.json file
    - Short analysis of the game output (return anything interseting that was printed)
    - EMPHASIZE any errors, warnings, or signs of player implementation error in the game_output.txt file 

If there is a syntax error, I want you to return
    - The error message from the game_output.txt file
    - The exact line number of the error if possible
    - The exact line of code that caused the error if possible

ANALYSIS:

### Scores of the `foo_player.py` Player

The `foo_player.py` player achieved the following scores:
- **Wins**: 0
- **Average Victory Points (AVG VP)**: 2.0
- **Average Settlements (AVG SETTLES)**: 2.0
- **Average Cities (AVG CITIES)**: 0.0
- **Average Roads (AVG ROAD)**: 0.0
- **Average Army (AVG ARMY)**: 0.0
- **Average Development VP (AVG DEV VP)**: 0.0

### Short Analysis of the Game Output

The game output repeatedly prints "Choosing First Action on Default," indicating that the `foo_player.py` is consistently selecting the first available action from the `playable_actions` list. This behavior is expected based on the current implementation of the `decide` method in `foo_player.py`.

### Emphasis on Errors, Warnings, or Signs of Player Implementation Error

There are no explicit error messages or warnings in the game output. However, the repeated selection of the first action suggests a lack of strategic decision-making, which could be a sign of a simplistic or incomplete player implementation.
