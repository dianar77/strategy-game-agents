========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Justification: While the heuristic scores for all "BUILD_ROAD" actions are equal to 5, the player doesn't have enough resources to build a road. Building a road typically requires one Brick and one Wood, but the resource inventory is [2, 2, 0, 0, 1], indicating a lack of Brick (0) and Wood (0). Therefore, the optimal action is to "END_TURN" as no other actions are feasible, ensuring progression to the next stage of the game.
