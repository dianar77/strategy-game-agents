        Heuristic Scores for Actions:

        Please respond with the optimal action and briefly explain why it was chosen. Format:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the decision}
        

========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)  
Justification: The only available action in the current game state is to roll the dice, which progresses the game by generating resources based on the roll. Without rolling, no additional decisions or advancements in the game can be made. Thus, it is the optimal action as it is the only valid move at this moment.
