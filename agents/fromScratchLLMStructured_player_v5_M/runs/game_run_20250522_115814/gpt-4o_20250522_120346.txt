========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(0, 1))  
Justification: All options have identical heuristic scores, meaning no one action is inherently better based on the provided evaluation metric. Since there isn't any additional context indicating prioritization for specific road building locations, one valid approach is to arbitrarily select an option. `(0, 1)` was chosen for simplicity and consistency with the given options.
