        Please respond with the optimal action and briefly explain why it was chosen. Format:

========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)  
Justification: Rolling is the only action available, and its heuristic score is 1. Rolling the dice generates resources, increasing your resource pool, which can be used for building settlements, cities, roads, and ultimately gaining victory points. Without any other actionable options, rolling is the optimal choice at this stage.
