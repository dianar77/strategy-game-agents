========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)  
Justification: Rolling is the only available action, so there is no other decision to make. Additionally, rolling is a critical part of the game as it generates resources based on the settlements and cities owned. With your current resources being limited (0 wood, 1 brick, 2 wheat, 0 ore, and 0 sheep), rolling offers the potential to collect more resources, which can be used to build roads, settlements, or even cities to increase victory points. It also aligns with the heuristic score prioritizing this action (1).
