========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)  
Justification: The available action to roll the dice has the highest heuristic score (1) and is the only actionable move at this point in the game. Rolling the dice will generate additional resources based on board conditions, which can increase opportunities for expansion and development in subsequent turns. Since resources are currently limited, rolling is crucial for progression.
