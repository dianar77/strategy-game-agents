========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)  
Justification: The only available action in this game state is to end the turn, as no other actions can currently be performed given the player's resources and options. Ending the turn allows progression to the next phase of the game, where new opportunities may arise (e.g., gathering more resources to build settlements, cities, or roads).
