========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)  
Justification: The only available action is to end the turn, so it must be chosen. No other actions can be taken with the current resources or game state. Ending the turn allows the game to progress and provides the opportunity to collect more resources on subsequent turns.
