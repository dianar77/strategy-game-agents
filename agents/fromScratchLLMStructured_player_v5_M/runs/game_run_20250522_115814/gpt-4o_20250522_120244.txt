========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)  
Justification: The available action to end the turn is the only option provided. Since there are no other actions currently available, it is optimal to end the turn to allow resources to refresh or new opportunities to arise on the next turn.
