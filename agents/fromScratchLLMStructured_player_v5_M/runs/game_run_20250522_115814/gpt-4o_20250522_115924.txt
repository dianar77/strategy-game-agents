        Heuristic Scores for Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Please respond with the optimal action and briefly explain why it was chosen. Format:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the decision}
        

========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)  
Justification: Rolling the dice is currently the only available action, with a heuristic score of 1. This action is required to progress the game and generate resources based on dice outcomes, enabling further moves such as building settlements, roads, or cities, or trading resources. Since no other options are presented, rolling is the optimal and necessary action at this point in the game.
