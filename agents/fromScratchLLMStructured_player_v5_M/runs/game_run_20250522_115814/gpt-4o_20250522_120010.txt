        Heuristic Scores for Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.DISCARD: 'DISCARD'>, value=None): 1

        Please respond with the optimal action and briefly explain why it was chosen. Format:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the decision}
        

========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.DISCARD: 'DISCARD'>, value=None)  
Justification: The game state clearly shows there is only one available action to choose from: DISCARD. With heuristic scoring, this action has a value of 1, confirming it as the optimal move in this scenario. Discarding may be necessary due to game rules that require players to discard resources under certain conditions (e.g., rolling a 7 and exceeding the resource limit).
