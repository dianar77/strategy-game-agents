========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(6, 7))  
Justification: All three actions have the same heuristic score, meaning they are equally viable based on the system's evaluation. Since there is no further information suggesting one action has a strategic advantage over another, the choice between actions is relatively arbitrary. Thus, I selected the action to build the road at (6, 7) as a valid option. If additional information about future goals or resource considerations were provided, the choice could be refined further.
