        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Please respond with the optimal action and briefly explain why it was chosen. Format:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the decision}
        

========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)  
Justification: The only available action in the current game state is to roll the dice (ActionType.ROLL). Performing this action advances the game by generating new resources based on dice rolls, which is necessary to make progress. Since there are no other options presented, this is the optimal action by default. Additionally, maximizing resource collection is critical for building settlements, cities, or roads to increase victory points in future turns.
