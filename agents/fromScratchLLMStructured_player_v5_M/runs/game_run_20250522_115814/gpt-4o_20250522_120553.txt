        Heuristic Scores for Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Please respond with the optimal action and briefly explain why it was chosen. Format:

========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)  
Justification: With the current game state, you do not have sufficient resources to perform any other actions, such as building roads, settlements, or upgrading to cities. The only available action is to end your turn, which allows the game to progress and gives you the opportunity to gather more resources on the next roll or through trades. Ending the turn is optimal since there are no other viable moves at this time.
