========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)  
Justification: Rolling the dice is the only available action, as there are no alternative actions presented in the current game state. The heuristic score for this action is 1, representing the next logical step in the game progression. Rolling the dice could result in resource generation or progress by triggering events depending on the rolled value. This action moves the game forward.
