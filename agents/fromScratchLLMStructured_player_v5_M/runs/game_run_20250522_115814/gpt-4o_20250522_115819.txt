        Justification: {Reasoning behind the decision}
        

========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(0, 1))  
Justification: All the available actions have identical heuristic scores, so the optimal choice is arbitrary given there are no distinguishing factors between them. I selected the road at `(0, 1)` as it is the first action listed. If additional context (e.g., strategic position or future benefits) was available, that could influence the decision further.
