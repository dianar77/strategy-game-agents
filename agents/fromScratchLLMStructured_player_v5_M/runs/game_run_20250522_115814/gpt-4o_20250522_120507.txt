        Heuristic Scores for Actions:

        Please respond with the optimal action and briefly explain why it was chosen. Format:

========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)  
Justification: The only available action is to roll the dice, which is necessary to progress the game. Rolling will distribute resources to players based on the outcome, enabling further actions like building, trading, or upgrading in future turns. Since there are no alternative actions, this is the optimal choice.
