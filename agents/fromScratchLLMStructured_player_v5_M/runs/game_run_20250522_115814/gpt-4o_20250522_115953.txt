        Heuristic Scores for Actions:

        Please respond with the optimal action and briefly explain why it was chosen. Format:

========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)  
Justification: The only available action is to roll the dice, which progresses the game by generating resources or triggering events based on the roll outcome. As this is the sole option provided, it is the optimal action by default to continue moving forward in the game.
