========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)  
Justification: Rolling the dice is currently the only available action, and it progresses the game state by generating resources or triggering events for all players. With no other options presented, rolling is necessary to gather resources or create opportunities for future actions. Additionally, the heuristic score for this action is 1, indicating it is the best (and only) viable move.
