        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Here is the current game state:

        Heuristic Scores for Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Please respond with the optimal action and briefly explain why it was chosen. Format:

        Justification: {Reasoning behind the decision}
        

========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)  
Justification: The game state shows that you lack the necessary resources to build anything meaningful (e.g., settlements, cities, or roads). Additionally, there are no other actions available apart from ending your turn, making this the only viable option. Ending the turn is optimal to progress the game and potentially acquire additional resources on the next turn.
