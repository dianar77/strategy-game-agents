        Please respond with the optimal action and briefly explain why it was chosen. Format:

========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)  
Justification: ROLL action is the only available option in the current game state. Additionally, rolling the dice is essential to progress in the game, as it generates resources based on the settlement and city placements, enabling future actions like building roads, settlements, or upgrading to cities. The heuristic score also validates this action as optimal with a score of 1.
