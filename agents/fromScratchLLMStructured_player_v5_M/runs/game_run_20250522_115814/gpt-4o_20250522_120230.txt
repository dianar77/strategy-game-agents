========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(1, 2))

Justification: While multiple building roads have the highest heuristic score of 5, the optimal choice depends on strategic considerations such as extending your road network toward potential resource nodes, settlement expansion, or blocking opponents. Without additional context implying strategic advantages for specific road placements, selecting the first road-building action (1, 2) is reasonable to progress the game proactively. Ending the turn is suboptimal since other actions provide better opportunities for network expansion and board presence.
