        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Here is the current game state:
        Player Stats:
        - Resources: [0, 1, 0, 0, 2]
        - Settlements: [2, 4]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points: 2
        - Roads Available: 11

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Please respond with the optimal action and briefly explain why it was chosen. Format:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the decision}
        

========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)  
Justification: Rolling the dice is the only action available at this point in the game, indicated by a heuristic score of 1. Rolling facilitates resource generation based on the dice outcome and settlement placements, which can then be used to improve infrastructure, build settlements, cities, or roads, and progress toward victory points. This is the optimal action given the current game state.
