========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.DISCARD: 'DISCARD'>, value=None)

Justification: The only available action is to discard resources. This action might be enforced to balance resources due to a robber or game rule. Since there are no alternative actions and the heuristic score aligns with the available choice, this action is selected as the optimal one.
