        Heuristic Scores for Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Please respond with the optimal action and briefly explain why it was chosen. Format:

========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)  
Justification: Currently, there are no other actions available besides ending the turn. The heuristic score of 1 indicates that it is the optimal action in this case. Since no further progress can be made during this turn, ending it allows the game to proceed and provides an opportunity to gather more resources on future rolls.
