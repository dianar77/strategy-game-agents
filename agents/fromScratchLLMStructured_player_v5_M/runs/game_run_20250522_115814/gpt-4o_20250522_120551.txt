========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)  
Justification: The only action available is to roll the dice. Rolling is essential at the start of a turn to potentially collect resources, which can be used for building and progressing in the game. Since no other actions are available, this is the optimal action to take.
