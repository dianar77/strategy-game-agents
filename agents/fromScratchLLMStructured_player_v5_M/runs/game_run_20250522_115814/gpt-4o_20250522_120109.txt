========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)  
Justification: Rolling the dice is currently the only available action. This action progresses the game by determining resource production, yielding potential materials for future actions such as building settlements, cities, or roads. With no other options, this is the optimal move to continue gameplay.
