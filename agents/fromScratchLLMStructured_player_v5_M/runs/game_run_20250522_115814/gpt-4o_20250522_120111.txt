========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)  
Justification: The only available action is to end your turn. With limited resources ([0, 2, 2, 0, 0]) and no other actions provided, there are no opportunities to build, trade, or improve your position. Ending the turn allows progression to the next phase of the game and potential future opportunities.
