========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.DISCARD: 'DISCARD'>, value=None)  
Justification: Discarding resources is the only available action in the current game state. Since no other actions can be taken, the optimal choice is to proceed with the discard action, as it allows the game to progress. The heuristic score for this action is also provided as 1, indicating it as the best (and only) viable move.
