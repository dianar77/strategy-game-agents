========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)  
Justification: Rolling is the only available action at this stage of the game, as no other options (such as building or trading) are presented. Additionally, this action has a heuristic score of 1, indicating it is the optimal choice given the current state. Rolling will allow the production phase to proceed, potentially gaining resources that can be used for further game progress.
