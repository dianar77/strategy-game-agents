========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)  
Justification: The only available action is to end the turn. Since no other actions are listed and there are insufficient resources to build, upgrade, or perform any alternative actions, ending the turn is the optimal choice.
