========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)  
Justification: The current available action is to roll the dice, and there are no alternative choices at this stage of the game. Rolling the dice is necessary to progress the game, as it determines resource production and any subsequent actions you might take. This is the optimal action as there are no other options available.
