========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)  
Justification: The only available action is rolling the dice, as the game state does not currently allow for any other actions (e.g., building, trading, etc.). Rolling the dice is necessary to progress the game, generate resources, and create opportunities for future actions. Additionally, the heuristic score for this action is 1, the highest available score.
