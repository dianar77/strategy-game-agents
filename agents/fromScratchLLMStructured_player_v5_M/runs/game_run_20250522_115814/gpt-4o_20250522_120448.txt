========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)  
Justification: Ending the turn is the only available action. Since no other actions can be taken, it is optimal to conclude the turn and wait for additional resources or opportunities in the next round.
