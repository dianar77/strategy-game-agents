        Heuristic Scores for Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Please respond with the optimal action and briefly explain why it was chosen. Format:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the decision}
        

========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Justification: The only available action is to end the turn, as no other options are currently provided. Additionally, the player has insufficient resources (only 1 brick) to take other meaningful actions, such as building roads, settlements, or cities. Ending the turn is optimal in this situation to advance the game state and wait for a more favorable opportunity on the next turn.
