        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Here is the current game state:
        Player Stats:
        - Resources: [1, 0, 1, 2, 0]
        - Settlements: [0, 6]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points: 2
        - Roads Available: 12

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Please respond with the optimal action and briefly explain why it was chosen. Format:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the decision}
        

========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)  
Justification: The only action available is to roll the dice. The heuristic score indicates that this action is the optimal choice, albeit with a low score of 1, suggesting limited immediate impact. Rolling the dice is crucial to generating resources, enabling potential future actions such as building settlements, cities, or roads to progress toward victory points.
