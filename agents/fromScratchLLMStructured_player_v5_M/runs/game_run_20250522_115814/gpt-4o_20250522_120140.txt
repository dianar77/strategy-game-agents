========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Justification: All available actions have the same heuristic score of 1, and there is no clear advantage in performing a maritime trade given the lack of immediate utility for any of the resulting resources. Trading four "SHEEP" for a resource like "WHEAT," "ORE," "BRICK," or "WOOD" does not currently contribute to building settlements, roads, or other strategic goals due to either insufficient resources or no apparent follow-up moves. Ending the turn is therefore the optimal action to preserve resources and await better opportunities.
