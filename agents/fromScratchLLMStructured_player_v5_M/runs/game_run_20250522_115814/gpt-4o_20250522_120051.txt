========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(2, 3))  
Justification: All actions have identical heuristic scores (5), suggesting they are equally viable in terms of contribution to the player's strategy. In such cases, any of the actions can be considered optimal. The action (2, 3) is chosen arbitrarily among the options, as there is no clear differentiator provided.
