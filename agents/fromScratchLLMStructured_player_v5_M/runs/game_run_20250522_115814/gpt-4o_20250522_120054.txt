========================================

Response:
**Action:** Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(3, 4))  
**Justification:** All actions have equal heuristic scores of 5, making them equally viable from a purely heuristic standpoint. In such cases, choosing a valid action arbitrarily is acceptable. The action `(3, 4)` was chosen as it is the first action listed. While additional information about strategic positioning or resource considerations could refine the choice, there is no distinguishing factor provided in the current state.
