========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(1, 2))  
Justification: Since all actions have identical heuristic scores (5), indicating they are equally favorable in terms of strategic value, we can choose any of these actions based on arbitrary tiebreak criteria such as simplicity or maintaining connectivity. I chose `(1, 2)` because it appears first in the list, breaking the tie without further information about the board state.
