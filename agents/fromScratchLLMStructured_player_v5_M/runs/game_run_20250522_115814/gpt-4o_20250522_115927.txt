        - Settlements: []

        Heuristic Scores for Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Please respond with the optimal action and briefly explain why it was chosen. Format:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the decision}
        

========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)  
Justification: Rolling allows you to generate resources, which are critical for progressing in the game by building roads, settlements, cities, and increasing victory points. Since this is the only available action with a heuristic score of 1 and no other options exist, this is the optimal choice. It moves the game forward and creates opportunities for future actions.
