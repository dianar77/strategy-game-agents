========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)  
Justification: The only available action is to roll the dice. Rolling is necessary to generate resources or trigger trading and building opportunities, which are essential to progressing in the game. Since there are no other choices or competing heuristic scores, this is the optimal action to take at this point.
