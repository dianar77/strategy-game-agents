        Please respond with the optimal action and briefly explain why it was chosen. Format:

========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)  
Justification: Rolling is currently the only available action, and it has a heuristic score of 1, indicating that it is an appropriate move given the current game state. Rolling will generate resources based on dice outcomes and connected tiles, which can be strategically used to expand settlements, upgrade to cities, or build roads. With limited resources and no alternative actions, rolling is necessary to progress in the game.
