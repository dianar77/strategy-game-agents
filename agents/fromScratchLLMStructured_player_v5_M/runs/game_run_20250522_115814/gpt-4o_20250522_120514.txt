        - Settlements: [0, 6]
        - Cities: []

        - Roads Available: 12

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Please respond with the optimal action and briefly explain why it was chosen. Format:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the decision}
        

========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)  
Justification: Rolling the dice is currently the only available action. This action progresses the game by determining resource distribution, which can potentially increase resources for future development like building settlements, roads, or upgrading to cities. Thus, choosing to roll is the optimal move at this stage.
