        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Here is the current game state:
        Player Stats:
        - Resources: [7, 0, 0, 4, 0]
        - Settlements: []
        - Cities: [0, 2]
        - Victory Points: 4
        - Roads Available: 13

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Please respond with the optimal action and briefly explain why it was chosen. Format:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the decision}
        

========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)  
Justification: The only available action is to roll the dice, and its heuristic score is 1. Rolling the dice is necessary to progress the game, as it determines resource production or other events (e.g., triggering a robber). Since there are no other decisions to consider, rolling is the optimal and required action at this stage.
