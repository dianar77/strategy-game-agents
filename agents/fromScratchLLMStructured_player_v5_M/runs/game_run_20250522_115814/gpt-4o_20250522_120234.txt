        Heuristic Scores for Actions:

        Please respond with the optimal action and briefly explain why it was chosen. Format:

========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)
        Justification: Rolling is the only available action in this game state. It allows the player to potentially gain resources depending on the dice roll outcome, which can then be used to build settlements, roads, or cities, contributing to victory points and progress in the game. Additionally, it has the highest heuristic score of the available actions, indicating its strategic importance right now.
