========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)  
Justification: The only available action is to end the turn. This indicates there are no current opportunities to build or trade given the player's resources and game state. Ending the turn allows the game to progress and provides the player a chance to acquire more resources or opportunities in subsequent turns.
