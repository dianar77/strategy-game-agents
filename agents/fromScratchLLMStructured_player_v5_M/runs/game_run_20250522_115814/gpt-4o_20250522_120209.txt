========================================

Response:
Given the heuristic scores, all available actions have the same score (1), which suggests no clear advantage between them based on the current game state. However, the decision should consider the utility of the resources being traded to improve the player's position.

### Analysis:
- **Resources**: Currently, the player has 4 BRICK, which can't be directly used to build settlements, roads, or cities without additional resources.
- **Victory Points**: The player only has 2 points, suggesting the need to prioritize actions that help build toward more settlements, roads, or cities.
- **Heuristic Scores**: Since all actions are scored equally, the decision boils down to practical reasoning.

### Maritime Trade Options:
1. **BRICK for WOOD**: Could enable building roads, considering your high count of available roads.
2. **BRICK for WHEAT**: Necessary for building settlements or upgrading to cities but currently wouldnâ€™t immediately enable either without other resources.
3. **BRICK for SHEEP**: Could enable settlements if combined with other resources, but we lack WHEAT to do so.
4. **BRICK for ORE**: Useful for cities, but the player has no WHEAT, making ORE less immediately valuable.

### Decision:
Trading **BRICK for WOOD** is optimal because it increases the player's ability to build roads. Roads expand the player's reach on the board, potentially opening access to new resources and future settlement locations. This action is preferable to ending the turn, as it progresses the player's strategy.

### Final Response:
**Action**: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('BRICK', 'BRICK', 'BRICK', 'BRICK', 'WOOD'))

**Justification**: Trading BRICK for WOOD expands the player's ability to build roads, opening opportunities for resource collection and future settlements. This action progresses the player's board position and avoids the stagnation of ending the turn.
