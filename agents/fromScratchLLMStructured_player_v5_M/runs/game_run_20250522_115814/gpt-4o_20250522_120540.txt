Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Here is the current game state:
        Player Stats:
        - Resources: [1, 0, 1, 2, 0]
        - Settlements: [0, 6]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points: 2
        - Roads Available: 12

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Please respond with the optimal action and briefly explain why it was chosen. Format:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the decision}
        

========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)  
Justification: The player currently has insufficient resources to perform any upgrades (like building settlements, roads, or cities) or trade. With a heuristic score of 1 for ending the turn and no other actions available, ending the turn is the optimal choice to allow the player to collect more resources next turn and reassess potential future moves.
