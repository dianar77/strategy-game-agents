========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)  
Justification: Rolling is the only available action at this moment, and its heuristic score is 1. Rolling the dice progresses the game by potentially generating new resources or triggering events, which will allow subsequent actions to be taken based on the updated game state.
