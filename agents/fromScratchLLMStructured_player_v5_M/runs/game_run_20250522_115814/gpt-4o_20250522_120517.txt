========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.DISCARD: 'DISCARD'>, value=None)  
Justification: The only available action is a DISCARD action, which has a heuristic score of 1. Since there are no other choices presented, this action is optimal by default. Discarding resources is typically a forced action in scenarios like being over the limit due to a robber activation or other game rules.
