========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)  
Justification: The only available action is to end the turn, as no other actions (e.g., building, trading, or upgrading) are present in this game state. Ending the turn allows the game to progress and provides the opportunity to acquire more resources on the next dice roll, enabling future actions.
