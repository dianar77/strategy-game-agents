Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Here is the current game state:
        Player Stats:
        - Resources: [1, 0, 1, 2, 0]
        - Settlements: [0, 6]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points: 2
        - Roads Available: 12

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Please respond with the optimal action and briefly explain why it was chosen. Format:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the decision}
        

========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)  
Justification: The only available action is "ROLL," and its heuristic score is 1. Rolling the dice is necessary to advance the game state by generating resources, which are critical for building settlements, roads, and cities to increase victory points. Since no other actions are available, this is the optimal choice.
