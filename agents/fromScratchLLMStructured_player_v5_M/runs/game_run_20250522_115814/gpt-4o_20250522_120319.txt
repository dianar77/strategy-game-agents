========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)  
Justification: Both actions have equal heuristic scores, meaning neither stands out as particularly advantageous in the current state. However, buying a development card costs resources ([1, 1, 1]), which will deplete your already limited resource supply. Considering this, it may be advantageous to conserve your resources for future growth opportunities, such as building roads or settlements/cities. Ending the turn allows you to maintain your resources and prepare for a potentially better move in the next round.
