Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Here is the current game state:
        Player Stats:
        - Resources: [5, 0, 0, 2, 2]
        - Settlements: []
        - Cities: [0, 2]
        - Victory Points: 4
        - Roads Available: 13

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.DISCARD: 'DISCARD'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.DISCARD: 'DISCARD'>, value=None): 1

        Please respond with the optimal action and briefly explain why it was chosen. Format:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the decision}
        

========================================

Response:
Based on the presented game state, the optimal action is:

**Action:** `Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.DISCARD: 'DISCARD'>, value=None)`

**Justification:** The only available action is to discard, meaning the game state (likely due to rules or specific conditions) requires you to remove a resource from your inventory. Even though this action has a low heuristic score, it is not possible to select any other action. To proceed in the game, this action must be performed. Thus, discarding is not just optimal but mandatory.
