========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)  
Justification: All available actions have the same heuristic score of 1, and no single action provides an immediate advantage in the current game state. Resources are insufficient to construct any important structures (e.g., a settlement, city, or road), and trading sheep for other resources does not provide a clear path toward achieving a meaningful goal since additional resources would still be needed. Therefore, the optimal decision is to end the turn to progress the game and potentially collect more resources on the next turn.
