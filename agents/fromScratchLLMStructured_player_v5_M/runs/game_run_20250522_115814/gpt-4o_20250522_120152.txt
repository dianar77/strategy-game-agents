        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Here is the current game state:
        Player Stats:
        - Resources: [0, 5, 3, 0, 0]
        - Settlements: [2, 4]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points: 2
        - Roads Available: 13

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Please respond with the optimal action and briefly explain why it was chosen. Format:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the decision}
        

========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)  
Justification: ROLL is the only available action in this game state, and its heuristic score is 1. Rolling the dice is necessary to generate resources, which will allow for future actions like building roads, settlements, or cities to progress towards additional Victory Points and eventual victory.
