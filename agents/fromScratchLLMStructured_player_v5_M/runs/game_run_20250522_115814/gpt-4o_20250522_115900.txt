Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Here is the current game state:
        Player Stats:
        - Resources: [7, 0, 0, 4, 0]
        - Settlements: []
        - Cities: [0, 2]
        - Victory Points: 4
        - Roads Available: 13

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.DISCARD: 'DISCARD'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.DISCARD: 'DISCARD'>, value=None): 1

        Please respond with the optimal action and briefly explain why it was chosen. Format:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the decision}
        

========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.DISCARD: 'DISCARD'>, value=None)  
Justification: The only available action in the current game state is discarding resources. Since you have a total of 11 resources (7, 0, 0, 4, 0), the discard action is likely prompted because you've exceeded the threshold (7 resources or more) after rolling a 7 or encountering the Robber. Therefore, the discard action must be taken to comply with the game's rules, and there are no alternative choices. The heuristic score of 1 confirms it is the only logical step.
