========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)  
Justification: The current game state indicates you lack the resources required to take meaningful actions such as building settlements, cities, or roads. Furthermore, no other actions are presented as available, so the only logical move is to end your turn. This allows you to progress the game and potentially gather more resources on subsequent turns for better strategic opportunities.
