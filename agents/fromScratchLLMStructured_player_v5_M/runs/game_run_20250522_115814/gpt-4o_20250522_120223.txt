========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)  
Justification: The only available action is to end the turn. There are no resources or opportunities to build or take other game-changing actions at this time, and ending the turn is the logical choice to proceed.
