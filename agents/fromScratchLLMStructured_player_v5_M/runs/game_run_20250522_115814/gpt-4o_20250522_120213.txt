        Available Actions:

        Heuristic Scores for Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Please respond with the optimal action and briefly explain why it was chosen. Format:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the decision}
        

========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)  
Justification: Rolling is the only available action and has a heuristic score of 1. Rolling generates resource production based on hex tiles, which is essential for expanding settlements, upgrading to cities, and building roads. Since no other actions are currently available, rolling is the optimal move to progress in the game.
