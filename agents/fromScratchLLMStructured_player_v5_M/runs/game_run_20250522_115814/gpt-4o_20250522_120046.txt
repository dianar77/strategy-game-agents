Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Here is the current game state:
        Player Stats:
        - Resources: [6, 0, 0, 6, 16]
        - Settlements: []
        - Cities: [0, 2]
        - Victory Points: 4
        - Roads Available: 13

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Please respond with the optimal action and briefly explain why it was chosen. Format:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the decision}
        

========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)  
Justification: The only available action at this time is to roll the dice, as indicated by the game state. Rolling is the next step to progress the game by determining resource production or other outcomes, and the heuristic score also ranks this as the optimal move (with a score of 1). Therefore, it is both the necessary and optimal action to take.
