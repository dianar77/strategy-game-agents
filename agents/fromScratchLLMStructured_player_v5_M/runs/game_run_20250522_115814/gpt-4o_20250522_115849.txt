        Heuristic Scores for Actions:

        Please respond with the optimal action and briefly explain why it was chosen. Format:

========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)  
Justification: The only available action is to roll the dice, as indicated in the game state. This action is fundamental to progressing in the game because rolling the dice determines resource production for all players based on the numbers on the board. It is therefore the optimal choice to proceed with the game.
