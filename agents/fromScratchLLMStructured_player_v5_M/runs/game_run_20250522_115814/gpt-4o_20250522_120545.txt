========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Justification: The only available action in this turn is to "END_TURN". There are no other actions to consider, as no alternative decisions or resources allow progress in the current state. Ending the turn is optimal to progress the game and wait for more resources or opportunities on subsequent turns.
