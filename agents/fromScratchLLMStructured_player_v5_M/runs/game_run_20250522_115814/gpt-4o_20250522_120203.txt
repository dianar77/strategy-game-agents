        Heuristic Scores for Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.DISCARD: 'DISCARD'>, value=None): 1

        Please respond with the optimal action and briefly explain why it was chosen. Format:
        Action: {Chosen Action}

========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.DISCARD: 'DISCARD'>, value=None)  
Justification: This is the only action available in the current game state. Despite having a heuristic score of 1, which indicates low desirability, no alternative actions are presented. Discarding resources is likely required by the game rules, possibly due to exceeding resource limits after a seven roll or other mechanics.
