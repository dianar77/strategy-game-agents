        Heuristic Scores for Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Please respond with the optimal action and briefly explain why it was chosen. Format:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the decision}
        

========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)  
Justification: Rolling the dice is the optimal action because it is the only available action at this point in the game. Rolling generates resources for players, enabling future possibilities such as building roads, settlements, or upgrading to cities, which are key to increasing victory points. The heuristic score supports this decision as it is the only action evaluated.
