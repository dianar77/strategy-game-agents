        - Settlements: [0, 6]
        - Cities: []

        - Roads Available: 12

        Available Actions:

        Heuristic Scores for Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Please respond with the optimal action and briefly explain why it was chosen. Format:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the decision}
        

========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)  
Justification: The only action available is to roll the dice, as indicated by the game state. Rolling the dice is essential to advance the game, potentially gather resources, and create opportunities for additional actions in future turns. Given that no other actions are available, this is the optimal and required move at this stage.
