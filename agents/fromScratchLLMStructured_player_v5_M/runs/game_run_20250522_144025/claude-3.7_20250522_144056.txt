# Blue Player Strategy Advice

Prioritize brick and wood to build roads toward the 8-wood/3-sheep intersection or the 6-sheep/9-wheat area for expansion. Your current settlements are on brick and stone but lack strong wheat and wood access.

Next steps:
1. Upgrade your settlement on the 5-brick/10-stone to a city
2. Build roads east toward the 8-wood
3. Establish a new settlement for wheat access

Trade stone for wood/brick when possible. Development cards could provide helpful knights for repositioning the robber away from your resources.
