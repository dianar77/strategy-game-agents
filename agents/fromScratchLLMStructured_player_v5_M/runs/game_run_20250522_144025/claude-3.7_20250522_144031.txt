# Blue Player Strategy

Focus on wheat and ore to pursue a city-development strategy. Your settlements are already on strong wheat hexes (8,10) and an ore hex (10).

**Priorities:**
- Build roads to the 3-ore/9-sheep intersection in the northeast
- Upgrade existing settlements to cities for increased production
- Acquire development cards for potential victory points and knights

Wheat and ore are your strength - leverage them for cities and development cards rather than expanding widely. Watch for opportunities to trade your excess wheat for missing resources.
