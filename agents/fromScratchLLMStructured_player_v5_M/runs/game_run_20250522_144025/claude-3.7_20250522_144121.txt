# Blue Player Strategy

**Prioritize brick and wood** - you have no reliable source for either (only 4:1 ports). 

**Focus on roads first** to expand westward toward the 5-wood/4-ore or down to the 6-sheep. 

**Development cards are viable** as you have decent ore/wheat/sheep production.

**Trade strategy:** Use your excess wheat and sheep to acquire brick and wood from other players.

**Medium-term goal:** Build settlements on the 5-wood/4-ore intersection and the 5-brick/11-wheat location to improve your resource balance.
