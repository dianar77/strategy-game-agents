Prompt:

            You are an expert Catan player helping choose the best initial settlement location.
            These are the available settlement locations with their potential resource production:
            
            [{'node_id': 33, 'resources': 'WHEAT: 0.1%', 'total_probability': '0.1%', 'resource_count': 1, 'port': 'SHEEP port'}]
            
            Select the best location by considering:
            1. Overall resource production probability
            2. Resource diversity (having access to many different resources)
            3. Access to scarce resources (brick and wood are important early)
            4. Port access if available
            
            Return only the node_id of the best settlement location.
