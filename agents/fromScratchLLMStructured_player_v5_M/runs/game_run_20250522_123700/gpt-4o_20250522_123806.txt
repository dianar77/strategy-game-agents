Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 1, 0, 0, 1]
        - Settlements: [0, 10]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 2
        - Roads Available: 11

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD: 'PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD'>, value=None)
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD: 'PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD'>, value=None): 1
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
**Action:** Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)  
**Justification:**  

Given the current game state, neither of the available actions directly contributes to maximizing Victory Points (VP) or strategic progression. While playing a Knight card (which moves the robber and potentially blocks an opponent) might be beneficial in some scenarios, there is no current indication of a strategic advantage to playing it now (e.g., no mention of blocking an opponent's key resource production or gaining Largest Army). With only 1 resource of each relevant type (Brick and Wood) and no possibility to immediately take action toward expanding settlements or roads, the optimal move is to **End Turn**, allowing for the collection of more resources during subsequent turns.  

Since both actions have equal heuristic scores (1), the decision prioritizes efficiency and avoiding unnecessary low-impact actions. Playing the Knight card isn't impactful here and would deplete a resource (Knight cards), which is better saved for a moment when it can provide higher strategic value. Ending the turn aligns better with the longer-term goal of maximizing VP efficiently.
