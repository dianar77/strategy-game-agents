Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 4, 3, 1, 0]
        - Settlements: [4, 0]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 3
        - Roads Available: 13

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
Based on the game state and priorities, the optimal course of action is as follows:

**Action:** `Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)`

**Justification:** Rolling the dice is the only available action, and it serves to gather resources, which are essential for building settlements, roads, and upgrading settlements to cities. Since resource diversity is critical for expanding and increasing VP early in the game, rolling is a necessary step to advance toward achieving these objectives. Additionally, it aligns with the first priority of expanding with settlements and roads to maximize resource efficiency and VP gain.
