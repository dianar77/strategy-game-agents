Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [1, 1, 0, 2, 0]
        - Settlements: [12, 21, 15]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 5
        - Roads Available: 4

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
### Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

### Justification:
Rolling is a necessary and impactful action in Catanatron because it generates resources for all players based on the dice roll and the hex placement of their settlements. 

Currently, you have limited resources ([1, 1, 0, 2, 0]) and cannot undertake any significant development (e.g., building roads, settlements, or upgrading to cities). To progress toward maximizing Victory Points (VP), resource accumulation is essential. Rolling will help you gain resources, which can eventually be used to build settlements for resource diversity, leading to future upgrades to cities and VP growth. 

The heuristic score for this action (1) emphasizes that rolling is the only feasible choice to set up future opportunities for impactful gameplay. Avoiding repetitive or low-value actions aligns with this decision.
