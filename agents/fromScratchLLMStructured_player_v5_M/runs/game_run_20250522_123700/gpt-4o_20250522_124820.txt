Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 1, 0, 1, 0]
        - Settlements: [12, 21, 15]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 5
        - Roads Available: 5

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
Based on the available information:

---

### **Chosen Action**:  
**Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)**

---

### **Justification**:
1. **Scarcity of Resources**:  
   - Current resources are insufficient for making impactful actions like building settlements (requiring a combination of wood, brick, wheat, and sheep) or upgrading to cities (requiring significant wheat and ore). Rolling gives us the opportunity to gather necessary resources.

2. **Lack of Available Alternatives**:  
   - The only listed action is rolling, leaving no other actionable choices.

3. **VP Growth & Expansion Plan**:  
   - Rolling directly impacts resource acquisition, a foundational step to achieving early-game goals like building more settlements and roads. These are pivotal for resource diversity and securing future VP growth.

4. **Low Heuristic Score Consideration**:  
   - While the heuristic score for this action is listed as 1, it reflects its limited immediate impact. Nevertheless, it aligns with our long-term strategy, as securing resources is essential to build settlements and roads, which lead to higher VP returns.

By rolling, we align our actions with Priority 1 (expansion for resource diversity) of the game's strategic framework.
