Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [2, 3, 3, 0, 2]
        - Settlements: [0, 10]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 9
        - Roads Available: 0

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
### Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

### Justification:
Given the current game state and priorities, rolling the dice is the only available action, and it is necessary to progress the game. This action allows you to potentially gain additional resources, which are essential for expanding settlements or upgrading to cities. 

Currently:
- You have 2 Brick, 3 Lumber, 3 Grain, 0 Ore, and 2 Wool.
- To build a road (if allowed in the near future), you need 1 Brick and 1 Lumberâ€”but you currently have no roads available to place. 
- To build a settlement, you need 1 Brick, 1 Lumber, 1 Grain, and 1 Wool. You lack sufficient Wool.
- To upgrade a settlement to a city, you would need 3 Grain and 2 Ore, but you currently have 0 Ore.

The immediate objective should be to gather more diverse resources, and rolling the dice is the only action that can enable resource generation.
