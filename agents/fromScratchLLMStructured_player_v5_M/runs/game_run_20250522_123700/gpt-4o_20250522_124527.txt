Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 1, 3, 0, 0]
        - Settlements: [0, 10]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 9
        - Roads Available: 0

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD: 'PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD'>, value=None)
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD: 'PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD'>, value=None): 1
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
### Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

### Justification:
1. **Focus on Resource Accumulation**: Currently, you have a limited amount of resources ([0, 1, 3, 0, 0]), and you do not have any roads available to expand your settlements or build new ones. Rolling the dice is crucial to gather additional resources and increase your options for future actions.

2. **Low Impact of Playing the Knight Card**: Playing a knight card currently has a low heuristic score of 1, indicating that it provides minimal strategic benefit at this moment. Without a clear target or opportunity to block opponents effectively, this action would not significantly contribute to your VP growth.

3. **Preparation for Priority Advancement**: Rolling the dice aligns with the priority of expanding resource diversity (priority 1), which will eventually allow you to build roads, settlements, or upgrade to cities (priority 2). This keeps you on a clear path toward maximizing VP efficiently.

In summary, rolling the dice is the most impactful action as it prioritizes resource generation that is essential for pursuing higher VP gains.
