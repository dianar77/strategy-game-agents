Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 1, 3, 2, 0]
        - Settlements: [0, 10]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 9
        - Roads Available: 0

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
### Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

### Justification:
Currently, your resources are limited ([0, 1, 3, 2, 0]), with no Roads Available and no Cities, which inhibits building settlements or upgrading to cities. Additionally, you are sitting at 9 Victory Points, close to the game-winning threshold (usually 10 VP). The lack of roads prevents immediate expansion to new potential settlement spots. 

The available action to roll is the only current option. Rolling the dice can generate resources for further strategic actions, such as:
- Gaining the resources needed to upgrade settlements to cities (a high VP return goal).
- Gaining the resources to build roads (allowing future settlement expansion).
- Potentially obtaining more diverse resources to improve trade options or build flexibility.

Rolling is the necessary first step to unlock future impactful moves aligned with your priorities of maximizing VP growth.
