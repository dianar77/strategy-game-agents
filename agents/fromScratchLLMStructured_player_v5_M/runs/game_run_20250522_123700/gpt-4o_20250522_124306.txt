Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [1, 0, 0, 2, 0]
        - Settlements: [0, 10]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 8
        - Roads Available: 1

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
### Action:
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

### Justification:
This is the only available action provided in the current game state. Rolling the dice enables resource generation, which is essential for building settlements, roads, and upgrading to cities. With your current resources ([1, 0, 0, 2, 0]) limited, you lack the materials (e.g., brick, wood, or grain) to take impactful actions such as building settlements or upgrading to cities. Rolling the dice may provide additional resources, allowing for more strategic development in subsequent turns. Additionally, the heuristic score for this action indicates its necessity at this point to advance toward maximizing VP efficiently.
