Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 2, 1, 0, 0]
        - Settlements: [4, 0]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 2
        - Roads Available: 13

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
Action: None (Gather more information or observe for resource generation next turn)

Justification: From the current game state, the only visible action is to END TURN, which has a low heuristic score (1). Ending the turn prematurely does not contribute to resource diversity, upgrading settlements, or expanding with roads. The primary goal is to maximize VP efficiently, and we currently lack resources (2 wood, 1 brick, 0 sheep, 0 wheat, 0 ore) necessary for impactful building actions (e.g., settlements or roads). It is better to avoid ending the turn until a more advantageous action becomes available. Observing resource generation next turn may provide options to expand strategically or prepare for upgrading settlements to cities.
