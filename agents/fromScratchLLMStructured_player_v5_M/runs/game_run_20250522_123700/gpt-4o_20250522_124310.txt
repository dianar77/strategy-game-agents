Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 0, 0, 2, 0]
        - Settlements: [0, 10]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 8
        - Roads Available: 1

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
**Action:** Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

**Justification:**  
In your current state, you have limited resources ([0, 0, 0, 2, 0]) and cannot afford to perform high-impact actions like building settlements, upgrading to cities, or constructing additional roads. Rolling the dice (ActionType.ROLL) is the necessary step to generate resources for future actions. Since building settlements and roads is your priority early game to expand resource diversity, rolling gives you the chance to acquire the resources needed to progress toward those objectives. While this action has a heuristic score of 1 (low impact), it is currently the only available and viable option to make progress toward your VP goals.
