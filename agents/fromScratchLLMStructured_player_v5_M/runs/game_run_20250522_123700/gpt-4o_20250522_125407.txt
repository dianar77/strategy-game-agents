Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 3, 3, 1, 0]
        - Settlements: [4, 0]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 3
        - Roads Available: 13

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
### Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

### Justification:
1. **Current Game State Analysis:**
   - Your resource count ([0, 3, 3, 1, 0]) suggests you're low on essential resources like brick (resource 0) and ore (resource 4), which are crucial for expanding settlements and upgrading to cities. Rolling the dice can yield additional resources to improve your diversity and quantity.
   - With 13 roads available, road-building is an option, but you currently lack the brick to build a road (cost: 1 brick, 1 wood).
   - You have 4 settlements on the board, meaning you're generating resources, but you need to gather a more robust pool to take impactful actions such as building new settlements or upgrading to cities.

2. **Why ROLL is Optimal:**
   - Rolling the dice is a productive action since it drives the game forward by providing resources and potentially aiding future goals.
   - Other actions are not currently available, but obtaining resources through rolling the dice directly aligns with the strategy to maximize resource diversity and VP efficiency.

3. **Avoid Repetition and Ineffective Actions:**
   - Refraining from ending the turn prematurely ensures you utilize your opportunities to gain resources and potentially set up higher-impact moves (e.g., building settlements, upgrading to cities).

Rolling the dice is a necessary step to progress meaningfully toward building your economy, setting you up for high-impact actions in subsequent turns.
