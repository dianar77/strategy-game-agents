Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 2, 2, 2, 0]
        - Settlements: [0, 10]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 8
        - Roads Available: 3

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
**Action**: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

**Justification**: Rolling is the only available action at the moment, and it is pivotal to trigger the main resource generation mechanism in Catan. This will allow your settlements to gather resources based on their adjacent tiles, increasing your resource pool. With [0, 2, 2, 2, 0] as your current resource inventory, you're missing critical components like Brick (1) and Ore (4), which are essential for either building roads or upgrading settlements to cities. Rolling here supports your primary objective of accumulating resources needed to expand settlements, build roads, and progress toward maximizing VP. This action doesn't end your turn unnecessarily and sets up opportunities for strategic choices once new resources are gained.
