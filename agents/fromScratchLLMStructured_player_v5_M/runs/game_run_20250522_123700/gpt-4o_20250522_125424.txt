Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 3, 3, 2, 0]
        - Settlements: [4, 0]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 3
        - Roads Available: 13

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
Action: None (No immediate action is recommended)

Justification: Based on the given game state, there are no available impactful actions to progress toward maximizing Victory Points (VP). The only available action, ending the turn, has a low heuristic score (1) and does not contribute to resource diversity, settlement expansion, or city upgrades. To make an optimal decision aligned with the priorities, we must wait for more resources or opportunities to arise in the next turn that allow progression toward VP-efficient moves, such as building settlements, roads, or upgrading settlements to cities. Ending the turn remains necessary to advance the game state.
