Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 4, 0, 0, 0]
        - Settlements: [12, 21]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 4
        - Roads Available: 6

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
### Action: `Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('BRICK', 'BRICK', 'BRICK', 'BRICK', 'WHEAT'))`

### Justification:
The priority is to build settlements and expand early for resource diversity. Currently, we lack sufficient resources to build a settlement or road, but we have 4 BRICKs and can use Maritime Trade to convert them into a resource we need.

Trading for `WHEAT` is the optimal choice for the following reasons:
1. **Settlement Requirements:** A settlement requires 1 WOOD, 1 WHEAT, 1 SHEEP, and 1 BRICK. Currently, we only need `WHEAT`, `WOOD`, and `SHEEP` to gather the necessary resources for building a settlement. Trading for `WHEAT` brings us one step closer.
2. **Efficiency:** Getting WHEAT now optimizes resource diversity, allowing us to make better progress in subsequent turns. Since we aren't currently blocked on WOOD or SHEEP, WHEAT is the most flexible trade.
3. **Avoiding Low-Impact Actions:** Ending the turn unnecessarily is unproductive when resources can be utilized for future strategic needs.

This action aligns with the priority to expand early for resource diversity, setting up conditions for growth while maximizing resource efficiency.
