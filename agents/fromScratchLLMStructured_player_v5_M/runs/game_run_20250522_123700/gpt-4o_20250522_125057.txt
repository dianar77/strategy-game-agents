Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]
        - Settlements: [12, 21, 15]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 3
        - Roads Available: 0

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
### Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)  
### Justification:  
Rolling is currently the only action available, making it the optimal choice by default. Rolling the dice will generate resources, which are essential for building roads, settlements, and cities to maximize Victory Points (VP). Although the heuristic score (1) indicates low immediate impact, taking this action progresses the game state towards acquiring the resources needed to pursue higher-priority goals like expanding settlements and converting them into cities later. 

This aligns with the top priority of the game: acquiring resource diversity and building toward a stronger position.
