Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 0, 1, 2, 0]
        - Settlements: [0, 10]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 8
        - Roads Available: 1

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
Based on the provided game state and goal priorities, it appears that your current resources [0, 0, 1, 2, 0] (likely relating to Brick, Lumber, Ore, Grain, and Wool) do not provide the means to take more impactful actions like building a settlement, upgrading a settlement to a city, or building a road. However, no other actionable options are presented besides ending the turn.

Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Justification: Ending the turn is currently the only action available. Without sufficient resources to pursue settlement or road-building options, and in the absence of any blocking or trading opportunities, it is necessary to end the turn and wait for your next resource acquisition or opportunity to act. This allows you to move closer to meeting the priorities of expanding settlement diversity or upgrading settlements into cities for higher VP returns. If other actions become available in future turns, it will be essential to leverage them strategically.
