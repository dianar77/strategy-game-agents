Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 2, 6, 1, 2]
        - Settlements: [4, 0]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 3
        - Roads Available: 13

        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
### Action:
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUY_DEVELOPMENT_CARD: 'BUY_DEVELOPMENT_CARD'>, value=None)

### Justification:
1. **Resource Utilization**: You have six sheep, which are sufficient for buying a development card without requiring maritime trades. Development cards provide opportunities for VP growth through potential Victory Point cards, or they can offer strategic advantages like knight cards for blocking opponents/resource stealing.

2. **Heuristic Score**: The action has the highest heuristic score (7), indicating it's currently the most impactful choice for VP maximization.

3. **Priority Alignment**: While expanding through settlements and roads is the top priority early in the game, you lack the diversity of resources necessary to build settlements or roads at this moment. Therefore, buying a development card is the best alternative for VP growth.

4. **Avoiding Low-Impact Actions**: Ending the turn or performing unnecessary trades does not progress toward the goal of maximizing VP effectively.

By choosing this action, you take immediate advantage of your surplus sheep, optimize resource usage, and potentially gain a VP card which directly contributes to your score.
