Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 3, 2, 1, 0]
        - Settlements: [4, 0]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 3
        - Roads Available: 13

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
Based on your description, there seems to be a lack of actionable options to improve Victory Points (VP) directly at this moment. The only listed available action is to "END_TURN," which has limited impact. However, if additional actions are possible but not listed, or you can prepare to take advantage of resources or expansion opportunities, other strategies may arise. Here's my analysis and response:

---

### **Action:**
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

### **Justification:**
1. **Resource Insufficiency:** Your current resource pool ([0, 3, 2, 1, 0]) is insufficient for building settlements (typically costs 1 brick, 1 wood, 1 wheat, and 1 sheep) or upgrading to cities (usually costs 2 wheat and 3 ore). Without the necessary materials, no higher-priority actions (building settlements or upgrading to cities) can be pursued during this turn.
   
2. **No Additional Actions Available:** Based on the provided information, the only action at this moment is to "END_TURN." Consequently, ending the turn is the only viable option until new resources are acquired through dice rolls, trades, or other means.

3. **Preparation for Future Turns:** Ending the turn allows the game to progress, where you can potentially collect resources to execute more impactful actions, such as building settlements for resource diversity or upgrading to cities.

4. **Avoiding Repetition:** While ending turns unnecessarily is discouraged, in this case, no other available actions justify holding the turn further.

### **Strategic Notes:**
- On the next turn, aim to gather resources for building a settlement. The priority should be expanding roads and settlements to unlock better resources, particularly ore and wheat, which are key to upgrading settlements to cities later.
- Consider trading if the opportunity arises to balance your resource pool for construction.
- Observe opponentsâ€™ moves to identify potential blockades or counterstrategies.
