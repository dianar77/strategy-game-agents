Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [1, 2, 0, 0, 0]
        - Settlements: [12, 21]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 2
        - Roads Available: 13

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
**Action:** Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)  
**Justification:**  
Since you currently lack sufficient resources to build new settlements, roads, or upgrade settlements to cities (you have a limited resource pool of [1, 2, 0, 0, 0]), rolling the dice is the optimal choice as it generates additional resources based on your settlements' positioning. This aligns with Priority 1 (expanding resource diversity by building settlements and roads early), as gaining resources is the first step toward enabling impactful actions like building or upgrading. Furthermore, rolling the dice has a heuristic score of 1, which, though minimal, is necessary for progress in this stage of the game. Avoiding repetitive or low-impact actions (such as ending the turn prematurely) is critical, making rolling the logical and most beneficial choice at this time.
