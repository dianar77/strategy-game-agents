Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 2, 0, 1, 0]
        - Settlements: [12, 21]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 2
        - Roads Available: 11

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
**Action:** Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

**Justification:**  
The only available action in the current game state is to roll the dice. Rolling is essential, as it generates resources for progress toward building settlements, roads, and upgrading to citiesâ€”key goals for maximizing Victory Points (VP). Without resources, no further impactful actions (like settlement building or upgrading to cities) can be performed. Rolling directly supports the first priority of the game: expanding for resource diversity. Additionally, since no other strategic actions are possible at this moment, rolling ensures efficient progression.
