Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 1, 0, 1, 1]
        - Settlements: [0, 10]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 9
        - Roads Available: 1

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
### Action:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

### Justification:
The current state of the game indicates limited resources ([0, 1, 0, 1, 1]). These resources are insufficient to take significant build actions, such as constructing a road (requires [1 Brick, 1 Wood]) or a settlement (requires [1 Brick, 1 Wood, 1 Wheat, 1 Sheep]). Therefore, the optimal move is to perform a roll.

Rolling provides the chance to gather essential resources for higher-impact actions during subsequent turns, aligning with Priority 1 (expanding for resource diversity). Additionally, no other impactful actions are currently available, making rolling the best available option to progress efficiently toward maximizing VP.
