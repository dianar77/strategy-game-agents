Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 2, 0, 0, 1]
        - Settlements: [12, 21, 15]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 5
        - Roads Available: 3

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
### Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

### Justification:
Currently, the available action is to roll the dice, which is necessary to collect resources and drive gameplay forward. Rolling the dice is a prerequisite for making any impactful moves, as it allows us to gather the resources needed to build roads, settlements, or upgrade settlements to cities. Without additional resources, our current options are limited, and the roll will dictate the next logical steps to pursue.

From the heuristic scores provided, this action has a score of 1, which confirms its necessity at this stage in the game. Taking other actions, such as ending the turn (if offered), would not align with the goal of maximizing victory points efficiently. Rolling now opens up opportunities for strategic expansion or development in subsequent turns.
