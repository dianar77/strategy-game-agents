Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 1, 0, 1, 1]
        - Settlements: [0, 10]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 4
        - Roads Available: 10

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
### Action: **Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)**

### Justification:
Given the current game state and available options, we are limited to ending the turn as no other action is presented. Here's the reasoning behind this choice:

1. **Insufficient Resources**:
   - The resources [0, 1, 0, 1, 1] indicate that we cannot currently afford to build a settlement, road, or upgrade a settlement to a city. For instance:
     - Settlements typically cost [1 Wood, 1 Brick, 1 Wheat, 1 Sheep].
     - Roads typically cost [1 Wood, 1 Brick].
     - Cities cost [2 Wheat, 3 Ore].
   - None of these actions are currently viable due to resource constraints.

2. **No Alternatives**:
   - The only available listed action is **END_TURN**. Without other actionable options, the most efficient step is to wrap up this turn and wait for the next resource roll.

3. **Strategic Efficiency**:
   - Ending the turn allows us to:
     - Accumulate more resources on the next turn through dice rolls.
     - Reassess opportunities to build roads or settlements in line with our strategic priorities.
   - Prolonging the turn without viable actions would be unproductive and result in wasted gameplay time.

Although "END_TURN" is considered a low-impact action, it is the only permissible choice under the current constraints. Future turns should aim to prioritize building roads and settlements to diversify resources and increase VP.
