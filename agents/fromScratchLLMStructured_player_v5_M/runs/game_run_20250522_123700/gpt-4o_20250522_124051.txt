Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1]
        - Settlements: [0, 10]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 7
        - Roads Available: 5

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD: 'PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD'>, value=None)
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD: 'PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD'>, value=None): 1
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
**Action**: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

**Justification**: ROLL is the optimal choice in this situation because:
- Rolling generates resources, which are crucial for following Priority 1 (building settlements and roads for resource diversity) and Priority 2 (upgrading settlements to cities for higher VP returns).
- With your current resources ([0, 0, 0, 1, 1]), you lack enough to perform meaningful actions (e.g., building roads or settlements). Rolling provides the opportunity to gain resources and progress toward those goals.
- Playing a Knight Card (heuristic score 1) would not immediately advance your VP or resource acquisition goals. Blocking opponents may become relevant later, but it is not strategically impactful at this stage due to the lack of immediate threats or conflicts.
- Rolling the dice aligns better with maximizing your future options and progressing efficiently toward VP growth.
