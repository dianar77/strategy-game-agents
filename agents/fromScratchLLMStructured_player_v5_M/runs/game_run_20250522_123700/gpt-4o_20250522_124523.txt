Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 0, 2, 0, 0]
        - Settlements: [0, 10]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 9
        - Roads Available: 0

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
**Action:** Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

**Justification:**  
Given the current game state, resources are insufficient to build a settlement (requiring at least 1 brick, 1 wood, 1 wheat, and 1 sheep) or upgrade to a city (requiring 2 wheat and 3 ore). Additionally, no roads can be built as there are zero roads available. Since no impactful actions can be taken with the current resources, ending the turn is the only viable option to allow resource generation in the next turn. While this action has a low heuristic score, it is a necessary step to progress towards future impactful moves such as building settlements, upgrading to cities, or strategically blocking opponents.
