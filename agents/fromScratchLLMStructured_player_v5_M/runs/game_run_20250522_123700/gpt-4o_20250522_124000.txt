Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 2, 1, 3, 1]
        - Settlements: [0, 10]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 7
        - Roads Available: 8

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD: 'PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD'>, value=None)
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD: 'PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD'>, value=None): 1
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
### Action:
```plaintext
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)
```

### Justification:
Rolling the dice is the most optimal action at this stage because it allows you to generate resources, which are critical for building settlements, roads, or upgrading to cities. These are directly aligned with the prioritization goals of expanding for resource diversity via settlements and later upgrading to cities for higher VP returns.

- **Resources Are Limited**: Your current resources ([0, 2, 1, 3, 1]) are insufficient for significant actions like building a settlement (which costs resources like brick, wood, wheat, and sheep) or upgrading a settlement to a city (which requires wheat and ore). Rolling is necessary to acquire more resources.
- **Playing the Knight Card Is Low-Impact**: Using a Knight card now does not directly enhance your position or serve the strategic priorities of expanding or upgrading.
- **Repetitive/Non-Progressive Actions**: Ending a turn or taking low-strategy actions would waste this opportunity to improve your position.

By rolling the dice, you advance the game meaningfully, creating new options to pursue higher VP efficiently in subsequent turns.
