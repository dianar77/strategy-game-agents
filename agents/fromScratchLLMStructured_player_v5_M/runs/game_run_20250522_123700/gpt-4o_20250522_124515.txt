Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [3, 0, 3, 0, 1]
        - Settlements: [0, 10]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 9
        - Roads Available: 0

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
**Action:** Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

**Justification:**  
Currently, you have 3 of Resource 1, 3 of Resource 3, and 1 of Resource 5 but are lacking Resources 2 and 4, which are necessary for constructing further settlements or upgrading settlements to cities. Since no higher-impact actions such as building roads, settlements, or cities are possible in this game state due to resource constraints, the optimal action is to roll the dice. Rolling generates the possibility of acquiring the resources you need to progress towards the overarching priorities, especially Priority 1 (building settlements and roads) or Priority 2 (upgrading settlements to cities). Avoiding repetitive or inactive turns is vital, and rolling the dice is the only productive action at this stage to move closer to increasing your VP efficiently.
