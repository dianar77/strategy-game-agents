Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 2, 1, 0, 2]
        - Settlements: [4, 0]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 3
        - Roads Available: 13

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
Based on the provided game state and actions, it seems that the system prompts only one available action:

### Action:
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

### Justification:
The current resource pool ([0, 2, 1, 0, 2]) does not allow building roads, settlements, or upgrading settlements to cities. Additionally, the game offers no alternative actions, such as trading or blocking opponent progress. Given the lack of impactful actions available, ending the turn is the only move to progress the game, allowing for the collection of additional resources on your next turn to pursue higher-priority goals like building settlements and increasing VP.

That said, ending the turn is a low-impact action, so future turns should focus on acquiring or trading resources to enable VP-generating actions.
