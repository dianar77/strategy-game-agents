Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 0, 2, 2, 0]
        - Settlements: [0, 10]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 2
        - Roads Available: 11

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
**Action**: None  

**Justification**: Based on the current game state and available actions, there is only one action provided, which is to end the turn. However, ending turns unnecessarily is a low-impact action and doesn't align with the goal of optimizing Victory Points efficiently. Without other impactful actions available, ending the turn may still be necessary to proceed, but it's clear that this situation requires waiting for more resource availability or trading opportunities in the next turn to pursue one of the prioritiesâ€”building settlements, roads, or advancing strategically. Assuming this is the only action in the list provided by the game state, no other alternatives exist right now. Suggest initiating better board ops in next rept as!
