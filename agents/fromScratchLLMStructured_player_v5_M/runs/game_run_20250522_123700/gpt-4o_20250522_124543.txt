Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 1, 3, 2, 0]
        - Settlements: [0, 10]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 9
        - Roads Available: 0

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)  
Justification: Given the current game state, your resources [0, 1, 3, 2, 0] (brick, wood, wheat, sheep, ore) are relatively unbalanced and insufficient to immediately build settlements, upgrade to cities, or effectively block opponents. The lack of available roads further limits expansion potential, emphasizing the importance of resource diversity to move forward strategically. Rolling is the only action available that could generate additional resources, enabling future actions to achieve higher VP (e.g., building settlements or upgrading to cities). While the heuristic score for this action is low (1), it is the only way to make progress and continue optimizing your position.
