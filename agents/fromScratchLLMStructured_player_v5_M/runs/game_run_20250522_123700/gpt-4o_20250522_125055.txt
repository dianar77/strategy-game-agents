Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]
        - Settlements: [12, 21, 15]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 3
        - Roads Available: 0

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Justification: The current state of the game does not allow for any meaningful development due to insufficient resources ([0, 1, 0, 0, 0]). Building a road or settlement is not possible without additional resources. Upgrading settlements to cities also requires resources we currently lack. Since no other relevant actions are available and no blocking moves can be made, the only remaining choice is to end the turn and wait for resource gains from the next dice roll. This is a low-impact action but necessary to progress toward future VP opportunities.
