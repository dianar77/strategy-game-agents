Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [1, 1, 0, 2, 0]
        - Settlements: [12, 21, 15]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 5
        - Roads Available: 5

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

### Analysis:

- #### Current Resources:
  [1, 1, 0, 2, 0] indicates **1 Wood, 1 Brick, 0 Sheep, 2 Wheat, 0 Ore**.  
  This allows the building of **roads** (1 Wood + 1 Brick). However, no settlements or cities can currently be built (settlements require all 5 resources; cities require 3 Ore + 2 Wheat).

- #### Game Strategy:
  1. **Building Roads for Expansion:**
     Building roads is crucial to unlocking new settlement spots. You also have 5 available roads, a limiting factor to account for.  
     Heuristic scores for all road-building actions are **equal (15)**, so the location's strategic importance must guide the decision.

  2. **Evaluating Road Placements:**
     - The roads' values (e.g., `(15, 17)`, `(9, 10)`) represent the tiles they connect.
     - Optimal placement depends on:
       - Connecting to **new locations for settlements**.
       - Blocking opponent expansion.
       - Unlocking high-resource, diverse-production tiles.

  3. **Avoiding END_TURN:**
     Ending the turn contributes no immediate progress or VP growth. Resources gained will depend on dice rolls, introducing uncertainty. Building a road is a guaranteed improvement.

### Decision:

#### **Best Road to Build**
Focus on roads that connect your existing settlements to new areas or block opponents.  
Analyzing possible values:
- **(15, 17):** Extends from Settlement on 15. Prioritizes expansion.
- **(16, 21):** Potentially connects to tiles around 21 (you already have a settlement there).
- Other road placements are less clear in their immediate strategic impact.  

Given this, a **road from `(15, 17)`** is the most optimal action, as it opens up nearby positions for new settlements while advancing your expansion objective.

### Response:

**Action:** Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(15, 17))  
**Justification:** This road placement expands your reach, connecting your settlement at 15 to nearby hexes, increasing the chances of accessing new settlement opportunities and resource diversity. It aligns with the priority of early-game expansion and maximizes progress toward VP growth.
