Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]
        - Settlements: [4, 0]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 3
        - Roads Available: 13

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
Based on the current game state and the available information, there is only one action listed: ending the turn. While a high-impact action aligning with the overall priorities (e.g., building settlements, roads, or upgrading to cities) would be the most desirable, it seems no such options are currently available, likely due to resource limitations.

### Analysis:
- **Resources:** Your resources are [0, 2, 0, 0, 0], suggesting you have only 2 wood and no other resources. This limits your ability to perform key actions like building roads (requires wood and brick), settlements (requires wood, brick, wheat, and sheep), or cities (requires wheat and ore).
- **Settlements and Roads Early Priority:** Expanding with settlements and roads is not currently feasible due to the lack of sufficient resources to build either.
- **Upgrade Settlements to Cities Later Priority:** Upgrading settlements to cities also isnâ€™t an option, as you have no wheat and ore.
- **Blocking Opponent Progress Priority:** There is no indication of an opportunity to block opponents, nor are resources or potential trade mechanisms available to enable such an action.

### Action:
**Action:** `Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)`

### Justification:
Ending the turn is the only available action. This is justified to allow resource income on the next dice roll, which will enable future impactful actions. Since no resources are sufficient for building roads or settlements and no opportunity exists to block opponents, ending the turn is the logical choice to move forward toward your goal of maximizing Victory Points.
