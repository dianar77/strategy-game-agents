Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]
        - Settlements: [12, 21, 15]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 5
        - Roads Available: 3

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
### Action:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

### Justification:
Rolling is currently the only available action, making it the optimal choice for this turn. Rolling will generate resources and set up future turns, allowing me to build settlements, roads, or upgrade to cities once sufficient resources are available. Since my resource pool is currently limited ([0, 2, 0, 0, 0]), rolling is necessary to gather more resources and progress toward the game's priorities of expanding settlements and upgrading to cities.
