Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 4, 0, 2, 0]
        - Settlements: [12, 21, 15]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 5
        - Roads Available: 6

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('BRICK', 'BRICK', 'BRICK', 'BRICK', 'WOOD'))
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('BRICK', 'BRICK', 'BRICK', 'BRICK', 'WHEAT'))
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('BRICK', 'BRICK', 'BRICK', 'BRICK', 'SHEEP'))
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('BRICK', 'BRICK', 'BRICK', 'BRICK', 'ORE'))

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('BRICK', 'BRICK', 'BRICK', 'BRICK', 'WOOD')): 1
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('BRICK', 'BRICK', 'BRICK', 'BRICK', 'WHEAT')): 1
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('BRICK', 'BRICK', 'BRICK', 'BRICK', 'SHEEP')): 1
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('BRICK', 'BRICK', 'BRICK', 'BRICK', 'ORE')): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
### Action:
**Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('BRICK', 'BRICK', 'BRICK', 'BRICK', 'WHEAT'))**

### Justification:
To maximize VP efficiently, the immediate priority is to facilitate building another settlement or upgrading a settlement to a city. Your current resources are `[0, 4, 0, 2, 0]`, so you currently lack **WHEAT**, which is crucial for both settlements and city upgrades.

The chosen **MARITIME_TRADE action** converts 4 unused **BRICK** (which you are clearly overstocked on) into **WHEAT**, enhancing your resource balance. With 2 existing WOOD and the traded WHEAT, you are one step closer to being able to build a settlement (or prepare for upgrading to a city upon acquiring other missing resources like SHEEP or ORE).

Ending the turn now is a low-impact action, as it would stall progress, so trading resources is the more strategically advantageous choice.
