Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 4, 3, 1, 0]
        - Settlements: [4, 0]

        - Roads Available: 13

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
**Action:** Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('BRICK', 'BRICK', 'BRICK', 'BRICK', 'WHEAT'))  
**Justification:** To maximize Victory Points efficiently, resources should be prioritized for building settlements and roads early, focusing on resource diversity. Your current resource inventory includes [0, 4, 3, 1, 0] (0 Brick, 4 Wood, 3 Sheep, 1 Wheat, 0 Ore). Wheat is required to build settlements and upgrade them to cities later. Maritime trading four Bricks (assuming that you are using the 4:1 trade ratio) for Wheat is the most impactful choice since Wheat is the scarcest resource you have and is crucial for settlement expansion and future upgrades. This move sets you up for the upcoming turn where you can utilize your remaining resources more strategically to build or expand efficiently.
