Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [1, 0, 0, 2, 1]
        - Settlements: [0, 10]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 7
        - Roads Available: 4

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Justification: The current game state lacks sufficient resources to perform impactful actions like building settlements, roads, or upgrading settlements to cities. Resource diversity is currently limited, and building settlements (priority 1) isn't feasible due to insufficient resources. Ending the turn is the only available action, making it necessary to wait for resource collection or trading opportunities in the next turn to execute more impactful actions. By ending the turn, we aim to position ourselves for improved strategic opportunities without compromising priorities.
