Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 2, 2, 0, 1]
        - Settlements: [4, 0]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 2
        - Roads Available: 13

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
Based on the game state, it appears that you currently have limited resources: [0, 2, 2, 0, 1], corresponding to brick, lumber, ore, grain, and wool. You currently cannot afford to build a settlement, city, or other items, nor do you have specific actions available that can drive progress. The only action available right now is to end your turn.

### Chosen Action:
**Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)**

### Justification:
1. **Lack of Sufficient Resources**: 
   - To build a settlement, you need [1 brick, 1 lumber, 1 grain, 1 wool] but are missing brick and grain.
   - To upgrade a settlement to a city, you need [3 ore, 2 grain], but you only have 2 ore and 1 grain.
   - No other actions are provided within your current game state, leaving "END TURN" as the sole option.

2. **Efficient Resource Collection**:
   - Ending your turn will allow the game to progress and production rolls to occur, potentially yielding the resources you need to pursue higher-priority actions like building settlements or roads.

3. **No Strategic Alternatives**:
   - Blocking opponents is not available, and no impactful actions can be taken this turn based on your resource constraints.

While ending turns without impact should generally be avoided, in some cases (like now), it is the only available action to set yourself up for future opportunities.
