Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 1, 0, 1, 1]
        - Settlements: [0, 10]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 7
        - Roads Available: 6

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=<target_road_position>)

Justification: To maximize Victory Points, the first priority is to build and expand settlements for resource diversity and strategic positioning. Building a road allows for expansion to new locations, increasing the likelihood of future resource gains and the possibility of additional settlements. With 6 roads available, this is a resource-efficient and impactful action. The current resource inventory may not suffice for building settlements or cities yet, so the next logical step is to utilize roads to prepare for these opportunities effectively. Ending the turn unnecessarily would stall progress, while building roads aligns with the game's stated priorities. Ensure the road targets a high-value location to optimize expansion potential.
