Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [1, 3, 2, 1, 3]
        - Settlements: [0, 10]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 5
        - Roads Available: 10

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD: 'PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD'>, value=None)

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
**Action:** Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(0, 20))

**Justification:** The current highest-priority strategy is to expand early for resource diversity by building settlements, which requires extending the road network. Among the available actions, building a road has the highest heuristic score (15), signaling its importance to overall VP efficiency. By building the road at `(0, 20)`, you are progressing toward potential future settlement locations, opening up key expansion opportunities and increasing your control over the board. This aligns with the strategic priority to expand early and set up for resource diversity before transitioning to upgrading to cities for VP growth. 

The alternative actions, such as building a settlement or buying a development card, have lower heuristic scores (7.22 and 7, respectively) and are less impactful at this stage compared to expanding roads. Ending the turn or playing the knight card provides no meaningful advantage here as they do not contribute to resource expansion or VP maximization.
