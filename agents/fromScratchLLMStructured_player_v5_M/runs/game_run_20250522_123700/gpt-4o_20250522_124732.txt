Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]
        - Settlements: [12, 21]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 4
        - Roads Available: 6

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)  
Justification: Based on the current game state, the only action presented is to end the turn. This indicates there are no other impactful moves available due to insufficient resources ([0, 0, 0, 1, 0]) to build roads, settlements, or upgrade settlements to cities. Ending the turn allows you to enter the next resource production phase to gather critical resources needed for future actions. While ending the turn may have a low heuristic score, it is the only viable option in this scenario. Once additional resources are acquired, the focus will shift to building roads and settlements to expand strategically.
