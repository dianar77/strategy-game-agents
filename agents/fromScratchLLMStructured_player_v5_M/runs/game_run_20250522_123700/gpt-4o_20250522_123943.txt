Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 1, 0, 2, 1]
        - Settlements: [0, 10]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 7
        - Roads Available: 8

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD: 'PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD'>, value=None)
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD: 'PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD'>, value=None): 1
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
### Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

### Justification:
Rolling the dice is the optimal action in this scenario for the following reasons:

1. **Resource Generation Opportunity:** Rolling the dice gives you the chance to gain resources, which are essential for building settlements, roads, or upgrading to cities. Your current resource pool is limited ([0, 1, 0, 2, 1]), so you need more resources to make meaningful progress.

2. **Progress Toward Priority Goals:**
   - Priority 1: Building settlements and roads requires resources. Rolling increases your chances of acquiring the needed materials to expand.
   - Priority 2: Upgrading settlements to cities, a higher VP-generating action, also requires more resources.

3. **Low Heuristic Score of Playing the Knight Card:** 
   - Playing the Knight card would block an opponent or steal a resource but is not currently impactful because your resource diversity is limited, and thereâ€™s no indication that blocking an opponent would lead to a significant advantage at this time.

4. **Strategic Efficiency:** Since rolling the dice generates the potential for immediate resource gain with no cost, it is the most efficient action to set the stage for future impactful moves.

By rolling the dice, you increase your resource pool and advance closer to actions that will maximize your Victory Points.
