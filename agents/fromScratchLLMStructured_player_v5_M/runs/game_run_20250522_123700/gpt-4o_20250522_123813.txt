Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [1, 2, 0, 1, 1]
        - Settlements: [0, 10]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 2
        - Roads Available: 11

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
### Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)  
### Justification: 
The current game state does not provide any immediate actionable options such as building settlements, upgrading to cities, or blocking opponents. Rolling is the logical choice as it progresses the game by generating resources, which are necessary to fulfill priority 1 (building settlements and roads). Actions like skipping turns or stalling would be inefficient and counterproductive, so rolling ensures the game advances while maintaining the focus on VP optimization.
