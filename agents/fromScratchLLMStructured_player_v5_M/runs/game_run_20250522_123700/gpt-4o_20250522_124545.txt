Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [1, 1, 3, 2, 0]
        - Settlements: [0, 10]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 9
        - Roads Available: 0

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_SETTLEMENT: 'BUILD_SETTLEMENT'>, value=19)
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_SETTLEMENT: 'BUILD_SETTLEMENT'>, value=28)
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_SETTLEMENT: 'BUILD_SETTLEMENT'>, value=32)
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_SETTLEMENT: 'BUILD_SETTLEMENT'>, value=33)
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_SETTLEMENT: 'BUILD_SETTLEMENT'>, value=45)
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_SETTLEMENT: 'BUILD_SETTLEMENT'>, value=46)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_SETTLEMENT: 'BUILD_SETTLEMENT'>, value=19): 7.222222222222222
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_SETTLEMENT: 'BUILD_SETTLEMENT'>, value=28): 7.138888888888889
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_SETTLEMENT: 'BUILD_SETTLEMENT'>, value=32): 7.277777777777778
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_SETTLEMENT: 'BUILD_SETTLEMENT'>, value=33): 7.138888888888889
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_SETTLEMENT: 'BUILD_SETTLEMENT'>, value=45): 7.055555555555555
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_SETTLEMENT: 'BUILD_SETTLEMENT'>, value=46): 7.083333333333334

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_SETTLEMENT: 'BUILD_SETTLEMENT'>, value=32)  
Justification: The primary goal in Catan is to optimize Victory Point growth efficiently while ensuring strategic resource diversity. Building a settlement at value=32 has the highest heuristic score (7.277777...), which indicates the spot offers the best combination of resource diversity, future expansion potential, and VP efficiency. This aligns with the early-game priority of expanding settlements and roads to secure diverse resources. Ending the turn or selecting a lower-scoring action would result in suboptimal resource development and slower progress toward maximizing Victory Points.
