Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 1, 0, 2, 0]
        - Settlements: [12, 21]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 4
        - Roads Available: 7

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Justification: Based on the current game state, your available resources [0, 1, 0, 2, 0] (indicating Brick, Wood, Sheep, Wheat, and Ore respectively) are insufficient to construct either a road (requires Brick and Wood) or a settlement (requires Brick, Wood, Wheat, and Sheep). Without further available actions, ending the turn is the only viable option to progress toward gathering more resources and enabling impactful actions in the future. While ending the turn is a low-impact action numerically, it's necessary in this case given the constraints of the game state.
