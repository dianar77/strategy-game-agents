Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 1, 1, 2, 0]
        - Settlements: [0, 10]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 8
        - Roads Available: 2

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
Given the current game state and available actions, here's the response:

---

**Action**: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

**Justification**: At this stage, rolling is the only available action. Rolling will generate new resources based on the dice outcome and board setup, enabling opportunities for future impactful moves. Since resource diversity is critical for building settlements, upgrading to cities, or maintaining strategic flexibility, this action is necessary to progress toward VP optimization. Ending the turn here or delaying would waste an opportunity to utilize additional resources. Therefore, rolling is the optimal next step.
