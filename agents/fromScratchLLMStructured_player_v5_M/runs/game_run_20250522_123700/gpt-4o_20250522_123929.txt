Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 1, 0, 2, 2]
        - Settlements: [0, 10]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 5
        - Roads Available: 8

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD: 'PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD'>, value=None)
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD: 'PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD'>, value=None): 1
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
**Action**: `Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD: 'PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD'>, value=None)`

**Justification**:  
Ending the turn (`END_TURN`) provides no immediate benefit or progress toward the goal of maximizing Victory Points (VP), as it does not advance resource diversity, settlement growth, or city upgrades. On the other hand, playing the Knight Card (`PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD`) could block opponent progress by moving the robber strategically, which is aligned with Priority 3: "Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous."

The heuristic scores for both actions are tied at 1, indicating no clear decisive option. However, given the game state:
1. You lack sufficient resources ([0, 1, 0, 2, 2]) to immediately execute other major actions like building a road, settlement, or city.
2. Utilizing the Knight Card creates an opportunity to disrupt your opponents' momentum while positioning yourself for a potential Largest Army bonus (a potential VP boost), aligning with the overall strategy to optimize VP gains.

Thus, playing the Knight Card is the most impactful action at this point.
