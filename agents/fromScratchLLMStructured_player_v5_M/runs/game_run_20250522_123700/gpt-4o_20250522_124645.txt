Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        - Settlements: [12, 21]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 4
        - Roads Available: 9

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(9, 10))
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(15, 17))

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
### Action:
**Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(19, 21))**

### Justification:
In this scenario, the clear priority is expanding our settlement base by building roads to set up for future settlement placements and to diversify resources, as highlighted in the objective of maximizing VP efficiently. Here are the key reasoning points:

1. **Proximity to Existing Settlements**:
   - The road segment `(19, 21)` connects directly to our current settlement at `(21)`. By extending roads outward from our existing settlements, we are maximizing our opportunities to settle in new, potentially resource-diverse areas.

2. **Resource Optimism and Expansion Potential**:
   - Roads like `(19, 21)` open possibilities for establishing a settlement in a nearby location, leveraging it for future city upgrades and resource diversity. Expanding toward open nodes or viable settlement spots is crucial for VP growth.

3. **Same Heuristic Score - Strategic Choice**:
   - Each road-building action has the same heuristic score of 15, so choosing roads that strategically enhance our position or expand our territory is most logical. The `(19, 21)` road is advantageous as it avoids branching off randomly and instead focuses on progressive expansion from our existing settlement at `(21)`.

4. **Efficient Resource Usage**:
   - Building roads aligns with our current resource count (Brick: 1, Lumber: 3). It makes productive use of resources without overspending, setting up solid groundwork for achieving the next goal: constructing settlements.

5. **Avoiding Idle Action**:
   - Actions like "END_TURN" (score: 1) provide no immediate benefit and waste tempo. Building a road is significantly more impactful.

By choosing `(19, 21)` we adhere to the primary early-game strategy of expanding for resource diversity and securing advantageous settlement positions while efficiently using available resources.
