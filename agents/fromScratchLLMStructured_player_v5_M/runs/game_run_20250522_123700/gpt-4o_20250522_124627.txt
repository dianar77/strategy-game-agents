Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [1, 3, 0, 4, 0]
        - Settlements: [12, 21]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 2
        - Roads Available: 11

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
**Action**: `Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)`

**Justification**: Rolling is currently the only available action, and it provides an opportunity to gain additional resources. Resources are essential to fulfill the first priority: building settlements and roads to expand for resource diversity. The current resource stock ([1, 3, 0, 4, 0] corresponding to brick, wood, sheep, wheat, and ore) is insufficient to directly construct a settlement (cost: [1, 1, 1, 1, 0]) or upgrade to a city (cost: [0, 0, 0, 2, 3]). By rolling, we can potentially gain resources to progress toward these goals, maximizing VP efficiently.
