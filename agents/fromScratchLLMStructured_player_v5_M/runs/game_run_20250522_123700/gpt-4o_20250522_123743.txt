Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 1, 2, 1, 0]
        - Settlements: [0, 10]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 2
        - Roads Available: 11

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD: 'PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD'>, value=None)
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD: 'PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD'>, value=None): 1
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
### Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

### Justification:
The current game state shows that you have limited resources ([0, 1, 2, 1, 0]) and need to gather more to take meaningful actions like building settlements or upgrading to cities. The "ROLL" action allows you to generate resources and potentially diversify your inventory, aligning with Priority 1, which focuses on expanding resource diversity. 

Although "PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD" is an available action, its heuristic score (1) does not indicate a strong strategic impact in this situation, as it will not directly contribute to your resource acquisition or VP growth in the short term. There is no indication that playing a Knight Card would significantly block an opponent's progress or benefit your game at this point.

Choosing the "ROLL" action is the most impactful choice, as it sets you up for subsequent moves to build roads or settlements, progressing toward your goal of maximizing VP efficiently.
