Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [1, 2, 2, 0, 2]
        - Settlements: [0, 10]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 9
        - Roads Available: 0

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
### Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

### Justification:
Rolling the dice is currently the only available action, which directly contributes to acquiring more resources. Resource diversity is critical in the early game for building settlements and roads, as per the priority sequence. Since you have some resources already ([1, 2, 2, 0, 2]), gaining additional materials through the roll increases the likelihood of meeting resource requirements to expand your settlements or roads when opportunities arise. This aligns with the goal of maximizing VP efficiently by progressing from settlements to cities.
