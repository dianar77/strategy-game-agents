Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [2, 2, 2, 0, 1]
        - Settlements: [0, 10]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 9
        - Roads Available: 0

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
### Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

### Justification:
Given the current game state and available actions, it appears there are no impactful moves to expand settlements, build roads, or upgrade settlements to cities. Your resources ([2, 2, 2, 0, 1]) are insufficient for constructing a settlement (generally requires 1 brick, 1 lumber, 1 wheat, and 1 sheep), a road (requires 1 lumber and 1 brick), or upgrading settlements to cities (requires 2 wheat and 3 ore). Additionally, with no roads available, expanding settlements is not currently viable. 

Ending the turn is the only valid option in this state to collect more resources during the next round, setting up for more impactful actions later. This adheres to the goal of maximizing VP growth efficiently by waiting for resource acquisition rather than pursuing repetitive actions.
