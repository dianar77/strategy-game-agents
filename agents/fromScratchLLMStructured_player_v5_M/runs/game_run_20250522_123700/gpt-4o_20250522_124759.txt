Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 0, 0, 3, 0]
        - Settlements: [12, 21, 15]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 5
        - Roads Available: 6

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
### Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

### Justification:
In the current game state, you lack the resources necessary to build new settlements or roads. Specifically, the resource breakdown [0, 0, 0, 3, 0] indicates you have no brick, wood, wheat, or ore, and only 3 sheep. This makes it impossible to pursue settlement or city upgrades at this time. Additionally, there are no immediate opportunities to block opponents or strategize further since no other actionable moves have been made available to you.

Given these constraints, the only viable immediate action is to end your turn to collect resources in the next round. This ensures that you don't waste time unnecessarily and can start planning impactful moves once your resource inventory improves.
