Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [1, 1, 0, 1, 0]
        - Settlements: [12, 21, 15]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 5
        - Roads Available: 6

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

========================================

Response:
### Action: `Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(4, 15))`

### Justification:
- **Goal: Maximize VP growth**  
  According to the given priorities, I should focus on building roads and settlements early to expand for resource diversity and future VP growth. Building roads helps open up paths to build more settlements and block opponents when strategically advantageous.

- **Strategic Value of Road (4, 15):**  
  This specific action aligns with future settlement opportunities connected to your existing settlement at vertex 15. By building a road from (4, 15), you gain a foothold toward potential building spots, expanding your control over diverse resources.

- **Resource Constraint Consideration:**  
  Building a road is affordable with your current resources, as it costs 1 brick and 1 wood (you have [1, 1, 0, 1, 0]). You do not yet have enough resources to upgrade settlements to cities or build settlements since they require more resources. Thus, building a road is the most viable action.

- **Avoid Low-Impact Actions:**  
  Ending the turn now would be inefficient as it wastes an opportunity to expand. Building roads advances your strategy better than passivity.

- **Equal Heuristic Scores:**  
  While other road-building actions also score equally (15), the choice of (4, 15) stands out because it aligns with your current settlements and offers flexible opportunities for expansion with a clear target for settlement building soon.

This road is a step toward strategically executing our early-game goal of expansion for resource diversity, contributing to potential VP growth.
