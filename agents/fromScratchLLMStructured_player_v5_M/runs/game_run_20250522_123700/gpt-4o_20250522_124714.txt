Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 3, 0, 4, 0]
        - Settlements: [12, 21]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 4
        - Roads Available: 6

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'WOOD'))
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'ORE'))
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'SHEEP'))
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'BRICK'))

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'WOOD')): 1
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'ORE')): 1
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'SHEEP')): 1
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'BRICK')): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'BRICK'))

Justification: Based on the current game state and priorities, the primary goal is to build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity. Your resource inventory suggests that you lack brick (essential for building roads and settlements). Trading wheat for brick increases your ability to construct roads, enabling you to expand and secure more resource diversity, which aligns directly with Priority 1.

The other trade options (wood, ore, sheep) don't immediately help with building expansions or VP progression. Ending the turn prematurely without taking action would be suboptimal, as it doesn't progress your current goals. Trading for brick is the highest-impact move at this stage, ensuring you're better positioned to construct roads and settlements as soon as possible.
