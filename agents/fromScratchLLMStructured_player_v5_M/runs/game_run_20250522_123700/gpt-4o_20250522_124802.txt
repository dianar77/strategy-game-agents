Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [1, 0, 0, 4, 0]
        - Settlements: [12, 21, 15]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 5
        - Roads Available: 6

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
### Action:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

### Justification:
At this stage, rolling the dice is the only available action, and it is critical to drive the game forward. Rolling the dice can generate resources for future development, such as building roads, settlements, or upgrading to cities. Acquiring resources is fundamental to progressing with Catan strategies, especially given your current resource pool ([1, 0, 0, 4, 0]), which is insufficient for any significant action.

Priorities Breakdown:
1. **Building Settlements**: Building a settlement requires resources like brick, wood, wheat, and sheep, but your current resource pool is lacking the diversity (e.g., only 1 clay and 4 ore) needed to expand. Rolling will help gather missing resources.
2. **Upgrading to Cities**: Upgrading settlements to cities requires substantial ore and wheat. You have ore but no wheat, making rolling essential to improve resource availability.
3. **Blocking Opponents**: This strategic maneuver is unavailable without specific development cards or road-building opportunities. Therefore, rolling is a productive step toward unlocking such options later.

With no other meaningful action available, rolling the dice aligns with the priority to advance resource acquisition and preparation for the next impactful moves.
