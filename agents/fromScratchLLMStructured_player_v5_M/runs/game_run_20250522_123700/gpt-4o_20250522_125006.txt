Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 2, 0, 0, 1]
        - Settlements: [12, 21, 15]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 5
        - Roads Available: 3

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
Action: None (No action chosen)

Justification: The current game state shows that there are insufficient resources to perform impactful actions such as building roads, settlements, or upgrading to cities. The only available action presented is "END_TURN," which has a low heuristic score of 1. According to the priorities for maximizing VP efficiently, it is crucial to avoid ending turns unnecessarily without attempting impactful moves first. However, given the lack of alternative actions in the provided information, ending the turn is inevitable in this case.

To improve in subsequent turns:
1. Focus on acquiring missing resources by targeting high-value numbers on the resource grid or trading if possible.
2. Maintain enough roads to connect to diverse resource hexes, as resource diversity is key to long-term growth.
3. Build settlements or prepare for city upgrades when resources are sufficient, aligning with VP maximization priorities.

In this case, if there are no other unlisted options available, proceed with ending the turn, as it is the only action provided in the current context.
