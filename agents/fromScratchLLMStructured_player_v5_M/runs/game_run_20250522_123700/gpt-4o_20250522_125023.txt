Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 1, 0, 3, 0]
        - Settlements: [12, 21, 15]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 3
        - Roads Available: 2

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
Based on the game rules and given the current state:

**Chosen Action**: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

**Justification**: 

Rolling the dice generates resources, which are necessary to execute any meaningful actions like building settlements, roads, or upgrading settlements to cities. Your current resources [0, 1, 0, 3, 0] (0 brick, 1 lumber, 0 ore, 3 grain, 0 wool) are insufficient to construct anything meaningful at this stage. For instance:
- A settlement typically requires brick, lumber, grain, and wool, so you are missing brick and wool.
- A city upgrade requires ore and grain; you're missing ore.
- Expanding roads requires brick and lumber, so you're also missing brick.

Therefore, the most beneficial and non-redundant immediate action is to roll the dice to gain more resources, which will enable better actions next turn. This aligns with the first priority: building settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
