Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 2, 0, 0, 1]
        - Settlements: [12, 21, 15]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 5
        - Roads Available: 3

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
### Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

### Justification:
Given the current game state:
- **Resources**: [0, 2, 0, 0, 1] represent Brick (0), Wood (2), Sheep (0), Wheat (0), and Ore (1). These resources are insufficient for building either a **road** (requires 1 Brick, 1 Wood), **settlement** (requires 1 Brick, 1 Wood, 1 Wheat, 1 Sheep), or **city** (requires 2 Wheat and 3 Ore). Therefore, no immediate impactful actions can be taken.
- **Settlements and Roads**: Expanding settlements or laying roads is critical early on, but resources to progress in this priority are currently unavailable.
- **Blocking Opponent Progress**: This would require an action like strategically placing a road or settlement, but again, the resource shortage prevents this.

Since no other actionable opportunities exist, the optimal choice here is to **end the turn** and collect resources on the next roll to begin working towards settlements, roads, or city upgrades as soon as possible. Maximizing efficiency requires resource accumulation for impactful moves later.
