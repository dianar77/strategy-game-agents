Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 1, 0, 0, 2]
        - Settlements: [0, 10]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 5
        - Roads Available: 8

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
Action: No optimal action can currently be chosen with the provided state. Recommended approach: accumulate necessary resources for future impactful actions or explore missing details to clarify options.

Justification: Based on the given game state and priorities, the only available action is ending the turn, which holds a low heuristic score of 1 due to its lack of direct impact. The resource pool ([0, 1, 0, 0, 2]) is insufficient to build roads, settlements, or upgrades to cities, so accumulating resources by progressing to the next turn becomes necessary. If further details on possible additional actions or trade opportunities emerge, re-evaluation would allow for a more impactful choice. Ending the turn remains temporarily unavoidable to advance the game state.
