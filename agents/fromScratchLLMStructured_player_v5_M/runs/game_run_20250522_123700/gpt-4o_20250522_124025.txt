Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]
        - Settlements: [0, 10]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 7
        - Roads Available: 7

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD: 'PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD'>, value=None)
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD: 'PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD'>, value=None): 1
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
Based on the current game state, here’s the analysis:

- **Resources:** You have [0, 2, 0, 0, 0], which means you lack sufficient resources to build settlements, roads, or upgrade to cities. This limits your ability to take build-focused actions.
- **Settlements:** You have 10 settlements available for building, which indicates room for expansion if you can gather resources.
- **Cities:** None have been built yet, so upgrading settlements to cities for maximizing VP isn’t yet applicable due to a lack of cities or sufficient materials.
- **Victory Points:** You’re sitting at 7 VP, possibly from settlements and other game elements.
- **Actions:** The two available actions are to play a knight card or end your turn. However, the heuristic scores for both actions are low (just 1), reflecting minimal strategic impact.

### Action:** Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)
