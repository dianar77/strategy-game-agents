Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 3, 2, 0, 2]
        - Settlements: [0, 10]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 9
        - Roads Available: 0

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
**Action:** Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

**Justification:** The current game state shows that rolling the dice is the only available action. This is a necessary step to generate new resources, allowing for future moves, such as building settlements or upgrading settlements to cities, in line with your priorities. Although the heuristic score for this action is minimal, it is the only means to progress and work toward maximizing Victory Points. Without rolling, you cannot gather additional resources, limiting your ability to build or upgrade.
