Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 1, 2, 1, 0]
        - Settlements: [0, 10]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 2
        - Roads Available: 12

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
### Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

### Justification:
Looking at the current game state:
1. **Resource Availability:** You currently have [0, 1, 2, 1, 0] resources. Unfortunately, this resource combination doesn't allow for building a road, settlement, or upgrading to a city. To build a settlement (costing 1 brick, 1 wood, 1 wheat, and 1 sheep), or a road (costing 1 brick and 1 wood), more resources are needed. The same applies for upgrading to a city (requiring 3 ore and 2 wheat).

2. **Strategic Priorities:** 
   - Priority 1 (Building settlements and roads): You lack the necessary resources for either action.
   - Priority 2 (Upgrading settlements to cities): Similarly, the resources required (ore and wheat) are insufficient.
   - Priority 3 (Blocking opponents): There is no indication of an opportunity or need to block opponents here.

3. **Available Actions:** The only action presented is `END_TURN`. Since resource generation depends on dice rolls or trading during other players' turns, you must wait before taking impactful actions. Ending the turn is currently the only option.

In conclusion, while ending the turn is not a direct VP-generating action, it is the only viable option to progress toward acquiring resources for future impactful moves.
