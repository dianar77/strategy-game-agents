Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 2, 0, 1, 1]
        - Settlements: [0, 10]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 7
        - Roads Available: 7

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD: 'PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD'>, value=None)
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD: 'PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD'>, value=None): 1
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
**Action:** Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD: 'PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD'>, value=None)  
**Justification:**  
Playing a Knight card can potentially block opponents' progress or force strategic resource denial if implemented appropriately, even though the heuristic scores for both options are equal. Ending the turn in this situation does not actively contribute to expanding settlements, cities, or roads for resource diversity and VP growth.  

While resources are too limited for immediate construction, the Knight card can pave the way for future moves by hindering competitors or securing a competitive advantage (e.g., moving the robber to block productive tiles for opponents or stealing a resource to complete missing sets). Ending the turn without utilizing this opportunity is less impactful strategically.
