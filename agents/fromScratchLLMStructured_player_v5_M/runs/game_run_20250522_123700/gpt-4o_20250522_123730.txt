Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 0, 2, 2, 0]
        - Settlements: [0, 10]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 2
        - Roads Available: 11

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
**Action**: `Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)`

**Justification**:  
Currently, you have insufficient resources ([0, 0, 2, 2, 0]) to take any other impactful actions. Building a settlement requires a mix of resources (typically 1 brick, 1 wood, 1 wheat, and 1 sheep), and upgrading to a city requires 3 ore and 2 wheat, none of which you can afford. Additionally, you don't seem to have any other immediate actions available to progress actively towards more Victory Points.

Given the circumstances, the optimal action is to end the turn, collect resources during the next round, and reassess based on new resource acquisition. While ending the turn has a low heuristic score (1), it is the only option available and ensures that you can work towards fulfilling the stated priorities (expanding for diversity and upgrading for VP returns) in subsequent turns.
