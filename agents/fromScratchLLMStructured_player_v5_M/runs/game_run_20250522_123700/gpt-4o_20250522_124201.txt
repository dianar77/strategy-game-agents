Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [1, 0, 0, 3, 1]
        - Settlements: [0, 10]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 7
        - Roads Available: 4

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
**Action:** Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

**Justification:** The current resource pool ([1, 0, 0, 3, 1]) does not provide enough resources to take impactful actions, such as building settlements (requiring [1 wood, 1 brick, 1 wheat, 1 sheep]) or upgrading settlements to cities (requiring [2 wheat, 3 ore]). Additionally, there are no immediate opportunities to block opponents or utilize roads effectively, given the limited strategic depth provided in the scenario. Ending the turn is the only viable action to gather more resources through dice rolls in subsequent turns, enabling future progress toward fulfilling the game's priorities. While ending the turn is low in heuristic value (1), it is the optimal choice given the current constraints.
