Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 1, 2, 2, 0]
        - Settlements: [0, 10]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 8
        - Roads Available: 2

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
Based on the provided game state and priorities, there seems to be a contradiction in the description of available actions and the directive to avoid repetitive or low-impact actions, like ending turns unnecessarily. The *only* explicitly available action provided is `Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)`, with a heuristic score of 1. Therefore, I'd proceed cautiously:

---

### Action:
**Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)**

---

### Justification:
- No other actions (like building settlements, upgrading to cities, or building roads) are listed as available.
- Ending the turn is a low-impact move based on the heuristic score of 1, but it is the only move explicitly permitted.
- Current resources `[0, 1, 2, 2, 0]` (Brick, Lumber, Ore, Wheat, Sheep) are insufficient to efficiently build a settlement (cost: `[1, 1, 0, 1, 1]`) or upgrade settlements to cities (cost: `[0, 0, 3, 2, 0]`), aligning with the lack of listed actions for immediate VP growth.
- Ending the turn will allow resource generation on the next dice roll, potentially improving your ability to execute impactful VP-oriented strategies (e.g., building settlements or upgrading to cities) in a subsequent turn.
