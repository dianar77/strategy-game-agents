Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 1, 2, 0, 2]
        - Settlements: [4, 0]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 2
        - Roads Available: 13

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)  
Justification: While ending the turn is generally not an optimal action, in the current game state, I have insufficient resources to build a settlement (cost: [1 wood, 1 brick, 1 wheat, 1 sheep]) or any other significant structure, as I have no wood or brick. Additionally, I cannot upgrade to a city (cost: [2 wheat, 3 ore]) because I lack ore and have only 2 wheat. With no other available actions listed, the only action right now is to end the turn and wait for my next resource roll to collect materials that will allow me to progress toward building settlements or upgrading settlements into cities.
