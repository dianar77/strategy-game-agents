Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 1, 0, 1, 0]
        - Settlements: [12, 21, 15]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 5
        - Roads Available: 4

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
**Action:** Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

**Justification:** Based on the current game state, you have insufficient resources to take productive actions such as building settlements (cost: resources required) or upgrading to cities (cost: resources required). Your resources [0, 1, 0, 1, 0] indicate that you only have 1 wool and 1 brick, which aren't sufficient for any meaningful expansions or upgrades. Building roads typically requires wood and brick, and you lack the wood.

Since no other action seems possible at this time, the best option is to end the turn and wait for additional resource acquisition or trade opportunities in subsequent rounds. While ending the turn is a low-impact action that we typically avoid unless necessary, it is currently the only viable choice to progress toward improving your position in the game.
