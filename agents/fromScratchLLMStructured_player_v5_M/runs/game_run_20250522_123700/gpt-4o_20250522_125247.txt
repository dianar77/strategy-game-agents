Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 2, 3, 1, 2]
        - Settlements: [4, 0]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 3
        - Roads Available: 13

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
### Action:
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

### Justification:
The current resource inventory ([0, 2, 3, 1, 2]) is insufficient to take strategic actions like building settlements or upgrading settlements to cities. Rolling is the most impactful choice at this stage since it may trigger additional resource gains from production tiles, enabling future actions to expand settlements or upgrade them to cities, which align with the priorities of maximizing VP. Rolling is also the only available action, which makes it the logical next step to progress in the game.
