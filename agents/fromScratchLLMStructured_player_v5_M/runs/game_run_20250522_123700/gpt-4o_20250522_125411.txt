Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 3, 3, 1, 0]
        - Settlements: [4, 0]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 3
        - Roads Available: 13

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
**Action:** Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

**Justification:** Unfortunately, based on the current game state and lack of alternative actions provided, there doesn't seem to be an actionable option available to build settlements, roads, or upgrade settlements to cities. Building a settlement typically requires a diverse set of resources (e.g., 1 brick, 1 wood, 1 wheat, 1 sheep), while upgrading to a city requires 2 wheat and 3 ore. Currently, the resource inventory [0, 3, 3, 1, 0] lacks both brick and wood necessary for expansion as well as ore for city upgrades. Therefore, there is no high-impact action to take this turn, and the only available action is to end the turn. 

To maximize future efficiency, consider trading next turn or positioning yourself to obtain missing resources via strategic trades, dice rolls, or resource cards. Ending the turn promptly is necessary to move forward.
