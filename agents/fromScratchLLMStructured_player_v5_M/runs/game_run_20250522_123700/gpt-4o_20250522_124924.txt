Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 0, 0, 2, 1]
        - Settlements: [12, 21, 15]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 5
        - Roads Available: 3

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
**Action:** Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

**Justification:**  
Rolling the dice is currently the only available action and serves as the starting point to gather resources. Since your current resource pool is limited ([0, 0, 0, 2, 1]), and you're unable to build or upgrade anything immediately, rolling the dice is necessary to generate resources. This will enable future actions, such as building roads or settlements, aligning with Priority 1 (expanding for resource diversity). Rolling the dice optimizes your chances for increasing resources and preparing for higher-impact actions in subsequent turns. Also, since no alternative impactful actions are present, this is the optimal move.
