Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [1, 2, 0, 2, 0]
        - Settlements: [12, 21]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 4
        - Roads Available: 8

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
### Action:
**Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(3, 12))**

### Justification:
The priority here is to maximize VP efficiently by expanding towards resource diversity and future settlement placements. 

- **Settlement Expansion Priority (Resource Diversity):** Among the available road-building options, extending road from **settlement 12** (connected to vertex 3) allows for expansion toward unclaimed areas that could lead to valuable settlement locations with resource diversity.
- **Efficient Resource Usage:** Building roads costs **1 Lumber** and **1 Brick** each. With **resources [1 (Brick), 2 (Lumber), 0 (Wheat), 2 (Ore), 0 (Sheep)]**, the action consumes available resources without overextending and leaves strategic options open for future turns.
- **Endgame City Upgrades:** Upgrading settlements to cities (costing Wheat and Ore) is a later priority. Saving Wheat and Ore right now aligns with our mid-to-late game strategy of converting settlements for higher VP returns.

Other road-building actions (e.g., connecting to far-off nodes) are symmetrical in heuristic scores but less targeted toward settlement expansion connected to earlier-placed settlements like vertex 12. Ending the turn without action squanders an opportunity to progress toward optimal expansion.

### Final Thought:
This action sets up future settlements while maintaining focus on Victory Point growth, aligning perfectly with the stated priorities.
