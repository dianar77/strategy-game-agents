Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 2, 0, 3, 0]
        - Settlements: [12, 21]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 4
        - Roads Available: 6

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
**Action:** Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)  
**Justification:** In the current game state, you do not have sufficient resources to build roads (cost: [1 Brick, 1 Wood]), settlements (cost: [1 Brick, 1 Wood, 1 Sheep, 1 Wheat]), or upgrade settlements to cities (cost: [2 Wheat, 3 Ore]). Your resource inventory includes [0 Brick, 2 Wood, 0 Sheep, 3 Wheat, 0 Ore], which doesn't allow for any productive action right now. 

Ending the turn is the only available action, but it is not ideal to repeat this frequently unless it enables new resource collection or strategic benefits. Ending the turn now is a step toward accumulating more resources to take impactful actions in the future. The next priority should be collecting resources to either expand with settlements/roads or upgrade settlements to cities.
