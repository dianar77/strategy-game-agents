Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1]
        - Settlements: [12, 21, 15]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 5
        - Roads Available: 3

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
**Action:** Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)  
**Justification:**  

Unfortunately, given the current game state, there are no alternative viable actions to build settlements, roads, or upgrade settlements into cities. The resource pool ([0, 0, 0, 1, 1]) is inadequate for any meaningful construction:  
- Settlements require something like [1 Brick, 1 Lumber, 1 Wheat, 1 Sheep].  
- Roads require [1 Brick, 1 Lumber].  
- Upgrading to cities requires 3 Ore and 2 Wheat.  

Since none of these actions are possible at this moment, the only available action in the list is ending the turn. While ending the turn has the lowest heuristic impact, it is necessary to replenish resources from dice rolls in the next turn, paving the way for better options.  
In subsequent turns, prioritize resource diversity and expansion through building additional roads and settlements to progress the game more effectively toward VP growth.
