Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 1, 2, 2, 0]
        - Settlements: [0, 10]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 8
        - Roads Available: 2

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
To respond to this situation and strategic breakdown, here's the optimal move:

**Action:** `Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)`

**Justification:**  
The current game state indicates limited resource availability:  
- Resources: [0, 1, 2, 2, 0] (low total resources and some key types missing, e.g., wheat and brick).  
- The player needs better resource diversity to fulfill higher-priority actions like building settlements or upgrading to cities.  
- Rolling for resources is the only available and impactful action that can help gather more resources for future moves. Rolling introduces a random element necessary for resource influx, which aligns with the priority of building settlements early.  

Heuristic Priority:  
While the score for this action is low (1), there are no other choices currently presented. Avoiding this action would stall progress, whereas rolling creates opportunities to collect resources for settlements or roads. This is the best step toward maximizing long-term VP efficiently.
