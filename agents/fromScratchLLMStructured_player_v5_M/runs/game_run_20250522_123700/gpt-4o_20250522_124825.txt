Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 1, 0, 1, 1]
        - Settlements: [12, 21, 15]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 5
        - Roads Available: 5

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Justification: Based on the current game state, it seems no additional available actions beyond ending the turn have been presented. Therefore, I am compelled to choose this action. Nonetheless, this is not ideal for maximizing VP growth as it merely defers progress. For future optimal moves:
- My current resource pool ([0, 1, 0, 1, 1]) includes 1 wood, 1 brick, and 1 sheep, but I am missing wheat to build either a settlement (requires [1 wood, 1 brick, 1 wheat, 1 sheep]) or a city (requires [2 wheat, 3 ore]).
- I still have roads available, and building roads early increases expansion opportunities for settlements. It would be strategic to collect resources to enable road building or to build settlements near resource-heavy intersections. Thus, I would aim to prioritize resource acquisition on my next turn by targeting high-yield resource-producing numbers.
