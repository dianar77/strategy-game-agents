Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 1, 1, 0, 1]
        - Settlements: [4, 0]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 3
        - Roads Available: 13

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
**Action:** Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

**Justification:**  
Given the current game state:  
- Resources: [0, 1, 1, 0, 1] (presumably Brick, Wood, Sheep, Wheat, Ore in standard order). You lack sufficient resources to construct a settlement (cost: 1 Brick, 1 Wood, 1 Wheat, 1 Sheep) or upgrade to a city (cost: 2 Wheat, 3 Ore).  
- Roads are still plentiful (13 available), but road-building (cost: 1 Brick, 1 Wood) is also unavailable due to resource constraints.  
- No other explicit viable actions are provided in the game state.  

As such, the optimal decision is to end the turn to cycle to the next resource roll, allowing resource accumulation for more impactful actions in future turns. While ending turns is inherently a low-heuristic action, it is strategically necessary given the lack of actionable options.
