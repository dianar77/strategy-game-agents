Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [1, 3, 3, 0, 2]
        - Settlements: [0, 10]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 9
        - Roads Available: 0

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
Action: No valid action available to optimize Victory Points at this moment.

Justification: Given your current game state:

- **Resources**: You currently have [1, 3, 3, 0, 2], which does not align with the requirements to build settlements, upgrade settlements to cities, or construct roads.
- **Settlements**: You have reached the maximum number of settlements (10) allowed, leaving no room for building more.
- **Cities**: Upgrading settlements to cities would be the next priority, but you lack the combinations of resources (usually requiring wheat and ore) necessary for this action.
- **Roads**: Without available roads, expanding via road-building is currently not possible.

The only available action listed is `END_TURN`, which has a low heuristic score (1) because it is a repetitive, low-impact action under these circumstances. However, unless new actions or events arise, there isn't much room for impactful decisions on this turn. Ending the turn is the only realistic option to allow for resource collection or situational changes in subsequent turns.
