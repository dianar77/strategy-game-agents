Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 2, 3, 2, 0]
        - Settlements: [4, 0]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 3
        - Roads Available: 13

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
### Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

### Justification:
Currently, the game state reflects that resources are relatively low, with [0, 2, 3, 2, 0], which limits options for pursuing major developments like settlements (requires 1 brick, 1 wood, 1 wheat, and 1 sheep) or cities (requires 3 wheat and 2 ore). Rolling the dice is essential to collect additional resources and proceed with impactful actions like building settlements or roads. The heuristic score for this action is 1, which indicates it is appropriate as the next strategic step.

This decision aligns with the game's priorities:
1. **Priority on Expansion:** Resource diversity is crucial for building settlements. Rolling allows us to gather resources to pursue this goal.
2. **Avoid Low-Impact Actions:** Rolling is the only action currently available that has the potential to unlock meaningful gameplay progress. Without additional resources, other impactful actions cannot be taken.
