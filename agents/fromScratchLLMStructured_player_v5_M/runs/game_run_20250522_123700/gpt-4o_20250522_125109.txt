Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [1, 2, 0, 1, 0]
        - Settlements: [12, 21, 15]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 3
        - Roads Available: 0

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
**Action**: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)  
**Justification**: Given the current game state and resources ([1, 2, 0, 1, 0]), you are unable to build settlements, roads, or upgrade settlements into cities due to insufficient resources. The victory point growth strategy emphasizes proactive moves, but there are no actionable options available this turn. Ending the turn is the only viable action to progress the game and collect more resources, which will enable impactful actions in subsequent turns. This decision aligns with the priority of resource acquisition to expand strategically and maximize VP.
