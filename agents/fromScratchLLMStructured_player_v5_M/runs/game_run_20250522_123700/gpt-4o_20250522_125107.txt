Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [1, 2, 0, 1, 0]
        - Settlements: [12, 21, 15]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 3
        - Roads Available: 0

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
### Action:
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

### Justification:
The only available action is to roll the dice, as indicated in the provided game state. Rolling the dice serves as the critical function to generate resources, and these resources are necessary for pursuing the established priorities:

1. You currently lack sufficient resources to build new settlements, roads, or upgrade settlements to cities. Rolling is essential to accumulate the materials needed for these objectives.

2. Expanding settlements and upgrading to cities are the highest-impact early and mid-game actions for increasing VP. Rolling the dice is the most direct way to eventually reach these objectives.

3. By rolling now, you can potentially gain resources that will position you for strategic moves, such as building roads to expand settlement options, upgrading settlements to cities for higher VP, or blocking opponents later if needed.

### Conclusion:
The dice roll is the only viable action to help gather resources and maintain progress toward the end goal of maximizing VP.
