Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 3, 2, 0, 3]
        - Settlements: [0, 10]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 5
        - Roads Available: 10

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD: 'PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD'>, value=None)
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD: 'PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD'>, value=None): 1
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
Based on your game state and the lack of impactful options available in this turn:

### Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

### Justification:
1. **Limited Resources for Expansion:**
   - Current resources `[0, 3, 2, 0, 3]` are insufficient to build a settlement (requires [1 Brick, 1 Wood, 1 Wheat, 1 Sheep]) or a road (requires [1 Brick, 1 Wood]) to fulfill priority #1 (expansion through building settlements/roads).
   - For priority #2 (upgrading settlements to cities), you're also lacking the required resources (3 Wheat, 2 Ore).

2. **Low Impact of Playing a Knight Card:**
   - Playing the Knight Card does not directly aid in resource collection or expansion this turn since no specific opponent block or strategic benefit from moving the robber was mentioned.
   - With a heuristic score of `1`, it is currently a low-impact action.

3. **Strategic Resource Accumulation:**
   - Ending the turn allows you to proceed to the next resource collection phase, potentially acquiring the resources necessary to expand (build a settlement or roads) or upgrade settlements to cities in the next turn.

In the absence of meaningful resource usage or impactful strategic moves, saving resources and moving to the next turn is the best option for maximizing VP growth efficiently.
