Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 0, 0, 2, 1]
        - Settlements: [0, 10]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 7
        - Roads Available: 4

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
### Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

### Justification:
Currently, the game state indicates that you lack sufficient resources to take major actions like building roads, settlements, or upgrading settlements to cities. Your resources are [0, 0, 0, 2, 1], which are insufficient to fulfill any construction costs. Rolling the dice is the only available action that allows you to potentially acquire more resources to fuel your expansion strategy.

Given the heuristic score of 1 for this action (indicating a moderate level of impact), rolling the dice is the optimal step to progress in the game. This action aligns with priority 1, as gaining resources through rolling enables you to pursue settlement building and resource diversity in subsequent turns. It also avoids stalling by refraining from low-impact or redundant actions.
