Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 3, 1, 0, 1]
        - Settlements: [0, 10]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 5
        - Roads Available: 10

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD: 'PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD'>, value=None)
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD: 'PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD'>, value=None): 1
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
### Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

### Justification:
Rolling the dice is the optimal action at this point for several reasons:  
1. **Resource Accumulation**: With limited resources ([0, 3, 1, 0, 1] - representing most likely [brick, lumber, grain, ore, sheep]), you currently do not have enough to build anything impactful (e.g., settlements need [1 brick, 1 lumber, 1 grain, 1 sheep]). Rolling the dice increases the chance of obtaining resources for future actions.  
2. **Forward Progress**: Rolling the dice is mandatory to advance the game state. It is a non-repetitive action that moves the game forward, whereas using a knight card would yield no immediate benefit since the heuristic score for it is low and thereâ€™s no active blocking opportunity evident.  
3. **Strategic Alignment**: Following your stated priorities, you need to focus on resource diversity by expanding via settlements and roads first. Rolling gives you a chance to gather materials needed for that objective. Playing a knight card would not contribute to these priorities at this stage.
