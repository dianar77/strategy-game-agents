Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 1, 0, 1, 0]
        - Settlements: [12, 21, 15]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 5
        - Roads Available: 6

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
Action: **Gather Resources or Explore Alternatives**

Justification: Given the current state, you lack sufficient resources to build settlements, roads, or upgrade settlements to cities (not enough diversity in your resource pool). Additionally, the only available action is ending your turn, but its heuristic score is very low, indicating minimal impact. Since ending the turn doesn't directly progress toward maximizing VP growth, our optimal strategy would involve seeking additional opportunities or alternatives to gather resources or barter with opponents if those options could be unlocked. However, if no other actions are explicitly available (as per the prompt), the "END_TURN" is the only feasible choice, albeit not ideal here.
