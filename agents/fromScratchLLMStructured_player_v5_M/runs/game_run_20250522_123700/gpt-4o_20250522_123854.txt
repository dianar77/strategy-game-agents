Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [1, 3, 2, 0, 3]
        - Settlements: [0, 10]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 5
        - Roads Available: 10

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD: 'PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD'>, value=None)
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD: 'PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD'>, value=None): 1
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
### Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

### Justification: 
The highest-priority goal in the early game is to expand for resource diversity by constructing settlements and roads. However, both available actions ("PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD" and "ROLL") have equal heuristic scores of 1, so further analysis is necessary.

- **Rolling Dice:** This action is optimal because it provides a chance to gather additional resources, which are critical for building settlements, roads, and cities. Since the goal is to expand early for resource diversity and VP gains, rolling will allow us to progress toward these objectives by potentially gaining more resources.

- **Playing a Knight Card:** While this can block opponents strategically or gain control of the largest army bonus, it is currently not the highest priority unless it directly prevents an opponent from achieving a key milestone (which is not indicated in the game state). Additionally, it does not contribute directly to expanding our resource base or building infrastructure.

Given the circumstances, rolling the dice is the most impactful action to optimize the early-game strategy of expanding resource diversity.
