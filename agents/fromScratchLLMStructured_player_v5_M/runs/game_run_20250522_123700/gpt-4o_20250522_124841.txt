Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 0, 0, 2, 0]
        - Settlements: [12, 21, 15]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 5
        - Roads Available: 4

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
**Action:** Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

**Justification:**  
Rolling the dice is currently the only highlighted action and is a critical step in the flow of the game. Rolling generates resources based on the numbers associated with your existing settlements (12, 21, 15). These resources are necessary to perform impactful actions that align with your priorities, such as building roads, creating additional settlements, and eventually upgrading to cities for higher VP. 

Given your minimal resource pool ([0, 0, 0, 2, 0]), rolling is required to gather diverse resources, which will allow you to progress towards your primary objective of maximizing VP. While this action has a low heuristic score (1), it is foundational and sets up subsequent decisions. Avoiding the roll would prevent future impactful actions, violating the priority of taking efficient, high-value steps. 

Thus, rolling is the optimal choice at this moment to maximize future opportunities.
