Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 1, 0, 0, 1]
        - Settlements: [12, 21, 15]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 5
        - Roads Available: 3

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
**Action:** Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

**Justification:** Rolling the dice is the only available action at this moment. This action is required to generate resources, which are critical for executing further strategies like building settlements, roads, or upgrading settlements to cities. Based on the heuristics provided, rolling has a low score of 1 due to its indirect impact on VP but remains the best action given the current game state. Future actions will depend on the resources gained from the dice roll. Prioritizing resource diversity early in the game will enable faster VP growth by allowing settlement expansion and eventual upgrades to cities.
