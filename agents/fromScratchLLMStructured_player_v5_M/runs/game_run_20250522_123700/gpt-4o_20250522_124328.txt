Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]
        - Settlements: [0, 10]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 9
        - Roads Available: 1

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Justification: There are no other available actions listed at this time besides ending the turn. Given the current resource pool of [0, 2, 0, 0, 0], this is insufficient to build a settlement (requires [1 brick, 1 wood, 1 wheat, 1 sheep]), upgrade to a city (requires [2 wheat, 3 ore]), or build additional roads (requires [1 brick, 1 wood]). Additionally, blocking opponent progress or taking any strategic moves is not feasible without actionable choices.

While ending the turn does not directly advance VP, it is the only logical move to cycle forward and gain resources on upcoming dice rolls or trades to enable impactful actions during the next turn.
