Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [1, 2, 0, 1, 0]
        - Settlements: [12, 21, 15]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 3
        - Roads Available: 0

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
### Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)  
### Justification:  
- Rolling is the only available action at this moment. It increases resource generation possibilities for yourself and potentially other players. Improving your resource pool aligns with your current priorities of expanding settlements, building roads (once resources permit), and setting up for future cities.  
- While the heuristic score is modest (1), it is still the next logical step in advancing your position. Accumulating more resources will allow you to build roads and settlements, which maximizes VP growth efficiently.  
- No other impactful alternatives exist, as you are currently constrained in terms of resource diversity (no brick or wheat) and have no roads available to expand settlements. Rolling is necessary to progress the game state toward actionable options, such as building infrastructure.
