Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]
        - Settlements: [12, 21, 15]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 5
        - Roads Available: 4

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
### Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)  
### Justification:  
Currently, your resource pool is very limited ([0, 0, 0, 1, 0]), and you need to gather resources to progress toward building settlements, roads, or upgrading settlements to cities. Rolling is the only available action that increases your resource pool. Although the heuristic score of this action is 1 (indicating average utility), it is still essential to take this step because collecting resources is a prerequisite to executing higher-impact actions.

Expanding via settlements and roads early aligns with Priority 1, but without sufficient resources, no further development or strategic blocking can occur. Therefore, rolling is the most logical action to maximize future opportunities and bring the game closer to your VP maximization goal.
