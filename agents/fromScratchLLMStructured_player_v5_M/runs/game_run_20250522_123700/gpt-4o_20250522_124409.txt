Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 3, 3, 0, 2]
        - Settlements: [0, 10]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 9
        - Roads Available: 0

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.DISCARD: 'DISCARD'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.DISCARD: 'DISCARD'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
### Action: **Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.DISCARD: 'DISCARD'>, value=None)**  
### Justification:  
Given the current game state, you have limited flexibility due to a lack of roads available and insufficient resources to build settlements or upgrade settlements to cities. Your resources are distributed as follows: [0, 3, 3, 0, 2], which do not meet the requirements of settlements (needs 1 brick and 1 wood) or cities (needs 3 ore and 2 wheat).  

At this moment, the only available action is to discard resources, which may situationally align with maintaining strategic flexibility if resource constraints are present or if a robber has been triggered (though this is implied but not explicitly stated). Since this action has a heuristic score of 1, it is the optimal choice for moving the game forward despite its limited impact on VP growth.  

Blocking opponents and making impactful plays will become possible once new actions or resources are available, particularly focusing on settlements and roads as priority 1.
