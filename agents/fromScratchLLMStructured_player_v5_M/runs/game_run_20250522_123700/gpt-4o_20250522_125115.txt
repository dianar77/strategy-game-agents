Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
        - Settlements: [4]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 1
        - Roads Available: 15

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(4, 15))
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(4, 5))
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(3, 4))

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(4, 15)): 15
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(4, 5)): 15
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(3, 4)): 15

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
Based on the current game state and heuristic scores for the available actions, we need to choose a road-building action that best aligns with the stated goal of expanding for resource diversity while maximizing future VP opportunities. Since all the actions have an equal heuristic score of 15, additional considerations such as board position, connectivity, and potential resource access would inform our decision if more information were provided.

### Chosen Action:
**Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(4, 15))**

---

### Justification:
1. **Resource Expansion:** Building a road to (4, 15) appears to extend from the settlement at node 4 to an optimal location for securing new placements, potentially providing opportunities to reach diverse resource tiles.
2. **Strategic Growth:** This action prioritizes future settlement placement, aligning with priority #1 to expand before upgrading settlements into cities.
3. **Equal Scoring:** While all available actions are scored equally (15), the position (4, 15) might offer better long-term flexibility based on board layout (even though such specific details arenâ€™t provided in the prompt).
4. **Avoid Repetition and Low Impact:** Building roads is an impactful action that avoids delaying progress, unlike unnecessary turns or less useful actions.

Thus, extending a road to (4, 15) ensures proactive VP optimization and sets the foundation for resource expansion.
