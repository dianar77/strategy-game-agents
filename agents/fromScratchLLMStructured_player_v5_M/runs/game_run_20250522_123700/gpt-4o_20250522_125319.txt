Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]
        - Settlements: [4, 0]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 3
        - Roads Available: 13

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
Based on the current game state and priorities, we need to focus on expanding resources and making progress towards building roads and settlements. However, the listed resources ([0, 0, 0, 1, 0]) suggest a lack of necessary materials for constructing roads, settlements, or cities. Additionally, there appears to be only one action available: ending the turn.

### Chosen Action:
**Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)**

### Justification:
Ending the turn is currently the only action available due to resource constraints. This allows the collection of new resources depending on dice rolls and board placement, enabling future impactful actions like building roads or settlements to expand resource diversity and maximize Victory Points (VP). The heuristic score for this action is low (1), indicating it is only marginally valuable, but there is no alternative action at this time. My strategy will shift as soon as additional resources and opportunities arise.
