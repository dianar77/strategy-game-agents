Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 0, 2, 0, 1]
        - Settlements: [8, 10]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 2
        - Roads Available: 14

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(9, 10))
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(10, 11))
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(10, 29))

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(9, 10)): 10
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(10, 11)): 10
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(10, 29)): 10

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
I'll analyze this Catanatron minigame situation carefully to select the optimal action.

Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(10, 29))

Justification: With resources [0, 0, 2, 0, 1], we have 2 brick and 1 wood, which is exactly what we need to build one road. All three road options have the same heuristic score of 10, so I need to evaluate which provides the best strategic advantage. Building the road at (10, 29) appears to open up more future expansion possibilities since it extends from our settlement at position 10 in a different direction than the other options. This creates pathway diversity from our current settlement, allowing us to reach new resource hexes more efficiently in future turns. Since expanding for resource diversity is our top priority, this road position likely gives us the best opportunity to access new potential settlement locations that would provide different resource types than our current settlements.
