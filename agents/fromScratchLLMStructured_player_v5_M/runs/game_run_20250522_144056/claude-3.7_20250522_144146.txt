Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 0, 1, 0, 2]
        - Settlements: [8, 10]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 2
        - Roads Available: 13

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
# Catanatron Move Analysis

Action: END_TURN
Justification: Based on my current resources [0, 0, 1, 0, 2] (likely [Brick, Grain, Lumber, Ore, Wool]), I don't have sufficient materials to build any structures. I have 1 lumber and 2 wool, but building a road requires brick+lumber, and settlements require brick+lumber+grain+wool. Since I cannot make any productive moves with my current resources, ending my turn is the only logical option. This will allow me to collect new resources on the next roll and potentially have enough for construction on my next turn.
