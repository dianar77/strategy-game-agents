Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 1, 1, 0, 3]
        - Settlements: [8, 10]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 3
        - Roads Available: 13

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
I'll analyze the current game state and determine the optimal action.

Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Justification: In this situation, I'm forced to end my turn as it's the only available action. Looking at my current resources [0, 1, 1, 0, 3] (which corresponds to [Brick, Wood, Sheep, Wheat, Ore]), I don't have enough of the right combination to build any meaningful structures. I need brick+wood for roads, brick+wood+sheep+wheat for settlements, or wheat+wheat+ore+ore+ore for cities. My strongest resource is ore (3), but I lack the wheat needed to build cities. Since I can't take any building actions with my current resources, ending the turn is the correct strategic choice to collect new resources and prepare for my next move. Having settlements at positions 8 and 10 gives me a foundation to build upon in future turns.
