Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 1, 0, 0, 1]
        - Settlements: [8, 10]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 3
        - Roads Available: 13

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
I see that I need to analyze the current game state and available actions to make the optimal decision in this Catanatron Minigame.

Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Justification: In this situation, I only have one action available - to end my turn. While I have 1 brick and 1 wood resource, this isn't enough to build anything (roads require 1 brick + 1 wood, settlements require 1 brick + 1 wood + 1 wheat + 1 sheep). With insufficient resources to take any building action, the optimal choice is to end my turn and gather more resources on the next roll. I already have two settlements at positions 8 and 10, giving me 3 VP total, and ending my turn will allow me to collect more resources to work toward my priority of upgrading to cities or building more roads and settlements in future turns.
