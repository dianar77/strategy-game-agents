Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 1, 1, 0, 1]
        - Settlements: [8, 10]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 3
        - Roads Available: 13

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD: 'PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD'>, value=None)
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD: 'PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD'>, value=None): 1
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}

# Evaluation of Available Actions

Looking at the current game state:
- Resources: [0, 1, 1, 0, 1] (Brick, Grain, Lumber, Ore, Wool)
- Limited resources with only one each of grain, lumber, and wool
- No immediate building opportunities with current resources

## Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD: 'PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD'>, value=None)

## Justification: 
Playing the knight card is strategically advantageous for multiple reasons:
1. It allows me to move the robber, potentially disrupting an opponent's key resource production
2. It contributes toward building the "Largest Army" (worth 2 VP) if I play more knight cards in the future
3. I may be able to steal a resource from an opponent if they have settlements/cities adjacent to where I place the robber
4. My current resources are insufficient for building anything, so this is more valuable than simply ending my turn
5. This creates momentum for future turns by potentially improving my position relative to opponents

The alternative of just ending my turn would waste an opportunity to gain strategic advantage through the knight card.
