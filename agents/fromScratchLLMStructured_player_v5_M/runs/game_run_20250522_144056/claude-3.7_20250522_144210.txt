Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 1, 2, 0, 2]
        - Settlements: [8, 10]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 2
        - Roads Available: 13

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
I'll analyze this Catanatron Minigame state carefully to make the best decision.

Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Justification: In this situation, ending my turn is the only available action. I currently have some resources ([0, 1, 2, 0, 2] which represents Brick=0, Wool=1, Lumber=2, Ore=0, Grain=2), but the game system isn't offering any building options, suggesting I don't have the correct resource combinations for building anything. With 2 settlements already placed and 13 roads available, my next priority would be to gather more resources to either build more settlements or upgrade to cities. Since I can't make any construction moves this turn, ending my turn to collect new resources on the next dice roll is the optimal play. This will position me to take more impactful actions in future turns when I have the right resource combinations.
