Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 0, 2, 1, 3]
        - Settlements: [8, 10]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 2
        - Roads Available: 13

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUY_DEVELOPMENT_CARD: 'BUY_DEVELOPMENT_CARD'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUY_DEVELOPMENT_CARD: 'BUY_DEVELOPMENT_CARD'>, value=None): 7

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
I'll analyze the current game state and available actions to determine the optimal move.

Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUY_DEVELOPMENT_CARD: 'BUY_DEVELOPMENT_CARD'>, value=None)

Justification: Buying a development card is clearly the better option here with a heuristic score of 7 compared to 1 for ending the turn. Looking at my resources [0, 0, 2, 1, 3], I have exactly what's needed to purchase a development card (1 wheat, 1 sheep, and 1 ore). Development cards provide multiple strategic advantages:

1. They might yield a Victory Point card, directly advancing my goal.
2. Knight cards allow me to move the robber and potentially earn the Largest Army bonus (2 VP).
3. Progress cards like Road Building, Year of Plenty, or Monopoly can provide powerful resource advantages.

Simply ending my turn would waste this opportunity and leave my resources vulnerable to the robber (7 rolls) or opponent's Monopoly cards. Since I can't build other structures with my current resources, buying a development card is the most efficient way to convert these resources into potential victory points and strategic options.
