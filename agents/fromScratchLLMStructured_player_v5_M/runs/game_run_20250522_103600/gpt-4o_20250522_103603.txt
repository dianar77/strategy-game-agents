========================================

Response:
To advise effectively, I need the exact board layout detailing numbers, resources, and placements. However, if you're BLUE:

1. **Prioritize scarce or high-value resources (e.g., rare Brick/Wood for roads and settlements, or Wheat for development balance).**  
2. **If resource-poor, aim for ports** (e.g., 2:1 on surplus resources).  
3. **Focus first on settlements near high-frequency hexes (5s, 6s, 8s)** to maximize production.  
4. **Expand aggressively before others block key roads**; target diverse resource pairs.  
5. **If blocked, shift to cities or development cards** for flexibility.  

Adapt dynamically based on other playersâ€™ moves.
