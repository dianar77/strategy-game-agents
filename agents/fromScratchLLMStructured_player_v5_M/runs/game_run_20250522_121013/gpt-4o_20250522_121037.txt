Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [3, 0, 0, 0, 1]
        - Settlements: [10]
        - Cities: [12]
        - Victory Points (VP): 3
        - Roads Available: 13

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
**Action:** Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

**Justification:**
Currently, rolling the dice is the only available action, and it serves as the mechanism to gather resources. You are in the early game phase with limited resources ([3, 0, 0, 0, 1]), and your priority is to collect diverse resources to enable settlement building or upgrading settlements to cities. 

Given that expanding and acquiring more resources is critical for early game growth, rolling the dice maximizes your chances of improving your resource pool and creating opportunities to build roads and settlements in future turns. Additionally, this action is not low-impact but rather essential for progressing efficiently toward your VP-maximizing goals.
