Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 0, 0, 2, 3]
        - Settlements: [16]
        - Cities: [23]
        - Victory Points (VP): 6
        - Roads Available: 9

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
**Action:** Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

**Justification:**  
Currently, rolling the dice is the only action available, and it's necessary to replenish resources in order to pursue impactful options like building settlements or upgrading to cities, which align with your priorities for maximizing VP. Without additional resources (e.g., brick, lumber, wheat, and ore), we cannot build settlements, roads, or cities. Rolling the dice therefore serves as the optimal action because it is the foundational step to progress toward improving resource diversity (Priority #1) and increasing VP efficiently.
