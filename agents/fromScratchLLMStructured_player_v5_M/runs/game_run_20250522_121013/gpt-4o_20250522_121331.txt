Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [3, 0, 0, 1, 1]
        - Settlements: []
        - Cities: [12, 10]
        - Victory Points (VP): 4
        - Roads Available: 4

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
**Action:** Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)  
**Justification:**  
In the current game state, I am constrained by both resource availability and lack of settlements to expand strategic positioning. With [3, 0, 0, 1, 1] resources, it's insufficient to build roads, settlements, or upgrade existing cities as none of these actions are possible due to their higher resource requirements. Without plausible impactful moves, the logical choice at this moment is to end the turn while preparing to accumulate further resources through dice rolls or trades to enable more meaningful actions in future turns. Avoiding low-value actions is crucial, but waiting for better opportunities is necessary to maximize potential VP gains efficiently.
