Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 5, 3, 1, 2]
        - Settlements: []
        - Cities: [23, 16]
        - Victory Points (VP): 7
        - Roads Available: 6

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
### Action:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUY_DEVELOPMENT_CARD: 'BUY_DEVELOPMENT_CARD'>, value=None)

### Justification:
The primary objective is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently, and the heuristic score for buying a development card (score = 7) outweighs all other options. Here's the reasoning step-by-step:

1. **Resource Analysis**:  
   You have sufficient resources to buy a development card (1 Ore, 1 Wheat, 1 Sheep). This aligns with utilizing resources effectively instead of stockpiling them unnecessarily.

2. **Action Prioritization**:  
   While building settlements or upgrading to cities is ideal for early/mid-game VP growth, no immediate action here allows for these. Roads are also currently irrelevant as there are no unclaimed intersections or paths for settlement expansion listed in the game state. Thus, the focus shifts to secondary actions for VP growth, like obtaining development cards.

3. **Development Cards' Benefits**:  
   Development cards can provide:
   - **Victory Points**: Adding to your VP total directly.
   - **Knights**: Contributing towards the largest army and gaining VP later.
   - Other bonuses: Road building or resource monopolization.
   Thus, they are a high-value investment when other actions are not immediately productive.

4. **Discarding Less Impactful Actions**:
   - **Maritime Trade**: Trading four bricks for one resource is inefficient and does not directly contribute to VP or strategic expansion presently.
   - **End Turn**: Wasting your turn without taking proactive actions to utilize resources is suboptimal.
   - **Play Knight Card**: No strategic benefit currently unless it helps you claim the largest army (which this situation does not suggest).

By buying a development card, you take a proactive and impactful step toward growing your Victory Points directly (through VP cards) or indirectly (through knights or other card benefits).
