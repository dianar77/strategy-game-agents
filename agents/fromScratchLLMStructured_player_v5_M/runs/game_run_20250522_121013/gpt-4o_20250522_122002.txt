Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 4, 2, 0, 3]
        - Settlements: [10, 22]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 2
        - Roads Available: 10

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
**Action**: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

**Justification**:  
Currently, the only actionable step available is rolling the dice to generate resources for both yourself and other players. Rolling is critical at this juncture because:
- You do not have sufficient resources to build a settlement, road, or upgrade a settlement to a city.
- Gaining additional resources through rolling may provide the necessary materials to pursue the priorities of settlement expansion or upgrading to cities.  
- The heuristic score for rolling indicates a baseline necessity for sustaining the game progression. While it has a lower score overall, it's a prerequisite for actions that involve accumulating resources to optimize VP growth (settlements and cities).

This action aligns with the need to make productive choices rather than halting progress or taking non-impactful steps, given the current constraints.
