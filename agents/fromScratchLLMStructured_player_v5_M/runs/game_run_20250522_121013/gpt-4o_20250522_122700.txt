Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1]
        - Settlements: [23, 16]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 2
        - Roads Available: 13

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD: 'PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD'>, value=None)
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD: 'PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD'>, value=None): 1
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
### Chosen Action:
**Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)**

### Justification:
Currently, your resource pool is limited with only 2 resources ([0, 0, 0, 1, 1]), which are insufficient to build roads or settlements. Rolling is essential to generate additional resources and determine the board state (e.g., resource allocations for yourself and opponents), increasing your chances of taking productive future actions.

- **Why not PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD?** 
  While playing a Knight card can block or steal resources from opponents, this action would offer minimal benefit now because you lack the necessary resources or development cards to directly utilize the advantage. Blocking progress at this stage is not strategically impactful, especially when resource scarcity is your primary constraint.

- **Why ROLL is optimal?**
  Rolling drives the game forward by generating resources, which aligns with Priority 1 (building settlements and roads early). Without sufficient resources, no significant progress can be made toward VP growth. Rolling maintains momentum and increases flexibility for future decision-making.
