Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 3, 3, 0, 4]
        - Settlements: []
        - Cities: [23, 16]
        - Victory Points (VP): 7
        - Roads Available: 6

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
### Action:
**Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('ORE', 'ORE', 'ORE', 'ORE', 'WHEAT'))**

### Justification:
1. **Resource Optimization for VP Growth:**
   - You currently have 0 wheat, which is crucial for building **settlements** (1 wheat, 1 wood, 1 brick, 1 sheep) or upgrading settlements to **cities** (2 wheat, 3 ore).
   - Trading 4 ore for 1 wheat balances your resource pool and enables you to plan for settlement expansion or city upgrades.

2. **Aligning with Catanatron Priorities:**
   - The top priority is building settlements and roads early. These require resource diversity (brick, wood, sheep, and wheat), and you’re missing wheat to progress. Collecting wheat now positions you to act efficiently in future turns.
   - Upgrading settlements to cities (priority #2) also requires wheat and ore. Although you don’t currently have settlements, securing wheat for this purpose keeps your path to VP growth on track.

3. **Avoiding Low-impact Actions:**
   - Ending the turn without trading wastes an opportunity to improve resource diversity.
   - Playing the knight card doesn’t contribute directly to VP growth or resource optimization at this stage.
   - Other maritime trade options (wood, sheep, brick) are less beneficial because you already have ample sheep and brick, and wood doesn’t directly aid city upgrades or settlement building.

In summary, trading for wheat supports resource diversity and keeps you aligned with priority #1, setting the stage for settlement expansion and eventual city upgrades for higher VP returns.
