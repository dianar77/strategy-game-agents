Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
        - Settlements: []
        - Cities: [23, 16]
        - Victory Points (VP): 7
        - Roads Available: 9

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
Based on the provided game state, you currently have no resources to perform impactful actions like building settlements, roads, or upgrading settlements to cities. Additionally, the only available action is to "END_TURN," which unfortunately does not contribute any immediate progress toward optimizing Victory Point growth.

### Response:
#### Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

#### Justification:
Given your resource constraints ([0, 0, 0, 0, 0]) and the lack of other actionable options, ending the turn is the only available action. While this does not strategically advance your position, it allows you to collect resources in the subsequent turn that could be used to continue expanding your settlements, building roads, or upgrading settlements to cities as per the game's priorities.
