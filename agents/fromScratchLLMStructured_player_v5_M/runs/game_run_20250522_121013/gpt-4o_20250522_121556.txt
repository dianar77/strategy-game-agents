Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [2, 0, 0, 0, 1]
        - Settlements: []
        - Cities: [12, 10]
        - Victory Points (VP): 4
        - Roads Available: 0

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)  
Justification: While ending the turn is not directly impactful, it is currently the only available action given the game state and the lack of resources or roads to perform other meaningful moves. With only [2, 0, 0, 0, 1] in resources, there are insufficient resources to build either a settlement (typically requiring 1 brick, 1 wood, 1 wheat, and 1 sheep) or upgrade a settlement to a city (requiring 3 ore and 2 wheat). Since no other actions are available that could influence progress, ending the turn is necessary to await resource production and broaden options in subsequent turns. The goal in the next turn will be to prioritize resource collection for settlement building or road placement to advance VP.
