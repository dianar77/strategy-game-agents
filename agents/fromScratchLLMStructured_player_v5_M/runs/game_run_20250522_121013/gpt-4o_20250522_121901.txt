Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 3, 3, 0, 3]
        - Settlements: [10, 22]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 2
        - Roads Available: 11

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
**Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)**

**Justification:** Based on the given game state, there are no additional actionable choices provided beyond ending the turn. While maximizing VP is the goal, resource accumulation is pivotal for building settlements, roads, and upgrading to cities. At this moment, your resource pool ([0, 3, 3, 0, 3]) does not allow for any meaningful development due to insufficient brick (0) and wheat (0). 

Ending the turn is necessary to generate more resources on subsequent rolls and pave the way toward impactful actions such as building settlements or upgrading to cities when resource conditions improve. While ending the turn has a heuristic score of 1, this action is currently unavoidable and aligns with the strategy of setting up for future VP-maximizing moves.
