Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 2, 0, 3, 2]
        - Settlements: []
        - Cities: [10, 22]
        - Victory Points (VP): 7
        - Roads Available: 3

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
Based on the provided game state and available action, it appears that you only have one available action: to end your turn. However, ending the turn unnecessarily is discouraged unless there is no meaningful progression possible based on your resources or the game state.

### Analysis

#### Resource Inventory: [0, 2, 0, 3, 2]
- This translates to:
  - **Brick**: 0
  - **Wood**: 2
  - **Sheep**: 0
  - **Wheat**: 3
  - **Ore**: 2

#### Current Board Progress:
- **Settlements**: None.
- **Cities**: Two cities already established at locations 10 and 22, maximizing their resource production.
- **VP**: 7 Victory Points.
- **Roads Available**: 3 roads can be built, opening potential new settlement placements.

#### Priorities Assessment:
1. **Settlement and Road Expansion** (Primary Priority): You lack some key resources (e.g., brick and sheep), making it impossible to construct a settlement or a road this turn. This limits your early-game expansion potential for resource diversity.
2. **Upgrading Settlements to Cities** (Secondary Priority): You don't have settlements to upgrade to cities, so this is currently not actionable.
3. **Strategic Blocking**: Since there are no concrete actions available for blocking, this priority is also not applicable in this turn.

#### Heuristic Score:
The only action available has a heuristic score of 1, which indicates the action has minimal impact on overall VP progression.

### Conclusion

Since you cannot take any meaningful actions to progress your VP objectives this turn and the only action available is to end your turn, this action is unavoidable.

---

### Response

**Action**: `Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)`

**Justification**: All other priorities (expanding settlements, upgrading to cities, or blocking opponents) are currently unachievable given the lack of necessary resources or additional actions available. Ending the turn allows you to gather new resources in the next turn, potentially enabling impactful actions.
