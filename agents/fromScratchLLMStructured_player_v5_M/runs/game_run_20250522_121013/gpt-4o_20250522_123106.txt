Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [1, 0, 0, 3, 0]
        - Settlements: []
        - Cities: [23, 16]
        - Victory Points (VP): 7
        - Roads Available: 9

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
**Action**: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)  

**Justification**:  
The current game state suggests we lack the resources to perform meaningful actions such as building a settlement, upgrading to a city, or constructing roads. Specifically, our resources ([1, 0, 0, 3, 0], corresponding to brick, lumber, ore, wheat, and sheep) are insufficient for critical actions:  
- A settlement requires [1 brick, 1 lumber, 1 wheat, 1 sheep], which we cannot afford.  
- A city requires [0 brick, 0 lumber, 3 ore, 2 wheat], but we're short of wheat (need 2, have 3).  

Given the outlined heuristic priorities, there are currently no impactful options until resource accumulation progresses through dice rolls or trading. Ending the turn here is a necessary step to collect resources or pursue other actions in subsequent turns, despite this action's low heuristic score.
