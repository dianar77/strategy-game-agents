Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 4, 0, 0, 1]
        - Settlements: [23, 16]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 2
        - Roads Available: 13

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD: 'PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD'>, value=None)
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD: 'PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD'>, value=None): 1
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
### Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

### Justification:
- **Resource Accumulation**: Rolling is the most effective option in this scenario, as you currently do not have enough resources to build a settlement, upgrade to a city, or take other impactful actions. Rolling will allow you to collect resources, which are crucial for expanding your resource diversity and progressing toward VP-building actions.
- **Heuristic Tie-Breaker**: Both actions (rolling and playing a knight card) have the same heuristic score of 1. However, since playing the knight card does not currently address your resource needs, rolling is the better option to advance your board state.
- **Minimize Low-Impact Actions**: Without a clear blocking or strategic advantage from playing the knight card, it is better to avoid an action with limited current impact. Rolling provides the opportunity to advance toward achieving priority goals such as building settlements or roads.
