Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 2, 1, 0, 2]
        - Settlements: [22]
        - Cities: [10]
        - Victory Points (VP): 5
        - Roads Available: 7

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD: 'PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD'>, value=None)
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD: 'PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD'>, value=None): 1
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
### Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD: 'PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD'>, value=None)

### Justification: 
In the current situation, both available actions have equal heuristic scores, but playing the knight card is a more impactful option compared to ending the turn. Here's why:

1. **Resource Advantage**: Playing a knight card allows us to move the robber, potentially disrupting an opponent and securing better access to key resources for us. Blocking resources for key opponents directly aligns with the priority of blocking opponent progress strategically.

2. **Largest Army Potential**: Playing knights increases our potential to claim the "Largest Army" bonus (2 Victory Points), which can be crucial in maximizing our VP efficiency over time.

3. **Low-impact Alternative**: Ending the turn without taking a significant action doesn't contribute to short-term resource advantage, VP growth, or long-term strategy. It should be avoided unless no better options are available.

Playing the knight card here provides a tangible strategic benefit, even if its impact is moderate in the current turn, whereas ending the turn achieves nothing immediately. Maximizing every opportunity to improve our position is key.
