Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 3, 0, 0, 1]
        - Settlements: [22]
        - Cities: [10]
        - Victory Points (VP): 5
        - Roads Available: 9

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
**Action:** End Turn

**Justification:**  
Currently, the game state indicates that you lack sufficient resources to take impactful actions such as building settlements or roads, both of which are critical for early resource expansion in accordance with your strategy priorities. Specifically, you are missing key resources like wood and brick needed for roads, as well as additional resources required for settlements. Without available options for tactical expansion or VP optimization, ending the turn is the only viable action. Although ending the turn is rated low on heuristic impact, it is necessary to gather more resources from subsequent rolls or trades in order to set up impactful moves in the future.
