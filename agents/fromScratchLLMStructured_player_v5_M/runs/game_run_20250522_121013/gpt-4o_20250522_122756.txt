Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 0, 1, 0, 1]
        - Settlements: [23, 16]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 2
        - Roads Available: 12

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
**Action**: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)  
**Justification**: Given the current game state, you do not have sufficient resources to perform impactful actions like building settlements, roads, or upgrading to cities. Specifically, building a settlement requires more resources (e.g., [1 wood, 1 brick, 1 wheat, 1 sheep]), which you do not currently possess. Similarly, upgrading a settlement to a city requires three ore and two wheat, which are also not available. 

Therefore, the only viable action this turn is to end the turn and wait for resource generation on future dice rolls, trading, or other opportunities to optimize your position. While itâ€™s not ideal to end turns without major actions, this is the only strategic option at this stage. Focus on gathering resources and positioning for an impactful turn next.
