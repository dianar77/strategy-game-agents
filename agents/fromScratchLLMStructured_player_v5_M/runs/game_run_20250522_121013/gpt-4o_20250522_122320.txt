Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 3, 1, 0, 1]
        - Settlements: [22]
        - Cities: [10]
        - Victory Points (VP): 5
        - Roads Available: 8

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
Based on the provided game state and goals, there are no other actions explicitly listed except `END_TURN`. However, "avoiding repetitive or low-impact actions" like unnecessarily ending turns advises against simply choosing `END_TURN` if better alternatives are theoretically possible.

### Optimal Course of Action:
Since the game state lists only `END_TURN` as an available action, no clearer options for expanding settlements, building roads, or upgrading settlements to cities are provided to consider.

---

**Action:** Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

**Justification:** There do not appear to be enough resources available to build settlements (brick and wood are required), build roads (brick and wood are required), or upgrade a settlement to a city (three ore and two wheat are needed). Additionally, no additional actions apart from ending the turn are listed as available. Therefore, ending the turn is the most viable choice at this time.
