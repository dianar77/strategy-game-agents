Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 2, 1, 0, 4]
        - Settlements: []
        - Cities: [23, 16]
        - Victory Points (VP): 7
        - Roads Available: 6

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD: 'PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD'>, value=None)
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD: 'PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD'>, value=None): 1
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
**Action:** Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)  
**Justification:** Rolling the dice is necessary to generate resources, which are pivotal for building settlements, roads, or upgrading cities. Currently, you lack the necessary resource diversity, especially for building settlements (which require combinations of wood, brick, wheat, and sheep). By rolling, you can potentially gain the resources needed to fulfill priority #1 (expand for resource diversity via settlements and roads). While playing a Knight card can strategically block opponents, it's not your primary goal right now, particularly since the Knight card doesn't increase VP or provide resources directly. Maximizing your resource pool through rolling keeps the game moving towards VP efficiency.
