Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]
        - Settlements: []
        - Cities: [23, 16]
        - Victory Points (VP): 9
        - Roads Available: 7

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
Given the current game state and the absence of actionable options for expanding settlements, upgrading cities, or building roads (assuming resources are too sparse), I can only make a choice within the constraints of what's available. Here's the response:

---

**Action**: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

**Justification**:  
At this point, no impactful actions are available due to insufficient resources (current resources: [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]). Building settlements, roads, or upgrading to cities is not viable. While ending the turn is not ideal, it allows me to collect resources in the next turn and eventually pursue higher-impact actions to maximize VP growth. Ending the turn minimizes stagnation, as no other meaningful options exist. If other actions become available later, they will be prioritized to align with maximizing VP efficiently.
