Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [1, 0, 0, 4, 3]
        - Settlements: []
        - Cities: [23, 16]
        - Victory Points (VP): 9
        - Roads Available: 7

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'BRICK'))
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'WOOD'))
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'ORE'))
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'SHEEP'))

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'BRICK')): 1
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'WOOD')): 1
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'ORE')): 1
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'SHEEP')): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
### Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'BRICK'))

### Justification:
1. **Expanding with Settlements and Roads (Priority 1):**
   - Current resources are [1, 0, 0, 4, 3] (1 Brick, 0 Lumber, 0 Ore, 4 Wheat, 3 Sheep). 
   - To build a settlement (1 Brick, 1 Lumber, 1 Wheat, 1 Sheep), we are missing Lumber but are also in danger of lacking Brick if used for other purposes. 
   - By trading 4 surplus Wheat for 1 Brick, we safeguard future Brick needs for settlement and road construction.

2. **Avoiding Low-Impact Actions:**
   - Ending the turn without acting wastes an opportunity to prepare for settlement or road building.
   - None of the other MARITIME_TRADE options (e.g., trading Wheat for Wood) immediately enable us to progress toward building despite being theoretically equal in heuristic, since the only strategic move at this moment is ensuring supplies of scarce resources.

3. **Preparation for Next Steps:**
   - While Brick is apparently less urgent than Lumber, securing it now ensures flexibility when resources shift.
   - This action maximizes future gains, sets up for building infrastructure, and prevents stagnation in development.
