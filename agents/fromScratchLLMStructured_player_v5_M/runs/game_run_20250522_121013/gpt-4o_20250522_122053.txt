Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]
        - Settlements: [10, 22]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 4
        - Roads Available: 9

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
Given your current game state and the available action options, here’s the decision based on the rules and priorities:

### **Action**: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

### **Justification**:
1. **Resource Constraints**: Your resource pool is currently very limited ([0, 2, 0, 0, 0]). You don’t have the necessary resources to build anything (settlements, roads, or upgrades), leaving you unable to take actions that directly contribute to Victory Points in this turn.
   
2. **Strategic Planning**:
   - Priority 1 is to build settlements and roads early, but this cannot be pursued right now due to a lack of resources.
   - Priority 2 involves upgrading to cities for VP gains, but this is also unavailable due to insufficient resources.
   - Priority 3 is about blocking opponents, but no actions for that are described as available in this turn.

3. **Avoiding "No Action" Stalling**: In this situation, ending your turn is not repetitive or low-impact—it's a required move to progress the game and collect new resources on the next roll. Waiting for a new resource roll gives you the opportunity to acquire resources that enable impactful actions in future turns.

Without further options for proactive play, ending the turn is the most optimal choice. This will allow you to move toward conditions for advancing your VP efficiently in the following turns.
