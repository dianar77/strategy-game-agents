Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
        - Settlements: [23, 16]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 2
        - Roads Available: 12

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD: 'PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD'>, value=None)
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD: 'PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD'>, value=None): 1
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
**Action:** Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)  

**Justification:**  
Currently, you lack resources ([0, 0, 0, 0, 0]), which prevents you from building settlements, roads, or upgrading settlements to cities. These are the highest-priority actions for optimizing VP growth. The heuristic scores for both available actions are identical (1), meaning neither action provides a distinct advantage in the immediate turn.

Playing the knight card in this situation does not provide strategic value, as you are not in a position to block an opponent's progress or claim Largest Army. Moreover, it does not help you generate resources or directly contribute to VP growth right now. Thus, it is more strategic to save the knight card for a moment when it can have a greater impact, such as blocking a key opponent resource or securing Largest Army.

Given the lack of impactful options, the best course of action is to end the turn, allowing for a resource roll on the next turn to potentially gain resources and reassess better actions for progress.
