Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [2, 0, 0, 2, 0]
        - Settlements: []
        - Cities: [12, 10]
        - Victory Points (VP): 4
        - Roads Available: 8

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
**Action:** Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

**Justification:**  
Given the current game state, no other actionable options are listed besides ending the turn. While ending the turn is a low-impact move, it is necessary here due to the lack of sufficient resources to build roads, settlements, or cities. With 2 brick, 2 wood, and no other resources available, you don't have the required combinations to perform VP-progressing actions (e.g., building settlements requires wood, brick, wheat, and sheep, and cities require wheat and ore). Ending the turn is therefore the only viable choice, allowing for resource generation during the next rounds. 

For future moves, focus on collecting sheep, wheat, and ore for settlements and city upgrades while leveraging available resources efficiently to build roads for expansion and strategic blocking. Plan to diversify resources soon to ensure long-term success in VP accumulation.
