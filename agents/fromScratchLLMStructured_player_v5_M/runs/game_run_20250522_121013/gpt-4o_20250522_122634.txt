Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 3, 1, 0, 5]
        - Settlements: [23, 16]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 2
        - Roads Available: 13

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('ORE', 'ORE', 'ORE', 'ORE', 'WHEAT'))
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('ORE', 'ORE', 'ORE', 'ORE', 'WOOD'))
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('ORE', 'ORE', 'ORE', 'ORE', 'SHEEP'))
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('ORE', 'ORE', 'ORE', 'ORE', 'BRICK'))

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('ORE', 'ORE', 'ORE', 'ORE', 'WHEAT')): 1
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('ORE', 'ORE', 'ORE', 'ORE', 'WOOD')): 1
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('ORE', 'ORE', 'ORE', 'ORE', 'SHEEP')): 1
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('ORE', 'ORE', 'ORE', 'ORE', 'BRICK')): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
### Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('ORE', 'ORE', 'ORE', 'ORE', 'WHEAT'))

### Justification:
1. **Evaluate Current Resources**:
   - Resource state: [0 (Brick), 3 (Wood), 1 (Sheep), 0 (Wheat), 5 (Ore)].
   - Settlement goal: To build a settlement, you need [1 Brick, 1 Wood, 1 Sheep, 1 Wheat].
   - You currently lack Wheat and Brick to construct another settlement.

2. **Maritime Trade to Gain Wheat**:
   - Trading 4 Ore for 1 Wheat addresses the specific shortage of Wheat.
   - With the current resource stock, this action brings us closer to having what’s needed for an additional settlement, prioritizing **expansion for resource diversity** (Priority #1).

3. **Avoiding Low-Impact Actions**:
   - Ending the turn without trading wastes an opportunity to optimize resources.
   - Other trades (e.g., for Wood, Sheep, or Brick) are premature because you don’t yet have the Wheat, which is currently the bottleneck.

4. **Preparing for Efficient Settlement Building**:
   - After this trade, you'll have [0 Brick, 3 Wood, 1 Sheep, 1 Wheat, 1 Ore].
   - On the next turn, focus on acquiring Brick (via rolls or further trades), which will complete your settlement requirement.

By taking this action, you are advancing toward building your third settlement, directly increasing VP and adhering to the goal of resource diversity early in the game.
