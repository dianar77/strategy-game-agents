Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [1, 0, 0, 3, 0]
        - Settlements: []
        - Cities: [12, 10]
        - Victory Points (VP): 4
        - Roads Available: 3

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
Action: None (Evaluate situation further)

Justification: The current resources [1, 0, 0, 3, 0] (assuming corresponding to brick, wood, wheat, ore, sheep) do not appear sufficient for impactful actions such as building roads or settlements. The only available action listed is ending the turn, which is a low-impact option with a heuristic score of 1. Ending the turn unnecessarily should be avoided unless there truly are no other strategic moves available. 

If there is an opportunity to trade resources, evaluate trades to acquire missing materials for settlement or road building. Clarify or share additional available actions (e.g., building roads, trading resources, or blocking opponents) to help optimize the game state toward expanding or upgrading for Victory Points.
