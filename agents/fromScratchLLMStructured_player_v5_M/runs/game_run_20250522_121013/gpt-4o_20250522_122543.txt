Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 2, 0, 1, 0]
        - Settlements: []
        - Cities: [10, 22]
        - Victory Points (VP): 7
        - Roads Available: 3

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
**Action:** Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

**Justification:** 

Currently, the game state indicates I have limited resources ([0, 2, 0, 1, 0]), which suggests insufficient material to build settlements, roads, or upgrade settlements to cities. The only available action is to roll the dice, which will provide additional resources for future turns, allowing me to work toward my top priority of building settlements and roads to expand and eventually upgrade them to cities for Victory Point (VP) growth.

Rolling the dice is currently the only beneficial action to break the resource bottleneck and progress strategically toward maximizing VP, aligning with the game priorities.
