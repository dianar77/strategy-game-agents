Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [2, 0, 0, 1, 3]
        - Settlements: [10]
        - Cities: [12]
        - Victory Points (VP): 3
        - Roads Available: 11

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
Based on the current game state you provided, there seems to be a lack of other actionable options besides ending the turn. Unfortunately, the action list doesn't directly provide alternatives like building settlements, roads, or upgrading settlements to cities, which are typically key for VP maximization. You may not yet have access to those due to insufficient resources or constraints in the game's mechanics.

However, here's the required response:

### Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

### Justification:
Ending the turn is currently the optimal (and only) available action given:
1. **Resource Constraint:** The resource pool ([2, 0, 0, 1, 3]) likely doesn't meet the requirements for building settlements (requires 1 wood, 1 brick, 1 wheat, 1 sheep) or upgrading settlements to cities (requires 2 wheat, 3 ore).
2. **Strategic Priority:** Expanding via settlement or road building is prioritized early, but cannot be pursued this turn without adequate resources. Blocking opponents or alternative VP-generating strategies are unavailable.
3. **Action Availability:** The game state explicitly indicates that the only actionable option is to end the turn. While ending the turn has a low heuristic score of 1, no alternatives are provided for this turn.

Ending the turn allows resource generation from subsequent rolls and positions you to take more impactful actions in future turns when you have more resources to optimize VP growth efficiently.
