Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 3, 0, 3, 2]
        - Settlements: [23, 16]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 5
        - Roads Available: 9

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
Action: None (no chosen action from provided game state)  

Justification: Based on the details of the game state and available actions, the only action presented is `Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)`. This action scores poorly (heuristic score of 1) and doesn't contribute directly to maximizing Victory Points (VP), expanding resource diversity, or blocking opponents. Without additional impactful actions or the resources necessary to pursue options like building settlements, roads, or upgrading to cities, the optimal course of action would require waiting for more relevant actions to emerge. Ending the turn may be necessary if no other choices are provided, but it is not strategically advantageous here. Additional context with actionable opportunities, if available, would allow for a more effective decision.
