Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [1, 0, 1, 0, 1]
        - Settlements: []
        - Cities: [10, 22]
        - Victory Points (VP): 6
        - Roads Available: 6

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
Based on the information provided:

### Analysis:
1. **Resources**: You currently have `[1, 0, 1, 0, 1]`, which corresponds to 1 brick, 0 lumber, 1 ore, 0 grain, and 1 wool. This is insufficient to build a settlement (requires 1 brick, 1 lumber, 1 grain, and 1 wool) or upgrade to a city (requires 2 grain and 3 ore). You need to acquire more resources to take impactful actions.

2. **Settlements and Cities**: With no settlements on the board, expanding to build new settlements should be the next goal (priority 1). Settlements unlock resource diversity and increase VP.

3. **Victory Points (VP)**: You are at 6 VP currently. For significant VP growth and board control, settlements should be prioritized.

4. **Roads**: You have 6 available roads, which is critical for reaching new settlement spots. However, roads alone do not yield VP, so they should serve as a setup for settlement placement.

5. **Available Action**: The only action currently available is `ROLL`. This is a mandatory action at the start of a turn to generate resources and/or activate robber mechanics, which are prerequisites for any meaningful moves.

### Decision:
#### Action: `Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)`

#### Justification:
- Rolling is a **necessary action** to generate resources. Without rolling, the game cannot progress, and no new opportunities or actionable decisions can arise.
- Resource generation is essential to meet your immediate goal of building settlements. Specifically, you need lumber and grain, which are currently missing from your inventory.
- Although the heuristic score for the ROLL action is low (1), it is the **only available action**, and skipping it would unnecessarily stall the game. Once resources are collected, you can assess further steps toward building roads and settlements.
