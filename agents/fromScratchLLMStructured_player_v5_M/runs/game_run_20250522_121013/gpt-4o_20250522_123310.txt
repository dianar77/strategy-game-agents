Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 5, 2, 0, 1]
        - Settlements: []
        - Cities: [23, 16]
        - Victory Points (VP): 7
        - Roads Available: 6

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
Given the current game state and priorities, I'll evaluate the possible actions to determine the optimal choice.

### Analysis:
1. **Current Resources**: [0 BRICK, 5 WHEAT, 2 WOOD, 0 ORE, 1 SHEEP]
   - At this time, you lack BRICK, which is necessary for building roads and settlements. Maritime trade could help acquire a BRICK or another needed resource.
   - WHEAT (5) is abundant, allowing for potential trades to diversify resources.
2. **Victory Points and Expansion**:
   - With no available settlements and only cities on the board, the highest priority should be either expanding for resource diversity (building settlements or roads) or preparing for further upgrades.
   - Roads are a prerequisite for building new settlements, so gathering BRICK and WOOD should be prioritized.

3. **Available Actions**:
   - **Play Knight Card**: No immediate benefit given the board state.
   - **End Turn**: Premature and does not advance the game.
   - **Maritime Trade for SHEEP, WHEAT, WOOD, ORE**: Not helpful unless a settlement or road can be built this turn.
   - **Maritime Trade for BRICK**: Logical action, as it sets up road building. Roads are a critical step toward building settlements, which directly increases VP.

4. **Goal Alignment**:
   - Building roads and settlements aligns with Priority 1 (expansion for resource diversity).
   - Maritime Trade for BRICK stands out as the optimal action, as you can then accumulate resources for roads and settlements.

### Recommendation:

**Action**: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('BRICK', 'BRICK', 'BRICK', 'BRICK', 'BRICK'))

**Justification**:
- Trading WHEAT to acquire BRICK allows you to prepare for road construction immediately or in future turns.
- Roads are essential for expanding to new settlement locations, which grants resource diversity and VP growth.
- This action adheres to your goal of efficiently maximizing VP by prioritizing expansion over ending the turn or performing low-impact actions.
