Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 1, 0, 3, 1]
        - Settlements: [23, 16]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 2
        - Roads Available: 11

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD: 'PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD'>, value=None)
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD: 'PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD'>, value=None): 1
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
**Action:** Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)  
**Justification:**  

Rolling the dice is the most logical and impactful choice at this moment for several reasons:  
1. **Resource Accumulation**: With only [0, 1, 0, 3, 1] resources, you are far from being able to build a settlement (requires [1, 1, 1, 1, 0]) or other significant constructions. Rolling the dice provides an opportunity to gather more resources and move closer to your primary goal of expanding with settlements and roads.  
2. **Early Game Priority**: As per the priority list, early expansion through settlement and road building is crucial to gain resource diversity and map control. Rolling the dice is the first step toward acquiring the resources necessary to achieve this.  
3. **Knights are Secondary**: Playing a knight card has a low heuristic score (1) here, as there is no immediate strategic opportunity to block opponents or steal meaningful resources. Building roads or settlements still takes precedence over deploying knights at this stage of the game.  
4. **No Other Productive Actions**: You can't use your current resources for any impactful builds. Rolling enables progress toward accumulating resources.
