Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 2, 1, 0, 2]
        - Settlements: [10, 22]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 2
        - Roads Available: 10

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
Action: None (Action not specified due to missing impactful choices in the provided game state)

Justification: Based on the game state and priorities, no impactful action is currently available to optimize VP growth or strategic positioning. Ending the turn unnecessarily would provide minimal benefit, as it has the lowest heuristic score (1). With only five resources ([0, 2, 1, 0, 2]) and 10 roads available, the player currently lacks the resources to build settlements, roads, or cities. The most efficient course of action is to either wait for a new opportunity to obtain resources or evaluate if additional actions could be unlocked moving forward. Since no such impactful options are presented in the current game state, action selection is deferred until the game state changes.
