Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 6, 0, 2, 2]
        - Settlements: []
        - Cities: [10, 22]
        - Victory Points (VP): 7
        - Roads Available: 3

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('BRICK', 'BRICK', 'BRICK', 'BRICK', 'SHEEP'))
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('BRICK', 'BRICK', 'BRICK', 'BRICK', 'WHEAT'))
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('BRICK', 'BRICK', 'BRICK', 'BRICK', 'WOOD'))
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('BRICK', 'BRICK', 'BRICK', 'BRICK', 'ORE'))

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('BRICK', 'BRICK', 'BRICK', 'BRICK', 'SHEEP')): 1
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('BRICK', 'BRICK', 'BRICK', 'BRICK', 'WHEAT')): 1
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('BRICK', 'BRICK', 'BRICK', 'BRICK', 'WOOD')): 1
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('BRICK', 'BRICK', 'BRICK', 'BRICK', 'ORE')): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
### Action: `Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('BRICK', 'BRICK', 'BRICK', 'BRICK', 'WHEAT'))`

### Justification: 
Currently, you have **6 brick, 2 wheat, and 2 ore**, which do not allow you to take impactful actions such as building settlements or upgrading to cities. However, by trading 4 brick for 1 wheat, you will accumulate **3 wheat**. This positions you to take meaningful future actions, such as:
  - Saving resources to upgrade a settlement into a **city** (requires 2 wheat and 3 ore, for which you're only one wheat short after this trade).
  - Broadening your resource base for future opportunities.

None of the other maritime trades (e.g., for sheep, wood, or ore) moves you meaningfully closer to your goals. Ending the turn also offers no progress. Therefore, trading for wheat is the optimal choice for efficiently advancing toward your next resource milestone and maximizing VP efficiently.
