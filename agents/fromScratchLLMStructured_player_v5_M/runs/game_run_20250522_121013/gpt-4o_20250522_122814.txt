Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 0, 2, 0, 4]
        - Settlements: [23, 16]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 2
        - Roads Available: 12

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD: 'PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD'>, value=None)
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('ORE', 'ORE', 'ORE', 'ORE', 'WHEAT'))
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('ORE', 'ORE', 'ORE', 'ORE', 'WOOD'))
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('ORE', 'ORE', 'ORE', 'ORE', 'SHEEP'))
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('ORE', 'ORE', 'ORE', 'ORE', 'BRICK'))

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD: 'PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD'>, value=None): 1
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('ORE', 'ORE', 'ORE', 'ORE', 'WHEAT')): 1
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('ORE', 'ORE', 'ORE', 'ORE', 'WOOD')): 1
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('ORE', 'ORE', 'ORE', 'ORE', 'SHEEP')): 1
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('ORE', 'ORE', 'ORE', 'ORE', 'BRICK')): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
### Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('ORE', 'ORE', 'ORE', 'ORE', 'BRICK'))  
### Justification:  
Currently, your resource pool consists of `[0, 0, 2, 0, 4]`, representing no wheat, no wood, 2 sheep, no brick, and 4 ore. This distribution leaves you unable to take impactful actions like building more roads or settlements (which require brick and wood). Since the ultimate goal is VP maximization, your priority should be to trade surplus ore (4 ore) for missing critical resources that would enable settlement expansion.  

Among the available maritime trades, trading 4 ore for *brick* is the most impactful, as brick is essential for roads and settlements. Acquiring brick moves you closer to fulfilling the resource requirements to build either a new settlement or a road to expand your territory. Subsequent actions could involve gathering or trading for wood and other needed resources.  

While all maritime trades here have the same heuristic score (1), choosing brick prioritizes progress toward early-game strategic goals (expanding for resource diversity and potential settlement building). Ending the turn prematurely or playing a knight card would not advance your position effectively at this stage.
