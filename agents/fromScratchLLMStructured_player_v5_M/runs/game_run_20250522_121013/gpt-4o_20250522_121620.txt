Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [4, 0, 0, 1, 1]
        - Settlements: []
        - Cities: [12, 10]
        - Victory Points (VP): 4
        - Roads Available: 0

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('WOOD', 'WOOD', 'WOOD', 'WOOD', 'SHEEP'))
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('WOOD', 'WOOD', 'WOOD', 'WOOD', 'BRICK'))
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('WOOD', 'WOOD', 'WOOD', 'WOOD', 'WHEAT'))
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('WOOD', 'WOOD', 'WOOD', 'WOOD', 'ORE'))

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('WOOD', 'WOOD', 'WOOD', 'WOOD', 'SHEEP')): 1
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('WOOD', 'WOOD', 'WOOD', 'WOOD', 'BRICK')): 1
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('WOOD', 'WOOD', 'WOOD', 'WOOD', 'WHEAT')): 1
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('WOOD', 'WOOD', 'WOOD', 'WOOD', 'ORE')): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
Here’s an analysis of the given game state and heuristic scores:

**Current state:**
- **Resources:** 4 Wood, 1 Sheep, 1 Ore (you lack both Wheat and Brick for building settlements or cities).
- **Settlements:** None so far.
- **Cities:** You have 2 cities located on hexes 12 and 10. 
- **VP:** 4 (you need to expand settlements to raise this effectively).
- **Roads Available:** 0 (cannot expand settlements currently without building roads).

**Analysis of Actions:**
1. **End Turn:** Low impact. No development or resource optimization occurs by ending the turn with no strategic advantage.
2. **Maritime Trade (Wood → Other Resources):** Each action allows exchanging 4 Wood at a 4:1 ratio for Sheep, Brick, Wheat, or Ore.
   - **Sheep:** Assuming settlements are a priority, you’d need Brick and Wheat, not Sheep at this point.
   - **Brick:** This resource is crucial for building roads. Roads enable additional settlement placement, a top priority early in the game. Trading for Brick seems impactful.
   - **Wheat:** Vital for upgrading to cities or building settlements. However, without immediate access to Brick for building a road or settlement, it’s less urgent than Brick at this stage.
   - **Ore:** You already have 1 Ore, and cities are a later priority; adding Ore now would not immediately progress your goal.
   
Trading Wood for Brick gives you the best chance to build roads, expand settlements, and increase VP. The heuristic scores might be equal numerically, but strategic context makes this trade more impactful.

**Chosen Action:**
```plaintext
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('WOOD', 'WOOD', 'WOOD', 'WOOD', 'BRICK'))
```

**Justification:**
Prioritizing settlements via road building is your current top goal under the strategic framework. Trading 4 Wood for Brick is the optimal move because:
1. It equips you to work toward building roads and settlements.
2. It aligns with the priority to expand for resource diversity and settlement placement.
3. Brick is the immediate limiting resource for progressing toward VP growth.
