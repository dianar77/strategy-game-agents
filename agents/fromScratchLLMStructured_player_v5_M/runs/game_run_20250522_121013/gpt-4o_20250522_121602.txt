Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [1, 0, 0, 0, 5]
        - Settlements: []
        - Cities: [12, 10]
        - Victory Points (VP): 4
        - Roads Available: 0

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('ORE', 'ORE', 'ORE', 'ORE', 'WHEAT'))
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('ORE', 'ORE', 'ORE', 'ORE', 'WOOD'))
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('ORE', 'ORE', 'ORE', 'ORE', 'SHEEP'))
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('ORE', 'ORE', 'ORE', 'ORE', 'BRICK'))

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('ORE', 'ORE', 'ORE', 'ORE', 'WHEAT')): 1
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('ORE', 'ORE', 'ORE', 'ORE', 'WOOD')): 1
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('ORE', 'ORE', 'ORE', 'ORE', 'SHEEP')): 1
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('ORE', 'ORE', 'ORE', 'ORE', 'BRICK')): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
### Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('ORE', 'ORE', 'ORE', 'ORE', 'WHEAT'))

### Justification: 
The current game state shows that you lack the necessary resources to take meaningful actions like building settlements or roads. However, you're holding a significant surplus of ORE (5 units), which aligns with the objective of converting those resources into more versatile or immediately useful ones. Among the available maritime trade actions, trading 4 ORE for 1 WHEAT is the most valuable choice for the following reasons:

1. **Priority Alignment**: WHEAT is essential for upgrading settlements to cities, one of your primary strategies for gaining Victory Points (VP). Adding WHEAT to your pool (resources: [1, 0, 0, 1, 1]) brings you closer to the requirements for upgrading a settlement (2 WHEAT + 3 ORE).
   
2. **Resource Utilization**: Currently, your ORE is excess and sitting idle. By trading ORE for WHEAT, you convert excess resources into progress toward a higher-impact action (e.g., a city upgrade).

3. **Avoiding Low-impact Actions**: Ending the turn without trading would leave your turn resource-neutral, essentially wasting this opportunity to move closer to your goals (VP growth).

4. **Future Flexibility**: Gaining WHEAT provides flexibility to respond to future game states since WHEAT is a critical resource for multiple actions, including settlements and cities.

By taking this action, you strategically prepare for a high-impact move in subsequent turns while avoiding stagnation in your progress.
