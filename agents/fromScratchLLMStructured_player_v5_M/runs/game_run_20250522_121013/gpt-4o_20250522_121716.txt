Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [3, 1, 0, 0, 3]
        - Settlements: []
        - Cities: [12, 10]
        - Victory Points (VP): 4
        - Roads Available: 0

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
**Action:** Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)  
**Justification:** At the current state, there are no available actions beyond ending the turn. With Resources: [3, 1, 0, 0, 3], no settlements or roads can be built because these actions generally require specific combinations of raw materials such as wood, brick, wheat, and sheep. The lack of roads also prevents expanding for resource diversity. Since upgrading to a city further requires at least 3 ore and 2 wheat (for which we don't have enough wheat), there are insufficient resources to perform impactful actions now. Ending the turn is the only choice, allowing resource collection during the opponent's rolls to better position for future builds or upgrades. While ending the turn isn't ideal for VP progression, it sets up potential actions during the next phase.
