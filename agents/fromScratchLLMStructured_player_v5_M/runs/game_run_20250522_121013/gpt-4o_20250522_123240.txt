Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 2, 1, 0, 2]
        - Settlements: []
        - Cities: [23, 16]
        - Victory Points (VP): 7
        - Roads Available: 6

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
Based on the provided game state and actions, it seems like the only explicitly provided available action is to *END_TURN*. However, since you've emphasized avoiding repetitive or low-impact actions, an optimal response would involve a strategic assessment of other potential actions that could progress the game state efficiently toward gaining VP.

However, since there are no other explicit actions (e.g., building a road/settlement or upgrading a city), I would consider using the next turn to focus on accumulating resources for impactful moves like building settlements or roads.

**Action:** `Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)`

**Justification:**  
- Currently, your resources ([0, 2, 1, 0, 2]) are insufficient for building a settlement (requires 1 Brick, 1 Wood, 1 Wheat, and 1 Sheep) or a road (requires 1 Brick and 1 Wood).  
- Upgrading a settlement to a city is not possible as you have no settlements yet to upgrade, and cities require additional Wheat and Ore.   
- With no impactful actions currently available, ending the turn is necessary to collect resources during the next dice roll. This will set up the potential to construct roads/settlements in future turns for expansion and eventual VP growth.

Strategically, prioritize accumulating resources next to focus on building roads and settlements in upcoming turns.
