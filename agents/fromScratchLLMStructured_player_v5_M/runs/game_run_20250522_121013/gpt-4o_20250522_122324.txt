Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 3, 1, 1, 1]
        - Settlements: [22]
        - Cities: [10]
        - Victory Points (VP): 5
        - Roads Available: 8

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD: 'PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD'>, value=None)
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD: 'PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD'>, value=None): 1
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
### Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

### Justification:
Rolling the dice is necessary to progress the game by gaining new resources, especially given the current state of the game:

1. **Resource Diversity**: Your current resources ([0, 3, 1, 1, 1]) are insufficient to build a settlement (requires 1 brick, 1 wood, 1 wheat, 1 sheep) or a road (requires 1 brick, 1 wood). Rolling could potentially provide the additional resources needed to take impactful actions like building roads or settlements, following Priority 1.

2. **No Immediate Utility for Knight Card**: Playing the knight card would only block opponents but does not immediately improve your resource situation or help advance towards building settlements, cities, or roads. It has a heuristic score of 1, but since no immediate blocking is obviously beneficial here, rolling takes precedence.

3. **Maximize Impact**: Rolling the dice introduces resource gains and new opportunities, which are essential to progress toward building settlements or upgrading to cities for higher VP, aligning with game priorities.

Thus, rolling is the optimal choice to gather resources and unlock greater strategic flexibility.
