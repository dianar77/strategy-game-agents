Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [4, 0, 0, 4, 1]
        - Settlements: []
        - Cities: [12, 10]
        - Victory Points (VP): 4
        - Roads Available: 7

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
### Action: **Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('WOOD', 'WOOD', 'WOOD', 'WOOD', 'BRICK'))**

### Justification:
1. **Objective Prioritization**: The top priority is to build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity. Currently, you lack **brick**, which is essential for building roads. Trading 4 wood for 1 brick is the best action that aligns with this goal.

2. **Resource Management**: You have an adequate amount of wood (4), but no brick (0). This trade not only optimizes your resources but also enables you to proceed towards building roads, which will allow you to claim new settlement spots for future expansion.

3. **Strategic Advantage**: While other trades or ending the turn are possible actions, they do not contribute significantly to your immediate strategic goals. This trade prepares you to take impactful actions in subsequent turns.

4. **Heuristic Improvement**: Although all heuristic scores are currently low (1), acquiring brick sets you up for meaningful actions next round. For example:
   - Build a road (requires wood and brick).
   - Move toward settlements on well-placed hexes for VP growth and resource diversity.

By avoiding a passive turn and making this trade, you make progress toward efficient VP maximization.
