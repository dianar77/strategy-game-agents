Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 6, 2, 0, 1]
        - Settlements: [22]
        - Cities: [10]
        - Victory Points (VP): 5
        - Roads Available: 8

        Available Actions:

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('BRICK', 'BRICK', 'BRICK', 'BRICK', 'SHEEP')): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
### Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('BRICK', 'BRICK', 'BRICK', 'BRICK', 'WHEAT'))

### Justification:
Currently, resources are limited, and the available Maritime Trade actions allow conversion of excess BRICK into other resources. With **6 BRICK**, trading 4 BRICK for **WHEAT** is strategic because:

1. **Priority 1: Build settlements**  
   Settlements require **WHEAT**, **WOOD**, **BRICK**, and **SHEEP**. You are missing WHEAT to build additional settlements, so acquiring it helps progress toward this objective.

2. **Resource diversity**  
   Trading BRICK (an abundant resource) for WHEAT increases resource diversity, paving the way for settlement construction, which is crucial for expanding raw material production. Settlements also directly increase Victory Points.

3. **Preparation for upgrading settlements to cities (Priority 2)**  
   Cities require WHEAT and ORE. Gaining WHEAT now can help both settlement expansion and future upgrades to cities.

4. **Avoiding End Turn**  
   Ending the turn without using the Maritime Trade would waste your surplus BRICK and fail to advance the strategy for maximizing VP efficiently.

BRICK->WHEAT is favored over alternatives like BRICK->SHEEP or BRICK->WOOD, as you already have sufficient SHEEP and WOOD resources to prioritize settlement construction after this trade.
