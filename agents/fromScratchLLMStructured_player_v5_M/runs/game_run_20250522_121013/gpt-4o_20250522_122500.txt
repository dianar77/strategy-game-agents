Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [1, 0, 1, 0, 3]
        - Settlements: []
        - Cities: [10, 22]
        - Victory Points (VP): 6
        - Roads Available: 4

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)  
Justification: 
Given the current game state, no other actionable opportunities are presented beyond ending the turn. Resource diversity is insufficient to build settlements, roads, or upgrade to cities. The lack of actions in the provided state framework implies that ending the turn is the only viable choice to progress the game and accumulate new resources. While this is a low-impact action, it sets up future possibilities when resources refresh. Would recommend focusing future actions on acquiring resources required for expansion.
