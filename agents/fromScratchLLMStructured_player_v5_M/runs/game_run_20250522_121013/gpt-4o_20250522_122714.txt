Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [1, 0, 0, 0, 1]
        - Settlements: [23, 16]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 2
        - Roads Available: 13

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)  
Justification:  
Currently, you lack the necessary resources to take meaningful actions like building roads, settlements, or cities. None of the available Monopoly plays appear impactful, as there is no information to suggest which resource is abundant among opponents or beneficial to your immediate strategy. Similarly, playing a Knight card does not seem tactically advantageous without a clear opportunity to block opponents or position yourself better. Thus, ending the turn is the optimal decision to cycle for better resources and position yourself for future VP-building opportunities.
