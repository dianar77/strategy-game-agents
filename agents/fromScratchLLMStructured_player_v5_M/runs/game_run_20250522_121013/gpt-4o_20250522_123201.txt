Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [1, 0, 0, 1, 3]
        - Settlements: []
        - Cities: [23, 16]
        - Victory Points (VP): 9
        - Roads Available: 7

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
### Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

### Justification:
Currently, the resources in your inventory ([1, 0, 0, 1, 3]) are insufficient to take actions that directly result in VP growth, such as building settlements (which likely require wood, brick, wheat, and sheep) or upgrading settlements to cities (which require wheat and ore). Rolling the dice is the most impactful action at this point because it provides the opportunity to gather additional resources based on your current board setup. These resources can be used to build roads or settlements, both of which align with the strategic priority to expand for resource diversity and maximize VP.

With heuristic score 1, this action is optimal since it opens up possibilities for future impactful moves while the alternatives (ending the turn or taking no action) would be non-progressive toward VP optimization.
