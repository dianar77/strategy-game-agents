Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 2, 0, 4, 1]
        - Settlements: []
        - Cities: [12, 10]
        - Victory Points (VP): 4
        - Roads Available: 7

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'BRICK'))
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'WOOD'))
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'ORE'))
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'SHEEP'))

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'BRICK')): 1
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'WOOD')): 1
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'ORE')): 1
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'SHEEP')): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
### Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'BRICK'))

### Justification:
To progress toward your objective of maximizing Victory Points and efficiently expanding early, you need to prioritize building settlements and roads to gain resource diversity. Currently, you have no settlements, and your resource balance is insufficient to construct either a settlement (requiring BRICK + WOOD + SHEEP + WHEAT) or a road (requiring BRICK + WOOD).

The most logical move is to perform a maritime trade to obtain BRICK, as it is a scarce resource (you have 0 BRICK) required for constructing roads or settlements. Among the options presented, trading 4 WHEAT for BRICK addresses this scarcity and sets you up for future actions in alignment with your priorities. Since all heuristic scores for actions are equal (1), selecting any action that progresses your goal materially is preferred over ending your turn.

By acquiring BRICK, you can potentially build roads or settlements in subsequent turns, which will expand your resource diversity and lay the groundwork for victory point growth.
