Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 2, 0, 3, 1]
        - Settlements: [23, 16]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 5
        - Roads Available: 9

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
### Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

### Justification:
The current action available is to roll the dice. Rolling is always a mandatory first action in a turn and facilitates resource generation, which is critical to progressing in the game. Resources are currently limited ([0, 2, 0, 3, 1]), and additional resource income is needed to take productive actions, such as:

1. **Building settlements**: To expand for resource diversity, a central priority at this stage of the game.
2. **Upgrading settlements to cities**: For higher VP returns later in the game.
3. **Building roads**: To secure more settlement locations while blocking opponents, if strategically viable.

Currently, rolling the dice is the only viable action to advance the game state, as all other impactful actions (e.g., building settlements, upgrading to cities) are unavailable due to insufficient resources.
