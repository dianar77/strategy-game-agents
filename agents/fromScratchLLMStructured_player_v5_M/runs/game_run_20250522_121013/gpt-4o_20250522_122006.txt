Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 4, 2, 0, 3]
        - Settlements: [10, 22]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 2
        - Roads Available: 10

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('BRICK', 'BRICK', 'BRICK', 'BRICK', 'SHEEP'))
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('BRICK', 'BRICK', 'BRICK', 'BRICK', 'WHEAT'))

Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('BRICK', 'BRICK', 'BRICK', 'BRICK', 'ORE'))

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('BRICK', 'BRICK', 'BRICK', 'BRICK', 'SHEEP')): 1
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('BRICK', 'BRICK', 'BRICK', 'BRICK', 'WHEAT')): 1
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('BRICK', 'BRICK', 'BRICK', 'BRICK', 'WOOD')): 1
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('BRICK', 'BRICK', 'BRICK', 'BRICK', 'ORE')): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
**Action:** Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('BRICK', 'BRICK', 'BRICK', 'BRICK', 'WHEAT'))

**Justification:**  
To maximize Victory Points efficiently, it is vital to focus on building settlements early for resource diversity, as stated by Priority 1. Since settlements require **Wood**, **Brick**, **Wheat**, and **Sheep**, and you currently lack **Wheat** (essential for settlement construction), trading excess **Brick** (you have 4) for **Wheat** is the most strategic action. By doing so, you set yourself up for constructing a settlement when additional resources (Wood and Sheep) are acquired.

- Ending the turn (ActionType.END_TURN) provides no progress this turn and is suboptimal.
- Trading for other resources like Sheep, Wood, or Ore is less prioritized because settlement construction hinges on obtaining Wheat first.
- The heuristic scores provided are all equal, forcing a judgment-based decision; acquiring Wheat has the most immediate impact on achieving further VP growth via settlement expansion.

This action paves the way for impactful moves in subsequent turns, adhering to the stated priorities.
