Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 4, 0, 1, 5]
        - Settlements: [22]
        - Cities: [10]
        - Victory Points (VP): 5
        - Roads Available: 6

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD: 'PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD'>, value=None)
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD: 'PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD'>, value=None): 1
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
### Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

### Justification:
Rolling the dice is the optimal choice because it enables the progression of the game by potentially acquiring resources, which are crucial for building settlements, roads, or upgrading to cities. Currently, the resource pool ([0, 4, 0, 1, 5]) is unbalanced and insufficient for impactful actions like constructing new settlements or upgrading to cities. Since **resource diversity** is key in the early game (to fulfill Priority 1), gaining additional resources through a roll can open up those opportunities.

On the other hand, playing a knight card at this moment offers a negligible strategic impact (heuristic score: 1) because:
1. There is no immediate indication that blocking an opponent or moving the robber would leverage our position significantly.
2. Knights are better saved for when blocking is more strategically advantageous or when competing for Largest Army.

Thus, rolling the dice maximizes potential for early game progression in the current state.
