Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 2, 3, 1, 0]
        - Settlements: [22]
        - Cities: [10]
        - Victory Points (VP): 5
        - Roads Available: 9

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD: 'PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD'>, value=None)
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD: 'PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD'>, value=None): 1
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
**Action:** Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

**Justification:** Rolling the dice is essential to progress the game and collect resources, which are critical for building settlements, upgrading to cities, and expanding your reach on the board. Currently, your resource pool ([0, 2, 3, 1, 0]) does not support any immediate upgrades or builds, so rolling is necessary to potentially gather the resources you need. Playing the Knight Card in this situation (with a heuristic score of 1) is not strategically impactful at this moment, as thereâ€™s no mention of an immediate threat to block an opponent or reclaim the largest army. Prioritizing resource acquisition through rolling is the logical next step to work towards building or upgrading, maximizing your Victory Points efficiently.
