Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 4, 0, 0, 1]
        - Settlements: [23, 16]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 2
        - Roads Available: 13

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD: 'PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD'>, value=None)
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('BRICK', 'BRICK', 'BRICK', 'BRICK', 'SHEEP'))
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('BRICK', 'BRICK', 'BRICK', 'BRICK', 'WHEAT'))
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('BRICK', 'BRICK', 'BRICK', 'BRICK', 'WOOD'))
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('BRICK', 'BRICK', 'BRICK', 'BRICK', 'ORE'))

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD: 'PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD'>, value=None): 1
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('BRICK', 'BRICK', 'BRICK', 'BRICK', 'SHEEP')): 1
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('BRICK', 'BRICK', 'BRICK', 'BRICK', 'WHEAT')): 1
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('BRICK', 'BRICK', 'BRICK', 'BRICK', 'WOOD')): 1
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('BRICK', 'BRICK', 'BRICK', 'BRICK', 'ORE')): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
Based on the provided game state and the principles of maximizing Victory Points (VP) efficiently by prioritizing strategic expansion:

### **Analysis:**
1. **Current Resources**:  
   - Resources: [0, 4, 0, 0, 1] = 0 Brick, 4 Sheep, 0 Wheat, 0 Wood, 1 Ore.  
   - You currently don't have the required resources to build a settlement (Brick, Wood, Wheat, Sheep) or upgrade a settlement to a city (Wheat, Wheat, Ore, Ore, Ore).  
   - Maritime trading is an option and offers a way to transform 4 Sheep into another resource, but none of the offered trades directly result in an immediate settlement or city.  

2. **Action Scores**:  
   - All maritime trade actions are scored at 1 heuristic point, indicating none have a clear immediate priority over another.  
   - Playing the knight card has no apparent tactical advantage (like blocking an opponent or stealing a key resource).  
   - Ending the turn does not provide progress toward the goal since there are meaningful trade options to explore.  

3. **Goal Alignment**:  
   The primary goal right now should be to accumulate resources to set up either a settlement or a city. Maritime Trading for **Wheat** would get you closer to building a settlement, as you'd only need Brick and Wood afterward. If this trade is not available (or unadvantageous), trading for **Ore** is a secondary step toward upgrading your settlement into a city.

### **Decision:**  
#### **Action:**
`Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('BRICK', 'BRICK', 'BRICK', 'BRICK', 'WHEAT'))`

#### **Justification:**
1. **Strategic Value**:  
   This trade converts 4 Sheep into 1 Wheat, which progresses you toward the resources needed to build a settlement (needs Brick, Wood, Wheat, Sheep).  

2. **Better than Alternatives**:  
   - Trading for Ore is less useful at this stage since you are farther from upgrading to a city than from building a settlement.  
   - Trading for Wood or Sheep does not lead to immediate progress toward your current goals.  
   - Ending your turn without trading wastes the opportunity to optimize your resources by capitalizing on maritime trade options.  

3. **Resource Accumulation for Expansion**:  
   Building settlements and roads early for resource diversity is critical. This trade aligns with the first priority by progressing toward a settlement (expansion potential).

If a follow-up action is granted after this maritime trade, acquiring Brick and Wood via harvesting or additional trades will complete the settlement requirement.
