Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [4, 0, 0, 3, 2]
        - Settlements: []
        - Cities: [12, 10]
        - Victory Points (VP): 4
        - Roads Available: 2

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('WOOD', 'WOOD', 'WOOD', 'WOOD', 'SHEEP'))
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('WOOD', 'WOOD', 'WOOD', 'WOOD', 'BRICK'))
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('WOOD', 'WOOD', 'WOOD', 'WOOD', 'WHEAT'))
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('WOOD', 'WOOD', 'WOOD', 'WOOD', 'ORE'))

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('WOOD', 'WOOD', 'WOOD', 'WOOD', 'SHEEP')): 1
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('WOOD', 'WOOD', 'WOOD', 'WOOD', 'BRICK')): 1
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('WOOD', 'WOOD', 'WOOD', 'WOOD', 'WHEAT')): 1
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('WOOD', 'WOOD', 'WOOD', 'WOOD', 'ORE')): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
### Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('WOOD', 'WOOD', 'WOOD', 'WOOD', 'BRICK'))

### Justification:
In the current game state, the optimal move is to trade resources for **BRICK**, as it aligns with the priority of building settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity (Priority 1). You already have **4 WOOD**, which meets the requirement for maritime trade, and adding **BRICK** to your resources will enable the creation of roads or settlements. 

- Building roads facilitates expansion to new hexes that provide additional resource diversity and potential settlement locations.
- Settlements increase VP and resource acquisition, which is essential to upgrade to cities later (Priority 2).

The other resource trades (SHEEP, WHEAT, and ORE) do not immediately contribute to the construction of settlements or roads and therefore hold less strategic value at this stage. Ending the turn (ActionType.END_TURN) is a low-impact action that stalls game progress unnecessarily.
