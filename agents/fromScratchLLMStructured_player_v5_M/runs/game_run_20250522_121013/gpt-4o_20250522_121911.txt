Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 2, 2, 0, 2]
        - Settlements: [10, 22]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 2
        - Roads Available: 10

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
**Action:** None (Evaluate additional possible actions)  
**Justification:** Ending the turn unnecessarily would not contribute toward maximizing Victory Points as per stated priorities. The game state indicates available resources: [0, 2, 2, 0, 2], which need to be evaluated for potential settlement building, road construction, or other impactful options. This analysis would determine if any viable actions (such as building settlements or roads to expand resource access) align with the given strategic priorities. However, no alternative actions were provided in the stated game state. Therefore, either comprehensive action options are missing, or the game state should allow more interaction to follow the priorities effectively.
