Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 5, 1, 1, 1]
        - Settlements: [22]
        - Cities: [10]
        - Victory Points (VP): 5
        - Roads Available: 8

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
### Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUY_DEVELOPMENT_CARD: 'BUY_DEVELOPMENT_CARD'>, value=None)

### Justification:
1. **Resource Usage for VP Potential**: You currently have [0 BRICK, 5 SHEEP, 1 WOOD, 1 WHEAT, 1 ORE]. Buying a development card costs 1 WHEAT, 1 SHEEP, and 1 OREâ€”all resources you possess. This converts resources into potential Victory Points (e.g., through Victory Point cards or helpful effects like granting Largest Army via Knight cards).
   
2. **Heuristic Score Alignment**: The action to buy a development card has the highest heuristic score (7), indicating its strategic impact on optimizing VP growth and game influence. Other actions (e.g., ending turns, maritime trades) have low scores (1) due to their minimal immediate value.

3. **Long-Term Impact**: Development cards can provide critical benefits, such as Knight cards to block opponents (priority 3), Monopoly cards to gain resource control, or direct VP cards to increase your overall score. This aligns with the game's later-stage priority transition towards high VP efficiency.

4. **Avoid Inefficiencies**: Maritime trades are unhelpful for advancing your current priorities, as trading 4 BRICK (which you lack) for other resources does not directly improve your VP productivity.

By buying a development card, you strategically set yourself up for future VP opportunities and maintain progress momentum.
