Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [6, 3, 0, 0, 7]
        - Settlements: []
        - Cities: [12, 10]
        - Victory Points (VP): 4
        - Roads Available: 0

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
### Chosen Action:
**Action:** Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('ORE', 'ORE', 'ORE', 'ORE', 'BRICK'))

---

### Justification:
1. **Expanding with Settlements and Roads:** 
   - You currently have no settlements and no roads available, which limits your ability to expand on the board and gain resource diversity. To build settlements, you need roads first.
   - To build a road, you need **1 Brick and 1 Wood**. Currently, you have **7 Ore, 6 Wood, and 0 Brick.** Trading excess Ore (a resource you don't need right now) for Brick is a strategically sound move to prepare for road-building.

2. **Optimizing Resource Conversion:**
   - You have an abundance of Ore (7) but lack Brick entirely. Ore is less critical until you aim to upgrade a settlement to a city, which is a later priority. Using maritime trade to exchange excess Ore for Brick gives you the resources you need to start making progress on the board through road construction.

3. **Other Trade Actions Are Lower Priority:**
   - Trading for other resources like Wheat or Sheep doesnâ€™t immediately help you progress towards your highest priority, which is building roads and settlements early for expansion.
   - Reaching resource diversity requires immediate steps towards building infrastructure (roads and settlements), and trading for Brick is the most impactful action in this turn.

4. **Avoiding Low-Impact Actions:**
   - Ending the turn without taking an impactful action would be suboptimal since you have the resources and an opportunity to prepare for future expansion now. Choosing an action that advances your progress is crucial.

By trading Ore for Brick, you'll set yourself up to start building roads in subsequent turns, aligning with the early expansion strategy and maximizing your Victory Points efficiently over time.
