Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
        - Settlements: [23, 16]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 2
        - Roads Available: 13

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD: 'PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD'>, value=None)
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD: 'PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD'>, value=None): 1
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
**Action:** Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

**Justification:**  
Currently, you have no resources ([0, 0, 0, 0, 0]) to perform impactful actions such as building settlements, roads, or upgrading settlements to cities. The heuristic scores for both available actions ("PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD" and "END_TURN") are equal at 1, indicating no significant advantage to playing the knight card in this situation. Without resources, playing a knight card would likely be a low-impact action, as it does not directly contribute to expanding resource diversity, increasing VP, or strategically blocking your opponents unless there is an immediate context not provided here (e.g., an opponent dominating in key areas or you competing for Largest Army).  

In this specific scenario, the optimal decision is to **end your turn** and gather resources on subsequent turns to set up for impactful moves that align with the game priorities of expanding your resource base and transitioning into higher VP gains. Avoiding unnecessary or premature card plays ensures you preserve flexibility for more strategic turns.
