Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 2, 0, 1, 3]
        - Settlements: []
        - Cities: [23, 16]
        - Victory Points (VP): 7
        - Roads Available: 6

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
### Action:
`Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)`

### Justification:
Given the current game state, no other actions are explicitly presented as available except `END_TURN`. While ending a turn generally has a low priority due to its limited immediate impact on VP growth, it is the only viable action presently. Attempting any other action would not be possible with the given options.

Looking at your resource count `[0, 2, 0, 1, 3]`:
- You lack the necessary resources to immediately build a settlement or road (requires at least wood and brick).
- Upgrading to a city is also not possible currently because cities require higher amounts of ore and wheat, neither of which you have in sufficient quantities.
  
Ending the turn is therefore the only pragmatic option at this time, as it will:
1. Allow you to roll for more resources on your next turn.
2. Open up new opportunities to execute actions aligned with your priorities.
3. Avoid wasting time on an unavailable move.

As the game progresses, prioritize collecting resources to enable future impactful actions like expanding settlements or upgrading cities to accelerate VP growth.
