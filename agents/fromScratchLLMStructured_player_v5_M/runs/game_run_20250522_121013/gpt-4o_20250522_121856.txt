Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 1, 3, 0, 1]
        - Settlements: [10, 22]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 2
        - Roads Available: 11

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
**Action:** Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

**Justification:** Unfortunately, based on the current game state and available actions, there are no impactful actions at this time beyond ending the turn. While maximizing VP is the goal, the listed resources ([0, 1, 3, 0, 1])—representing some combination of brick, wood, sheep, wheat, and ore—do not align with the necessary building costs for either roads, settlements, or cities:

- **Settlement Costs:** 1 wheat, 1 sheep, 1 wood, 1 brick. You lack brick and wood, hence cannot build a settlement.
- **City Upgrade Costs:** 3 ore, 2 wheat. You only have 1 ore and 1 wheat, meaning upgrading a settlement to a city is not possible.
- **Road Costs:** 1 wood, 1 brick. You have no wood or brick, so building a road is also not an option.

With roads available and plausible settlement expansion in the future, ending the turn allows you to gather new resources through dice rolls or trades that may enable impactful actions later. Although ending the turn scores low on the heuristic, it's the only viable action at the moment.
