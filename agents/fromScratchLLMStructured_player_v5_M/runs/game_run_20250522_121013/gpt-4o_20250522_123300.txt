Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 3, 3, 1, 0]
        - Settlements: []
        - Cities: [23, 16]
        - Victory Points (VP): 7
        - Roads Available: 6

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD: 'PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD'>, value=None)
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD: 'PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD'>, value=None): 1
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

Justification: Rolling the dice is the most impactful action in this scenario because it progresses the game by generating resources, which are essential for building settlements, roads, and upgrading to cities. Since the current resource pool is insufficient to execute strategic objectives (e.g., building settlements or upgrading to cities), rolling is necessary to obtain the resources needed to take meaningful next steps toward maximizing VP. Playing the knight card at this time is a low-impact choice as there is no indication in the game state that blocking opponents or stealing resources via the robber is strategically urgent. Thus, rolling the dice aligns with the objective of resource accumulation and advancing toward higher-priority actions for VP growth.
