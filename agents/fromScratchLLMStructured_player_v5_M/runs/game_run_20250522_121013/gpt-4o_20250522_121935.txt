Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 2, 2, 0, 2]
        - Settlements: [10, 22]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 2
        - Roads Available: 10

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
**Action:** None

**Justification:** Based on the given game state and instructions to optimize Victory Points (VP), there appear to be no impactful actions currently presented beyond ending your turn (which has a minimal heuristic score of 1). To follow the priority of expanding for resource diversity and VP growth:

1. **Resources Evaluation:** You currently have [0, 2, 2, 0, 2], which might not be sufficient to build settlements (3 brick, 2 lumber, etc.).
2. **Blocking Opponent Priority:** The heuristics or blocking them missing clarified
