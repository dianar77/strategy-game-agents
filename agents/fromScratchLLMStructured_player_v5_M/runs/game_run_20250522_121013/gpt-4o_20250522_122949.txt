Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 2, 0, 1, 3]
        - Settlements: [23, 16]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 4
        - Roads Available: 10

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
### Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

### Justification:
Rolling is the only action available, and it is strategically necessary at this point because:
1. **Resource Generation:** Rolling generates additional resources randomly based on dice outcomes. With resource diversity being critical for settlement and city construction, rolling is essential for building momentum toward VP growth.
2. **Current Resource Limitation:** You lack the resources (brick, wheat) necessary to build roads, settlements, or cities. Rolling may provide these missing resources, enabling more impactful actions later.
3. **Heuristic Score Alignment:** The action has a heuristic score of 1, indicating that while not ideal for immediate VP growth, it is the only viable option to progress or unlock better actions.

This roll establishes the groundwork for more impactful decisions on the next turn while adhering to the priorities of resource diversity and settlement expansion.
