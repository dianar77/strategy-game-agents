Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 1, 1, 0, 3]
        - Settlements: []
        - Cities: [10, 22]
        - Victory Points (VP): 6
        - Roads Available: 5

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)  
Justification: Based on the current game state, you lack the necessary resources to build settlements (requiring at least [1, 1, 1, 1] for wood, brick, sheep, and wheat) or roads ([1, 1] for wood and brick). Additionally, you do not have enough resources to upgrade settlements into cities either (requires [3, 2] for wheat and ore, respectively). With no other impactful actions available, ending the turn becomes the optimal choice to gather more resources on subsequent turns. However, as soon as resources are accumulated, prioritize building settlements to expand and diversify your resource generation.
