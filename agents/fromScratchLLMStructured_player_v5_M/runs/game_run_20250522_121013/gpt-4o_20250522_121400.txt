Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 1, 0, 3, 2]
        - Settlements: []
        - Cities: [12, 10]
        - Victory Points (VP): 4
        - Roads Available: 3

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
Based on the provided game state and priorities, there appears to be no immediate actions listed besides ending the turn (`END_TURN`). However, we know that the goal is to maximize VP efficiently, so if ending the turn is the only option currently, additional insights about what to prioritize or prepare for should also be considered.

### Response:

**Action:** Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

**Justification:**  
- Currently, there are insufficient resources to build a settlement (requires [1 wood, 1 brick, 1 wheat, 1 sheep] but resources are [0, 1, 0, 3, 2]) or upgrade a settlement to a city (requires [2 wheat, 3 ore] but resources are insufficient for this as well).  
- Roads could be an option in the future if resources for wood and brick become available, but currently, you have no wood.  
- Ending the turn is necessary while aiming to gather resources to execute higher-priority actions like building a settlement for resource diversity or upgrading a settlement for higher VP gains.  
- Ending the turn here is low impact but unavoidable given the current lack of development options and resource constraints.
