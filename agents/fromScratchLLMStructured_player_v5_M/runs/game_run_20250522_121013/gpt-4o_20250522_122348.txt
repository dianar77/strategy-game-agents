Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]
        - Settlements: [22]
        - Cities: [10]
        - Victory Points (VP): 5
        - Roads Available: 7

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD: 'PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD'>, value=None)
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD: 'PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD'>, value=None): 1
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
### Action: **Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)**

### Justification:
- **Resource Acquisition**: Rolling the dice is crucial in the early game to gather resources for building settlements and roads, which aligns with Priority 1 (expanding for resource diversity). With only 4 total resources (0 brick, 2 wood, 0 sheep, 0 wheat, 2 ore), we are currently unable to build anything significant. Rolling maximizes our chances of gaining resources needed for future impactful actions.
  
- **Low Impact of Playing a Knight**: Playing a Knight card in this scenario would not serve a strategic advantage. It is typically used to block opponents or to pursue Longest Army for VP gains. Since no threat or opportunity has been stated for blocking opponents or gaining Longest Army, playing the Knight card now would be wasteful.

- **VP Efficiency**: Rolling keeps us moving toward resource diversity, which is a prerequisite for future settlement building and city upgrades, both of which provide direct VP gains. Passing on resource rolls at this stage would unnecessarily delay our progress.

In summary, rolling the dice represents a proactive and efficient path toward gaining resources and advancing the game state.
