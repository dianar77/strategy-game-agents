Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 0, 3, 4, 0]
        - Settlements: [10, 22]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 2
        - Roads Available: 12

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
### Action:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

### Justification:
Rolling is the only available action at this stage. Rolling is crucial as it determines which resources are produced, which directly fuels your ability to build settlements, roads, and citiesâ€”all of which are critical for VP growth. With 0 wheat, brick, and ore in your resource pool, you are currently unable to build settlements or upgrade to cities. Rolling is necessary to gather the resources required for more impactful actions later, particularly given that settlements and roads are your next priority per the strategic guidelines. 

Thus, rolling maximizes progress while retaining flexibility for future decisions.
