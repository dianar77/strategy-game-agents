Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 1, 0, 4, 2]
        - Settlements: []
        - Cities: [12, 10]
        - Victory Points (VP): 4
        - Roads Available: 2

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
### Analysis of the Situation:
- **Current Resources**: [0, 1, 0, 4, 2] means you have:
  - **Brick**: 0
  - **Wood**: 1
  - **Sheep**: 0
  - **Wheat**: 4
  - **Ore**: 2
- **Objective**: The goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) effectively. Following our priorities:
  1. Resource diversity is critical for building settlements and roads early in the game.
  2. Upgrading settlements to cities is a better VP producer later in the game, but expanding with settlements is first priority as it enables resource generation.
  3. Blocking opponents is off the table in this scenario as no explicit threat exists in the given information.

### Action Options:
1. **END_TURN**: Doing this would waste a turn without making progress, as no resources gain additional utility by ending the turn now.
2. **MARITIME_TRADE (WHEAT x4 for BRICK)**:
   - This trade gives you **Brick**, a resource currently missing from your inventory.
   - You already have **Wood**, so with both **Brick** and **Wood**, you can build a **Road** to expand or set yourself up for building a Settlement later.
   - This action aligns with Priority 1 (expansion via roads and settlements).
3. **MARITIME_TRADE (WHEAT x4 for WOOD)**: While gaining a second Wood could be helpful, both **Brick** and **Wood** together are necessary to build Roads/Settlements. Currently, Brick is the blocking factor.
4. **MARITIME_TRADE (WHEAT x4 for ORE)**: Though ore could contribute to upgrading cities (Priority 2), you already have 2 Ore, and upgrading to a city requires 3 Ore, 2 Wheat, and a Settlement to upgrade. Without a Settlement or the full resources required, focusing on diversity (new settlements and roads via Brick) is more strategic for now.
5. **MARITIME_TRADE (WHEAT x4 for SHEEP)**: This adds Sheep for potential Settlements, but without Brick and Roads to expand to a new Settlement location, this trade is not as high-impact as acquiring Brick.

### Chosen Action:
**Action**: `Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'BRICK'))`

### Justification:
- Trading 4 Wheat for Brick addresses your immediate need for resource diversity more effectively than any other trade by enabling the construction of Roads with your existing Wood.
- Building Roads is critical for expanding to new Settlement locations, which aligns with the highest priority for maximizing VP growth early.
- This action leverages the high Wheat resource count effectively, rather than leaving it unused during this turn.
- Avoiding the **END_TURN** keeps momentum and progress toward resource diversity and expansion.
