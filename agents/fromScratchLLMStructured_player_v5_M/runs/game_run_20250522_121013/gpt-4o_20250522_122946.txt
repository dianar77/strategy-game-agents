Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 2, 0, 1, 2]
        - Settlements: [23, 16]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 4
        - Roads Available: 10

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
Based on your game state and priorities, there are no available impactful actions listed besides ending your turn. With your current resources ([0, 2, 0, 1, 2]), you lack the necessary combinations to build roads or settlements. Additionally, as upgrading settlements to cities requires a considerable amount of resources that you do not possess, you are constrained to the provided options.

### Decision:

**Action:** Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

**Justification:** Ending your turn is currently the only action available. While low-impact actions like ending the turn are not ideal, you need to accumulate resources in subsequent rounds to execute higher-impact moves like building settlements, roads, or upgrading to cities. Ending the turn will allow you to receive new resources as the game progresses, maintaining potential for future VP growth based on upcoming rolls and trades.
