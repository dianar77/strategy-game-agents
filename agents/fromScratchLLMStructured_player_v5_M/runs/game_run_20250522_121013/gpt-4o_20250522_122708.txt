Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]
        - Settlements: [23, 16]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 2
        - Roads Available: 13

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.PLAY_MONOPOLY: 'PLAY_MONOPOLY'>, value='WOOD')
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.PLAY_MONOPOLY: 'PLAY_MONOPOLY'>, value='BRICK')
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.PLAY_MONOPOLY: 'PLAY_MONOPOLY'>, value='SHEEP')
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.PLAY_MONOPOLY: 'PLAY_MONOPOLY'>, value='WHEAT')
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.PLAY_MONOPOLY: 'PLAY_MONOPOLY'>, value='ORE')
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD: 'PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD'>, value=None)
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.PLAY_MONOPOLY: 'PLAY_MONOPOLY'>, value='WOOD'): 1
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.PLAY_MONOPOLY: 'PLAY_MONOPOLY'>, value='BRICK'): 1
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.PLAY_MONOPOLY: 'PLAY_MONOPOLY'>, value='SHEEP'): 1
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.PLAY_MONOPOLY: 'PLAY_MONOPOLY'>, value='WHEAT'): 1
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.PLAY_MONOPOLY: 'PLAY_MONOPOLY'>, value='ORE'): 1
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD: 'PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD'>, value=None): 1
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
**Action:** Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

**Justification:**  
In the current game state, you do not have sufficient resources to build roads, settlements, or upgrades, and none of the playable cards (Monopoly, Knight) offer immediate high-impact benefits at this moment. Since a roll action generates resources for you and potentially for others, it is aligned with the strategic priority of resource acquisition, which could help fulfill the requirement to build settlements and roads early in the game. Rolling is a necessary step to potentially diversify and increase your resources, which can be used later to expand and earn more Victory Points efficiently. This makes it the most optimal choice given the circumstances.
