Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [1, 2, 0, 2, 2]
        - Settlements: []
        - Cities: [12, 10]
        - Victory Points (VP): 4
        - Roads Available: 0

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
Based on the current game state, here is the optimal response:

**Action:** Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

**Justification:** Rolling the dice is the most logical choice in this situation, as it progresses the game by generating resources, which are crucial for building settlements, roads, or upgrading to cities. Since you have no roads available and insufficient resources to build settlements or upgrade cities (you need specific combinations, such as 3 Brick and 2 Wood for roads or 1 Ore and 1 Wheat to upgrade settlements), taking the ROLL action is required to gather more resources and create opportunities to execute higher VP-yielding actions. Avoiding repetitive or low-impact actions is also emphasized, and rolling is necessary at this point to strategically proceed.
