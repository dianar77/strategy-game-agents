Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
        - Settlements: [22]
        - Cities: [10]
        - Victory Points (VP): 5
        - Roads Available: 7

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD: 'PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD'>, value=None)
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD: 'PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD'>, value=None): 1
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)  
Justification:  
Given the current game state, you have zero resources ([0, 0, 0, 0, 0]), which prevents you from performing impactful actions like building settlements, roads, or upgrading to cities. Playing a knight card would not actively contribute to increasing Victory Points (VP) or resource diversity at this point, as it would merely block an opponent without strategic advantage. Ending the turn is the optimal choice to wait for a better resource roll or trading opportunity in the next turn, aligning with the priority of maximizing VP growth efficiently.
