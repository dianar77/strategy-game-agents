Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]
        - Settlements: []
        - Cities: [12, 10]
        - Victory Points (VP): 6
        - Roads Available: 0

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
### Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

### Justification:
Currently, the game state reveals the following key points:
- Resource availability ([0, 0, 0, 0, 1]) is extremely limited, with only 1 resource available, and it's unclear what specific resource this is. Thus, no immediate builds or upgrades are possible.
- Settlements are absent, meaning your expansion for resource diversity is blocked, and building settlements should be prioritized as per your strategy.
- The only available action is **ROLL**, which is necessary to collect additional resources that will enable you to execute impactful moves (e.g., building settlements or roads in future turns).
- While the heuristic score for the ROLL action is low (1), it's the only viable move to advance the game state and improve your resource collection.

Choosing to roll is the optimal choice because it unlocks new resources, enabling stronger actions in subsequent turns that align with your strategy. Avoiding unnecessary or low-impact actions in this scenario means proceeding with the ROLL to stay proactive.
