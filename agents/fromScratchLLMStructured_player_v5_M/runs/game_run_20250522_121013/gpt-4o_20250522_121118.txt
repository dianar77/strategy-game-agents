Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [4, 0, 0, 1, 6]
        - Settlements: [10]
        - Cities: [12]
        - Victory Points (VP): 3
        - Roads Available: 11

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
**Action:** Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

**Justification:**  

In the current state of the game, rolling the dice is the only action available. Rolling the dice provides resources, which are critical for future actions such as building settlements, roads, and citiesâ€”all of which are necessary to gain Victory Points (VP). Since resource generation is the foundation for executing impactful moves, choosing to roll the dice ensures progress toward expanding your influence on the board.

Currently, you lack sufficient resource types ([4, 0, 0, 1, 6]) to execute high-impact VP growth moves like building settlements (costing 1 Wood, 1 Brick, 1 Wheat, 1 Sheep) or upgrading to cities (costing 2 Wheat, 3 Ore). As such, rolling the dice is both necessary and strategically aligned with your priorities. By doing so, you increase your chances of acquiring the resources needed to build settlements or cities in subsequent moves, thereby maximizing VP efficiently.
