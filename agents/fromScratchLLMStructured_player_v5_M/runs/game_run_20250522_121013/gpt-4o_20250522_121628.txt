Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 1, 0, 2, 1]
        - Settlements: []
        - Cities: [12, 10]
        - Victory Points (VP): 4
        - Roads Available: 0

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
### Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

### Justification:
Currently, your resources are limited ([0, 1, 0, 2, 1]), which restricts your ability to build settlements, upgrade to cities, or construct roads for expansion. The `ROLL` action allows you to collect resources based on dice rolls and your settlement/city placements on the board. Since you already have two cities (on hexes 12 and 10), rolling can yield double the resources compared to settlements, which accelerates your resource gathering for future builds.

Given that the heuristic score for `ROLL` is 1 (the highest in the provided actions, albeit the only choice here), it is the optimal decision to progress towards your goal of increasing VP. This is a necessary step to prepare for constructing settlements or upgrading further.
