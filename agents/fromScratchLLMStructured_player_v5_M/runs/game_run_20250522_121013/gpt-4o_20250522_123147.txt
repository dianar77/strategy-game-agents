Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 0, 0, 1, 3]
        - Settlements: []
        - Cities: [23, 16]
        - Victory Points (VP): 9
        - Roads Available: 7

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
It seems the only available action in the current game state is to end the turn. However, ending the turn without further progress towards resource diversity, settlement expansion, or other strategic goals is suboptimal. Let’s evaluate:

### Analysis:
1. **Resources**: [0, 0, 0, 1, 3] – You only have 1 brick and 3 wood. This is insufficient to build roads or settlements, as you lack other required resources.
2. **Settlements and Cities**: You already have 2 cities (which give higher VP returns over settlements). However, you lack new settlements and connected roads, so your expansion for resource diversity is stalled.
3. **Available Actions**: The heuristic suggests that ending your turn offers low impact right now (score of 1). This means that no impactful moves are currently available.

### Justification:
Given that no other actions are available and additional gameplay maneuvers (such as trading or using development cards) are not presented as options, **ending your turn is the only action**. While it's important to avoid low-impact actions, strategic gameplay requires you to move forward when no immediate high-impact options exist.

### Response:
**Action**: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)  
**Justification**: Since there are no options to construct roads, settlements, or cities due to resource limitations, and no other impactful actions are presented, ending the turn allows you to gather resources on your next roll or trade when opportunities arise. Prioritize resource diversity and settlement building in subsequent turns.
