Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 5, 2, 0, 1]
        - Settlements: []
        - Cities: [23, 16]
        - Victory Points (VP): 7
        - Roads Available: 6

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.DISCARD: 'DISCARD'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.DISCARD: 'DISCARD'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
### Action: `Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.DISCARD: 'DISCARD'>, value=None)`

### Justification:
In the present game state, there appears to be only one action available (`DISCARD`) with a heuristic score of 1. While discarding resources appears counterintuitive to progressing Victory Points (VP), it is a forced action in this case due to game mechanics, likely triggered by exceeding the resource limit after the Robber was activated. Discarding specific resources might enable future strategic adjustments to better align with the priorities:

1. Analyzing current resources: [0, 5, 2, 0, 1], where:
   - 0: Brick
   - 5: Wood
   - 2: Sheep
   - 0: Wheat
   - 1: Ore

   You are disproportionately heavy on wood (5). By discarding excess wood, you can balance your resource pool while retaining diversity, allowing more flexibility for building settlements or roads after this round.

2. Immediate priorities:
   - Since thereâ€™s an imbalance in resource distribution and the heuristic score points to `DISCARD`, this action is necessary. Afterward, we can refocus on saving for settlements or roads, as these are the most VP-efficient moves early in the game.

**Note**: Once the discard is complete, your resource strategy should shift toward obtaining brick and wheat to enable foundational settlement-building actions.
