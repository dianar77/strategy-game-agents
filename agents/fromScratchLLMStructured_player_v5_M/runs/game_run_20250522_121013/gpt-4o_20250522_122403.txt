Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 2, 1, 0, 2]
        - Settlements: [22]
        - Cities: [10]
        - Victory Points (VP): 5
        - Roads Available: 7

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)  
Justification: Based on the game state and available information, there are no actions provided here (such as building settlements, roads, or upgrading to cities) that can directly contribute to maximizing Victory Points at this moment. The only action listed is "END_TURN," meaning no impactful moves are currently possible. Ending the turn allows resources to accumulate through dice rolls on subsequent turns, positioning you for future progress once sufficient resources are acquired. While this action has a low heuristic score, it is the only choice available and is necessary to advance the game.
