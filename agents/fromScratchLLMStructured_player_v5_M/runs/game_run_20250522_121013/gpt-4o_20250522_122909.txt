Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 3, 0, 0, 4]
        - Settlements: [23, 16]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 2
        - Roads Available: 11

Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('ORE', 'ORE', 'ORE', 'ORE', 'WOOD')): 1
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('ORE', 'ORE', 'ORE', 'ORE', 'SHEEP')): 1
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('ORE', 'ORE', 'ORE', 'ORE', 'BRICK')): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
Analyzing the current game state and priorities, here's the most optimal course of action:

### Action:
**Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('ORE', 'ORE', 'ORE', 'ORE', 'BRICK'))**

---

### Justification:
1. **Primary Goal: Expand Settlement and Road-Building Opportunities**
   - You currently have 3 wheat and 4 ore but lack brick and wood, which are essential for building settlements and roads. 
   - Trading 4 ore for 1 brick moves you closer to being able to build a road or a settlement, which align with the game priorities of expanding resource diversity and territory.

2. **Maximizing Resource Efficiency**
   - Ore is necessary for upgrading to cities, but since you have no settlements to upgrade to cities yet and cannot currently afford a city (requires 2 wheat and 3 ore), the excess ore is better spent through maritime trade to diversify resources.
   - Trading for brick sets up the conditions for constructing roads or settlements as soon as you obtain wood.

3. **Avoiding Low-Impact Actions**
   - Ending the turn without taking meaningful actions wastes opportunities to progress strategically and improve your position.
   - Playing the knight card at this moment would not serve your immediate priority of resource acquisition or territory expansion.

4. **Strategic Preparation for Future Actions**
   - Once you acquire brick (and later wood), you will be in a position to:
     - Build roads to expand settlement-building possibilities.
     - Use future resources for more impactful developments like settlements, unlocking additional Victory Points.

By prioritizing resource diversification and setting the stage for settlement expansion, this action aligns with your strategic goals and positions you better for the next turns.
