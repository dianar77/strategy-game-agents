Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 5, 0, 0, 0]
        - Settlements: [22]
        - Cities: [10]
        - Victory Points (VP): 5
        - Roads Available: 8

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD: 'PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD'>, value=None)
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('BRICK', 'BRICK', 'BRICK', 'BRICK', 'SHEEP'))

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD: 'PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD'>, value=None): 1
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('BRICK', 'BRICK', 'BRICK', 'BRICK', 'SHEEP')): 1
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('BRICK', 'BRICK', 'BRICK', 'BRICK', 'WHEAT')): 1
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('BRICK', 'BRICK', 'BRICK', 'BRICK', 'WOOD')): 1
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('BRICK', 'BRICK', 'BRICK', 'BRICK', 'ORE')): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
Given the game state and priorities, here's the analysis:

1. **Resources: [0, 5, 0, 0, 0]**  
   - You have an abundance of **BRICK** (5 units) but lack other resources entirely. Trading your surplus BRICK is crucial to acquiring resources needed for expansion or upgrades.

2. **Victory Points (VP):** 5  
   - Early game priorities focus on building **settlements** and **roads** for expansion. You need **WOOD** and **SHEEP** to build settlements (1 BRICK + 1 WOOD + 1 SHEEP + 1 WHEAT).

3. **Strategic Maritime Trade Options:**  
   - Available trades allow you to exchange 4 BRICK for 1 unit of any other resource (e.g., WOOD, WHEAT, SHEEP, ORE). While no one trade is inherently better than another in the current break-even heuristic, the goal is to aim for a trade that progresses towards building settlements.

4. **Other Actions:**  
   - **PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD:** The heuristic score indicates this is a low-priority action. Playing the knight card is not urgent unless blocking an opponent or obtaining the Largest Army bonus.  
   - **END_TURN:** Ending the turn now provides no advantage since you can take a trade action to position yourself better.

### Optimal Action:  
**Action:** `Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('BRICK', 'BRICK', 'BRICK', 'BRICK', 'WOOD'))`

**Justification:**  
Acquiring **WOOD** is critical because it brings you closer to building a settlement (along with SHEEP and WHEAT, which can be traded for later). This aligns with the early-game priority of building settlements and roads for resource diversity. WOOD is essential for both roads and settlements, making this a logical first trade.  

Subsequent actions can build on this, possibly trading BRICK for SHEEP or WHEAT on future turns. Ending the turn now is unnecessary, as you risk losing momentum in settlement expansion.
