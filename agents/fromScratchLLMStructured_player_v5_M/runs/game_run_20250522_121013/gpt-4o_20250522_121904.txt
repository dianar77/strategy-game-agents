Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [1, 3, 3, 0, 3]
        - Settlements: [10, 22]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 2
        - Roads Available: 11

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
## Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)  
        
## Justification:  
- **Current Resources:** Your resource pool ([1, 3, 3, 0, 3]) is not yet sufficient to take impactful building actions (e.g., constructing roads, settlements, or upgrading to cities). Rolling the dice is the necessary step to gather additional resources.  
  
- **Strategic Alignment:** Rolling the dice is a prerequisite to progressing toward building settlements and roads (Priority 1). It sets the stage for achieving resource diversity, which is essential for long-term efficiency and advancing the VP goals.

- **Low Impact of Other Actions:** No other productive or block-related actions are currently possible (e.g., you cannot spend resources effectively or block opponents without more information). Rolling ensures momentum toward meaningful progress.  

In summary, rolling is the optimal action to gather resources and prepare for impactful future actions in line with your goal of maximizing VP efficiently.
