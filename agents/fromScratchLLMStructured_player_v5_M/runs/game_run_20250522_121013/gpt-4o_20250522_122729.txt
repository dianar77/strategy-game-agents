Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [1, 0, 1, 1, 0]
        - Settlements: [23, 16]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 2
        - Roads Available: 13

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
**Action:** Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.PLAY_MONOPOLY: 'PLAY_MONOPOLY'>, value='WOOD')  
**Justification:**  
Given the current game state, there are no opportunities to directly build new settlements, roads, or upgrade settlements to cities. However, it's crucial to gather resources that will allow for future development. The chosen action utilizes the Monopoly card to claim all WOOD resources from opponents. Here's the reasoning:  

1. **Aligning with Priority 1 (Building settlements and roads early):**  
   - Settlements and roads require WOOD and BRICK. Prioritizing WOOD through Monopoly gives access to one of the two critical resources while using the card efficiently.  
   - WOOD will enable future road-building, which is necessary for expanding settlement placements.  

2. **Limited Immediate Options:**  
   - All available actions have equal heuristic ratings (1); however, ending the turn prematurely misses an opportunity to gain resources.  
   - Of the Monopoly options, WOOD is prioritized because it is more commonly required for early-game road and settlement expansion than other resources.  

3. **Maximizing Impact:**  
   - Monopoly disrupts opponents' resource pools, slowing down their progress while improving your chances of achieving Priority 1.  

By choosing WOOD, you take steps toward early-game expansion while also blocking a potentially significant resource from opponents.
