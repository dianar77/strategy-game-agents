Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 2, 1, 0, 1]
        - Settlements: []
        - Cities: [10, 22]
        - Victory Points (VP): 6
        - Roads Available: 3

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
**Action**: Action(color=Color.BLUE, action_type=ActionType.ROLL, value=None)  
**Justification**: Rolling is a necessary first step to generate additional resources, which are critical for executing strategic actions like building settlements, roads, or upgrading to cities. With your current resource inventory ([0, 2, 1, 0, 1]), you do not have enough to build a settlement (typically requiring 1 brick, 1 wood, 1 wheat, and 1 sheep), a road (requiring 1 brick and 1 wood), or upgrade to a city (requiring 2 wheat and 3 ore). Rolling can potentially provide the resources needed to take impactful actions that optimize Victory Point growth, adhere to the stated priorities, and advance your position on the board.
