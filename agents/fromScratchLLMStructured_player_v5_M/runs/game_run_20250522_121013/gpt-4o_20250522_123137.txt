Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]
        - Settlements: []
        - Cities: [23, 16]
        - Victory Points (VP): 9
        - Roads Available: 7

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
**Action:** Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)  

**Justification:**  
Currently, you have insufficient resources to take impactful actions like building settlements, roads, or upgrading settlements to cities. Your resource count is [0, 0, 0, 1, 0], which means you are missing critical materials (such as wood, brick, wheat, or ore) required to progress towards settlement expansion or upgrades. Ending the turn allows you to collect resources based on dice rolls in the next turn or gain opportunities to participate in trades that could set you up for productive actions. Since there are no alternative actions available in the listed game state, ending the turn is the only choice, though low-impact. Once your resource pool improves, you can shift focus back to growth strategies.
