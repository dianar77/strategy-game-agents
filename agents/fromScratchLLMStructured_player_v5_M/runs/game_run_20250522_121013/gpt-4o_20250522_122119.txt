Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]
        - Settlements: [22]
        - Cities: [10]
        - Victory Points (VP): 5
        - Roads Available: 9

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD: 'PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD'>, value=None)
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD: 'PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD'>, value=None): 1
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
Based on the given game state and available actions:

### Action: `Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD: 'PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD'>, value=None)`

### Justification:
1. **VP Optimization**: Playing a Knight Card can help you progress toward the "Largest Army" bonus, which provides 2 additional Victory Points if you achieve it. This aligns with maximizing VP and prepares you for future advantages.
2. **Strategic Blocking**: Using the Knight Card allows you to move the Robber strategically, which can block an opponent's key resource production. This inhibits their growth, indirectly benefiting you.
3. **Turn Efficiency**: Ending the turn without taking any impactful action (given your limited resources) is a low-priority move. Playing the Knight Card offers more strategic value than simply ending the turn.

In this scenario, playing the Knight Card is the optimal choice, as it helps advance your board position toward VP growth while adding a strategic component by disrupting opponents. Ending the turn adds no immediate benefit or progress given your current state.
