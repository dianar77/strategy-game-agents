Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [2, 0, 0, 1, 2]
        - Settlements: []
        - Cities: [12, 10]
        - Victory Points (VP): 4
        - Roads Available: 2

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Justification: Based on the given game state:
1. There are insufficient resources to build settlements, roads, or upgrade settlements to cities. The resources are [2 (brick), 0 (lumber), 0 (ore), 1 (wheat), 2 (sheep)], which do not meet the requirements for further construction or upgrades.
2. There are no immediate options outlined to use the roads available or block opponents, and no further strategic actions are suggested.
3. Ending the turn is the only viable action to collect resources from future dice rolls or trades, setting the stage for more impactful decisions in the next turn.

Although ending the turn is not ideal for maximizing VP directly, it is currently the only possible action per the given game state.
