Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [2, 0, 0, 1, 2]
        - Settlements: []
        - Cities: [12, 10]
        - Victory Points (VP): 4
        - Roads Available: 2

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
**Action**: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

**Justification**: Currently, the only available action is to roll the dice, and this is necessary to progress the game by generating resources. With the current resource pool ([2, 0, 0, 1, 2]), you lack sufficient resources to build a settlement (which typically requires 1 wood, 1 brick, 1 wheat, 1 sheep) or upgrade a settlement to a city (2 wheat, 3 ore). Rolling the dice allows you to gather resources, enabling future actions aligned with your strategy of building settlements and eventually upgrading them to cities for higher VP returns. Since repetitive or low-impact moves are to be avoided, rolling the dice is the optimal and necessary action right now to continue the game efficiently.
