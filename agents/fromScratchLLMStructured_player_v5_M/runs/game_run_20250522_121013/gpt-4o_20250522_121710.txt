Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [6, 4, 0, 0, 3]
        - Settlements: []
        - Cities: [12, 10]
        - Victory Points (VP): 4
        - Roads Available: 0

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
### Action: `Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('BRICK', 'BRICK', 'BRICK', 'BRICK', 'WOOD'))`

### Justification:
1. **Goal Assessment:**
    - Priority 1 emphasizes building settlements and roads early to expand resource diversity. You currently have **no Settlements**, and you cannot build roads as you have 0 available. Your resources include an abundance of **brick (4)** and **wood (0)**â€”two critical resources for road building and settlement expansion. To follow the priority of future growth, acquiring **wood** is essential.

2. **Action Analysis:**
    - Trading 4 bricks for 1 wood enables you to progress toward the ability to construct roads (cost: 1 wood, 1 brick), which directly supports **expansion and resource diversity** (Priority 1). This is preferable to other trades, such as for **sheep, ore, or wheat**, which won't immediately further your ability to build settlements or roads.

3. **Strategic Concerns:**
    - Ending the turn without taking any action forfeits the opportunity to optimize resources for your growth.
    - Other maritime trade options, such as trading brick for sheep, wheat, or ore, do not contribute to your immediate goal of building settlements and roads. They would only help with **city upgrades** (Priority 2), which is not the focus at this stage.
    - Preparing to build roads early positions you to gain access to **more diverse resources via settlements**, ensuring sustainable production for higher VP actions later.

4. **Efficiency Consideration:**
    - This trade sets you up to use your **6 total bricks** and eventually unlock more productive board positions. This aligns with the principle of prioritizing impactful actions over repetitive or low-impact turns.

By trading 4 bricks for 1 wood, you stay on track to build roads and settlements, preparing for significant strategic gains in future turns.
