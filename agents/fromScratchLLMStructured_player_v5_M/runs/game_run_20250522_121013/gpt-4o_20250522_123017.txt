Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 1, 1, 3, 1]
        - Settlements: [23, 16]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 4
        - Roads Available: 9

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUY_DEVELOPMENT_CARD: 'BUY_DEVELOPMENT_CARD'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUY_DEVELOPMENT_CARD: 'BUY_DEVELOPMENT_CARD'>, value=None): 7

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
**Action:** Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUY_DEVELOPMENT_CARD: 'BUY_DEVELOPMENT_CARD'>, value=None)  
**Justification:**  
The given heuristic scores indicate that buying a Development Card (score: 7) is a significantly more impactful action compared to simply ending the turn (score: 1). Development Cards can provide Victory Points, resource-related advantages, or strategic tools (like Knights for Largest Army or progress cards). Given the strong point differential in heuristic scores and the long-term potential benefits of Development Cards, this action aligns with the goal of maximizing VP efficiently while avoiding unnecessary delays. Ending the turn without taking action would squander the opportunity to utilize available resources effectively.
