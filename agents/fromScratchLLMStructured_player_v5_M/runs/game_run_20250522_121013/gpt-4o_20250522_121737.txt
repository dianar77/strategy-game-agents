Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [3, 3, 0, 0, 3]
        - Settlements: []
        - Cities: [12, 10]
        - Victory Points (VP): 4
        - Roads Available: 0

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.DISCARD: 'DISCARD'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.DISCARD: 'DISCARD'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
Based on the current game state and available options, my response is as follows:

### Action: `Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.DISCARD: 'DISCARD'>, value=None)`

### Justification:

1. **Resource Overload:** The action indicates discarding excess resources, likely because you have reached or exceeded the hand limit due to a high resource count. Discarding is mandatory in this context.

2. **No Other Options:** There's no indication of being able to build roads, settlements, or cities at this moment since the action list only provides the DISCARD option, barring any direct VP-increasing actions.

3. **Preparation for Future Moves:** Once this mandatory discard is resolved, new actions could become available to progress toward building roads or settlements, which align with priority 1 of resource diversity and VP optimization.

4. **Efficient Decision-Making:** This ensures compliance with the discard phase, avoids penalties, and allows the game to proceed strategically in the next turn.

Unfortunately, no VP gains can be made immediately, but this step is necessary for unlocking future impactful moves.
