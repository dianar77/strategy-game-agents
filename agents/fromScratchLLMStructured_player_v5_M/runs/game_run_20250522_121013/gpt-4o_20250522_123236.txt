Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 2, 2, 1, 3]
        - Settlements: []
        - Cities: [23, 16]
        - Victory Points (VP): 7
        - Roads Available: 6

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUY_DEVELOPMENT_CARD: 'BUY_DEVELOPMENT_CARD'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUY_DEVELOPMENT_CARD: 'BUY_DEVELOPMENT_CARD'>, value=None): 7

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
**Action:** Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUY_DEVELOPMENT_CARD: 'BUY_DEVELOPMENT_CARD'>, value=None)

**Justification:**  
Based on the current game state and priorities:  
1. The current resources ([0, 2, 2, 1, 3]) are insufficient to build a settlement, road, or city. Thus, taking these strategic expansion actions is not an option at this time.  
2. Among the two available actions, **buying a development card** is the optimal choice because it has a much higher heuristic score (7) compared to ending the turn (1). Development cards can lead to additional Victory Points, knight cards for largest army, or useful progress cards that can further your strategic position.  
3. Ending the turn without using resources or pursuing development would be a low-impact move. Since resources have been accumulated, it's better to put them to use rather than let them sit idle.  
4. Prioritizing impactful actions like buying a development card aligns with the goal of optimizing VP growth and ensuring you stay competitive.
