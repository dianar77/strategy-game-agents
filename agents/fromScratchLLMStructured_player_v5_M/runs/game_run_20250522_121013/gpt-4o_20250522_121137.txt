Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 0, 0, 2, 2]
        - Settlements: [10]
        - Cities: [12]
        - Victory Points (VP): 3
        - Roads Available: 9

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)  
Justification: Currently, your resources ([0, 0, 0, 2, 2]) are insufficient to build either roads, settlements, or cities as they require specific resource combinations not currently available. Ending the turn is the only viable action to progress and gather more resources for impactful moves in future turns. You should prioritize accumulating wood, brick, sheep, and wheat to enable building settlements further, aligning with the goal to maximize VP growth. Note: While ending the turn has a low heuristic score, it remains your only option at the moment.
