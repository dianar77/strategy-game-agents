Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 3, 2, 0, 3]
        - Settlements: [10, 22]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 2
        - Roads Available: 10

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
Action: **Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)**  
Justification: Based on the current game state, there are no additional actions provided beyond ending the turn. As a result, it's necessary to proceed with this action to allow resource collection in subsequent turns and unlock new opportunities. Resources currently available ([0, 3, 2, 0, 3]) are insufficient to build roads, settlements, or upgrade settlements to cities, which are higher-priority objectives. Ending the turn avoids stagnation and sets the stage for more impactful decisions in the future.
