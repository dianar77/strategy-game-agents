Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 2, 0, 2, 0]
        - Settlements: []
        - Cities: [10, 22]
        - Victory Points (VP): 7
        - Roads Available: 3

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
**Action:** Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)  
**Justification:**  
Given the current game state, there are no other listed actionable options besides ending the turn. While the goal is to maximize VP efficiently, the lack of sufficient resources ([0, 2, 0, 2, 0]) constrains your ability to build settlements, roads, or upgrade to cities in this turn. Strategic priorities dictate expanding resource diversity and upgrading structures, but without other options presented, ending the turn to collect resources in subsequent turns becomes necessary. Moving forward, focusing on securing critical resources (brick, wood, and wheat) for building and expanding infrastructure is the next logical step.
