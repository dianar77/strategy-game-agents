Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [1, 0, 0, 5, 0]
        - Settlements: []
        - Cities: [12, 10]
        - Victory Points (VP): 4
        - Roads Available: 3

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'BRICK'))
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'WOOD'))
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'ORE'))
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'SHEEP'))

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'BRICK')): 1
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'WOOD')): 1
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'ORE')): 1
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'SHEEP')): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
**Action:** Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'BRICK'))

**Justification:**  
The highest priority in the game is to build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity. Currently, you do not have any settlements and need roads to reach new areas for potential settlement placements.

Looking at your resource pool [1, 0, 0, 5, 0] (1 Brick, 0 Wood, 0 Sheep, 5 Wheat, 0 Ore), you are stockpiling Wheat but lack critical resources, particularly Wood and Brick. Road-building requires one Brick and one Wood. By performing maritime trade to convert 4 Wheat for 1 Brick, you will be closer to constructing roads with the Brick you already have in your inventory. Trading for Brick over Wood is strategically optimal because you cannot construct even one road without *both* materials, and this action ensures one full road can be built once Wood is acquired.

Other maritime trade options (e.g., for Wood, Ore, or Sheep) are less immediately impactful since they do not align as directly with the goal of expanding by building roads and settlements. Ending the turn without action would waste a critical opportunity to position yourself better for expansion. Therefore, trading for Brick is the most efficient choice to advance your priorities.
