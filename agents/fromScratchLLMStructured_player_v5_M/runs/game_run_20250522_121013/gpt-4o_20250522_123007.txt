Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 1, 0, 2, 1]
        - Settlements: [23, 16]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 4
        - Roads Available: 9

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
Based on the provided information and the priorities:

### Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

### Justification:
At this stage, it seems that the only action available to us is to "END TURN." Since we lack sufficient resources ([0, 1, 0, 2, 1]) to take impactful actions like building a settlement (usually requires [1 Brick, 1 Wood, 1 Grain, 1 Sheep]) or upgrading a settlement to a city (requires [2 Grain, 3 Ore]), ending the turn is the only valid move. 

Although ending the turn is low-impact in terms of progression, the heuristic score reflects this necessary action. By ending the turn, we progress to the next phase, expecting new resources that align with our expansion and upgrade strategies to maximize VP efficiently.
