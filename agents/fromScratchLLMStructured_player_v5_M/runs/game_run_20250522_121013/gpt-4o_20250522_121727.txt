Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [7, 2, 0, 0, 3]
        - Settlements: []
        - Cities: [12, 10]
        - Victory Points (VP): 4
        - Roads Available: 0

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('WOOD', 'WOOD', 'WOOD', 'WOOD', 'SHEEP'))
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('WOOD', 'WOOD', 'WOOD', 'WOOD', 'BRICK'))
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('WOOD', 'WOOD', 'WOOD', 'WOOD', 'WHEAT'))
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('WOOD', 'WOOD', 'WOOD', 'WOOD', 'ORE'))

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('WOOD', 'WOOD', 'WOOD', 'WOOD', 'SHEEP')): 1
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('WOOD', 'WOOD', 'WOOD', 'WOOD', 'BRICK')): 1
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('WOOD', 'WOOD', 'WOOD', 'WOOD', 'WHEAT')): 1
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('WOOD', 'WOOD', 'WOOD', 'WOOD', 'ORE')): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
### Action:
**Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('WOOD', 'WOOD', 'WOOD', 'WOOD', 'BRICK'))**

### Justification:
The current priority is to expand early by building settlements and roads to increase resource diversity and set up opportunities for upgrading to cities. Your resource situation shows that you lack **BRICK**, which is essential for building roads and settlements, while you already have **WOOD** (7 units), more than enough for such constructions.

- Trading **WOOD** for **BRICK** enables the construction of roads once you accumulate additional resources.
- Although other trades are available (e.g., for SHEEP, WHEAT, or ORE), none directly support your immediate priority of expansion via settlements and roads.
- This action positions you strategically to maximize VP by facilitating future developments while avoiding unnecessary turns without advancing your goal.
