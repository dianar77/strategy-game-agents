Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 1, 3, 0, 0]
        - Settlements: [10, 22]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 2
        - Roads Available: 12

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
**Action:** None  

**Justification:**  
Currently, there is no actionable choice presented in the current game state that aligns with the priorities for maximizing Victory Points efficiently (settlements, cities, strategic blocks). The only available action (`END_TURN` with a heuristic score of 1) is low-impact and does not contribute meaningfully to advancing the key priorities. The lack of necessary resources (you need [wood, brick, and wheat] to build settlements, and [ore, wheat] to upgrade to cities) restricts progress at this turn. Ending the turn (thus collecting new resources on subsequent rolls) is a logical next step until more impactful actions become available.
