Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1]
        - Settlements: []
        - Cities: [12, 10]
        - Victory Points (VP): 4
        - Roads Available: 0

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
### Action: `Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)`  
### Justification:
In reviewing the current state, there are no impactful actions available beyond ending the turn. Specifically:  
- **Resources:** A total of `[0, 0, 0, 1, 1]` indicates insufficient resources to construct settlements, roads, or upgrade settlements to cities. Settlements and roads require diverse resource sets that are currently unavailable.  
- **Settlements and Cities:** While upgrading settlements to cities is a high-priority goal, the lack of resources makes this action impossible at this stage.  
- **Roads and Expansion:** No roads are currently available or available for construction, which rules out strategic expansion or blocking opponents.  
- **Available Actions:** The only action is to end the turn. While low-impact, it is the only viable choice given the game state.

Given these constraints, ending the turn is the optimal decision as it allows resource accumulation on future dice rolls, enabling higher-priority strategic moves in subsequent turns.
