Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [1, 2, 0, 0, 1]
        - Settlements: [23, 16]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 4
        - Roads Available: 11

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(24, 53))
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(18, 40))
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(22, 23))

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
### Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(22, 23))

### Justification:
1. **Expand for Resource Diversity (Priority 1)**:
   - The road `(22, 23)` strategically connects to existing settlements at node `23`. This opens up new opportunities for settlement placement around node `22`, which contributes to resource diversity and expansion potential.

2. **Higher Heuristic Score**:
   - All "BUILD_ROAD" actions have equal heuristic scores (10). Given this tie, prioritizing roads that align with settlement expansion near existing nodes ensures efficient resource access and maximization of VP opportunities.

3. **Avoid Ending Turn Prematurely**:
   - Ending the turn without building any roads is low-impact and conflicts with the resource diversity and expansion priorities outlined.

4. **Road Placement Synergy**:
   - Building a road connected to an established settlement (node `23`) provides more strategic advantage than other options that branch off arbitrarily. This option sets the stage for creating additional settlements or cities later, optimizing VP growth.

By executing this action, you actively expand towards new territory while leveraging existing infrastructure for future development.
