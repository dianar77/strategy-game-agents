Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 2, 2, 1, 3]
        - Settlements: []
        - Cities: [23, 16]
        - Victory Points (VP): 7
        - Roads Available: 6

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)  
Justification: Rolling the dice is the only action available at this time, and it serves as the starting point to potentially gain essential resources to progress strategically. Since your current resource mix ([0, 2, 2, 1, 3]) isn't sufficient to build settlements (requires specific combinations like brick and wood for roads, or all types for settlements), rolling gives you the opportunity to collect resources that align with your priorities. Expanding with settlements and roads early is key for resource diversity and maximizing VP growth.
