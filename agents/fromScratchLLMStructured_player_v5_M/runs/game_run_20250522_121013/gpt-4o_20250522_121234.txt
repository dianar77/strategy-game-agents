Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [5, 0, 0, 2, 5]
        - Settlements: []
        - Cities: [12, 10]
        - Victory Points (VP): 4
        - Roads Available: 8

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
**Action:** Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

**Justification:**  
Currently, the game state shows limited resources for building critical structures. You only have 5 brick, 2 wheat, and 5 wood, which are insufficient to build a settlement (requires wood, brick, wheat, and sheep) or upgrade a settlement into a city (requires wheat and ore). 

Rolling is necessary because it provides the opportunity to gather more resources dynamically based on the dice result, enabling you to take meaningful actions like building roads, settlements, or cities in subsequent turns to maximize VP. Additionally, prioritizing resource collection aligns with the main strategic goal: expanding and eventually upgrading for efficient VP gains. Since the action has the highest heuristic score available (1), and there are no other impactful options currently, rolling is the optimal choice.
