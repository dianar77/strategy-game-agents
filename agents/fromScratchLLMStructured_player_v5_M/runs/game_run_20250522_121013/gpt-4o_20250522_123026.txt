Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 2, 0, 3, 1]
        - Settlements: [23, 16]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 5
        - Roads Available: 9

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Justification: Unfortunately, the game state only provides a single action optionâ€”ending the turn. This indicates no other immediate moves (e.g., building settlements, upgrading to cities, or placing roads) are viable due to insufficient resources. Given your current resources (0 brick, 2 wood, 0 sheep, 3 wheat, 1 ore), you lack the combinations necessary to build a settlement, road, or upgrade a settlement. Ending the turn becomes the sole choice in this instance, as no other impactful actions are available. Future turns can focus on gathering missing resources to pursue priority actions (e.g., building settlements or upgrading to cities).
