Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [5, 1, 0, 0, 7]
        - Settlements: []
        - Cities: [12, 10]
        - Victory Points (VP): 4
        - Roads Available: 0

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
Based on the current game state and priorities, the chosen action should aim to improve the resource situation and move toward building settlements and roads.

### Action:
Action: **Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)**

### Justification:
1. **Resource Accumulation:**
   - Rolling dice is essential to generate more resources. Your current resource pool ([5, 1, 0, 0, 7]) is insufficient to build a settlement (requires 1 Wood, 1 Brick, 1 Wheat, and 1 Sheep) or a road (requires 1 Wood and 1 Brick), so rolling is necessary to replenish resources.
   
2. **Focus on Priority 1:**
   - The first priority is building settlements and roads to expand and diversify resources. Since you lack roads in your inventory and insufficient resources to build roads or settlements, rolling the dice is the only productive option to move toward this goal.

3. **Avoid Low-Impact Actions:**
   - Ending the turn without rolling (not applicable here) would stall progress unnecessarily. Rolling the dice keeps the game moving and provides new opportunities for strategic planning.

4. **Heuristic Score Reinforcement:**
   - Rolling dice has a heuristic score of 1, which (even if itâ€™s low) indicates that it is the best available action given the current circumstances.

By rolling the dice, you aim to gather the resources needed to build roads or settlements in subsequent turns, progressing toward expanding resource diversity and victory points.
