Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 0, 0, 1, 3]
        - Settlements: []
        - Cities: [23, 16]
        - Victory Points (VP): 9
        - Roads Available: 7

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
**Action:** Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

**Justification:** The available action is to roll the dice, which is necessary to generate resources in order to build settlements, roads, or upgrades in future turns. Given the current resource pool ([0, 0, 0, 1, 3]), we lack critical resources (ones such as brick, wood, wheat, ore, or sheep) to construct new settlements or roads or to upgrade settlements into cities. Rolling will allow us the opportunity to gather more resources and diversify our pool, enabling us to take more impactful actions in future turns. This aligns with the strategic priority of early resource acquisition to maximize VP progression efficiently. Since rolling the dice is the only impactful move available right now, it is the optimal choice.
