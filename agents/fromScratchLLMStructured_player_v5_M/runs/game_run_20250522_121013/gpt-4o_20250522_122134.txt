Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 2, 1, 1, 0]
        - Settlements: [22]
        - Cities: [10]
        - Victory Points (VP): 5
        - Roads Available: 9

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
### Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

### Justification:
The current game state indicates that you are in the early to mid-phase of the game, with 1 settlement and 1 city contributing to your Victory Points (VP). Your resource pool is quite limited ([0, 2, 1, 1, 0]), and a roll is essential to potentially gain additional resources. Rolling the dice will generate resources for you (and potentially others), which is crucial for building settlements and roads to expand your reach and resource diversity.

Based on the minigame priorities:
1. **Expanding resource diversity** - You need to secure additional resources by building/exporting more settlements, and rolling is the key input to gather resources.
2. **Current high PRIORITY high** This does (
