Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 2, 1, 0, 1]
        - Settlements: [10, 22]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 2
        - Roads Available: 10

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD: 'PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD'>, value=None)
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD: 'PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD'>, value=None): 1
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
**Action:** Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)  
**Justification:** Given the current game state, rolling the dice is the most impactful action because it generates resources, which are critical for constructing roads, settlements, or upgrading to cities. The heuristic score for both available actions is equal, but playing a Knight card without a specific target does not advance the primary objectives (expanding, improving resource diversity, or gaining immediate VP). Rolling introduces new possibilities to gather resources, unlocking further options to progress toward the goal of maximizing Victory Points efficiently.
