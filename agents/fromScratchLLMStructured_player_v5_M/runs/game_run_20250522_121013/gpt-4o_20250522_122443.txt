Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [1, 0, 1, 0, 2]
        - Settlements: []
        - Cities: [10, 22]
        - Victory Points (VP): 6
        - Roads Available: 6

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
Based on the provided game state and available actions:

### Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

### Justification:
Currently, you only have one action available, which is to end the turn. While it is generally advised to avoid unnecessary end-turn actions, no other moves are presented to enable productive resource or building opportunities. Analyzing the state of the game:

1. **Resources ([1, 0, 1, 0, 2]):** Your resource pool is insufficient to build either a settlement (requires 1 wood, 1 brick, 1 wheat, and 1 sheep) or a road (requires 1 wood and 1 brick). Additionally, there's insufficient wheat for upgrading to a city.
   
2. **Settlements and Cities:** You currently have no settlements to expand with roads, and the existing cities cannot be further upgraded.

3. **Strategies like blocking opponents:** No explicit option is provided to block opponents through building roads or other actions, as no usable actions are available.

Given the lack of alternative impactful actions at this moment, it is optimal to end the turn and collect more resources during the next round, positioning yourself for more strategic decisions afterward.
