Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [1, 0, 1, 0, 3]
        - Settlements: []
        - Cities: [10, 22]
        - Victory Points (VP): 6
        - Roads Available: 4

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
**Action:** Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

**Justification:**  
After analyzing the provided game state and list of available actions, it appears that the only action currently available is to end the turn. Given that there are no other alternative options or impactful actions presented, ending the turn is the only logical choice.

While the strategy emphasizes building settlements and roads early for resource diversity, the current resources [1, 0, 1, 0, 3] (matching typical Hex types like Brick, Lumber, Ore, Wheat, Sheep) are insufficient for building either roads (requiring Brick and Lumber) or settlements (requiring Brick, Lumber, Wheat, and Sheep). Additionally, upgrading to a city is also unavailable due to insufficient Ore and Wheat.

Although ending the turn is a low-impact action, it is necessary here to collect more resources and set up subsequent, more impactful moves that align with the priorities. As no blocking strategy or other strategic option is available either, this is the best course of action for now.
