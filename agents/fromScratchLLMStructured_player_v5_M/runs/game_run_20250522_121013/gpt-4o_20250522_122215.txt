Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 3, 1, 0, 0]
        - Settlements: [22]
        - Cities: [10]
        - Victory Points (VP): 5
        - Roads Available: 9

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD: 'PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD'>, value=None)
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD: 'PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD'>, value=None): 1
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
### Action: `Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)`

### Justification:
Currently, the available actions have identical heuristic scores of 1, reflecting minimal benefit to either choice in terms of optimizing VP growth. However, playing a Knight Card in this state is not strategically advantageous for the following reasons:

1. **Resource Constraints**: 
   - Your resource pool ([0, 3, 1, 0, 0]) is insufficient to build anything impactful (e.g., settlements require specific resource combinations such as 1 wood, 1 brick, 1 wheat, and 1 sheep).
   - Using resources, even indirectly via a Knight Card, offers no clear improvement to your position.

2. **Knight Card Play Impact**:
   - Playing a Knight Card could block opponents from critical resource gains or secure Largest Army in the future, but no information suggests its immediate strategic value right now.
   - There’s no apparent opportunity to leverage the Knight card for blocking in spite of the priority goal (3). Thus, its impact would be negligible this turn.

3. **Ending the Turn Is More Efficient**:
   - Ending the turn allows you to roll for new resources in the next round and possibly collect the materials needed to build roads or settlements, progressing priority goals (1) and (2).
   - It avoids wasting the Knight Card on a low-impact turn and preserves flexibility for decisive plays later when it may actively block an opponent’s progress or secure Largest Army for bonus VP.

Given this reasoning, ending the turn is the optimal choice to conserve resources, avoid waste, and prepare for more effective VP-generating actions in subsequent turns.
