Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [3, 0, 0, 1, 3]
        - Settlements: [10]
        - Cities: [12]
        - Victory Points (VP): 3
        - Roads Available: 12

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
### Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

### Justification:
- **Resource Situation**: You currently have [3, 0, 0, 1, 3] resources (Brick, Lumber, Ore, Grain, Wool respectively), which limits immediate building actions like settlements or roads. Rolling is necessary to gain additional resources.
- **Settlements and Cities**: Expanding resource diversity by building more settlements is critical for early-game strategy, in line with Priority 1. However, you don’t yet have the necessary resources to build a settlement.
- **Impactful Actions**: The heuristic score of 1 for this `ROLL` action suggests it’s the most strategically advantageous option available at this moment. Rolling will generate more resources, which are essential for future development and VP accumulation.
- **Future Planning**: Rolling can potentially give you resources to build roads, expand settlements, or upgrade to cities later on, aligning with your ultimate goal of maximizing victory points. There is no better option to take at this moment, and skipping or taking repetitive/low-impact actions would be suboptimal.
