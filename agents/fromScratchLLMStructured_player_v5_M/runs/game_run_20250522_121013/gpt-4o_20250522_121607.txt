Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [1, 0, 0, 1, 1]
        - Settlements: []
        - Cities: [12, 10]
        - Victory Points (VP): 4
        - Roads Available: 0

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
Given the context provided, there appears to only be one viable *Available Action* listed: `Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)`. However, this action has minimal strategic value (heuristic score: 1), which suggests it does not directly advance the goal of maximizing Victory Points (VP) efficiently.

Let's assess the situation:
1. **Goal Priorities**:
   - Current resources `[1, 0, 0, 1, 1]` (representing 1 Brick, 0 Ore, 0 Wheat, 1 Wood, 1 Sheep).
   - The resource pool is insufficient for building any settlements (requires 1 Brick, 1 Wood, 1 Wheat, and 1 Sheep) or cities (requires 3 Wheat and 2 Ore).
   - You lack roads, which hinders expansion to new settlement locations.

2. **Strategic Options**:
   - Without additional *Available Actions* (such as trading, building, expanding, or disrupting opponents), the only path is to **end the turn**, acquire more resources through the next roll, and gradually build toward actionable goals.

### Action: `Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)`

### Justification:
With no viable actions to advance VP growth at the current state (due to insufficient resources and roads available), ending the turn is necessary to collect resources in the next round. Prioritize gathering enough resources to either:
1. Build settlements and roads early (goal: resource diversity and board control).
2. Upgrade settlements to cities later (goal: increased VP returns for efficiency). 

Ending the turn prepares you for these future actions.
