Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 1, 0, 4, 1]
        - Settlements: [23, 16]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 2
        - Roads Available: 11

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
Based on the available resources and actions, the optimal decision focuses on advancing toward the next step to increase Victory Points while following the priorities of expansion and resource diversity.

### Analysis:

1. **Current Resources: [0, 1, 0, 4, 1]**
   - Resources are represented as [Brick, Wood, Sheep, Wheat, Ore].
   - You lack Brick, Wood, and Sheep to construct new Roads or Settlements.
   - However, you have a surplus of Wheat (4), which can be converted using Maritime Trade.

2. **Available Actions:**
   - Ending the Turn (`END_TURN`): Low impact with no immediate progression.
   - Play Knight Card (`PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD`): Does not directly contribute to VP or resource diversity unless blocking an opponent's key tile.
   - Maritime Trade: Allows trading Wheat (4:1 rate) into a resource that could help expand options for building or setting up future trades.

3. **Best Maritime Trade Options:**
   - Brick: Critical for Roads and Settlements.
   - Wood: Also critical for Roads and Settlements.
   - Ore: Potentially helps upgrade to Cities but should not be prioritized yet as you lack resources for Cities.
   - Sheep: Needed for Settlements.

4. **Settlement Expansion Priority:**
   - Building new Settlements requires: 1 Brick, 1 Wood, 1 Sheep, 1 Wheat.

   Since both Brick and Wood are prerequisites for Roads (to expand to new settlement spots), these are of higher immediate value than Sheep or Ore.

### Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'BRICK'))

### Justification:
- Trading 4 Wheat for 1 Brick gets you closer to the combination needed to expand with a Road or Settlement.
- Brick and Wood are currently the most critical resources, and since Wood is also unavailable, selecting Brick ensures progress toward VP-efficient actions (building Roads and expanding Settlements).
- This action aligns with Priority 1 (build Roads/Settlements for resource diversity) while preparing for future turns effectively.
