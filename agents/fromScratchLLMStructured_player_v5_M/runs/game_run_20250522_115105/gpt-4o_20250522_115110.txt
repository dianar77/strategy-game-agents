========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(0, 1))

Justification: All available actions have equivalent heuristic scores of 5, indicating they are equally desirable from a strategic perspective according to the provided scoring system. Since there is no differentiating factor in the heuristic scores or additional context provided, (0, 1) is chosen arbitrarily from the available actions. If further context, like positional significance on the board or future development opportunities, existed, that could influence the decision.
