        Heuristic Scores for Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Please respond with the optimal action and briefly explain why it was chosen. Format:

========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)  
Justification: Rolling the dice is the only available action at this moment, and it has a heuristic score of 1. Rolling the dice progresses the game by generating resources based on established settlements and cities, potentially helping to unlock future build actions like roads, settlements, or cities. Additionally, rolling is essential to continue gathering resources to work toward victory points.
