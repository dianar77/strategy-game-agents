========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(1, 2))  
Justification: All three available actions have identical heuristic scores of 5, meaning they are evaluated as equally beneficial based on the game's current state. In the absence of a clear differentiator, the first action in the list, `(1, 2)`, is chosen arbitrarily as per convention to break ties.
