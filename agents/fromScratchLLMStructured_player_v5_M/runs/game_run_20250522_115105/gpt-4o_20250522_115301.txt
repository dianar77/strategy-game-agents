========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)  
Justification: The only available action in the game state is to end the turn. Since no other choices are presented, this action is optimal by default, allowing the game to progress to the next playerâ€™s turn or the next roll, maintaining the flow of the game.
