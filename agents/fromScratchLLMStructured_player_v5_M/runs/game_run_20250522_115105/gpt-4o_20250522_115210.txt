        Available Actions:

        Heuristic Scores for Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Please respond with the optimal action and briefly explain why it was chosen. Format:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the decision}
        

========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)  
Justification: Rolling the dice is the only available action in this game state. By rolling the dice, the player opens the possibility to collect more resources and progress toward building roads, settlements, or cities, which are essential for scoring additional victory points. Since it has a heuristic score of 1, it is currently the optimal choice.
