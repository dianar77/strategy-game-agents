========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)  
Justification: The only available action at this point is to end the turn. Since there are no viable options for building or trading due to insufficient resources, ending the turn is the optimal decision to progress the game.
