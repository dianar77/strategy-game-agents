        - Settlements: [0, 2]
        - Cities: []

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Please respond with the optimal action and briefly explain why it was chosen. Format:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the decision}
        

========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)  
Justification: With no other available actions apart from ending the turn, it is optimal to proceed with this action. Since there are no resources or conditions to build settlements, roads, or cities, there are no other meaningful moves to take this turn. Ending the turn allows resource generation to continue and maintains game momentum.
