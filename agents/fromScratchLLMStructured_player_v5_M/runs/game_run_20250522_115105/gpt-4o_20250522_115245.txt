        Heuristic Scores for Actions:

========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Justification: The only action available in this game state is to end the turn. Since there are no other actions to select from and no resources or conditions that could be used for meaningful plays, ending the turn is the optimal choice.
