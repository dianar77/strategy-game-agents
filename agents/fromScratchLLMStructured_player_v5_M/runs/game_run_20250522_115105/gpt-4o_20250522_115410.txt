========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)  
Justification: The only available action is to end the turn. Since no other options are presented, ending the turn is the optimal and necessary step to progress in the game while awaiting additional opportunities or resource acquisition.
