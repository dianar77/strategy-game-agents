        Heuristic Scores for Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Please respond with the optimal action and briefly explain why it was chosen. Format:

========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)  
Justification: The only available action is to roll the dice, as indicated by the game state and available actions. Rolling is necessary to advance the game and potentially generate additional resources needed for future strategic moves like building roads, settlements, or upgrading to cities. The heuristic score is 1, which confirms this is the optimal action to progress the game.
