========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)  
Justification: ROLL is the only available action currently. Rolling the dice is necessary to proceed with the game, as it determines resource production for all players. Additionally, its heuristic score is 1, which is the highest possible score in this case. Taking this action ensures the game moves forward.
