        Heuristic Scores for Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Please respond with the optimal action and briefly explain why it was chosen. Format:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the decision}
        

========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)  
Justification: With the current game state, the player does not have sufficient resources to build anything (e.g., settlements, cities, or roads) or perform any other valuable moves. The only available action is to end the turn. Ending the turn is optimal to proceed in the game and wait for future opportunities to gather more resources or take beneficial actions.
