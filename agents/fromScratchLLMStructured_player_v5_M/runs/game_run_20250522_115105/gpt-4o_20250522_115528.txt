        Heuristic Scores for Actions:

        Please respond with the optimal action and briefly explain why it was chosen. Format:

========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)  
Justification: Rolling the dice is currently the only available action, as per the game state. While the heuristic score is low (1), it is required to progress the game by generating resource roll outcomes that can improve the player's resource pool and unlock other actions such as building roads, settlements, or upgrading to cities.
