Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Here is the current game state:
        Player Stats:
        - Resources: [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]
        - Settlements: [0, 2]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points: 2
        - Roads Available: 12

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Please respond with the optimal action and briefly explain why it was chosen. Format:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the decision}
        

========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)  
Justification: Since the only available action in the current game state is to end the turn, this is the optimal move. Without any other options to improve resources, expand settlements, or build roads, the player must end their turn to allow progression of the game and gather new opportunities in subsequent turns.
