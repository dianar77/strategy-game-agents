        Heuristic Scores for Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Please respond with the optimal action and briefly explain why it was chosen. Format:

========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)  
Justification: Rolling is the only available action in the current game state, and its heuristic score is 1, indicating it is the optimal choice. Rolling the dice progresses the game by potentially generating needed resources for future actions, such as building roads, settlements, or upgrading to cities.
