        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Here is the current game state:
        Player Stats:
        - Resources: [4, 0, 0, 2, 1]
        - Settlements: [0, 2]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points: 2
        - Roads Available: 11

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Please respond with the optimal action and briefly explain why it was chosen. Format:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the decision}
        

========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)  
Justification: The only available action is to roll the dice. This action has a heuristic score of 1, and rolling in Catan typically generates resources based on the dice roll outcome and the positions of settlements. Since you have an opportunity to increase your resources, rolling is the natural optimal action to progress in the game.
