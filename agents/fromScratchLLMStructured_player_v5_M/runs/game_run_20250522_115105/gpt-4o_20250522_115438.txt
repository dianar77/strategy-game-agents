========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)  
Justification: The action to roll the dice is the only available option and also has the highest heuristic score (1). Rolling the dice advances the game by distributing resources or triggering other outcomes, allowing for opportunities to build or progress in future turns.
