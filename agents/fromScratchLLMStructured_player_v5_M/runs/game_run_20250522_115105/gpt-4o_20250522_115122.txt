        Heuristic Scores for Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Please respond with the optimal action and briefly explain why it was chosen. Format:

========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)  
Justification: Rolling is the only available action, as indicated by the game state. Furthermore, the heuristic score for this action is 1, suggesting it is the optimal move within the current context. Rolling is necessary to generate resources that can be used to expand settlements, build cities, or construct roads, all of which contribute to achieving victory points.
