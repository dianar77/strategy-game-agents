        Heuristic Scores for Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Please respond with the optimal action and briefly explain why it was chosen. Format:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the decision}
        

========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)  
Justification: The current game state shows no available resources for building, upgrading, or trading to progress significantly this turn. Additionally, there are no alternative actions presented except ending the turn. Thus, ending the turn is the optimal action to transition to the next phase of the game and hopefully acquire useful resources on the next roll.
