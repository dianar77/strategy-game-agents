========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)  
Justification: The only available action is to roll the dice, as no other actions are currently listed. Rolling is necessary to progress the game, generate resources, and gain opportunities for future actions. Additionally, the heuristic score for this action is 1, making it the optimal (and only) choice in this scenario.
