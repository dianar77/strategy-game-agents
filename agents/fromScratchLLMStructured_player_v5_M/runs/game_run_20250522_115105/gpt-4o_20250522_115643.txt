Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Here is the current game state:
        Player Stats:
        - Resources: [7, 0, 0, 0, 3]
        - Settlements: [2]
        - Cities: [0]
        - Victory Points: 3
        - Roads Available: 11

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.DISCARD: 'DISCARD'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.DISCARD: 'DISCARD'>, value=None): 1

        Please respond with the optimal action and briefly explain why it was chosen. Format:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the decision}
        

========================================

Response:
**Action:** Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.DISCARD: 'DISCARD'>, value=None)  
**Justification:** In the current game state, the only available action is to discard resources. This is likely due to exceeding the resource card limit (e.g., after rolling a 7 in Catan). While the heuristic score provides minimal insight (score of 1), it seems to confirm there is no alternative action. Discarding keeps the game moving and complies with the rules. Selecting the sole option is the logical and optimal choice to proceed.
