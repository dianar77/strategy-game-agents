========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)  
Justification: The only available action is to end the turn. Since no other actions are provided, there are no further moves that can be made during this turn, making it the optimal decision to advance the game.
