        Heuristic Scores for Actions:

        Please respond with the optimal action and briefly explain why it was chosen. Format:

========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)  
Justification: The player's current resources are insufficient to perform any meaningful upgrades, builds, or trades. The only available action to proceed in the game is to end the turn. As there are no other choices provided, it is optimal to execute the "END TURN" action to allow other players to act and to potentially gain resources during the next roll or trading opportunities.
