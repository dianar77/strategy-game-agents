        - Settlements: [0, 2]
        - Cities: []

        - Roads Available: 12

        Available Actions:

        Heuristic Scores for Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Please respond with the optimal action and briefly explain why it was chosen. Format:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the decision}
        

========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)  
Justification: Rolling is the only available action in the current game state. It allows resources to be distributed based on the dice roll, which can potentially increase the player's resource pool and enable future actions like building settlements, cities, or roads. The heuristic score indicates this action is beneficial, and taking it progresses the game state.
