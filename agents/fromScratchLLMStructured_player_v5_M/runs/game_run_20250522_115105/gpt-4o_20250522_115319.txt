        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Please respond with the optimal action and briefly explain why it was chosen. Format:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the decision}
        

========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)  
Justification: Rolling the dice is the only available action. Additionally, rolling is necessary in Catan to gain resources, and since the player's current resource count is limited ([0, 0, 1, 0, 0]), a roll could potentially improve resource acquisition and open up more opportunities for future actions. The heuristic score of 1 also confirms this action as the optimal choice in the given game state.
