========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)  
Justification: The given game state indicates that there is only one available action: ending the turn. Since no other actions are presented (such as building, upgrading, or trading), ending the turn is the only viable option to advance the game. Additionally, the heuristic score for this action is 1, reaffirming that it is appropriate in this scenario.
