========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)  
Justification: Rolling the dice is the only available action. This is essential to advance the game by generating resources, which are needed to build settlements, cities, and roads, or to trade. Since no other actions are presented, rolling optimizes progress and aligns with the heuristic score provided, ensuring the game's momentum continues.
