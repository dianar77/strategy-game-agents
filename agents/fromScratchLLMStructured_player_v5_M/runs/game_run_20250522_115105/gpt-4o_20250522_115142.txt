        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Here is the current game state:
        Player Stats:
        - Resources: [0, 0, 1, 3, 0]
        - Settlements: [0, 6]
        - Cities: []

        - Roads Available: 13

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Please respond with the optimal action and briefly explain why it was chosen. Format:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the decision}
        

========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)  
Justification: The game state indicates limited resources ([0, 0, 1, 3, 0]) which are insufficient for building any new settlements, cities, or roads. Without further possible actions to advance the player's position or earn victory points, the optimal decision is to end the turn. The heuristic score for the "END_TURN" action is the highest (1), which supports this choice as the best move under the current circumstances. Ending the turn allows for a new round where additional resources can potentially be gathered to improve the player's position.
