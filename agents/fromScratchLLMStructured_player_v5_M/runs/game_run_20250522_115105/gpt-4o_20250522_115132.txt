Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Here is the current game state:
        Player Stats:
        - Resources: [0, 0, 2, 2, 0]
        - Settlements: [0, 6]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points: 2
        - Roads Available: 13

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Please respond with the optimal action and briefly explain why it was chosen. Format:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the decision}
        

========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)  
Justification: The only available action is to roll the dice, which is the prerequisite step to generate resources for making progress in the game (e.g., building roads, settlements, or cities). Since there are no other actions to consider, this is both the optimal and necessary choice.
