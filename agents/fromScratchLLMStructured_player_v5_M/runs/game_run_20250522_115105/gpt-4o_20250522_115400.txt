========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)  
Justification: The current game state indicates that there are no resources available to take any productive actions, such as building roads, settlements, or cities. Additionally, there is only one available action—ending the turn—making it optimal by default. Ending the turn allows the collection of new resources on the next player's turn or when dice are rolled, enabling progress in the game.
