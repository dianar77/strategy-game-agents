        Heuristic Scores for Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Please respond with the optimal action and briefly explain why it was chosen. Format:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the decision}
        

========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)  
Justification: The given game state does not allow for any other actions aside from ending the turn. With limited resources (3 wheat and 3 brick, no wood, sheep, or ore), it is impossible to build roads, settlements, or cities. The heuristic score for ending the turn is 1, indicating it is the only viable action. Ending the turn allows progression to the next phase, where new resources or opportunities may be obtained.
