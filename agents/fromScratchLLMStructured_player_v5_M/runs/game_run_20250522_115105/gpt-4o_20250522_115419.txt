========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)  
Justification: The only available action is to end the turn. Given the current game state, there are no other actions that can be taken due to insufficient resources or unavailability of other options. Ending the turn allows progression of the game, leading to the possibility of acquiring new resources or opportunities on the next turn.
