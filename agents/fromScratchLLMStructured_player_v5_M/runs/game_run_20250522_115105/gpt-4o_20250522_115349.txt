        - Roads Available: 12

        Available Actions:

        Heuristic Scores for Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Please respond with the optimal action and briefly explain why it was chosen. Format:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the decision}
        

========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)  
Justification: Rolling is the only action available at this stage of the game. Since rolling the dice determines resource production, it is a necessary step to progress the game and potentially gain resources for future actions. Additionally, it has a heuristic score of 1, making it the best (and only) option.
