========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)  
Justification: Rolling the dice is the only available action in this game state. It has a heuristic score of 1, indicating that it is the optimal action to proceed, as it allows the player to potentially collect more resources and advance their position in the game. Without resources, further actions like building settlements, roads, or upgrading to cities are not possible.
