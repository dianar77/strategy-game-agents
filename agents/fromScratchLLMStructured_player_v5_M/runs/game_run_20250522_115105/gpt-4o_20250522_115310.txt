========================================

Response:
**Action:** Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(1, 2))  
**Justification:** All three actions have equal heuristic scores (5), so there isn't a clear numerical advantage to prioritize any one over the others. In the absence of further context (e.g., board geography or strategic priorities), selecting the first available action is a fair and valid decision. It allows for progress towards potentially securing new settlement spots or connecting to valuable game areas.
