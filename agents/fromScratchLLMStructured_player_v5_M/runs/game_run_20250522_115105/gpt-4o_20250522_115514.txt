========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)  
Justification: Rolling is the only available and valid action in this game state. Taking this action progresses the game and allows resources to potentially be generated, which are necessary for future actions like building settlements, cities, or roads.
