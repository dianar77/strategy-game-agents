========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.DISCARD: 'DISCARD'>, value=None)  
Justification: This is the only available action in the current game state. Since discarding resources is mandatory (likely due to a robber or certain game rules), there are no alternative options. Thus, this action must be chosen by default to continue the game.
