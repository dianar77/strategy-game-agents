========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)  
Justification: There is only one available action: ending the turn. No other options are presented, and the heuristic score for this action is 1, signaling that it is the optimal choice given the current game state. Ending the turn allows other players to proceed and may create opportunities to gather more resources or plan better moves in subsequent turns.
