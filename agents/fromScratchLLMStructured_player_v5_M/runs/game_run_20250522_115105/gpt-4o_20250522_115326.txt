========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)  
Justification: Currently, no actions other than rolling the dice are available. Rolling the dice is necessary to generate resources, which will allow for further actions like building roads, settlements, or cities. It is the optimal and only viable choice at this stage to progress the game. Additionally, the heuristic score for this action is 1, indicating it is favorable within the given constraints.
