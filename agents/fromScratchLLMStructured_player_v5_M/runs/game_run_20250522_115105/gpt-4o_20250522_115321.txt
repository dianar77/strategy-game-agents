========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)  
Justification: The current game state indicates that your resources are limited ([0, 0, 1, 0, 0]), preventing you from performing any meaningful construction or development actions such as building settlements, roads, or purchasing development cards. With no other available actions to take, the optimal choice is to end your turn and wait for resource production in future turns to improve your position.
