========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(6, 7))  
Justification: All actions have identical heuristic scores of 5, which means they are equally valued based on current scoring methods. Since there is no additional context provided (such as strategy focusing on certain map areas or future setups), the action `(6, 7)` is chosen arbitrarily among the options. Any of the three could reasonably be selected.
