========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)  
Justification: The current game state indicates that no other actions are available apart from ending the turn. Additionally, the heuristic score for this action is 1, which suggests it is the optimal (and only viable) choice at this moment. Ending the turn allows the game to progress while awaiting a more favorable resource collection or action opportunity in the next round.
