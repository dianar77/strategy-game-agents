        - Settlements: [0, 6]

        Heuristic Scores for Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Please respond with the optimal action and briefly explain why it was chosen. Format:

========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)  
Justification: Rolling the dice is the only action available in this turn, as no other actions are listed in the game state. Furthermore, the heuristic score for this action is 1, and given no alternatives to compare against, rolling the dice progresses the game and creates potential resource generation opportunities for future moves.
