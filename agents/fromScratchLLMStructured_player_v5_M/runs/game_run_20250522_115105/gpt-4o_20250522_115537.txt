Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Here is the current game state:
        Player Stats:
        - Resources: [0, 0, 0, 0, 2]
        - Settlements: [0, 2]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points: 2
        - Roads Available: 11

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Please respond with the optimal action and briefly explain why it was chosen. Format:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the decision}
        

========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)  
Justification: Based on the game state and heuristic scores, the only action available is to end the turn. Since you currently lack the resources (no [0, 0, 0, 0, 2] relevant to building settlements, cities, or roads), there is no productive move to make. Ending the turn is the optimal choice to allow the game to progress and potentially gather more resources or opportunities in the next turn.
