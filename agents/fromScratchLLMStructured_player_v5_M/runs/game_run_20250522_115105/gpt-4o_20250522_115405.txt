        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Here is the current game state:
        Player Stats:
        - Resources: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
        - Settlements: [0, 2]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points: 2
        - Roads Available: 12

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Please respond with the optimal action and briefly explain why it was chosen. Format:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the decision}
        

========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)  
Justification: The roll action is the only available action in this game state. Rolling the dice is essential to advance the game, potentially acquiring resources based on settlement locations and enabling further actions such as building or upgrading in subsequent turns. With a heuristic score of 1, this action is the most optimal (and only) choice at this point.
