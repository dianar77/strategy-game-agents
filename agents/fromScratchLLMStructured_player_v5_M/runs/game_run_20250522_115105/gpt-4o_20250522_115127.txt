Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Here is the current game state:
        Player Stats:
        - Resources: [0, 0, 2, 2, 0]
        - Settlements: [0, 6]
        - Cities: []

        - Roads Available: 13

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Please respond with the optimal action and briefly explain why it was chosen. Format:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the decision}
        

========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)  
Justification: Given the current game state, the player has limited resources ([0, 0, 2, 2, 0]), meaning no immediate actions such as building roads, settlements, or cities are feasible. Furthermore, only one action is available, which is to end the turn. Since no other strategic options can be pursued at this moment, ending the turn is the optimal choice to wait for new resources or opportunities in the next round.
