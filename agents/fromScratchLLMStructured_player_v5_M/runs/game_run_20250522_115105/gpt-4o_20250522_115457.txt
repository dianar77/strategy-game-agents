========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(0, 1))

Justification: All actions have identical heuristic scores (5) and the same action type. In cases where the scores and action types are equal, any of the options is valid as they all have the same priority. I arbitrarily chose the first action for simplicity and consistency.
