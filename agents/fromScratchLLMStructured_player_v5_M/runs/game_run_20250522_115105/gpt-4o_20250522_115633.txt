        Please respond with the optimal action and briefly explain why it was chosen. Format:

        Justification: {Reasoning behind the decision}
        

========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.DISCARD: 'DISCARD'>, value=None)

Justification: The game state indicates that the only available action at this moment is to discard. This is likely due to a rule like exceeding the resource hand limit after a dice roll of 7, forcing the player to discard half their resources (rounded down). With 9 resources currently, this would require discarding 4 resources. Since this is the only action available, it must be selected to proceed to the next stage of the game.
