        Please respond with the optimal action and briefly explain why it was chosen. Format:
        Action: {Chosen Action}

========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)  
Justification: The only available action is to roll the dice (`ROLL`). Rolling is necessary to generate resource production and progress the game, as you currently have insufficient resources (especially wood and brick) to build roads or other structures. Since there are no alternative actions, this is the optimal move to advance your position.
