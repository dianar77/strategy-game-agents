        - Settlements: [0, 6]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points: 2
        - Roads Available: 13

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Please respond with the optimal action and briefly explain why it was chosen. Format:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the decision}
        

========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)  
Justification: The only available action is to roll the dice, as highlighted in the game state provided. Rolling is critical at this point to generate resources, which are necessary for building settlements, roads, and upgrading to cities, all of which contribute to the path toward victory. The heuristic score of 1 for this action further supports it as the optimal choice.
