========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Justification: Based on the current game state and heuristic scores, all available actions have the same score of 1. However, the player has no resources to trade for a maritime trade (as they lack the required 4 "WHEAT" for any maritime trade action). Thus, attempting maritime trade isn't viable. With no meaningful actions left to improve the immediate situation, the optimal decision is to select the "END_TURN" action, allowing play to proceed and offering the chance for more favorable opportunities in the next turn.
