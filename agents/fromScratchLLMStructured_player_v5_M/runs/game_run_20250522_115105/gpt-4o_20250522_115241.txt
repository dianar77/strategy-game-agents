        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Here is the current game state:
        Player Stats:
        - Resources: [1, 0, 1, 3, 0]
        - Settlements: [0, 6]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points: 2
        - Roads Available: 13

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Please respond with the optimal action and briefly explain why it was chosen. Format:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the decision}
        

========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Justification: The current game state provides only one available actionâ€”ending the turn. Since no other actions are possible (e.g., building roads, settlements, etc.) due to insufficient resources or other restrictions, the optimal choice is to end the turn and wait for a better opportunity on the next turn.
