        Heuristic Scores for Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Please respond with the optimal action and briefly explain why it was chosen. Format:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the decision}
        

========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)  
Justification: The only available action is "ROLL," which has a heuristic score of 1. Rolling the dice is essential to progress the game by generating resources based on the board setup, potentially enabling future actions like building roads, settlements, or cities. Since no other options are provided, rolling is the optimal move to maintain momentum in the game.
