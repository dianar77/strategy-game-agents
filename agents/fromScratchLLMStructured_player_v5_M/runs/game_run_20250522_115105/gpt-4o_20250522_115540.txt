========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)  
Justification: The current game state indicates no other available actions except ending the turn. Additionally, the heuristic score for ending the turn is 1, which confirms it as the optimal decision given the circumstances. Ending the turn helps advance the game and provides an opportunity to gather more resources or make more impactful moves in the next round.
