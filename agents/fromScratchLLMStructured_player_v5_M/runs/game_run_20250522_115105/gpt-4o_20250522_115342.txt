========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)  
Justification: Rolling the dice is the only available action at this game state. It is necessary to proceed with the game and potentially collect resources, which are essential for building settlements, cities, and roads to increase Victory Points and progress toward winning the game. The heuristic score also indicates that this action is optimal given the current circumstances.
