========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)  
Justification: Given the current game state, you only have 2 wood resources and no other resources necessary to perform any substantial building actions. Additionally, the available actions suggest that the only option is to end your turn. Ending the turn is optimal since it allows you to move on and gather more resources in future turns to enable stronger moves later in the game.
