        Here is the current game state:
        Player Stats:
        - Resources: [0, 0, 2, 0, 0]
        - Settlements: [0, 2]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points: 2
        - Roads Available: 12

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Please respond with the optimal action and briefly explain why it was chosen. Format:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the decision}
        

========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)  
Justification: Rolling the dice is the only available action at this stage in the game. It is essential to progress and potentially gain resources to build settlements, cities, or roads, as the current resource pool is insufficient to take further actions. Additionally, its heuristic score is 1, indicating it is the optimal choice.
