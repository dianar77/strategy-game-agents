        Heuristic Scores for Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Please respond with the optimal action and briefly explain why it was chosen. Format:

========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)  
Justification: Rolling is the only available action at this stage, and it has a heuristic score of 1. Rolling will generate resources based on the dice and the board state, which is the next necessary step to progress in the game. This ensures continued development and creates opportunities for future actions.
