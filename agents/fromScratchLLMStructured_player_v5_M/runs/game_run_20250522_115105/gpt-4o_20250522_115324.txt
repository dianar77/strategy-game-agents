        Please respond with the optimal action and briefly explain why it was chosen. Format:

========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)  
Justification: Given the current game state, the player has insufficient resources (only 1 wheat) to perform any meaningful building or development actions, such as constructing roads, settlements, or upgrading settlements to cities. The only available action is to end the turn, as no other options are presented or feasible at this time. Ending the turn allows the player to proceed in the game and potentially acquire more resources on future rolls to expand further.
