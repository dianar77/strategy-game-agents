========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)  
Justification: The only available action to take is to end the turn. No other actions are listed, and as such, this choice is optimal by default. Ending the turn will pass the game state to the next phase or player, allowing progression.
