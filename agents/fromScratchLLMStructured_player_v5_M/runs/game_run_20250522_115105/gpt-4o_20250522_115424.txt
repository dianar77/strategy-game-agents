        - Settlements: [0, 2]
        - Cities: []

        - Roads Available: 12

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Please respond with the optimal action and briefly explain why it was chosen. Format:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the decision}
        

========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)  
Justification: The "ROLL" action is the only available action, with a heuristic score of 1. Rolling the dice advances the game by potentially generating resources for you and other players, which is crucial for progressing toward building settlements, cities, or roads. Since no other actions are presented, this is the optimal and necessary next step.
