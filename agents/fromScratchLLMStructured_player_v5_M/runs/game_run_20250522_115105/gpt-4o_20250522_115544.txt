========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)  
Justification: The only available action is to roll the dice, as there are no other actions currently presented. Rolling the dice is necessary to advance the game, as it will determine which resources are produced for all players. This will create opportunities to make progress and take further actions in subsequent turns.
