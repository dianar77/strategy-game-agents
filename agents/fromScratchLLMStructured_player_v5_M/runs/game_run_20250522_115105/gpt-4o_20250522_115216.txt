========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)  
Justification: All heuristic scores for the actions are equal at 1, which indicates that none of the maritime trade actions provide any distinct advantage given the current resources and game state. Since trading wheat (which appears you don't have any of) for other resources is not immediately beneficial and there are no other actions available, the best course of action is to end the turn. This maximizes efficiency by allowing the game to progress with the possibility of gaining new resources from the next turn.
