========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)  
Justification: Rolling the dice is the only available action in this state. Without any possibility to trade, build, or perform other actions, rolling is necessary to advance the game and potentially gather more resources for future actions. Additionally, it has the highest heuristic score (1), indicating it is optimal based on the current game state.
