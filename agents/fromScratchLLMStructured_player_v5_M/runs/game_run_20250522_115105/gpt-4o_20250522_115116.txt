        Heuristic Scores for Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Please respond with the optimal action and briefly explain why it was chosen. Format:

========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)  
Justification: Rolling the dice is the only available action at this stage. It progresses the game state by potentially providing new resources or opportunities for development, which the player currently needs to expand or build settlements, cities, or roads. The heuristic score of 1 indicates that rolling is a reasonable option to move forward.
