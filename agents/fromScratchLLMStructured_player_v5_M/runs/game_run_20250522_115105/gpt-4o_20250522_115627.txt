        Heuristic Scores for Actions:

        Please respond with the optimal action and briefly explain why it was chosen. Format:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the decision}
        

========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)  
Justification: The "ROLL" action is the only available action, meaning there are no other decisions to evaluate. Rolling the dice is essential for progressing the game, as it generates resources for building and advancing your position. Its heuristic score of 1 reflects this necessity in the current turn. Hence, it's the optimal and mandatory move.
