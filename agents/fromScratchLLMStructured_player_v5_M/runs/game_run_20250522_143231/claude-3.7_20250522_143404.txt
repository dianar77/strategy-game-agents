Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [1, 0, 0, 0, 2]
        - Settlements: [19]
        - Cities: [14]
        - Victory Points (VP): 3
        - Roads Available: 13

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}

# Game Analysis

## Action: END_TURN

## Justification:
Looking at the current game state, I have only 1 brick and 2 wheat available as resources, with no other options besides ending my turn. While I clearly need to expand, I simply don't have the necessary resources to build anything at this moment:

1. Building a settlement requires 1 brick, 1 wood, 1 wheat, and 1 sheep
2. Building a road requires 1 brick and 1 wood
3. Upgrading to a city requires 2 wheat and 3 ore

With my current resources (1 brick, 0 wood, 0 sheep, 0 ore, 2 wheat), I can't perform any construction actions. The only choice is to end my turn and hope for better resource collection on the next roll. Since there are no trading or development card options listed, ending my turn is the only logical move to make progress in future turns.
