Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [1, 0, 0, 2, 3]
        - Settlements: [14, 19]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 2
        - Roads Available: 13

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_CITY: 'BUILD_CITY'>, value=14)
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_CITY: 'BUILD_CITY'>, value=19)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_CITY: 'BUILD_CITY'>, value=14): 15
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_CITY: 'BUILD_CITY'>, value=19): 15

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
I need to evaluate which action will maximize my victory points most efficiently.

Looking at my resources: [1, 0, 0, 2, 3] - likely representing [Brick, Lumber, Wool, Grain, Ore]

For building a city, I need 2 Grain and 3 Ore, which I currently have. Building a city upgrades a settlement, giving me +1 VP and doubling resource production at that location.

Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_CITY: 'BUILD_CITY'>, value=14)

Justification: Both city options have the same heuristic score (15), indicating they're equally beneficial. Since I have exactly the required resources (2 Grain, 3 Ore) to build a city, I should take advantage of this opportunity to upgrade a settlement. Building a city will increase my VPs from 2 to 3 and double my resource collection at location 14, allowing for faster expansion in future turns. This is more strategic than ending my turn without using available resources.
