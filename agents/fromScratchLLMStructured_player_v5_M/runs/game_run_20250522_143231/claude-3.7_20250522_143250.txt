Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
        - Settlements: [14]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 1
        - Roads Available: 15

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(13, 14))
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(14, 15))
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(14, 37))

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(13, 14)): 10
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(14, 15)): 10
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(14, 37)): 10

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
I need to analyze which road building direction would be most strategic for my expansion.

Looking at the options, I have three potential roads from settlement 14. All actions have the same heuristic score (10), suggesting they're equally beneficial according to the immediate evaluation. However, strategic road placement depends on where I want to expand next.

Without seeing the full board layout, resource production locations, or opponent positions, my decision needs to rely on general principles of connectivity:

Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(14, 15))

Justification: I'm choosing to build toward node 15 as it likely represents a forward expansion path. Road building follows a sequential pattern, and lower-numbered nodes (15) are typically more centrally located on the board than higher-numbered ones (37). This road should provide better opportunities for future settlement placement at important resource-generating hexes. Building toward node 15 also maintains the connectivity of my network while potentially giving me more options for my next settlement placement, which is crucial for early resource diversification as mentioned in priority #1.
