Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
        - Settlements: [19]
        - Cities: [14]
        - Victory Points (VP): 3
        - Roads Available: 13

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
I'll analyze this situation for the optimal move in the Catanatron Minigame.

Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

Justification: Since there is only one available action - to roll the dice - this is clearly the optimal choice. Rolling is a fundamental action that can provide me with additional resources based on the dice outcome, which I critically need right now. I currently have only one brick resource and no other resources, making it impossible to build anything. A good dice roll could give me wood, sheep, wheat, or ore that would allow me to build roads or save toward settlements/cities. With 3 VP already and plenty of settlements, cities, and roads available for building, my next strategic moves will depend entirely on acquiring more resources through this roll. This action aligns with my primary goal of resource acquisition to enable expansion.
