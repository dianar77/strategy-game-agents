Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 0, 0, 2, 1]
        - Settlements: [14, 19]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 2
        - Roads Available: 13

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
I'll assess the current game state and available actions to make an optimal decision.

Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Justification: I have no choice but to end my turn since it's the only available action. Currently, I have insufficient resources to build anything new - I only have 2 wood and 1 sheep, which isn't enough for any construction (roads need 1 brick/1 wood, settlements need 1 brick/1 wood/1 wheat/1 sheep, cities need 2 wheat/3 ore). While ending turns isn't ideal, it's necessary in this case to collect more resources on the next round. My existing settlements at positions 14 and 19 will help generate more resources on future turns, which will eventually enable me to continue expanding my network of settlements and roads according to the game's priorities.
