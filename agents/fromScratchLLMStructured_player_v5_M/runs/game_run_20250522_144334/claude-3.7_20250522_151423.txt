Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 2, 3, 1, 0]
        - Settlements: [0, 21, 46]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 3
        - Roads Available: 6

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
Action: ROLL
Justification: I need to roll the dice to generate more resources, which is the only available action at this point. I currently have 2 brick, 3 wood, 1 sheep, and no ore or wheat. While I have enough brick and wood to potentially build a road, I cannot execute that action until after rolling. This roll will hopefully provide additional resources that can be used for building settlements, roads, or saving toward city upgrades. With 3 settlements already placed at positions 0, 21, and 46, a good roll could significantly improve my resource position for future turns.
