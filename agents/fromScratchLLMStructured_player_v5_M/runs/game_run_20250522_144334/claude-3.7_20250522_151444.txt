Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [1, 3, 0, 1, 0]
        - Settlements: [0, 21, 46]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 3
        - Roads Available: 6

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(45, 46))

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}

========================================

Response:
I'll analyze the current game state and available actions to make the best strategic decision.

**Analysis:**
- We have resources [1, 3, 0, 1, 0] which means 1 brick, 3 wood, 0 sheep, 1 ore, and 0 wheat
- We can build roads (cost: 1 brick, 1 wood)
- We have enough resources to build 1 road (using 1 brick, 1 wood)
- We have settlements at positions 0, 21, and 46
- Building roads should prioritize expanding from our existing settlements to enable future settlement construction

**Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(45, 46))**

**Justification:** I'm choosing to build a road at (45, 46) because it extends from our existing settlement at position 46. This road will help us expand our network in that area, potentially opening up new valuable spots for settlement placement. Since we already have a settlement at position 46, building a road from this location follows our primary strategy of expanding from current positions to diversify our resource collection. This is preferable to ending our turn without using our available resources, as it progresses us toward additional settlement possibilities in future turns, which will increase our resource income and victory points.
