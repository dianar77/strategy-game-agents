Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [2, 0, 3, 2, 0]
        - Settlements: [5, 3]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 2
        - Roads Available: 10

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}

Response:
# Analysis of Current Game State

Looking at the game state:
- Resources: [2, 0, 3, 2, 0] (Brick, Ore, Sheep, Wheat, Wood)
- 2 settlements already built (at positions 5 and 3)
- 0 cities built
- 2 VP total (from the settlements)
- 10 roads still available to build

# Available Actions Review

The only available action is:
- End Turn

# Decision

Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Justification: In this situation, ending my turn is the only option available. While generally I want to avoid ending turns without taking actions, I currently lack the proper resource combinations to build anything meaningful. I have brick (2), sheep (3), and wheat (2), but no ore or wood. This means I can't build:
- Roads (need brick + wood)
- Settlements (need brick + wood + sheep + wheat)
- Cities (need ore + wheat)
- Development cards (need ore + sheep + wheat)

The best strategy now is to end my turn and hope for better resource rolls on the next turn. With my current settlements, I'll be collecting resources that should enable construction actions in upcoming turns. When those resources arrive, I'll prioritize expanding with roads and settlements to increase my resource generation capability.
