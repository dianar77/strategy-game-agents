Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [1, 0, 3, 0, 1]
        - Settlements: [7, 16]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 3
        - Roads Available: 9

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
Action: END_TURN
Justification: Since there is only one available action (END_TURN), I must take this action despite wanting to be more strategic. With my current resources [1, 0, 3, 0, 1] (representing [Brick, Ore, Sheep, Wheat, Wood]), I don't have sufficient materials to build roads (need Brick+Wood), settlements (need Brick+Wood+Sheep+Wheat), or cities (need Ore+Wheat). The best strategy now is to end my turn and wait for new resource collection to enable more impactful actions in the next round. With settlements at positions 7 and 16, I'll hopefully collect resources on the next dice roll to execute expansion plans.
