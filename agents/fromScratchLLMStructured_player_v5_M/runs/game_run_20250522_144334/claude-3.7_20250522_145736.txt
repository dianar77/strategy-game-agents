Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 0, 0, 1, 3]
        - Settlements: [7, 16]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 5
        - Roads Available: 6

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

Justification: Since there is only one available action - rolling the dice - this is clearly the optimal choice. Rolling the dice is a fundamental game mechanic that allows me to potentially gather more resources based on the numbers rolled and the positions of my settlements. With my current resources (0 brick, 0 lumber, 0 wool, 1 grain, 3 ore), I'm particularly rich in ore which is excellent for city upgrades, but I need more diverse resources to execute other strategies. Rolling the dice gives me the chance to collect additional resources that could enable building roads, settlements, or upgrading to cities in subsequent turns. This action is necessary to progress in the game and cannot be skipped.
