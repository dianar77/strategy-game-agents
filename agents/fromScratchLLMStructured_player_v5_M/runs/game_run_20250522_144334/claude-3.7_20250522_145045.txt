Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 1, 2, 0, 0]
        - Settlements: [7, 16]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 3
        - Roads Available: 10

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
I need to choose the optimal action based on the current game state and available actions.

Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Justification: I only have one available action, which is to end my turn. While generally I should avoid ending turns unnecessarily, in this case I have no other options. With my current resources [0, 1, 2, 0, 0] (likely representing [brick, wood, sheep, wheat, ore]), I don't have sufficient materials to build any new structures. I have 1 wood and 2 sheep, but building anything requires specific resource combinations (e.g., settlements need brick, wood, sheep, and wheat). Ending my turn will allow me to collect new resources on the next roll, positioning me better for future expansion. I already have two settlements (at positions 7 and 16) giving me 2 VP, plus likely 1 additional VP from another source, for my current 3 VP total.
