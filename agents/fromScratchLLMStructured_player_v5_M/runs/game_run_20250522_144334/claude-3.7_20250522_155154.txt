Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 0, 2, 1, 0]
        - Settlements: [5, 3]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 2
        - Roads Available: 10

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
I'll analyze the current state and available actions for the Catanatron Minigame.

Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Justification: In this situation, I only have one available action which is to end my turn. With my current resources [0, 0, 2, 1, 0] (likely representing [Brick, Lumber, Wool, Grain, Ore]), I don't have sufficient resources to build any new settlements (which require brick, lumber, wool, and grain), roads (which require brick and lumber), or upgrade to cities (which require ore and grain). I have 2 settlements already placed (at positions 5 and 3) but cannot expand further with my current resources. The optimal play is to end my turn to collect more resources on the next roll, which will hopefully give me the brick and lumber needed to build roads or additional materials to work toward other development options. Ending the turn is the only viable action to progress the game state at this moment.
