Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 2, 1, 0, 1]
        - Settlements: [22]
        - Cities: [6]
        - Victory Points (VP): 3
        - Roads Available: 13

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

Justification: This is the only available action at this moment, which is to roll the dice. Rolling is a fundamental game mechanic that will potentially gain us more resources based on the numbers rolled and our settlement/city positions. With our current resources (2 wood, 1 brick, 0 sheep, 0 ore, 1 wheat), we're close to being able to build a road (costs 1 wood, 1 brick) but need more resources for other builds. Since we already have two settlements and one city established, a good roll could provide the resources needed to continue our expansion strategy or upgrade existing settlements. Rolling is the necessary first step in this turn to move forward with any strategic plans.
