Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [3, 0, 2, 2, 0]
        - Settlements: [0, 21, 46]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 3
        - Roads Available: 7

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Justification: In this situation, I have no choice but to end my turn since it's the only available action presented. Looking at my current resources [3, 0, 2, 2, 0] (representing [Brick, Grain, Lumber, Ore, Wool]), I don't have the correct combination to build anything new. For a new settlement, I would need [1, 1, 1, 0, 1], for a city I would need [0, 2, 0, 3, 0], and for a road [1, 0, 1, 0, 0]. While I have sufficient brick and lumber for roads, I'm missing combinations for other builds. Ending the turn allows me to collect more diverse resources on the next roll, which will hopefully enable more strategic moves in the following turn to expand my position with my 3 settlements and 7 remaining roads.
