Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [2, 0, 3, 0, 0]
        - Settlements: [5, 3]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 2
        - Roads Available: 10

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}

# Game Analysis

## Action: END_TURN

## Justification:
I only have one available action - to end my turn. This is because with my current resources [2, 0, 3, 0, 0] (representing [Brick, Ore, Sheep, Wheat, Wood]), I cannot build any meaningful structures:

1. For a road, I would need [1 Brick, 1 Wood] but I have 0 Wood.
2. For a settlement, I would need [1 Brick, 1 Sheep, 1 Wheat, 1 Wood] but I'm missing Wheat and Wood.
3. For a city upgrade, I would need [2 Wheat, 3 Ore] but I have 0 Wheat and only 0 Ore.
4. For a development card, I would need [1 Sheep, 1 Wheat, 1 Ore] but I'm missing Wheat and Ore.

With 2 Brick and 3 Sheep but no complementary resources, the only rational choice is to end my turn and hope to gather more useful resource combinations on subsequent turns. My priority will be to collect Wood and Wheat to enable building roads and settlements in my next turns.
