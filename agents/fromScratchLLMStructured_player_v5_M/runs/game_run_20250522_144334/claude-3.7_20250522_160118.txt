Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [2, 0, 2, 1, 0]
        - Settlements: [5, 3]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 2
        - Roads Available: 9

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
I need to evaluate my current situation and make a strategic decision.

Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Justification: Since this is the only available action, I must end my turn. I currently have resources [2, 0, 2, 1, 0] (likely representing Brick, Wool, Ore, Grain, Lumber) but can't take any building actions this turn. This suggests I don't have the right resource combinations for building roads (brick+lumber), settlements (brick+wool+grain+lumber), or cities (3 ore+2 grain). By ending my turn now, I'll collect new resources on the next roll which will hopefully give me the combinations needed to expand my network. With 2 settlements already placed and 9 roads available, I should focus on collecting complementary resources on my next turn to build either a road (if I get lumber) or work toward a new settlement or city upgrade.
