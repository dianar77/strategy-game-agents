Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 2, 0, 1, 0]
        - Settlements: [0, 21, 46]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 3
        - Roads Available: 5

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Justification: In this situation, I have no choice but to end my turn since it's the only available action. With current resources [0, 2, 0, 1, 0] (likely representing [Brick, Lumber, Wool, Grain, Ore]), I don't have enough materials for any meaningful construction. I have 2 Lumber and 1 Grain, but building a settlement requires Brick, Lumber, Wool, and Grain, while building a road requires Brick and Lumber. Since I'm lacking Brick (for either option) and Wool (for settlements), I can't make any strategic moves this turn. Ending my turn now allows me to collect more resources on the next round and hopefully gain the necessary materials for expansion on my next turn.
