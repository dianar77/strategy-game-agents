Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [3, 0, 1, 0, 2]
        - Settlements: [7, 16]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 6
        - Roads Available: 3

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

Justification: The only available action at this moment is to roll the dice, which is a mandatory action to progress the game. Rolling will determine which resources all players receive based on the hexes adjacent to their settlements/cities. With my current resources [3 brick, 0 wood, 1 sheep, 0 ore, 2 wheat], I'm hoping for a good roll that will add more resources to my inventory, particularly wood and ore which I'm currently lacking. A good roll could potentially enable building new roads or even upgrading a settlement to a city (which requires 3 ore and 2 wheat). Since I already have 6 VP and some established settlements, I'm in a good position to capitalize on new resources from this roll.
