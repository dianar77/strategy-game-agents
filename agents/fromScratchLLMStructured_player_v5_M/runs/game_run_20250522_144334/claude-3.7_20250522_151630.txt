Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 1, 1, 1, 0]
        - Settlements: [3, 5]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 2
        - Roads Available: 11

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
I'll analyze the current game state and make the most strategic decision.

Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Justification: In the current state, I have resources [0, 1, 1, 1, 0] which corresponds to [Brick=0, Wool=1, Grain=1, Lumber=1, Ore=0]. While I have some resources, I don't have enough of the right combination to build anything productive:
- For a road, I need 1 brick and 1 lumber, but I lack brick
- For a settlement, I need brick, wool, grain, and lumber, but I lack brick
- For a city upgrade, I need 2 grain and 3 ore, but I only have 1 grain and 0 ore
- For a development card, I need wool, grain, and ore, but I lack ore

Since I can't perform any construction actions with my current resources, ending my turn is the only viable option. This will allow me to potentially collect new resources on the next roll and take more impactful actions in the following turn. The heuristic score of 1 for this action confirms it's currently the best move given my limited options.
