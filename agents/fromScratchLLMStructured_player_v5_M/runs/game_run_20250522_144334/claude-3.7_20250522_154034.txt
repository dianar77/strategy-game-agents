Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 0, 0, 0, 2]
        - Settlements: [22]
        - Cities: [6]
        - Victory Points (VP): 5
        - Roads Available: 11

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}

# Game Analysis

Since there's only one available action, the decision is straightforward.

## Action: END_TURN

## Justification:
I must end my turn since it's the only available action. Currently, I have only 2 wheat resources and nothing else, which isn't enough to build any meaningful structures (settlements require brick/wood/sheep/wheat; roads require brick/wood; cities require ore/wheat). With 5 VPs already (from my settlements at position 22 and city at position 6), I'm in a good position, but need to gather more diverse resources on the next turn. Ending my turn now will allow me to collect new resources based on the next dice roll and potentially make more strategic moves on my next turn.
