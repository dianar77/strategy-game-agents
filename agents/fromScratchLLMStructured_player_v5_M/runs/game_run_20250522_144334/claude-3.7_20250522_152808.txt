Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [1, 3, 0, 0, 2]
        - Settlements: [3, 5, 21, 20]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 6
        - Roads Available: 0

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
I'll analyze the game state and determine the best action to take.

Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Justification: Given the current game state, ending my turn is the only available action. With my resources [1, 3, 0, 0, 2] (likely representing [Brick, Lumber, Wool, Grain, Ore]), I don't have the right combination to build any useful structures. I currently have 4 settlements (at positions 3, 5, 21, 20) providing 4 VP, plus likely 2 VP from other sources (possibly longest road or development cards) for a total of 6 VP. I have no roads available to build, which limits my expansion options. Since no other actions are available, I should end my turn to collect more resources based on the next dice roll and develop a stronger position for my next turn. My priority will be gathering resources to either upgrade settlements to cities (requiring 2 grain and 3 ore) or to build more roads to enable further settlement construction once I regain road availability.
