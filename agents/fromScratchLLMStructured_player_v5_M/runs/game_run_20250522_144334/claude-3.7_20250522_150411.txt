Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 0, 2, 0, 2]
        - Settlements: [7, 16]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 6
        - Roads Available: 2

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}

Response:
# Analysis of Catanatron Minigame State

I notice that this is a constrained situation where I only have one option available.

### Current Resources:
- Brick: 0
- Ore: 0
- Wheat: 2
- Wood: 0
- Sheep: 2

### Current Position:
- 2 settlements (at positions 7 and 16)
- No cities
- 6 Victory Points
- 2 roads available to build

## Decision

Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Justification: Since this is the only available action, I must end my turn. While I have some wheat (2) and sheep (2), I don't have the required resources to build roads (brick+wood), settlements (brick+wood+wheat+sheep), or cities (3 ore+2 wheat). The best strategic move is to end my turn and collect new resources on the next roll. With 6 VP already and settlements positioned at locations 7 and 16, I'm in a good position to continue expansion once I collect the necessary resources - particularly brick and wood for roads, or ore for city upgrades.
