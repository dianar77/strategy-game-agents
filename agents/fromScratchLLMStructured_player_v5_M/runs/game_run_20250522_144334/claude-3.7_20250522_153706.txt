Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 0, 2, 0, 0]
        - Settlements: [22]
        - Cities: [6]
        - Victory Points (VP): 5
        - Roads Available: 13

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
I'll analyze this game state and choose the optimal action.

Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Justification: In this situation, ending my turn is the only available action. I currently have 2 brick resources but no other resources needed for building (no wood for roads, no wheat or sheep for settlements). With settlements at positions 22 and 6 (with the latter upgraded to a city), I've already established a presence on the board. Since I lack the necessary resource combination to build anything new, the optimal move is to end my turn and hope to collect better resources on the next roll. While ending turns repeatedly isn't typically strategic, it's the only choice when no building options are available, and collecting new resources is essential to continue expanding.
