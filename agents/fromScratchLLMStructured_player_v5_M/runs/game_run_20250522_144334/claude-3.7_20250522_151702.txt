Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 2, 0, 1, 0]
        - Settlements: [3, 5]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 2
        - Roads Available: 11

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
I'll make the optimal move in this Catanatron Minigame based on the current state and available actions.

Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

Justification: This is the only available action at the moment, so I must roll the dice to progress the game. Rolling will generate new resources based on the number rolled and the positions of my settlements. With my current resources (2 brick and 1 grain), I don't have enough to build anything yet (settlements require 1 brick, 1 lumber, 1 wool, 1 grain; roads require 1 brick, 1 lumber). A successful roll could provide me with the additional resources needed to expand. Since I have settlements at positions 3 and 5, I'll likely collect resources if these numbers or adjacent hexes are rolled. Rolling is the necessary first step to implementing my strategy of early expansion through roads and settlements.
