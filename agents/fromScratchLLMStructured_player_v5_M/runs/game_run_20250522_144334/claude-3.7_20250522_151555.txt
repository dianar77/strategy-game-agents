Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 1, 0, 1, 0]
        - Settlements: [3, 5]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 2
        - Roads Available: 12

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
I'll analyze the current game state and available actions to make the most strategic decision.

Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Justification: Since there is only one available action (END_TURN), I must choose it. With current resources of [0, 1, 0, 1, 0] (likely representing [Brick, Lumber, Wool, Grain, Ore]), I don't have enough materials to build anything new. The resource combination doesn't meet requirements for any construction - settlements need brick, lumber, wool, and grain; roads need brick and lumber; cities need ore and grain; and development cards need wool, grain, and ore. Without sufficient resources for any builds, ending my turn is the only reasonable action, allowing me to collect more resources on the next round. The heuristic score of 1 confirms this is the optimal choice in the current situation.
