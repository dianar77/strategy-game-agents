Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 1, 1, 0, 0]
        - Settlements: [5, 3]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 2
        - Roads Available: 12

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}

Response:
# Game Analysis and Decision

Based on the current game state, I have only one available action:

**Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)**

**Justification:** Since this is the only action available to me, I must end my turn. My current resource bank is limited with only 1 brick and 1 wood, which is insufficient to build any meaningful structures (roads require 1 brick + 1 wood; settlements require 1 brick + 1 wood + 1 wheat + 1 sheep). Given my current settlements at positions 5 and 3, ending my turn allows me to potentially collect more diverse resources on the next round, which aligns with priority #1 of expanding for resource diversity. The heuristic score of 1 confirms this is the optimal move in the current situation. After collecting more resources in the next round, I can pursue more strategic actions like building roads to expand my network or saving toward a settlement or city upgrade.
