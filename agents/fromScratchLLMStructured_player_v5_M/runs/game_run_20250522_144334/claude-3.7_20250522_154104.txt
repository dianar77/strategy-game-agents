Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 1, 0, 0, 1]
        - Settlements: [22]
        - Cities: [6]
        - Victory Points (VP): 5
        - Roads Available: 11

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

Justification: The only available action is to roll the dice, which is a necessary step to progress the game. Rolling will determine which resource hexes produce resources this turn, potentially giving me additional resources beyond my current [0, 1, 0, 0, 1] (representing [Brick, Lumber, Ore, Grain, Wool]). With settlements at positions 22 and 6 (with 6 being a city), I'll collect resources from any hexes adjacent to these positions if their numbers are rolled. Since I currently have limited resources, rolling is crucial to gain more materials for future construction actions. This is especially important given my strategy priority to expand early with settlements and roads for resource diversity.
