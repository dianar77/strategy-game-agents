Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 1, 1, 0, 4]
        - Settlements: [22]
        - Cities: [6]
        - Victory Points (VP): 5
        - Roads Available: 13

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('ORE', 'ORE', 'ORE', 'ORE', 'WOOD'))
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('ORE', 'ORE', 'ORE', 'ORE', 'SHEEP'))
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('ORE', 'ORE', 'ORE', 'ORE', 'WHEAT'))
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('ORE', 'ORE', 'ORE', 'ORE', 'BRICK'))

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('ORE', 'ORE', 'ORE', 'ORE', 'WOOD')): 1
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('ORE', 'ORE', 'ORE', 'ORE', 'SHEEP')): 1
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('ORE', 'ORE', 'ORE', 'ORE', 'WHEAT')): 1
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('ORE', 'ORE', 'ORE', 'ORE', 'BRICK')): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}

# Game Analysis

Looking at the current game state:
- Resources: [0, 1, 1, 0, 4] (BRICK, ORE, SHEEP, WHEAT, WOOD)
- I have 1 settlement at position 22 and 1 city at position 6
- 5 Victory Points (1 for the settlement, 2 for the city, possibly 2 from other sources)
- I have 4 WOOD resources but need other resources for meaningful building

## Action Evaluation

With my current resources, I can't build anything immediately:
- Settlement needs [1,0,1,1,1]
- Road needs [1,0,0,0,1]
- City needs [0,3,0,2,0]

Trading 4 ORE for anything doesn't help since I only have 1 ORE. None of the maritime trades are actually useful given my current resource distribution.

Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Justification: Since I cannot build anything with my current resources, and the maritime trade options aren't viable (trading 4 ORE when I only have 1 ORE), ending my turn is the only logical move. The next turn will hopefully provide me with more useful resources to continue my expansion strategy. Holding my 4 WOOD is better than making inefficient trades that don't enable immediate building opportunities.
