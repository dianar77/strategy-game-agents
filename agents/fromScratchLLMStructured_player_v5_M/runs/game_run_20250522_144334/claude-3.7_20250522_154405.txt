Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 2, 3, 0, 3]
        - Settlements: [22]
        - Cities: [6]
        - Victory Points (VP): 5
        - Roads Available: 9

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}

# Action Analysis

Looking at the current game state and available actions, I have only one option:

## Action: END_TURN

## Justification:
Since END_TURN is the only available action, I must take it despite my preference for more strategic actions. This indicates I cannot build anything with my current resources [0, 2, 3, 0, 3] (which represents [Brick, Lumber, Wool, Ore, Grain]).

While I have good amounts of wool, grain, and lumber, I lack the brick needed for roads or settlements, and the ore needed for city upgrades or development cards. The lack of actionable moves means ending my turn is the only viable choice.

For my next turn, I should focus on acquiring brick (for road and settlement expansion) and ore (for city upgrades), as these are currently my limiting resources. My current board position with 5 VP (from two settlements and one city) shows good progress, but I need more resource diversity to continue expanding effectively.
