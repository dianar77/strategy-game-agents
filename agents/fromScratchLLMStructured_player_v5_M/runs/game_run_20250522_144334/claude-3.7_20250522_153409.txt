Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 2, 0, 2, 3]
        - Settlements: [6, 22]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 2
        - Roads Available: 13

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD: 'PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD'>, value=None)
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD: 'PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD'>, value=None): 1
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}

# Game Analysis

Looking at the current game state:
- Resources: [0 Brick, 2 Wood, 0 Sheep, 2 Wheat, 3 Ore]
- Two settlements established (6, 22)
- No cities yet
- 2 VP currently
- Both available actions have the same heuristic score

## Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

## Justification:
I'm choosing to roll the dice rather than play a Knight card because:

1. Resource accumulation is critical at this stage - rolling gives us a chance to gain more resources based on our settlement positions.

2. Our current resource set (especially the 3 Ore and 2 Wheat) suggests we're close to being able to build a city (costs 3 Ore + 2 Wheat). Rolling might give us the final resources needed.

3. Playing a Knight card is most valuable when:
   - Moving the robber would significantly hamper an opponent
   - We need the "Largest Army" bonus
   - We need to protect resources from a 7 roll

4. Without specific information about robber placement or opponent positions, the Knight card's strategic value is limited compared to the potential resource gain from rolling.

5. We should save development cards like Knights for when their tactical advantage is clearer or when we're competing for Largest Army.
