Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
        - Settlements: [5, 3]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 2
        - Roads Available: 10

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
I'll analyze the current situation in this Catanatron Minigame and make the best move.

Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Justification: I have no choice but to end my turn because it's the only available action presented. Currently, I have only 1 brick resource and no other resources (shown as [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]). This isn't enough to build any structures - a road requires 1 brick AND 1 wood, while settlements need even more resources. With my current resource scarcity, I can't make any productive moves this turn. By ending my turn now, I'll collect new resources based on my existing settlements (I have 2 settlements at positions 5 and 3) and hopefully be in a better position to expand on my next turn. This is a strategic pause that's sometimes necessary in resource management games when waiting to accumulate the right combination of resources.
