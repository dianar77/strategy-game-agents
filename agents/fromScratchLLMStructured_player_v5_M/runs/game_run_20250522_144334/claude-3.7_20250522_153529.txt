Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 3, 2, 0, 1]
        - Settlements: [22]
        - Cities: [6]
        - Victory Points (VP): 3
        - Roads Available: 13

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

Justification: In this situation, I need to roll the dice as it's the only available action. Rolling will create new opportunities based on the result, potentially giving me and my opponents more resources. With my current resource collection [0, 3, 2, 0, 1] (which represents [Brick, Wood, Sheep, Wheat, Ore]), I have a decent amount of Wood and Sheep, plus some Ore. After rolling, I'll need to evaluate my options for building settlements, roads, or upgrading to cities based on what resources I receive. Since rolling is mandatory to progress the game and generate more strategic options, this is the optimal and only valid move at this moment.
