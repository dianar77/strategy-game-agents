Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [2, 0, 3, 0, 0]
        - Settlements: [5, 3]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 2
        - Roads Available: 10

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}

Response:
# Catanatron Decision

## Action: END_TURN

## Justification:
Based on the current game state, I have no other valid actions available except to end my turn. With my current resources [2 brick, 0 wood, 3 wheat, 0 sheep, 0 ore], I cannot:

1. Build a road (requires 1 brick + 1 wood)
2. Build a settlement (requires 1 brick + 1 wood + 1 wheat + 1 sheep)
3. Upgrade to a city (requires 2 wheat + 3 ore)
4. Buy development cards (requires 1 wheat + 1 sheep + 1 ore)

While I have 2 brick and 3 wheat, I'm missing the complementary resources (particularly wood) needed to build anything. Ending my turn is the only option, which will allow me to collect new resources on the next roll and hopefully enable more strategic actions in the upcoming turn.
