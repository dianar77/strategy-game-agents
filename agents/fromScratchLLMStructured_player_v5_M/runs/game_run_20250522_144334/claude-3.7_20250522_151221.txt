Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [3, 0, 2, 2, 0]
        - Settlements: [0, 21, 46]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 3
        - Roads Available: 7

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
I need to evaluate my options based on the current game state.

Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Justification: In this situation, there's only one available action - to end my turn - so the choice is clear. Looking at my current resources [3, 0, 2, 2, 0] (likely representing [Brick, Wool, Lumber, Grain, Ore]), I don't have the correct combination to build any structure. For a settlement, I would need 1 brick, 1 wool, 1 lumber, and 1 grain, but I'm missing wool. For a road, I would need 1 brick and 1 lumber, which I have, but no placement option is being offered. For a city upgrade, I need 2 grain and 3 ore, which I don't have enough of. The best strategic move is to end my turn and hope to collect more diverse resources on the next roll to enable building during my next turn.
