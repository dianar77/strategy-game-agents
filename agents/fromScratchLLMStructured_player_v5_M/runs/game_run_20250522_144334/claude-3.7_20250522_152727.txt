Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [2, 3, 3, 0, 0]
        - Settlements: [3, 5, 21, 20]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 6
        - Roads Available: 0

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Justification: Since there is only one available action (END_TURN), I must select it. Currently, I have 2 Brick, 3 Lumber, 3 Wool, 0 Grain, and 0 Ore. While I have some resources, I don't have the right combination to build anything - I need grain for settlements and cities, and I'm out of roads to build. With 4 settlements and no cities yet, I have a good foundation but need more diverse resources. The best strategy now is to end my turn and collect new resources on the next round, hopefully getting grain and ore to upgrade my settlements to cities (which would be efficient for increasing VP). My current 6 VP shows good progress, but I need to prepare for the next phase of development.
