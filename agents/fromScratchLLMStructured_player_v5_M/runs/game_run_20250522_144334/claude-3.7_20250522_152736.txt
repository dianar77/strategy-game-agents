Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [2, 3, 4, 0, 0]
        - Settlements: [3, 5, 21, 20]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 6
        - Roads Available: 0

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
I'll analyze this Catanatron minigame situation and determine the optimal action.

Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

Justification: In this situation, there is only one available action - to roll the dice. This is a mandatory action at the beginning of each turn and will generate new resources based on the roll outcome. With my current resources [2, 3, 4, 0, 0] (representing brick, wood, ore, sheep, and wheat), I have a decent amount of ore which will be useful for city upgrades, and some brick and wood that could be used for roads once I have enough. Rolling is necessary to potentially gain the sheep and wheat resources I'm currently lacking, which would enable me to build new settlements or upgrade existing ones to cities. Since I have 4 settlements but no cities yet, increasing my resource income through the dice roll is the only way to progress toward my strategic goal of upgrading settlements to cities for more VP.
