Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [1, 0, 3, 0, 0]
        - Settlements: [7, 16]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 3
        - Roads Available: 11

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD: 'PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD'>, value=None)
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD: 'PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD'>, value=None): 1
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
I notice that I currently have limited resources [1, 0, 3, 0, 0] (meaning 1 brick, 0 wood, 3 sheep, 0 ore, and 0 wheat), which doesn't allow me to build settlements, cities, roads, or purchase development cards.

Looking at the available actions, I can either play a Knight card or end my turn. Since both actions have the same heuristic score (1), I need to consider the strategic impact.

Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD: 'PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD'>, value=None)

Justification: Playing the Knight card is the better option here for multiple reasons:
1. It gives me immediate control over resource distribution by moving the robber
2. I can potentially steal a valuable resource from an opponent
3. Playing Knight cards contributes to building the "Largest Army" special card (worth 2 VP)
4. I have very limited resources currently, so disrupting opponents while building toward a special achievement is more valuable than simply ending my turn

Since I can't build anything with my current resources, taking an action that disrupts opponents and works toward a long-term VP goal is more strategic than just ending my turn without making any progress.
