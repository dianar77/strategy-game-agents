Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [3, 0, 0, 1, 2]
        - Settlements: [7, 16]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 3
        - Roads Available: 8

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}

# Game Analysis

## Action: END_TURN

## Justification:
Since END_TURN is the only available action, I must take it. However, I can analyze my current position and plan for my next turn:

1. Current resources [3,0,0,1,2] means I have:
   - 3 Brick
   - 0 Wood
   - 0 Wheat
   - 1 Sheep
   - 2 Ore

2. My settlements are at positions 7 and 16, giving me 2 VP, plus I likely have 1 VP from another source (perhaps longest road).

3. Strategic assessment:
   - I'm resource-constrained with no wood or wheat currently
   - With my ore and brick, I'll be positioned to build a city (needs 2 more wheat + 1 more ore) or roads (need wood)
   - Ending my turn is necessary to collect new resources that align with my building strategy

By ending my turn now, I'll collect new resources on the next roll and hopefully be able to make a more impactful move that advances my position toward additional settlements or cities.
