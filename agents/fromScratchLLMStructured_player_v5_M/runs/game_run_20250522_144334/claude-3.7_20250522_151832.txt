Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [2, 0, 0, 3, 1]
        - Settlements: [3, 5]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 4
        - Roads Available: 9

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
Based on the information provided, I'll analyze the best course of action.

Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Justification: In this situation, I must end my turn as it's the only available action. My current resource distribution is [2, 0, 0, 3, 1], likely representing [Brick, Wood, Sheep, Wheat, Ore]. With these resources, I cannot build any new structures - I'm missing wood completely and don't have enough of other resources to build roads, settlements, or cities. Ending my turn allows me to collect new resources on the next roll, which is necessary for continued expansion. I currently have 4 VP from my two settlements (at positions 3 and 5), and have 9 roads available to build when I collect the right resources. On my next turn, I should focus on acquiring wood and more brick to continue building roads and expanding my settlement network.
