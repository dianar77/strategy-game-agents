Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 2, 1, 0, 3]
        - Settlements: [7, 16]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 3
        - Roads Available: 8

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
I'll analyze the current game state and available actions for the Catanatron Minigame.

Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Justification: In this situation, ending my turn is the only available action. Looking at my resources [0, 2, 1, 0, 3], I have 2 brick, 1 wood, and 3 wheat, but no ore or sheep. This resource combination doesn't allow me to build any new settlements (need brick, wood, sheep, wheat), roads (need brick and wood), cities (need ore and wheat), or development cards (need ore, sheep, wheat). Since I can't make any productive moves with my current resources, ending my turn is the correct strategic choice to collect new resources on the next round and potentially have more building options. I already have settlements at positions 7 and 16, giving me 2 VP, plus likely 1 VP from another source, for a total of 3 VP.
