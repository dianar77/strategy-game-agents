Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [3, 0, 2, 0, 2]
        - Settlements: [7, 16]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 6
        - Roads Available: 2

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}

# Analysis of Game State

I need to roll the dice to continue the game.

**Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)**

**Justification:** At this point in the game, rolling is the only available action. With 6 victory points already, I'm in a strong position. My current resources (3 brick, 2 grain, 2 sheep) put me close to building another settlement (need 1 more wood and 1 more brick) or making progress toward a city upgrade (need 3 ore and 1 more grain). Rolling will potentially give me additional resources to execute these high-value actions. Since I have 2 settlements (at positions 7 and 16), I have good potential for resource collection with this roll. After rolling, I'll evaluate whether I can build settlements/roads for expansion or save resources for city upgrades.
