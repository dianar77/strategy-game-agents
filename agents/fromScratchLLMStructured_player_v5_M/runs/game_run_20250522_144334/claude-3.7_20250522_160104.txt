Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [2, 0, 2, 1, 0]
        - Settlements: [5, 3]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 2
        - Roads Available: 9

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}

Response:
# Catanatron Decision Analysis

## Action: END_TURN
## Justification: I must end my turn because it's the only available action. With my current resources [2, 0, 2, 1, 0] (representing [Brick, Ore, Sheep, Wheat, Wood]), I don't have the right combination to build any new structures. For settlements I would need [1,0,1,1,1] and for roads [1,0,0,0,1]. While I have enough brick and sheep, I lack the wood needed for expansion. Ending my turn now will allow me to collect more resources on the next round and hopefully gain a better position for building. My priority will be to gather wood on the next turn to enable road building, which can lead to new settlement opportunities.
