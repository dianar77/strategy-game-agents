Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [1, 0, 0, 0, 2]
        - Settlements: [7, 16]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 3
        - Roads Available: 8

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

Justification: In the current game state, the only available action is to roll the dice. This is a mandatory action that will potentially generate new resources based on the dice outcome. With current resources of [1, 0, 0, 0, 2] (likely representing 1 brick, 0 wood, 0 sheep, 0 wheat, and 2 ore), I don't have enough resources for building settlements, cities, or roads yet. Rolling the dice is necessary to continue the game and potentially gain more resources that would enable more strategic actions in subsequent turns. Given that I have settlements at positions 7 and 16, a good roll could provide the diverse resources needed to expand further according to our primary strategic priority.
