Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 1, 5, 0, 0]
        - Settlements: [5, 3]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 2
        - Roads Available: 10

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

Justification: Since "ROLL" is the only available action at this moment, I should proceed with it. Rolling the dice is a necessary action to generate new resources that will enable future building opportunities. With my current resources [0, 1, 5, 0, 0] (representing [Brick, Wood, Sheep, Ore, Wheat]), I have 5 sheep but lack the complementary resources needed for most builds. The roll action will potentially provide additional resources that could open up more strategic options, such as building roads (requiring brick and wood) or settlements (requiring brick, wood, sheep, and wheat). Rolling is the essential first step of any turn and will determine my subsequent actions based on the resources gained.
