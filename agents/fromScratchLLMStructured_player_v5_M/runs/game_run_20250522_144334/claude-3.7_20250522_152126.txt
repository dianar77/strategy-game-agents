Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [2, 0, 0, 0, 0]
        - Settlements: [3, 5, 21]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 5
        - Roads Available: 7

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
I'll evaluate the current game state and available actions to determine the optimal move.

Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Justification: In this case, ending my turn is the only available action. Currently, I have 2 brick resources but no other resources that would allow me to build anything. With settlements at positions 3, 5, and 21, I have a good foundation (3 settlements = 3 VP), but I'm resource-constrained right now. Since I can't build any roads (need brick + lumber), settlements (need brick + lumber + wool + grain), or cities (need 3 ore + 2 grain), the only strategic choice is to end my turn and gather more diverse resources on the next roll. This will allow me to work toward my next strategic goals of either building more roads to expand my network or gathering the necessary resources to upgrade my existing settlements to cities for more efficient VP generation.
