Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 0, 1, 1, 0]
        - Settlements: [0, 21]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 2
        - Roads Available: 11

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}

Response:
# Action Analysis for Catanatron Minigame

Based on the current game state, I have only one available action:

## Action: END_TURN

## Justification:
Since END_TURN is the only available action, I must take it. With my current resources (1 wheat and 1 wood), I don't have enough to build any structures - settlements require brick and wood, roads require brick and wood, cities require ore and wheat, and development cards require ore, wheat and sheep. Since I can't build anything with my current resource combination, ending my turn is the only logical choice. This will allow me to collect new resources on the next round and hopefully gain enough of the right types to build settlements or roads according to the early game priority of expansion.
