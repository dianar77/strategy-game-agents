Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [1, 0, 0, 1, 3]
        - Settlements: [7, 16]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 5
        - Roads Available: 5

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
I'll analyze the current game state and make the optimal decision.

Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Justification: Based on the current game state, I have no choice but to end my turn since it's the only available action. Looking at my resources [1, 0, 0, 1, 3], which represents [Brick, Wood, Sheep, Wheat, Ore], I have 1 brick, 0 wood, 0 sheep, 1 wheat, and 3 ore. These resources are insufficient for any construction actions:
- Settlement (costs brick, wood, sheep, wheat)
- City (costs 3 ore, 2 wheat) - I'm one wheat short
- Development card (costs ore, sheep, wheat) - I'm missing sheep
- Road (costs brick, wood) - I'm missing wood

The best strategy is to end my turn now and hope for better resource rolls on the next turn. With 5 VP and settlements at positions 7 and 16, I should focus on collecting wood and sheep to enable more building options on my next turn.
