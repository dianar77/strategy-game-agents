Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [2, 0, 2, 0, 0]
        - Settlements: [5, 3]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 2
        - Roads Available: 9

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}

# Game Analysis

Examining the current game state:
- Resources: [2, 0, 2, 0, 0] (2 brick, 0 wool, 2 lumber, 0 ore, 0 grain)
- Settlements at positions 5 and 3
- No cities built yet
- 2 Victory Points (from the 2 settlements)
- 9 roads available to build

## Action Decision

Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Justification: The only available action is to end my turn. With my current resources [2, 0, 2, 0, 0], I can't build anything productive - roads require brick and lumber (I have these but would need a destination), settlements require brick, lumber, wool, and grain (missing wool and grain), and cities require ore and grain (missing both). Ending the turn allows me to collect more resources on the next roll, which gives me more options for my next turn. Since this is the only action available, the strategic choice is to end the turn and hope for beneficial resource collection in the next phase.
