Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 1, 2, 0, 1]
        - Settlements: [22]
        - Cities: [6]
        - Victory Points (VP): 5
        - Roads Available: 11

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
I'll analyze the current state and available actions for the Catanatron Minegame.

Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Justification: In the current game state, ending the turn is the only available action. I have limited resources ([0, 1, 2, 0, 1], which appears to be [Brick, Lumber, Wool, Grain, Ore]) that don't allow me to build any new settlements, cities, or roads. With 1 lumber, 2 wool, and 1 ore, I don't have the correct combinations for any build actions. I already have one city (at position 6) and one settlement (at position 22), accounting for my 5 victory points (2 for the settlement and 3 for the city). The best strategy now is to end my turn and collect new resources on the next round that will hopefully enable more impactful actions like building new settlements or upgrading to cities.
