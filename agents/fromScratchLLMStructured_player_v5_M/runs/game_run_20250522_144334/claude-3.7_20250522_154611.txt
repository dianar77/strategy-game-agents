Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 1, 1, 0, 0]
        - Settlements: [22]
        - Cities: [6]
        - Victory Points (VP): 5
        - Roads Available: 9

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}

Response:
# Game Analysis

Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Justification: I must end my turn since this is the only available action. With my current resources [0, 1, 1, 0, 0] (representing [brick, lumber, wool, grain, ore]), I don't have enough materials to build any structures. I only have 1 lumber and 1 wool, which isn't sufficient for a road (requires brick+lumber), settlement (requires brick+lumber+wool+grain), or city upgrade (requires 2 grain+3 ore). My current position includes 1 city (at position 6) and 1 settlement (at position 22), giving me 5 victory points. The best move is to end my turn and collect more resources on the next round. On my next turn, I should prioritize using any new resources to extend my network or upgrade settlements based on what I collect.
