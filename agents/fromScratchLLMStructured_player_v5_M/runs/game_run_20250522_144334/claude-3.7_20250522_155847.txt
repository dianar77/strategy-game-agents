Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [2, 0, 3, 0, 0]
        - Settlements: [5, 3]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 2
        - Roads Available: 10

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
I'll analyze the current game state and make a strategic decision for the Catanatron Minigame.

Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

Justification: Rolling the dice is the only available action currently, which is necessary to progress the game. With my current resources [2, 0, 3, 0, 0] (representing [BRICK, LUMBER, WOOL, GRAIN, ORE]), I don't have enough diversity to build anything yet. I have 2 bricks and 3 wool, but I'm missing lumber to build roads (costs brick+lumber) and missing grain for settlements (costs brick+lumber+wool+grain). Rolling will give me a chance to collect additional resources needed to expand my network. Since I already have settlements at 5 locations, I'm well-positioned to collect various resources depending on the dice outcome. This roll is crucial for developing my early game strategy of building roads and settlements for resource diversity.
