Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 2, 0, 1, 3]
        - Settlements: [7, 16]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 5
        - Roads Available: 8

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
Looking at the game state, I notice that I have only one possible action available, which is to end my turn.

Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Justification: I have no choice but to end my turn since it's the only action available. Looking at my current resources [0, 2, 0, 1, 3], I have 2 brick, 1 wheat, and 3 wood, but no ore or sheep. This resource combination doesn't allow me to build any new structures (settlements require brick, wheat, sheep, and wood; roads require brick and wood; cities require ore and wheat). Since I cannot make any impactful plays with my current resources, ending the turn is the optimal choice. On my next turn, I'll hopefully collect more diverse resources that will enable me to expand my position by building more roads or settlements, or upgrading to cities when I collect ore.
