Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 0, 1, 1, 0]
        - Settlements: [0, 21]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 2
        - Roads Available: 11

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
I'll analyze this Catanatron state and provide my optimal action recommendation.

Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Justification: In the current game state, I have very limited resources available - just 1 wood and 1 brick. This isn't enough to build any meaningful infrastructure (a road costs 1 wood + 1 brick, a settlement costs 1 wood + 1 brick + 1 wheat + 1 sheep, and a city costs 2 wheat + 3 ore). Since I have exactly the resources for a road but no other shown possible actions, I must conclude that either there are no legal road placements available or the action listing is incomplete. With no other viable actions appearing in the available actions list, ending my turn is the only logical choice. This will allow me to collect more resources on the next round and hopefully execute a more impactful strategy on my next turn.
