Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [3, 0, 3, 0, 2]
        - Settlements: [7, 16]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 6
        - Roads Available: 2

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}

Response:
# Game Analysis

Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

Justification: The only available action currently is to roll the dice, which is a mandatory step to progress in the game. Rolling will potentially generate new resources that can be used for subsequent actions. With our current resources [3 brick, 0 ore, 3 wood, 0 sheep, 2 wheat], we're well positioned for road building after the roll. We have 6 VP already with two settlements, so we're in a good position. After rolling, depending on the resources we receive, we should look to continue expansion through roads and settlements, or begin upgrading settlements to cities once we acquire sufficient ore and wheat.
