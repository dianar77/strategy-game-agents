Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 1, 0, 0, 2]
        - Settlements: [22]
        - Cities: [6]
        - Victory Points (VP): 5
        - Roads Available: 11

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
# Catanatron Minigame Decision

Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Justification: I must end my turn because it's the only available action. With my current resources [0 Brick, 1 Wood, 0 Sheep, 0 Wheat, 2 Ore], I don't have the right combination to build any structures. I have 1 Wood and 2 Ore, but building anything requires different resource combinations. For example, a road needs Brick and Wood, and a settlement requires Brick, Wood, Sheep, and Wheat. Since I can't perform any building actions, ending my turn is the only strategic choice available. On my next turn, I'll hopefully collect more diverse resources to continue expansion.
