Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [2, 3, 3, 0, 3]
        - Settlements: [3, 5, 21]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 5
        - Roads Available: 0

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

Justification: At this moment, there is only one available action, which is to roll the dice. This is a mandatory step at the beginning of a turn and will determine what resources I might collect. With my current resources [2, 3, 3, 0, 3] (representing [Brick, Lumber, Ore, Wheat, Wool]), I have a decent mix but am lacking wheat completely. Rolling the dice gives me an opportunity to potentially gain more resources, especially wheat which I need for settlements and cities. Since I already have 3 settlements but no roads available to expand further, my next priority after gathering resources would be to upgrade settlements to cities (requiring 3 ore and 2 wheat each) or build more roads to enable future settlement placement.
