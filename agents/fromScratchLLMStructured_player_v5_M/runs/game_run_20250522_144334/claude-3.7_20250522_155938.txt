Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [2, 0, 3, 2, 0]
        - Settlements: [5, 3]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 2
        - Roads Available: 10

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
I see we're playing the Catanatron Minigame, and need to make a strategic decision based on the current state.

Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

Justification: Rolling the dice is the only available action at this moment. This is the standard way to begin a turn in Catan, and it's necessary to generate new resources before we can take any building actions. With our current resource distribution [2, 0, 3, 2, 0] (likely representing [Brick, Wool, Lumber, Grain, Ore]), we have some brick, lumber, and grain, but need more resources to build effectively. Rolling will potentially provide additional resources needed for our next strategic move, whether that's building a road (brick + lumber), a settlement (brick + lumber + wool + grain), or working toward a city (grain + ore). Since this is the only action available, there's no strategic alternative to consider.
