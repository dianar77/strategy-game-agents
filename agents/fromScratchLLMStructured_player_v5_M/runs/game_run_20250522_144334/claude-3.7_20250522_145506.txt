Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 2, 1, 0, 3]
        - Settlements: [7, 16]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 3
        - Roads Available: 8

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
I'll analyze the current game state and determine the best action.

Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Justification: In this situation, ending my turn is the only available action. My current resources are [0, 2, 1, 0, 3], which corresponds to [Brick, Lumber, Wool, Grain, Ore]. With this combination, I cannot build any useful structures:
- Settlement requires [1,1,1,1,0] (Brick, Lumber, Wool, Grain)
- Road requires [1,1,0,0,0] (Brick, Lumber)
- City upgrade requires [0,0,0,2,3] (2 Grain, 3 Ore)

Though I have plenty of ore (3) and some lumber (2), I'm missing key resources like brick and grain needed for expansion. Ending my turn now will allow me to collect new resources on the next roll, potentially giving me the combination needed to build roads or upgrade to cities. Since I already have two settlements (at positions 7 and 16), my next strategic priority should be collecting the right resource combination to make meaningful progress.
