Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [2, 0, 0, 0, 1]
        - Settlements: [7, 16]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 6
        - Roads Available: 5

        Available Actions:

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
I need to choose the most strategic road placement from the available options. Let's analyze the situation.

Looking at my resources [2, 0, 0, 0, 1], I have 2 brick and 1 wood which is enough to build a road. I currently have settlements at points 7 and 16, with 6 VP total, and I need to expand my network efficiently.

Since all road options have the same heuristic score (10), I should prioritize roads that:
1. Extend from my existing settlements
2. Move toward valuable building spots 
3. Position me for future settlement placement

Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(6, 23))

Justification: This road appears to extend from my settlement at position 7 (assuming point 6 is adjacent to 7). Building this road will expand my network toward new areas where I can potentially place future settlements. Since all options have the same score, extending from my existing settlement is the most logical choice to maximize my board presence and set up for future settlement placements that will diversify my resource income. This is consistent with the priority of building roads early to expand for resource diversity.
