Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [2, 0, 1, 0, 2]
        - Settlements: [7, 16]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 6
        - Roads Available: 2

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}

# Game Analysis

Based on the current game state:

Action: END_TURN
Justification: I have limited resources available [2 brick, 0 ore, 1 wool, 0 grain, 2 lumber] which doesn't allow me to build any settlements (need 1 brick, 1 lumber, 1 wool, 1 grain), roads (need 1 brick, 1 lumber), cities (need 3 ore, 2 grain), or development cards. My VP count is already at 6, which is quite high for this stage of the game, and I have settlements at positions 7 and 16 with 2 roads still available. Since END_TURN is the only available action listed, I must pass my turn and collect resources on the next roll to set up for construction on my next turn. The heuristic score of 1 confirms this is the only viable option at this moment.
