Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 2, 3, 0, 1]
        - Settlements: [22]
        - Cities: [6]
        - Victory Points (VP): 5
        - Roads Available: 11

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
I'll analyze the current situation and make a decision.

Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Justification: In this situation, I only have one available action - to end my turn. Based on my resource inventory [0, 2, 3, 0, 1] (which translates to 0 Brick, 2 Wood, 3 Sheep, 0 Ore, 1 Wheat), I don't have the proper combinations to build any new structures. For a settlement, I'd need 1 brick, 1 wood, 1 sheep, and 1 wheat (missing brick). For a city upgrade, I'd need 3 ore and 2 wheat (missing ore and more wheat). For a road, I'd need 1 brick and 1 wood (missing brick). Since I cannot make any strategic builds with my current resources, ending my turn is the only meaningful option, allowing me to collect more resources on the next roll and potentially make a more impactful move in the following turn.
