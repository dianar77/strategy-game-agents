Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 1, 0, 0, 1]
        - Settlements: [22]
        - Cities: [6]
        - Victory Points (VP): 5
        - Roads Available: 13

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Justification: Since there's only one available action (END_TURN), I must select this option. Looking at my current resources [0, 1, 0, 0, 1], I have only 1 brick and 1 timber, which is insufficient to build any structures. I need at least 1 brick + 1 timber + 1 wheat + 1 wool to build a settlement, or 3 ore + 2 wheat to upgrade a settlement to a city. My current position with 5 VP (from 1 city worth 2 VP and 3 settlements worth 3 VP) is strong, but I need to accumulate more resources in the next turns. Ending my turn now will allow me to collect more resources during the next round and potentially make a more impactful move later.
