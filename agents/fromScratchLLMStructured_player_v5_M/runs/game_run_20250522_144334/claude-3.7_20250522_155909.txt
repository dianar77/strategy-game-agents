Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [2, 0, 3, 1, 0]
        - Settlements: [5, 3]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 2
        - Roads Available: 10

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}

Response:
# Action Analysis for Catanatron Minigame

## Action: END_TURN

## Justification:
Based on the current game state, I have no other available actions except to end my turn. While I generally want to avoid ending turns without taking productive actions, in this case it's the only option.

Looking at my resources [2, 0, 3, 1, 0], which represents [Brick, Lumber, Wool, Grain, Ore], I don't have sufficient resources for any building actions:

- Building a road requires 1 Brick + 1 Lumber, but I have 0 Lumber
- Building a settlement requires 1 Brick + 1 Lumber + 1 Wool + 1 Grain, but I'm missing Lumber
- Upgrading to a city requires 2 Grain + 3 Ore, but I only have 1 Grain and 0 Ore

Given my 2 settlements at positions 5 and 3, I should focus on gathering more diverse resources next turn, particularly Lumber and Ore which I completely lack. Ending my turn now allows me to collect resources on the next dice roll and potentially make more impactful moves afterward.
