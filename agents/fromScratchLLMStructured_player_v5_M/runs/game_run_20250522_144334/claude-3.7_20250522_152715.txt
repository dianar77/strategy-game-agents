Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [2, 2, 3, 0, 0]
        - Settlements: [3, 5, 21, 20]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 6
        - Roads Available: 0

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

Justification: In this situation, there's only one available action - to roll the dice. This is the standard way to begin a turn in Catan, and it's necessary to generate resources that will enable future building actions. With my current resources [2, 2, 3, 0, 0] (representing brick, wood, sheep, wheat, and ore), I have some brick, wood, and sheep but lack wheat and ore. Rolling the dice gives me a chance to collect more resources that could enable me to either build new settlements (if I get roads first), upgrade existing settlements to cities (if I get wheat and ore), or potentially purchase development cards. Since rolling is my only option and is essential for progressing in the game, this is the clear strategic choice.
