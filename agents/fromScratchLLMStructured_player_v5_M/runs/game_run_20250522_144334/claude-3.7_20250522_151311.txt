Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 0, 2, 2, 0]
        - Settlements: [0, 21, 46]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 3
        - Roads Available: 6

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Justification: Given the current game state, I have no choice but to end my turn since it's the only available action. With my current resources [0, 0, 2, 2, 0] (representing [Brick, Lumber, Wool, Grain, Ore]), I have 2 Wool and 2 Grain, which is insufficient to build any meaningful structure. For a settlement, I would need 1 Brick, 1 Lumber, 1 Wool, and 1 Grain. For a road, I would need 1 Brick and 1 Lumber. For a city upgrade, I would need 2 Grain and 3 Ore. Since I don't have any Brick, Lumber, or Ore at the moment, I cannot take any building actions and must end my turn to collect more resources on the next round.
