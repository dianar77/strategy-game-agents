Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
        - Settlements: [3, 5, 21]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 5
        - Roads Available: 5

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
I'll analyze the current game state and determine the optimal action.

Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Justification: In this case, ending my turn is the only available action. My resource situation is extremely limited with just 1 brick and no other resources. I currently have 3 settlements (at positions 3, 5, and 21) giving me 3 VP, plus 2 more VP from some other source (likely development cards), for a total of 5 VP. Without sufficient resources to build anything new (roads require brick and wood; settlements require brick, wood, wheat, and sheep), I need to end my turn to collect more resources from the next roll. Though ending turns unnecessarily is generally not optimal, in this situation it's the only option to progress my strategy. On my next turn, I'll focus on using any newly acquired resources to continue expanding with roads and settlements to diversify my resource income.
