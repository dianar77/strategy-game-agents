Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 1, 2, 0, 3]
        - Settlements: [7, 16]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 2
        - Roads Available: 13

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
I'll analyze the current game state and determine the optimal action.

Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Justification: In this situation, I have no choice but to end my turn as it's the only available action. My current resources [0, 1, 2, 0, 3] (representing [brick, wood, sheep, wheat, ore]) are insufficient for any building actions. I have 1 wood, 2 sheep, and 3 ore, but lack the brick and wheat needed for settlements (brick+wood+sheep+wheat) or roads (brick+wood). I also don't have enough resources to build a city (3 ore + 2 wheat). Since I cannot make any productive moves with my current resources, ending the turn is the correct strategic choice. On my next turn, I'll hopefully collect more diverse resources from my settlements at positions 7 and 16 to enable expansion through roads and new settlements.
