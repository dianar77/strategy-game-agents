Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [2, 3, 4, 0, 4]
        - Settlements: [3, 5, 21]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 5
        - Roads Available: 0

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
I'll help you make the best move in this Catanatron Minigame.

Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

Justification: There's only one available action, which is to roll the dice. This is a necessary step in the game flow that allows the game to progress. After rolling, we'll likely receive additional resources based on the dice outcome and the positioning of our settlements at nodes 3, 5, and 21. These new resources will enable more strategic actions in subsequent turns. With our current resource pool [2, 3, 4, 0, 4] (likely representing [Brick, Wood, Sheep, Wheat, Ore]), we have a good collection of resources but need to see what the dice roll brings before we can make additional development decisions, particularly since we need wheat (where we currently have 0) for city upgrades.
