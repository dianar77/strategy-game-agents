Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [1, 0, 1, 0, 2]
        - Settlements: [7, 16]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 6
        - Roads Available: 3

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}

Response:
# Analysis of Catanatron Minigame State

Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

Justification: I'll choose to roll the dice as it's the only available action at this point in the game. Rolling is a necessary and strategic action as it determines which resources we'll collect based on the number rolled and the hexes our settlements are adjacent to. Our current resource position is limited (1 brick, 1 wood, 2 sheep), so we need more resources to execute our build strategy. With 2 settlements already placed at positions 7 and 16, we have potential resource generation points, and rolling will help us collect the resources needed to either build roads for expansion or potentially upgrade one of our settlements to a city (which would require ore and grain, both of which we currently lack). With 6 VP already, we're in a good position, but need this roll to determine our next strategic move.
