Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [4, 0, 0, 1, 2]
        - Settlements: [7, 16]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 3
        - Roads Available: 8

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
I'll analyze the current game state and the available actions to make an optimal decision.

Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

Justification: Since rolling the dice is the only available action at this moment, I'll proceed with it. This is the standard way to begin a turn in Catan, and it will determine what resources I'll gain for this turn. With my current resource distribution [4 brick, 0 lumber, 0 wool, 1 grain, 2 ore], I'm particularly hoping for lumber and wool to enable settlement building, or additional brick for road building. The roll will likely provide new strategic options that aren't currently available. After rolling, I'll be in a better position to decide whether to build new roads (to expand my network), save resources for a settlement (if I gain the needed lumber and wool), or work toward upgrading to cities (needing more ore and grain).
