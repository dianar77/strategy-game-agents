Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [3, 0, 1, 0, 1]
        - Settlements: [3, 5, 21]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 5
        - Roads Available: 0

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

Justification: Rolling the dice is the only available action at this point, and it's a necessary step to advance the game. This roll will potentially generate new resources based on the settlement positions (3, 5, 21) that can be used for future building actions. With current resources of [3, 0, 1, 0, 1], I need more materials to build additional roads (which require brick and wood) or to upgrade settlements to cities (which require ore and wheat). Since I have 0 roads available and limited resources, rolling the dice is the optimal move to acquire more resources and expand strategic options for the next turn.
