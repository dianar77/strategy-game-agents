Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [1, 0, 1, 0, 0]
        - Settlements: [5, 3]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 2
        - Roads Available: 10

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Justification: Based on my current resources [1, 0, 1, 0, 0], I don't have sufficient materials to build anything. I have only 1 brick and 1 wood, but building a road requires 1 brick and 1 wood, building a settlement requires 1 brick, 1 wood, 1 wheat, and 1 sheep, and upgrading to a city requires 2 wheat and 3 ore. Since I can't perform any building actions with my current resources, the only strategic option is to end my turn and collect more resources on the next roll. While normally I would prioritize building over ending a turn, in this case ending the turn is the only available action and will allow me to potentially gather the resources needed for expansion on my next turn.
