Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 1, 0, 1, 0]
        - Settlements: [3, 5]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 2
        - Roads Available: 11

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
I'll analyze the current state and make the optimal decision for this Catanatron Minigame.

Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Justification: In the current state, ending my turn is the only available action. I have limited resources ([0, 1, 0, 1, 0]), which means I have 1 brick and 1 wool. This is not enough to build any new structure (settlement requires 1 brick, 1 wool, 1 wheat, 1 lumber; road requires 1 brick, 1 lumber). While I would normally prefer to take actions that progress toward victory points, the current resource constraints leave no viable alternative. By ending my turn, I'll have the opportunity to collect more resources on the next round, allowing me to implement the priority strategy of building settlements and roads early for expansion. With 2 settlements already placed (at positions 3 and 5), I'm in a good position to collect a diverse set of resources in the next round.
