Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [3, 0, 0, 3, 1]
        - Settlements: [3, 5]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 4
        - Roads Available: 9

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}

# Catanatron Analysis

## Action: ROLL
**Justification:** Rolling is my only available action, but it's the right strategic move. With current resources of [3, 0, 0, 3, 1] (brick, wood, sheep, wheat, ore), I can't build anything yet. I need to roll to potentially gain more resources that would enable productive building actions. With settlements at positions 3 and 5, rolling gives me the opportunity to collect resources based on the numbers these settlements are adjacent to. Since I have 9 roads available and only 4 VP, rolling is necessary to accumulate resources needed for expansion and development according to my priority of building settlements and roads early.
