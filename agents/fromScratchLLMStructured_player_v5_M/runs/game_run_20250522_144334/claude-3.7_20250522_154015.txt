Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 0, 0, 0, 2]
        - Settlements: [22]
        - Cities: [6]
        - Victory Points (VP): 5
        - Roads Available: 11

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
I'll analyze the current game state and available actions to provide the best possible move.

Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Justification: I only have one possible action available - ending my turn. While normally I would prefer actions that directly contribute to VP growth (like building settlements or upgrading to cities), I currently have very limited resources with only 2 wheat and no other resources. This is insufficient for any construction action (settlements require brick, wood, wheat, sheep; cities require 3 ore and 2 wheat; roads require brick and wood). With my current resource constraints, the best strategy is to end my turn to collect new resources on the next round. Though ending turns repeatedly is generally not optimal, in this specific situation it's necessary to continue the game flow and potentially gain better resources on my next turn to enable more strategic construction actions.
