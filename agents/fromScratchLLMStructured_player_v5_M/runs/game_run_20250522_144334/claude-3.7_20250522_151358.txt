Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 2, 3, 1, 0]
        - Settlements: [0, 21, 46]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 3
        - Roads Available: 6

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}

# Game Analysis

## Action: END_TURN

## Justification:
Given the current game state and available actions, I must end my turn as it's the only option presented. While ending a turn without building is typically not optimal in Catan, I have no other choices available.

Looking at my resources [0, 2, 3, 1, 0] (which represents [Brick, Lumber, Wool, Grain, Ore]), I have several resources but not the right combinations for building:
- For a road: I need brick and lumber, but I have 0 brick
- For a settlement: I need brick, lumber, wool, and grain (1 each), but I have 0 brick
- For a city upgrade: I need 2 grain and 3 ore, but I only have 1 grain and 0 ore

Since my resources don't allow for any construction this turn, ending my turn is the only reasonable action. On my next turn, I should focus on acquiring brick to enable road and settlement building, which aligns with the early game expansion priority.
