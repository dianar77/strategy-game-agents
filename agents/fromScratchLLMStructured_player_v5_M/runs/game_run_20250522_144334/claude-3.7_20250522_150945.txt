Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 0, 2, 2, 0]
        - Settlements: [0, 21]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 2
        - Roads Available: 9

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
I need to analyze the current game state and make the optimal decision.

Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Justification: In the current game state, I have 2 wood (index 2) and 2 brick (index 3), but no other resources. With these resources, I can't build any new settlements (need wood, brick, wheat, and sheep) or cities (need ore and wheat). I also can't build roads (would need at least 1 wood and 1 brick for each, but I have exactly 2 of each). Since I have no legal build actions available with my current resource configuration, ending my turn is the only viable option. This will allow me to collect more resources on the next turn and hopefully be in a better position to expand my settlements or upgrade to cities.
