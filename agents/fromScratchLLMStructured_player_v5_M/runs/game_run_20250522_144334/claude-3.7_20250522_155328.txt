Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 3, 1, 0, 0]
        - Settlements: [5, 3]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 2
        - Roads Available: 10

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
Based on the current game state and available actions, I have only one option:

Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Justification: While normally I'd prefer to take actions that directly contribute to increasing my VP like building settlements or upgrading to cities, I currently have no choice but to end my turn. With resources [0, 3, 1, 0, 0] (which corresponds to [Brick, Lumber, Wool, Grain, Ore]), I don't have the right combination needed for any productive action. I have plenty of Lumber (3) and some Wool (1), but I'm missing Brick for roads and Grain/Ore for city upgrades. The strategic move now is to end my turn to collect new resources on the next round, hopefully gaining the missing resources I need to execute my expansion strategy on my next turn.
