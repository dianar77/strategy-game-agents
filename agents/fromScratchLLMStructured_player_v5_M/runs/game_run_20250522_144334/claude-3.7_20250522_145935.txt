Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 0, 1, 0, 1]
        - Settlements: [7, 16]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 6
        - Roads Available: 5

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}

# Game Analysis

Based on the current game state, I have:
- Limited resources: only 1 wool and 1 brick
- 2 settlements at positions 7 and 16
- 6 victory points already
- 5 roads available to build
- Only one available action: END_TURN

## Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

## Justification:
I have no choice but to end my turn since this is the only available action. With my current resources (1 wool, 1 brick), I cannot build any new structures - a road would require brick+lumber, a settlement would require brick+lumber+wool+grain, and a city would require 2 grain+3 ore. Ending my turn is necessary to collect new resources on the next dice roll, which will hopefully provide what I need to continue expanding my network. With 6 VPs already, I'm likely in a good position, but I'll need to focus on acquiring resources to convert my settlements to cities or build new settlements on my next turn.
