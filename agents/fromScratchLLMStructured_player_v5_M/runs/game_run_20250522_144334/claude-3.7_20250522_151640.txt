Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 1, 1, 1, 0]
        - Settlements: [3, 5]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 2
        - Roads Available: 11

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
I'll analyze the Catanatron Minigame state and make the best decision based on the available information.

Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Justification: I only have one available action - to end my turn. With my current resources [0, 1, 1, 1, 0] (likely representing [Brick, Wool, Ore, Grain, Lumber]), I don't have enough resources to build a new settlement (requires Brick, Wool, Grain, and Lumber) or a road (requires Brick and Lumber). I can't upgrade my settlements to cities (requires 3 Ore and 2 Grain) with just 1 Ore and 1 Grain. Since I have no other legal moves, ending the turn is the only viable option, which will allow me to collect new resources on the next roll and potentially execute a more impactful action in the following turn.
