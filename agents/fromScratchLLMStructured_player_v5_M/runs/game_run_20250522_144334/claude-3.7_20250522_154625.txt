Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 1, 1, 0, 0]
        - Settlements: [22]
        - Cities: [6]
        - Victory Points (VP): 5
        - Roads Available: 9

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
I'll analyze this game state and make the best decision based on the provided information.

Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Justification: In this situation, I have only one available action - to end my turn. My current resources [0, 1, 1, 0, 0] (likely representing [Brick, Wool, Grain, Ore, Lumber]) are insufficient for any meaningful build action. With only one wool and one grain, I can't build any settlements (which require brick, wool, grain, and lumber), roads (which require brick and lumber), or cities (which require ore and grain). Since no other actions are available and I can't effectively use my current resources, ending my turn is the only strategic move available. This will allow me to collect new resources on the next round and potentially have more impactful options on my next turn. I should use the next round to focus on gathering more diverse resources to enable settlement expansion or city upgrades.
