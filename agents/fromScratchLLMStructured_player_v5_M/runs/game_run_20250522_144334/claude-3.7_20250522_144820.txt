Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [1, 0, 1, 0, 1]
        - Settlements: [7, 16]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 3
        - Roads Available: 11

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
# Catanatron Minigame Decision

Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Justification: In this situation, I have no viable alternative but to end my turn because:

1. My current resource configuration [1 Brick, 0 Wool, 1 Lumber, 0 Grain, 1 Ore] doesn't allow me to build any new developments:
   - A road requires [1 Brick, 1 Lumber] - I have these resources but currently have no beneficial road placement available
   - A settlement requires [1 Brick, 1 Wool, 1 Lumber, 1 Grain] - I'm missing wool and grain
   - A city upgrade requires [2 Grain, 3 Ore] - I'm missing grain and have insufficient ore
   - A development card requires [1 Wool, 1 Grain, 1 Ore] - I'm missing wool and grain

2. I currently have two settlements (at locations 7 and 16) which are generating resources, but need to accumulate more varied resources before I can make my next strategic move.

3. The heuristic score of 1 for ending my turn confirms this is the only reasonable action at this moment.

Ending my turn now will allow me to collect new resources on the next round and hopefully enable more substantial actions like building a new settlement or upgrading to a city.
