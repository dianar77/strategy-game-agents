Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 0, 4, 0, 2]
        - Settlements: [7, 16]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 2
        - Roads Available: 13

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

Justification: The only available action is to roll the dice. This is a mandatory step that initiates the resource collection phase of the turn. With 4 lumber and 2 brick currently in my inventory, rolling may provide additional resources that could enable building roads or settlements this turn. Even if I receive no useful resources from the roll, I must take this action to proceed with my turn and potentially trade or build afterward. Rolling is always the first step in a productive turn and creates opportunities for strategic advancement.
