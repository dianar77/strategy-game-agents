Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 1, 2, 1, 0]
        - Settlements: [0, 21, 46]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 3
        - Roads Available: 6

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}

Response:
# Analysis

**Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)**

**Justification:** I have no other available actions to choose from in the current game state. My resources [0, 1, 2, 1, 0] (Brick, Wool, Lumber, Grain, Ore) are insufficient to build anything meaningful. I need more resources to build roads (costs 1 Brick + 1 Lumber) or settlements (costs 1 Brick + 1 Wool + 1 Lumber + 1 Grain). My best option is to end my turn and collect more resources during the next round. I currently have 3 VPs from my settlements at positions 0, 21, and 46, and my priority will be to gather enough resources on the next turn to continue expanding my network of roads and settlements.
