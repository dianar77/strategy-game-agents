Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [2, 1, 3, 0, 1]
        - Settlements: [7, 16]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 3
        - Roads Available: 10

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(24, 53))
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(8, 27))

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

========================================

Response:
Looking at the current game state, I need to decide which road to build that will allow me to expand effectively.

I have:
- Resources: [2 brick, 1 ore, 3 wood, 0 sheep, 1 wheat]
- Two settlements at nodes 7 and 16
- Roads can be built with 1 brick + 1 wood, which I have sufficient resources for

Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(6, 7))

Justification: I'm choosing to build a road from node 6 to node 7 because this connects to my existing settlement at node 7. This creates a path for future expansion from an established position, which aligns with priority #1 of building roads early to expand for resource diversity. Since I currently have only two settlements, expanding my network from one of them is optimal for eventually building more settlements. Building from my current settlement positions gives me the best opportunity to claim new territory efficiently rather than building disconnected roads. The road at (6, 7) specifically opens opportunities to expand toward new resource nodes, potentially allowing me to build a new settlement soon when I acquire the necessary resources.
