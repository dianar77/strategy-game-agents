Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 1, 2, 0, 0]
        - Settlements: [5, 3]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 2
        - Roads Available: 10

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}

# Action Analysis

Looking at the current game state:
- Resources: [0, 1, 2, 0, 0] (0 brick, 1 wood, 2 wheat, 0 sheep, 0 ore)
- I have 2 VPs from 2 settlements
- I have no other options except to end my turn

Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Justification: I must end my turn as it's the only available action. With my current resources (1 wood, 2 wheat), I cannot build any improvements - not enough resources for a road (needs brick+wood), settlement (needs brick+wood+wheat+sheep), city upgrade (needs 2 wheat+3 ore), or development card (needs wheat+sheep+ore). Ending my turn will allow me to collect new resources on the next roll and potentially enable construction actions on my next turn.
