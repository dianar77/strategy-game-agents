Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 2, 0, 0, 3]
        - Settlements: [22]
        - Cities: [6]
        - Victory Points (VP): 5
        - Roads Available: 11

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.PLAY_ROAD_BUILDING: 'PLAY_ROAD_BUILDING'>, value=None)
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.PLAY_ROAD_BUILDING: 'PLAY_ROAD_BUILDING'>, value=None): 1
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
I need to analyze both options to determine which is most strategic given the current game state.

Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.PLAY_ROAD_BUILDING: 'PLAY_ROAD_BUILDING'>, value=None)

Justification: Playing the Road Building development card is the optimal choice here because:

1. We have 3 wool resources which indicates we likely just purchased a development card. Using it immediately provides immediate strategic value without waiting.

2. Building two free roads will allow us to extend our network toward new resource nodes, potentially setting up for a new settlement in the future. This directly supports priority #1 of expanding for resource diversity.

3. The alternative is simply rolling, which doesn't guarantee any strategic progress, while Road Building provides certain advancement of our position.

4. With 11 roads available and only one settlement (at position 22), we need to expand our network to reach new viable settlement locations. Using Road Building now is more efficient than spending resources on roads later.

5. This expansion can potentially block opponent's paths (priority #3) while creating opportunities for our future growth.
