Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [1, 1, 0, 0, 0]
        - Settlements: [3, 5, 21]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 5
        - Roads Available: 5

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.PLAY_ROAD_BUILDING: 'PLAY_ROAD_BUILDING'>, value=None)
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.PLAY_ROAD_BUILDING: 'PLAY_ROAD_BUILDING'>, value=None): 1
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.PLAY_ROAD_BUILDING: 'PLAY_ROAD_BUILDING'>, value=None)

Justification: Playing the Road Building development card is the optimal choice because it allows me to place two roads for free, which advances my expansion strategy without consuming additional resources. With 5 roads still available, this will help me reach new potential settlement locations and secure valuable territory. Given my current resources are limited [1, 1, 0, 0, 0], this action provides strategic advantage without requiring resource expenditure. Road expansion is crucial in the early game to reach diverse resource spots and block opponent expansion paths. This aligns with our top priority of building settlements and roads early to expand resource diversity, as these new roads will open up opportunities for future settlements.
