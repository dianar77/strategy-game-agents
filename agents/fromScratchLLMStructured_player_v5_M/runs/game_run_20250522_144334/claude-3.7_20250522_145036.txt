Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 1, 2, 0, 0]
        - Settlements: [7, 16]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 3
        - Roads Available: 10

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
I'll help you make an optimal decision in this Catanatron Minigame.

Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

Justification: In this situation, rolling the dice is the only available action. This is a critical beginning step that will generate new resources based on the dice outcome. Currently, I have limited resources [0, 1, 2, 0, 0] (likely representing [Brick, Wood, Sheep, Wheat, Ore]), which isn't enough to build most structures. With settlements at positions 7 and 16, I need to gather more resources to execute my strategic priorities of expanding through additional settlements and roads, or eventually upgrading to cities. Rolling the dice is necessary to continue the game and potentially gain the resources needed for these next strategic moves. Once I have a better resource position after the roll, I can make more impactful decisions aligned with the priority of maximizing Victory Points efficiently.
