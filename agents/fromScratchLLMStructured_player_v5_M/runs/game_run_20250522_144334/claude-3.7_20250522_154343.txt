Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 2, 3, 0, 2]
        - Settlements: [22]
        - Cities: [6]
        - Victory Points (VP): 5
        - Roads Available: 9

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
# Catanatron Minigame Decision

Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Justification: Since there is only one available action (END_TURN), I must end my turn. With current resources [0, 2, 3, 0, 2] (representing [Brick, Lumber, Wool, Ore, Grain]), I don't have the correct combination to build anything new - I need brick for roads, brick+lumber+wool+grain for settlements, or ore+grain for city upgrades. Without sufficient brick, I cannot expand with roads or settlements, and without ore I cannot build cities. The heuristic score of 1 for ending turn confirms this is my only option. I'll use this turn transition to collect new resources on the next roll and hopefully gather the necessary brick or ore to make more impactful moves in the following turn.
