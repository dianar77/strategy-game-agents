Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 1, 2, 0, 0]
        - Settlements: [7, 16]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 3
        - Roads Available: 10

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
I'll analyze the current game state and the available actions to make the best strategic decision.

Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Justification: In this scenario, I only have one available action which is to end my turn. Looking at my resources [0, 1, 2, 0, 0], I have 1 brick and 2 lumber, but I lack the necessary wool and grain to build a settlement (which requires 1 brick, 1 lumber, 1 wool, and 1 grain). I also don't have the resources for a city upgrade (which requires 2 grain and 3 ore) or even for building a road (which requires 1 brick and 1 lumber). Since I cannot perform any building actions with my current resources, ending my turn is the correct strategic move. This will allow me to collect more resources on the next turn and hopefully have more options available for expansion or development.
