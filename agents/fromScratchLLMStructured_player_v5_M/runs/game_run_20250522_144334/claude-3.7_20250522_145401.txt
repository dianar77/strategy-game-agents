Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 1, 1, 0, 3]
        - Settlements: [7, 16]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 3
        - Roads Available: 8

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
I'll analyze this Catanatron minigame scenario carefully.

Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Justification: In this situation, ending my turn is the only available action. Looking at my current resources [0, 1, 1, 0, 3] (which represents [Brick, Wood, Sheep, Wheat, Ore]), I don't have enough materials to build any new structures. I need brick for roads, specific combinations for settlements, and wheat+ore for city upgrades. With my current resource combination, I can't execute any construction actions. Ending my turn will allow me to collect new resources on the next round, hopefully gathering the necessary materials to either build a road (needing brick+wood), or save toward upgrading one of my existing settlements at positions 7 and 16 into cities (needing 3 ore + 2 wheat). The high ore count (3) suggests I should be prioritizing city upgrades once I collect some wheat.
