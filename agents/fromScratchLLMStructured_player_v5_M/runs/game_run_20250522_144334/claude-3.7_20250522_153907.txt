Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 1, 4, 0, 3]
        - Settlements: [22]
        - Cities: [6]
        - Victory Points (VP): 5
        - Roads Available: 13

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('SHEEP', 'SHEEP', 'SHEEP', 'SHEEP', 'WOOD'))
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('SHEEP', 'SHEEP', 'SHEEP', 'SHEEP', 'WHEAT'))

Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('SHEEP', 'SHEEP', 'SHEEP', 'SHEEP', 'ORE'))

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('SHEEP', 'SHEEP', 'SHEEP', 'SHEEP', 'WOOD')): 1
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('SHEEP', 'SHEEP', 'SHEEP', 'SHEEP', 'WHEAT')): 1
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('SHEEP', 'SHEEP', 'SHEEP', 'SHEEP', 'BRICK')): 1
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('SHEEP', 'SHEEP', 'SHEEP', 'SHEEP', 'ORE')): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
I need to analyze the current state and available actions to make the best strategic decision.

Current resources: [0, 1, 4, 0, 3] which represents [BRICK, ORE, SHEEP, WHEAT, WOOD]

Looking at my available resources and actions:
- I have 4 SHEEP and 3 WOOD
- I have 1 ORE but no BRICK or WHEAT
- I can only trade or end my turn

For building options:
- Settlement requires BRICK, WOOD, SHEEP, WHEAT (missing BRICK and WHEAT)
- Road requires BRICK and WOOD (missing BRICK)
- City requires ORE×3 and WHEAT×2 (need more ORE and WHEAT)

Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('SHEEP', 'SHEEP', 'SHEEP', 'SHEEP', 'BRICK'))

Justification: Trading 4 SHEEP for 1 BRICK is the most strategic move because it gets me closer to building a road or settlement. I already have 3 WOOD, so obtaining BRICK would potentially enable me to build a road on my next turn if I can get the resources. Building roads is crucial early in the game for expansion possibilities, and aligns with priority #1 (build settlements and roads early). The other trade options (for WOOD, WHEAT, or ORE) are less impactful since I already have sufficient WOOD, and single units of WHEAT or additional ORE would not immediately enable any builds without further resources.
