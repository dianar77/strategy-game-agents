Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [1, 0, 2, 1, 1]
        - Settlements: [7, 16]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 3
        - Roads Available: 11

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUY_DEVELOPMENT_CARD: 'BUY_DEVELOPMENT_CARD'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUY_DEVELOPMENT_CARD: 'BUY_DEVELOPMENT_CARD'>, value=None): 7

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
I'll analyze the current game state and available actions to make the optimal choice.

Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUY_DEVELOPMENT_CARD: 'BUY_DEVELOPMENT_CARD'>, value=None)

Justification: Looking at the current game state, I have resources [1, 0, 2, 1, 1] which represents 1 brick, 0 wood, 2 wheat, 1 sheep, and 1 ore. This is the exact combination needed to purchase a development card (1 sheep, 1 wheat, 1 ore). The heuristic score strongly suggests buying a development card (score of 7) over ending my turn (score of 1).

Development cards provide several strategic advantages:
1. They might give me Victory Point cards that immediately increase my VP count
2. Knight cards can help block opponents and contribute toward the "Largest Army" bonus (2 VP)
3. Road Building, Year of Plenty, or Monopoly cards provide powerful abilities for future turns

Since I can't build roads, settlements, or cities with my current resources, and I have the exact resources needed for a development card, this is clearly the optimal move rather than ending my turn without taking any action.
