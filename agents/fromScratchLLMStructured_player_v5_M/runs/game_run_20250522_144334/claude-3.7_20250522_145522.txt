Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 2, 1, 1, 3]
        - Settlements: [7, 16]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 3
        - Roads Available: 8

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUY_DEVELOPMENT_CARD: 'BUY_DEVELOPMENT_CARD'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUY_DEVELOPMENT_CARD: 'BUY_DEVELOPMENT_CARD'>, value=None): 7

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
I need to choose between ending my turn and buying a development card. Let me analyze the situation:

Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUY_DEVELOPMENT_CARD: 'BUY_DEVELOPMENT_CARD'>, value=None)

Justification: The optimal choice is to buy a development card for several reasons:
1. Resource utilization: I currently have [0,2,1,1,3] resources (likely [Brick,Wood,Sheep,Wheat,Ore]), which includes the exact combination needed for a development card (1 sheep, 1 wheat, 1 ore).
2. Strategic value: Development cards can provide immediate benefits (Knight cards for army building and moving robbers) or direct victory points.
3. Higher heuristic score: The development card action has a much higher score (7) compared to ending the turn (1), indicating its superior strategic value.
4. Resource efficiency: Buying a card now prevents potential resource loss if a 7 is rolled and I have more than 7 resources in the future.
5. Maintaining options: Development cards provide flexibility in future turns and can be saved for optimal timing.

Simply ending my turn would waste this opportunity to advance my position in the game.
