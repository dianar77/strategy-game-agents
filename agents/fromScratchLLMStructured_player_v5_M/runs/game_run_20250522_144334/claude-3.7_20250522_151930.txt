Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [2, 0, 1, 2, 0]
        - Settlements: [3, 5]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 4
        - Roads Available: 8

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}

Response:
# Catanatron Minigame Analysis

Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Justification: In this situation, I have only one available action which is to end my turn. Looking at my current resources [2, 0, 1, 2, 0] (which represents [Brick, Ore, Sheep, Wood, Wheat]), I don't have enough resources to build any new structures. While having more options would be ideal, I must end my turn to collect more resources on future rolls. I currently have 2 settlements (at locations 3 and 5) contributing to my 4 victory points, and should focus on gathering the necessary resources on my next turn to either build new settlements (requiring brick, wood, sheep, wheat) or upgrade to cities (requiring ore and wheat, which I'm currently lacking). Ending my turn is the only strategic option available, allowing me to continue resource collection in the next round.
