Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 0, 1, 1, 2]
        - Settlements: [7, 16]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 6
        - Roads Available: 5

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
I'll evaluate the current game state and make the best strategic decision.

Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

Justification: I only have one option available in this turn - to roll the dice. This is a necessary action to progress the game and potentially gain resources. With my current resource collection [0, 0, 1, 1, 2] (representing Brick, Ore, Sheep, Wheat, and Wood), I have some Wood, Wheat, and Sheep but need more resources to build additional infrastructure. Rolling will hopefully generate more resources that align with my strategic goals of early expansion through settlements and roads. After rolling, I'll reassess my position based on any new resources gained and determine whether to build a road, save for another settlement, or consider other options.
