Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 4, 3, 0, 1]
        - Settlements: [22]
        - Cities: [6]
        - Victory Points (VP): 4
        - Roads Available: 13

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('BRICK', 'BRICK', 'BRICK', 'BRICK', 'WOOD'))
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('BRICK', 'BRICK', 'BRICK', 'BRICK', 'WHEAT'))

Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('BRICK', 'BRICK', 'BRICK', 'BRICK', 'ORE'))

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('BRICK', 'BRICK', 'BRICK', 'BRICK', 'WOOD')): 1
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('BRICK', 'BRICK', 'BRICK', 'BRICK', 'WHEAT')): 1
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('BRICK', 'BRICK', 'BRICK', 'BRICK', 'SHEEP')): 1
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('BRICK', 'BRICK', 'BRICK', 'BRICK', 'ORE')): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

# Analysis of Current Position

I need to decide the best action given my resources [0, 4, 3, 0, 1] (representing [WOOD, BRICK, SHEEP, WHEAT, ORE]).

I have:
- 0 WOOD
- 4 BRICK
- 3 SHEEP
- 0 WHEAT
- 1 ORE

Options:
1. End turn
2. Trade 4 BRICK for WOOD
3. Trade 4 BRICK for WHEAT
4. Trade 4 BRICK for SHEEP
5. Trade 4 BRICK for ORE

## Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('BRICK', 'BRICK', 'BRICK', 'BRICK', 'WHEAT'))

## Justification:
Trading 4 BRICK for WHEAT is the most valuable move because:

1. Resource balance: I have excess BRICK (4) but zero WHEAT, creating a critical imbalance.
2. Build potential: With WHEAT, I could be one step closer to building a new settlement (costs WOOD, BRICK, SHEEP, WHEAT) or development card (costs SHEEP, WHEAT, ORE).
3. City upgrade potential: WHEAT is required for city upgrades (costs WHEAT, ORE). I already have some ORE, so gaining WHEAT puts me closer to potentially upgrading one of my settlements.
4. Strategic diversity: Trading for WHEAT gives me 3 different resource types (WHEAT, SHEEP, ORE) rather than overloading on any single type.

While WOOD would also be useful, WHEAT offers more versatile building options when combined with my existing resources, especially for potential development cards which could yield additional victory points or other advantages.
