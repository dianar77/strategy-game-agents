Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [1, 0, 2, 0, 2]
        - Settlements: [7, 16]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 6
        - Roads Available: 2

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}

# Action Analysis

Looking at the current game state:

**Resources**: [1, 0, 2, 0, 2] = 1 Brick, 0 Wood, 2 Ore, 0 Wheat, 2 Sheep
**Settlements**: At positions 7 and 16
**Cities**: None
**Victory Points**: 6
**Roads Available**: 2

**Available Actions**:
- Roll dice

## Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

## Justification:
Rolling is the only available action at this point, and it's the correct move to progress the game. With 6 victory points already, we're in a strong position, but need more resources to continue building. The roll will potentially give us additional resources based on our settlement positions. Our current resource collection (especially the ore and sheep) might set us up for purchasing development cards or working toward city upgrades after we roll, which aligns with our priority of upgrading settlements to cities for higher VP returns.
