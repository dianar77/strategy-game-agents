Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2]
        - Settlements: [6, 22]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 2
        - Roads Available: 13

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUY_DEVELOPMENT_CARD: 'BUY_DEVELOPMENT_CARD'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUY_DEVELOPMENT_CARD: 'BUY_DEVELOPMENT_CARD'>, value=None): 7

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
I'll analyze this game situation carefully.

Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUY_DEVELOPMENT_CARD: 'BUY_DEVELOPMENT_CARD'>, value=None)

Justification: Buying a development card is the optimal choice here for several reasons. First, I have the exact resources needed (1 ore, 1 wheat, 1 sheep) as shown by my resource distribution [0, 2, 2, 2, 2]. Development cards can provide immediate benefits like Knight cards (which can disrupt opponents and count toward the Largest Army bonus), Victory Point cards (direct VP gain), or progress cards like Road Building, Year of Plenty, or Monopoly that offer strategic advantages. With a heuristic score of 7 versus 1 for ending my turn, the development card clearly offers more strategic value. Since I can't build additional settlements or roads with my current resources, investing in a development card is the most efficient way to progress toward victory while potentially gaining tactical advantages against opponents.
