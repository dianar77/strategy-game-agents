Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 1, 2, 1, 0]
        - Settlements: [0, 21]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 2
        - Roads Available: 11

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
I'll analyze the current game state and available actions for the Catanatron Minigame.

Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Justification: In the current game state, I have limited resources [0, 1, 2, 1, 0] which represents [Brick, Ore, Sheep, Wheat, Wood]. With these resources, I cannot build any new settlements (requires 1 brick, 1 wood, 1 sheep, 1 wheat), roads (requires 1 brick, 1 wood), or upgrade to cities (requires 3 ore, 2 wheat). Since I have no other available actions besides ending my turn, the only logical choice is to end the turn and collect more resources on subsequent rounds. Ending my turn allows me to potentially gather the necessary resources for expansion in the next round, which aligns with the priority of building settlements and roads early for resource diversity.
