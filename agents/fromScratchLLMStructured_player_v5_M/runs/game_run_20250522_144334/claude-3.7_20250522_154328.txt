Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 2, 3, 0, 2]
        - Settlements: [22]
        - Cities: [6]
        - Victory Points (VP): 5
        - Roads Available: 9

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}

# Action Analysis for Catanatron Minigame

Based on the current game state and available actions, I'll make the optimal decision:

**Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)**

**Justification:** Since END_TURN is the only available action, I must choose it. However, this is strategically reasonable because:
1. Current resources [0, 2, 3, 0, 2] don't allow building any new settlements (need brick and wood) or cities (need ore and grain)
2. With 5 VP already (from 1 city worth 2 VP and 3 settlements worth 1 VP each), I'm in a good position
3. Ending my turn allows me to potentially gather new resources in the next round that might enable building settlements (to expand resource diversity) or upgrading to cities (for more efficient VP)
4. Although I have sufficient brick and wheat, there are no other available actions that would use these resources productively at this moment

The next turn will hopefully bring resources needed to continue expansion according to the prioritized strategy.
