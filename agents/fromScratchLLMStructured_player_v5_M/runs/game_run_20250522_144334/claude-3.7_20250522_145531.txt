Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]
        - Settlements: [7, 16]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 3
        - Roads Available: 8

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
I'll analyze this game situation carefully.

Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Justification: In the current state, I have very limited resources - just 2 Brick and 2 Wood (resources [0,2,0,0,2]). This isn't enough to build any new settlement (costs 1 brick, 1 wood, 1 wheat, 1 sheep) or road (costs 1 brick, 1 wood). I also can't upgrade my settlements to cities since that requires 2 wheat and 3 ore, which I don't have. With no other actions available as indicated in the "Available Actions" section, ending my turn is the only viable option. This will allow me to collect new resources on the next dice roll and hopefully gain enough materials for construction in my next turn. My current position with 2 settlements and 3 VP suggests I need to focus on resource collection now to enable expansion in future turns.
