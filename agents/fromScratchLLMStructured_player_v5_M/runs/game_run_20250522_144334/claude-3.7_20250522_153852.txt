Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 1, 1, 0, 3]
        - Settlements: [22]
        - Cities: [6]
        - Victory Points (VP): 5
        - Roads Available: 13

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}

# Analysis of Current Game State

Looking at the current state, I have:
- Resources: [0, 1, 1, 0, 3] (0 brick, 1 wood, 1 wheat, 0 ore, 3 sheep)
- Settlements at node 22
- Cities at node 6
- 5 Victory Points (1 for settlement, 2 for city, possibly 2 from development cards)
- 13 roads remaining (out of 15 total)

## Action Decision

Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Justification: I currently don't have sufficient resources to build any meaningful structures. With no brick, I can't build roads or settlements. With no ore and only 1 wheat, I can't build cities or development cards. The only action available to me is to end my turn and hope for better resource production on the next roll. While ending turns unnecessarily should be avoided, in this specific situation with insufficient resources for any construction, it's the only viable option to progress the game and potentially collect resources needed for expansion on the next turn.
