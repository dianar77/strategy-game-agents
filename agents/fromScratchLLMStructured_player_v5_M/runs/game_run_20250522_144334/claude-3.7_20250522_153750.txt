Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 1, 0, 0, 1]
        - Settlements: [22]
        - Cities: [6]
        - Victory Points (VP): 5
        - Roads Available: 13

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}

Response:
# Catanatron Minigame Decision

## Action: END_TURN

## Justification:
Based on the given game state, I have no choice but to end my turn as it's the only available action. My current resource inventory (only 1 brick and 1 wood) is insufficient for any building actions. With these limited resources, I cannot:
- Build a road (requires 1 brick + 1 wood, which I have, but no legal placement option must be available)
- Build a settlement (requires 1 brick + 1 wood + 1 wheat + 1 sheep)
- Upgrade to a city (requires 2 wheat + 3 ore)
- Buy a development card (requires 1 wheat + 1 sheep + 1 ore)

The best strategic move is to end my turn and collect new resources on the next roll. With 5 VP already (from my 1 city worth 2 VP and 3 settlements worth 3 VP total), I'm in a solid position but need to accumulate more resources to continue expanding.
