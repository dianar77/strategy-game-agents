Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 1, 0, 0, 1]
        - Settlements: [22]
        - Cities: [6]
        - Victory Points (VP): 5
        - Roads Available: 11

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}

Response:
# Action Analysis for Catanatron Minigame

## Action: END_TURN

## Justification:
In this situation, I have no choice but to end my turn since it's the only available action. With my current resources [0 brick, 1 wood, 0 sheep, 0 wheat, 1 ore], I don't have enough materials to build any structure:

- Settlement requires: 1 brick, 1 wood, 1 sheep, 1 wheat
- Road requires: 1 brick, 1 wood
- City upgrade requires: 2 wheat, 3 ore
- Development card requires: 1 sheep, 1 wheat, 1 ore

Although ending the turn isn't an ideal action for maximizing VP efficiency, it's necessary to collect more resources on the next roll. My current position shows good progress with 5 VP (from 1 city at location 6 and 1 settlement at location 22). The priority now should be gathering resources to either:
1. Build roads to reach new settlement locations
2. Upgrade my remaining settlement to a city
3. Build new settlements in strategic locations

Ending my turn now will allow me to collect new resources on the next dice roll, potentially enabling more impactful actions in my next turn.
