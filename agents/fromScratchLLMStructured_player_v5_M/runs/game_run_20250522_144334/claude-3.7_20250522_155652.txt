Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]
        - Settlements: [5, 3]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 2
        - Roads Available: 10

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
Looking at the current game state, I only have one action available: ending my turn.

Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Justification: I currently have limited resources (only 1 Sheep) and no other actions available. This is not enough to build any structures (settlements require 1 Brick, 1 Sheep, 1 Wheat, and 1 Wood; roads require 1 Brick and 1 Wood). The best strategic move is to end my turn to collect more resources on the next round. With my 2 settlements already placed, I'll have opportunities to gather more diverse resources. Once I accumulate sufficient resources, I can then focus on building roads to expand my network or upgrade settlements to cities in future turns. Ending my turn is the only viable option for progress at this moment.
