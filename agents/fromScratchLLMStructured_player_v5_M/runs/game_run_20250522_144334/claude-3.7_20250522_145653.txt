Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 1, 0, 0, 3]
        - Settlements: [7, 16]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 5
        - Roads Available: 7

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
I'll analyze the current game state and available actions to make an optimal decision.

Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Justification: There's only one available action - to end my turn - so I must take it. Currently, I have 5 VP, settlements at positions 7 and 16, and resources [0, 1, 0, 0, 3] (likely representing [Brick, Lumber, Ore, Grain, Wool]). With only lumber and wool resources, I cannot build any new structures this turn (roads require brick+lumber, settlements require brick+lumber+grain+wool, and cities require ore+grain). My best move is to end my turn and hope for better resource production in the next round, which will allow me to pursue the priority of expanding with new roads and settlements. The heuristic score of 1 for this action confirms it's the only viable option this turn.
