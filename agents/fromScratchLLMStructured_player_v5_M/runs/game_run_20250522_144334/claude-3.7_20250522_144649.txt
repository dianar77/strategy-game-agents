Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 0, 2, 0, 2]
        - Settlements: [7, 16]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 3
        - Roads Available: 12

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}

# Game Analysis

Looking at the current game state:

Action: END_TURN
Justification: I must end my turn because it's the only available action. With my current resources of [0, 0, 2, 0, 2] (meaning 2 Wheat and 2 Wood), I don't have the right combination to build anything. While I have two settlements established at positions 7 and 16 giving me 2 VP (plus possibly 1 VP from another source), I need to gather more resources before I can take strategic actions. Specifically, I'm missing Brick and Ore which would be necessary for roads and city upgrades. Ending my turn is the correct move to collect new resources in the next round and potentially gain better building options.
