Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 3, 3, 1, 1]
        - Settlements: [22]
        - Cities: [6]
        - Victory Points (VP): 3
        - Roads Available: 13

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUY_DEVELOPMENT_CARD: 'BUY_DEVELOPMENT_CARD'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUY_DEVELOPMENT_CARD: 'BUY_DEVELOPMENT_CARD'>, value=None): 7

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUY_DEVELOPMENT_CARD: 'BUY_DEVELOPMENT_CARD'>, value=None)

Justification: Buying a development card is the optimal choice in this situation for several reasons. First, I have the exact resources needed (1 ore, 1 sheep, 1 wheat) to purchase a development card. Second, development cards can provide significant strategic advantages - they might yield Victory Point cards (immediate hidden VP), Knight cards (which can disrupt opponents and build toward Largest Army), or helpful development cards like Road Building, Monopoly, or Year of Plenty. The heuristic score of 7 versus 1 for ending the turn clearly indicates this is the more strategic action. While our primary goals include building settlements and roads early, we already have established some presence (with settlements at position 22, city at position 6), and when lacking resources for immediate expansion, development cards offer excellent value and flexibility while potentially increasing our VP count.
