Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 2, 1, 1, 3]
        - Settlements: [22]
        - Cities: [6]
        - Victory Points (VP): 5
        - Roads Available: 9

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUY_DEVELOPMENT_CARD: 'BUY_DEVELOPMENT_CARD'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUY_DEVELOPMENT_CARD: 'BUY_DEVELOPMENT_CARD'>, value=None): 7

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUY_DEVELOPMENT_CARD: 'BUY_DEVELOPMENT_CARD'>, value=None)

Justification: Buying a development card is clearly the optimal choice here with a heuristic score of 7 compared to just 1 for ending the turn. Looking at my resources [0, 2, 1, 1, 3], I have the exact combination needed for a development card (1 ore, 1 wheat, 1 sheep). Development cards offer multiple strategic advantages: they might provide immediate victory points, Knights for defense and Largest Army bonus (2 VP), or helpful development cards like Road Building, Monopoly, or Year of Plenty that can accelerate future expansion. With 5 VP already and limited immediate building options, investing in development cards is a strong play that could provide either direct VP or tools to gain more resources and expand more efficiently in future turns. Ending the turn without using these resources would be a wasted opportunity.
