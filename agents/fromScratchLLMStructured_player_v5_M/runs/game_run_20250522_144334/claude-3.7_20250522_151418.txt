Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 2, 3, 1, 0]
        - Settlements: [0, 21, 46]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 3
        - Roads Available: 6

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
I'll evaluate the best action for the current turn based on the available game state and action options.

Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Justification: There's only one available action - ending my turn. Given my current resources [0, 2, 3, 1, 0] (representing [brick, wood, sheep, wheat, ore]), I don't have the right combinations for any builds. I'm missing brick for roads (needs brick+wood), not enough wheat for settlements (needs brick+wood+sheep+wheat), and I lack ore for cities or development cards. While I have 6 roads available for placement and good VP potential with 3 settlements already built, I can't take any productive action this turn. Ending my turn is necessary to collect new resources on the next roll, which will hopefully provide the missing resources I need to continue expansion according to our priorities.
