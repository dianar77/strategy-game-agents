Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]
        - Settlements: [5, 3]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 2
        - Roads Available: 10

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
I notice that with my current resources [0, 1, 0, 0, 0], I only have 1 brick and no other resources. This isn't enough to build any structures (roads require brick and lumber; settlements require brick, lumber, wool, and grain). Since I can't build anything with my current resources, the only reasonable option is to end my turn and collect more resources on the next round.

Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Justification: With only one brick resource available, I cannot build any structures (roads, settlements, or cities). Ending my turn is the only viable option, as it allows me to collect more resources on the next round. While I generally want to avoid ending turns without taking actions, in this case it's necessary due to insufficient resources. On my next turn, I'll prioritize building roads and settlements based on the new resources I collect, focusing on expanding to resource-diverse locations to support future growth.
