Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [1, 3, 1, 0, 2]
        - Settlements: [3, 5, 21, 20]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 6
        - Roads Available: 0

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
I'll evaluate the optimal choice for the current game state.

Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

Justification: In this situation, I have only one available action which is to roll the dice. This is a necessary step to continue the game turn and potentially gather more resources. With my current resource allocation [1, 3, 1, 0, 2] (likely representing [Brick, Wood, Sheep, Wheat, Ore]), I don't have enough resources for building new settlements or upgrading to cities yet. Rolling the dice could yield additional resources that will enable more strategic actions in my next turn. Since I already have 4 settlements established but no roads available, I need to focus on gathering resources for city upgrades (which cost 3 ore and 2 wheat) to continue increasing my VP efficiently. Rolling is the only way to progress toward that goal at this moment.
