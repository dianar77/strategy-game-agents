Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
        - Settlements: [7]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 1
        - Roads Available: 15

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(6, 7))
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(7, 24))
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(7, 8))

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(6, 7)): 10
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(7, 24)): 10
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(7, 8)): 10

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}

# Analysis of Road Building Options

Looking at the available actions, I need to choose one of three possible road placements from my current settlement at node 7.

All three options have equal heuristic scores (10), which suggests they're strategically similar in the immediate term. Since I currently have no resources, this is likely part of initial placement where roads are free.

I need to evaluate which direction offers the best potential for future expansion based on resource diversity and blocking considerations.

## Decision

Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(7, 8))

Justification: Without detailed board information like resource distributions, I'm selecting the road to node 8 as it likely provides the best strategic expansion potential. Moving in this direction probably opens up connections to more diverse resource hexes or reaches toward valuable intersection points. Building toward node 8 likely positions me to establish settlements at promising locations for resource diversity, aligning with my first priority of early expansion. This road placement likely creates opportunities to claim strategic positions before opponents can reach them, setting up a stronger foundation for my subsequent development strategy.
