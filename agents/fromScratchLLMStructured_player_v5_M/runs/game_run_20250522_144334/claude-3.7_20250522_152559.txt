Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [1, 2, 3, 0, 3]
        - Settlements: [3, 5, 21]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 5
        - Roads Available: 0

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
I'll analyze the current game state and make the optimal decision.

Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Justification: In this situation, ending my turn is the only available action. While I prefer taking impactful actions, my resources of [1, 2, 3, 0, 3] (representing brick, wood, sheep, wheat, ore) aren't sufficient for any builds. I need 1 brick + 1 wood to build a road, but I have no roads available anyway (Roads Available: 0). For a settlement, I'd need 1 brick + 1 wood + 1 sheep + 1 wheat, but I lack wheat. For a city upgrade, I'd need 2 wheat + 3 ore, but I lack wheat again. For development cards, I'd need 1 sheep + 1 wheat + 1 ore, but I still lack wheat. Given these constraints, ending my turn is the only reasonable option, allowing me to collect more resources on the next round to enable more strategic actions.
