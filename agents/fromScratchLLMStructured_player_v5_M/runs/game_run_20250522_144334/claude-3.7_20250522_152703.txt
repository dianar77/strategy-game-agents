Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [3, 3, 4, 1, 0]
        - Settlements: [3, 5, 21]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 5
        - Roads Available: 0

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
I need to analyze the current game state and available actions to make the most strategic choice.

Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_SETTLEMENT: 'BUILD_SETTLEMENT'>, value=20)

Justification: Building a settlement at position 20 is the optimal choice because:
1. It has the highest heuristic score (8.25) among all available options, indicating it's likely positioned on valuable resource hexes or has good future expansion potential.
2. My current resources [3,3,4,1,0] (likely [Brick, Wood, Sheep, Wheat, Ore]) allow me to build a settlement without trading.
3. Adding another settlement will immediately increase my VP count from 5 to 6, bringing me closer to victory.
4. New settlements improve resource collection diversity, addressing my priority of expanding early game for better resource generation.
5. While I have no roads available, I can still build settlements at legal positions, and position 20 appears to be a legal and advantageous location.
6. The maritime trade options have significantly lower scores (1.0) and would waste valuable resources without immediate VP gain.
