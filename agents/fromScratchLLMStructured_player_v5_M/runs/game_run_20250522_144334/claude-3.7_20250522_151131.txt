Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 1, 2, 0, 0]
        - Settlements: [0, 21, 46]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 3
        - Roads Available: 8

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
I'll analyze the current game state and available actions to determine the optimal move in the Catanatron Minigame.

Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Justification: With my current resources [0, 1, 2, 0, 0] (likely representing [Brick, Wood, Sheep, Wheat, Ore]), I don't have sufficient materials to build any new settlements, cities, or roads. I currently have 3 VP from my three settlements at positions 0, 21, and 46, which provides good board presence. Since the only available action is to end my turn, I must take this option to collect more resources in the next round. During my next turn, I'll focus on using newly collected resources to either build roads to expand toward new settlement locations or save toward upgrading existing settlements to cities (which requires 2 wheat and 3 ore). Ending my turn now is strategically necessary to continue resource accumulation for future development.
