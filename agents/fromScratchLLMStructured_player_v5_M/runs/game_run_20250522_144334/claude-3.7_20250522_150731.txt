Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 0, 1, 1, 0]
        - Settlements: [0, 21]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 2
        - Roads Available: 11

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
I'll analyze this game state and suggest the optimal action based on the Catanatron Minigame priorities.

Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Justification: In this situation, ending the turn is the only available action. I currently have minimal resources (just 1 wood and 1 brick), which isn't enough to build a road (costs 1 wood + 1 brick) or anything else. Since I can't build any structures with my current resources, the best strategic move is to end my turn to collect more resources on the next roll. With settlements at positions 0 and 21, I have some resource generation capability in place. My next priority should be to use future resources to expand with roads and more settlements to diversify my resource collection, following the first priority guideline. Ending the turn now is necessary to move the game forward and potentially gather the resources needed for meaningful actions on my next turn.
