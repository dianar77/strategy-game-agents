Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [1, 3, 3, 0, 3]
        - Settlements: [3, 5, 21]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 5
        - Roads Available: 0

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

Justification: In the current game state, I only have one available action which is to roll the dice. This is a necessary action to progress the game and potentially gather more resources. With my current resource inventory [1, 3, 3, 0, 3] (representing [Brick, Lumber, Wool, Grain, Ore]), I have a decent amount of lumber, wool, and ore, but I'm lacking grain which will be needed for city upgrades. I also have no roads available, so I'll need more resources before I can expand further. Rolling the dice is the only way to potentially gain these needed resources. After rolling, I'll be able to assess new action possibilities based on whatever resources I receive.
