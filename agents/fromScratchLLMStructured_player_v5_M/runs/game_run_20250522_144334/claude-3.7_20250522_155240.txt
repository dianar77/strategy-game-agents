Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 1, 2, 0, 0]
        - Settlements: [5, 3]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 2
        - Roads Available: 10

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
I'll analyze the optimal move for this turn of Catanatron Minigame.

Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

Justification: At this point in the game, the only available action is to roll the dice. This is a necessary action to generate new resources which will enable further building actions. Currently, I have [0, 1, 2, 0, 0] resources (likely representing [Wood, Brick, Ore, Sheep, Wheat]), which isn't enough to build any significant structures. With 2 settlements already placed and 10 roads available, my immediate priority after rolling will be to use any new resources to either:
1. Build more roads to expand my network (costs wood and brick)
2. Build additional settlements if possible (costs wood, brick, sheep, and wheat)
3. Upgrade existing settlements to cities if I receive more ore (costs ore and wheat)

The dice roll is crucial for advancing my position and unlocking these strategic options, making it the correct and only choice at this moment.
