Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [1, 0, 1, 0, 1]
        - Settlements: [3, 5, 21]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 5
        - Roads Available: 5

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}

Response:
# Catanatron Minigame Decision

Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

Justification: In this scenario, the only available action is to roll the dice. Rolling is the essential first step of any turn in Catan, as it determines what resources all players will collect. Currently, I have limited resources [1, 0, 1, 0, 1] (likely representing 1 brick, 0 wool, 1 lumber, 0 grain, and 1 ore), which is not enough to build anything substantial. Rolling the dice gives me an opportunity to collect additional resources that could enable building roads (requiring brick and lumber) or settlements (requiring brick, lumber, wool, and grain) on my next action. With 5 roads still available and a decent settlement base (3 settlements), collecting more resources through rolling is the only viable strategic choice to continue expanding my position in the game.
