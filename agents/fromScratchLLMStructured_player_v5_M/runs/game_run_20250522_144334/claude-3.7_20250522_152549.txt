Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [1, 2, 2, 0, 2]
        - Settlements: [3, 5, 21]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 5
        - Roads Available: 0

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
I need to analyze the current game state and determine the best action to take.

Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

Justification: This is the only available action at this moment. Rolling the dice is a necessary game progression step that will potentially generate more resources. With my current resources [1, 2, 2, 0, 2] (likely representing [Brick, Wood, Sheep, Wheat, Ore]), I have some flexibility but need more resources to build effectively. Since I have 0 roads available but have settlements at positions 3, 5, and 21, I should focus on gathering resources to upgrade these settlements to cities (requiring 3 ore and 2 wheat, which I'm currently short on). The dice roll could provide the resources I need to make progress toward my strategic priorities. This is the only logical action to take now to continue the game flow.
