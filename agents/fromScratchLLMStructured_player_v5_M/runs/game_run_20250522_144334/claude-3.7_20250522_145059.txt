Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 1, 3, 0, 1]
        - Settlements: [7, 16]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 3
        - Roads Available: 10

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
I'll analyze this game state and make the best decision:

Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Justification: In this situation, ending my turn is the only available action and therefore the optimal choice. Looking at my current resources [0, 1, 3, 0, 1], I have some brick, wood, and sheep, but not in combinations that allow me to build any meaningful structures. I need at least one more brick to build a road (costs 1 brick, 1 wood) or more diverse resources for settlements. By ending my turn now, I'll collect new resources on the next roll, hopefully getting what I need to expand with new roads or settlements. My current position with two settlements (at nodes 7 and 16) gives me 2 VP plus possibly 1 more from another source, and ending my turn is necessary to continue developing my strategy in subsequent turns.
