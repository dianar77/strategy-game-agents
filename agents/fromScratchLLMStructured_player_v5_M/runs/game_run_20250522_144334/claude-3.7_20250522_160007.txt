Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [2, 0, 6, 3, 0]
        - Settlements: [5, 3]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 2
        - Roads Available: 10

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

Justification: Rolling the dice is the only available action at this moment, making it the clear optimal choice. This roll will potentially generate additional resources based on the numbers adjacent to my settlements, which will help me execute my next strategic moves. With my current resources [2 brick, 0 wool, 6 lumber, 3 ore, 0 grain], I'm particularly well-positioned to build roads (requiring brick and lumber) after the roll. Since I have only 2 settlements currently and 10 roads available, getting a favorable roll could allow me to expand my network and place additional settlements, directly supporting my primary goal of early expansion. Rolling is a necessary game progression step that could significantly impact my resource position and open up more valuable actions in my next turn.
