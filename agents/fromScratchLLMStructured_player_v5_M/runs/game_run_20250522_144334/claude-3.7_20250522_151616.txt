Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 1, 0, 1, 0]
        - Settlements: [3, 5]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 2
        - Roads Available: 11

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}

Response:
# Catanatron Minigame Analysis

Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Justification: In this situation, ending my turn is the only available action. I currently have limited resources - just 1 brick and 1 wood. This combination isn't sufficient to build any meaningful structure (a road would require 1 brick + 1 wood, but I would also need to plan what that road connects to). The game state shows I already have two settlements providing 2 VP, but I need to gather more resources to continue expansion. With no other legal actions available, ending the turn is the optimal choice to progress the game and potentially collect new resources during the next round. On my next turn, with hopefully more resources, I can implement my strategy of early expansion through roads and settlements to secure diverse resource production.
