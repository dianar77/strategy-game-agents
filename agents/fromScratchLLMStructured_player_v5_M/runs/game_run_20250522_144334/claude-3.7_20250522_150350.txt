Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [1, 1, 1, 0, 2]
        - Settlements: [7, 16]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 6
        - Roads Available: 3

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}

Response:
# Analysis of Catanatron Minigame Decision

Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

Justification: In the current state, I only have one available action - to roll the dice. This is the natural progression of the game that I must take to generate new resources. With my current resources [1, 1, 1, 0, 2] (likely brick, wood, sheep, ore, wheat), I don't have enough to build new settlements, cities, or development cards. Rolling will potentially provide additional resources that will enable more strategic actions on my next turn. Since I already have 6 victory points and a decent position with two settlements, getting more resources through rolling is the clear best move to continue my expansion strategy.
