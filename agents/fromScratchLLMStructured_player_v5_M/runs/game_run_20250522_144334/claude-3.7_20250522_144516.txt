Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 0, 3, 0, 2]
        - Settlements: [7, 16]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 2
        - Roads Available: 13

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
I've analyzed the current game state and available actions for the Catanatron Minigame.

Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Justification: The only available action is to end my turn, so I must select it. With my current resources [0, 0, 3, 0, 2] (representing [Brick, Wood, Sheep, Wheat, Ore]), I have 3 sheep and 2 ore. This isn't enough for any productive builds since:
- Building a road requires 1 brick and 1 wood (which I don't have)
- Building a settlement requires 1 brick, 1 wood, 1 sheep, and 1 wheat (I'm missing brick, wood, and wheat)
- Upgrading to a city requires 2 wheat and 3 ore (I have 2 ore but no wheat)
- Development cards require 1 sheep, 1 wheat, and 1 ore (I have sheep and ore but no wheat)

Ending my turn allows me to gather more resources on the next roll and potentially set up for strategic builds in future turns. On my next turn, I should prioritize acquiring the resources I'm missing (particularly brick and wood) to expand my settlement network.
