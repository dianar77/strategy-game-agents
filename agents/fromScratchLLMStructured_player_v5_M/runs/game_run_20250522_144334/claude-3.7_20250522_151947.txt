Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [3, 2, 1, 2, 0]
        - Settlements: [3, 5]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 4
        - Roads Available: 8

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
I'll analyze the current game state and determine the best action to take.

Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

Justification: In this case, there's only one available action - to roll the dice. This is a mandatory step at the beginning of each turn in Catan, as it determines resource production. Rolling will potentially give me additional resources based on the settlements I have at positions 3 and 5, which will then enable me to build more infrastructure. Since I already have 3 brick, 2 lumber, 1 wool, 2 grain, and 0 ore, a good roll might give me enough resources to either build a new road (costs 1 brick, 1 lumber) to expand my network, or potentially save toward upgrading a settlement to a city (costs 3 ore, 2 grain) for additional VP. Since rolling is my only option, this is clearly the optimal choice to progress the game.
