Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [2, 0, 0, 3, 1]
        - Settlements: [3, 5]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 4
        - Roads Available: 9

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
I need to analyze the current game state and determine my best course of action.

Looking at my available actions, I only have one option:
- End Turn

Looking at my current resources [2, 0, 0, 3, 1] (likely [Brick, Lumber, Wool, Grain, Ore]), I don't have the right combinations to build anything new:
- A road requires 1 brick and 1 lumber (I have 2 brick but 0 lumber)
- A settlement requires 1 brick, 1 lumber, 1 wool, and 1 grain (missing lumber and wool)
- A city requires 2 grain and 3 ore (I have 3 grain but only 1 ore)
- A development card requires 1 wool, 1 grain, and 1 ore (missing wool)

Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Justification: With my current resource combination [2, 0, 0, 3, 1], I cannot build any new structures or purchase development cards. I need to end my turn to collect more resources, particularly lumber and wool which I'm completely out of. On my next turn, I should focus on using my brick and grain resources efficiently, potentially aiming to build a road if I collect lumber, or saving for a city upgrade once I collect more ore.
