Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]
        - Settlements: [5, 3]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 2
        - Roads Available: 10

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD: 'PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD'>, value=None)
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD: 'PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD'>, value=None): 1
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
I need to evaluate the best move in this Catanatron game based on the current game state and available actions.

Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

Justification: The decision is between playing a Knight card or rolling the dice. I have very limited resources (just 1 grain) which isn't enough to build anything significant. Playing the Knight card now would be wasteful since:
1. I don't need to move the robber defensively at this moment (no immediate threat mentioned)
2. I'm not close to getting the Largest Army bonus (which requires at least 3 Knight cards)
3. I should save the Knight card for when it could provide a strategic advantage, such as stealing resources from an opponent or protecting my key production hexes

Rolling the dice gives me a chance to gain additional resources that I desperately need for expansion. With only 1 grain and no other resources, I need to improve my resource position before making other moves. The roll might provide the resources I need to build roads or settlements according to my primary objective of early expansion.
