Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1]
        - Settlements: [3, 5]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 4
        - Roads Available: 9

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
I'll analyze the current game state and make a strategic decision.

Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Justification: Given the current game state, I have limited resources (only 1 wood and 1 brick) which isn't enough to build any meaningful structures. I can't build a road (costs 1 wood + 1 brick), settlement (costs 1 wood + 1 brick + 1 wheat + 1 sheep), or city (costs 2 wheat + 3 ore). Since I have no other available actions besides ending my turn, the optimal choice is to end my turn to collect more resources on the next roll. This will allow me to potentially gain the necessary resources for building roads or settlements on my next turn, advancing my expansion strategy. While I generally want to avoid ending turns without taking action, in this specific case, there's no other viable option.
