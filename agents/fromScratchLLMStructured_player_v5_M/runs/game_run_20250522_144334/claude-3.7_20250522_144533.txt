Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 0, 4, 0, 2]
        - Settlements: [7, 16]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 2
        - Roads Available: 13

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('SHEEP', 'SHEEP', 'SHEEP', 'SHEEP', 'WOOD'))

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
I need to analyze the available actions and my current resources to make the optimal decision.

Looking at my resources: [0, 0, 4, 0, 2] which represents [BRICK, ORE, SHEEP, WHEAT, WOOD]
I have 4 SHEEP and 2 WOOD, but no BRICK, ORE, or WHEAT.

Available actions:
1. End my turn
2. Trade 4 SHEEP for 1 WOOD
3. Trade 4 SHEEP for 1 WHEAT
4. Trade 4 SHEEP for 1 BRICK
5. Trade 4 SHEEP for 1 ORE

Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('SHEEP', 'SHEEP', 'SHEEP', 'SHEEP', 'BRICK'))

Justification: Trading for BRICK is the most strategic choice because it will help me build roads and new settlements, which aligns with priority #1: "Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity." A road costs 1 BRICK + 1 WOOD, and after this trade, I'll have 1 BRICK and 2 WOOD, giving me enough resources to build a road on my next turn. This will advance my position more than simply ending my turn, and adding more roads is essential for expanding my settlement network. BRICK is more valuable for early game expansion than the other resources I could trade for, as I already have WOOD for roads, but need BRICK to complete the resource requirement.
