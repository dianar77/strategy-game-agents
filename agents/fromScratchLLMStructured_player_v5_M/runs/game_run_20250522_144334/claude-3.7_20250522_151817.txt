Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [1, 0, 0, 3, 1]
        - Settlements: [3, 5]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 4
        - Roads Available: 9

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
I'll analyze the current game state and make the optimal decision.

Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Justification: Based on the current game state, I have limited resources [1, 0, 0, 3, 1] which appears to be [Brick, Lumber, Wool, Grain, Ore]. With these resources, I cannot build any new settlements (which require Brick, Lumber, Wool, Grain) or cities (which require 3 Ore and 2 Grain). Although I have 3 Grain and 1 Ore, I'm still 2 Ore short for a city upgrade. Similarly, I cannot build roads (which require Brick and Lumber) as I have only 1 Brick and no Lumber. Since no construction or development actions are possible with my current resources, ending my turn is the only logical move. This will allow me to collect new resources on the next turn and potentially enable more strategic options.
