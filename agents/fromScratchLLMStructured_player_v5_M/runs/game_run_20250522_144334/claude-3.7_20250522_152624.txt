Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [2, 3, 3, 0, 3]
        - Settlements: [3, 5, 21]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 5
        - Roads Available: 0

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

Justification: Since this is the only action available at this moment, I must roll the dice to continue the game. Rolling will generate new resources based on the territories adjacent to my settlements, which I need to build more infrastructure. With my current resources [2, 3, 3, 0, 3] (likely representing [Brick, Wool, Ore, Wheat, Lumber]), I need to gather more resources - especially wheat which I currently lack - before I can execute my strategic priorities like upgrading settlements to cities (requires 2 wheat and 3 ore) or building new roads (requires brick and lumber). Rolling is the necessary first step in this turn to advance the game and potentially gain valuable resources.
