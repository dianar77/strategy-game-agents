Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 2, 5, 0, 3]
        - Settlements: [22]
        - Cities: [6]
        - Victory Points (VP): 5
        - Roads Available: 9

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

Justification: I need to roll the dice to continue my turn. This is the only available action at this moment, and rolling will determine what resources I receive, which will inform my subsequent strategic decisions. With my current resource supply (0 brick, 2 wool, 5 lumber, 0 ore, 3 grain), I'm particularly hoping for brick and ore to enable building roads and upgrading settlements. The dice roll is mandatory to progress in the game, and will open up further action possibilities based on what resources I gain.
