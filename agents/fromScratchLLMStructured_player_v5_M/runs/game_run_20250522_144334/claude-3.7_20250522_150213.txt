Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [1, 0, 0, 0, 1]
        - Settlements: [7, 16]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 6
        - Roads Available: 5

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
I'll analyze this Catanatron minigame scenario carefully.

Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Justification: I have to end my turn because it's the only available action. With my current resources [1, 0, 0, 0, 1] (which appears to be 1 brick, 0 wood, 0 sheep, 0 wheat, 1 ore), I don't have enough materials to build roads (need brick+wood), settlements (need brick+wood+sheep+wheat), or cities (need 2 wheat+3 ore). Since I can't take any building actions with my limited resources, ending my turn is the optimal choice so I can collect new resources on the next roll and hopefully have more strategic options available on my next turn. With 6 VP already and settlements at positions 7 and 16, I'm in a decent position to continue my expansion strategy once I acquire more resources.
