Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 2, 2, 1, 0]
        - Settlements: [6, 22]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 2
        - Roads Available: 13

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

Justification: In this turn, I need to roll the dice as it's the only available action. Rolling is a fundamental game mechanic that will potentially bring me new resources based on the numbers rolled and the positions of my settlements (at locations 6 and 22). With my current resource count [0 brick, 2 wood, 2 wheat, 1 ore, 0 sheep], I'm close to being able to build a road (needs 1 brick, 1 wood) or potentially a development card (needs 1 wheat, 1 sheep, 1 ore). A good roll could provide the missing resources I need to make more strategic moves in subsequent turns. Since this is the only action available, I must take it to advance the game and work toward my priority of expanding my settlement network.
