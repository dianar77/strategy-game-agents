Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 0, 2, 0, 0]
        - Settlements: [7, 16]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 3
        - Roads Available: 10

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

Justification: In the current game state, rolling the dice is the only available action. This is a necessary and impactful move as it will determine what resources all players receive based on the settlement positions and the number rolled. With 2 lumber resources currently in hand but insufficient resources for building anything yet, a good roll could provide the additional resources needed to build roads or settlements. Since I have settlements at positions 7 and 16, I'll receive resources if their corresponding number tiles are rolled. Rolling is the essential first step of my turn that will determine what strategic options become available afterward.
