Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [2, 1, 2, 0, 0]
        - Settlements: [0, 21, 46]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 3
        - Roads Available: 8

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

Justification: I must roll the dice as it's my only available action at this moment. Rolling is a fundamental mechanism in Catan that determines resource production, and it's necessary to progress the game. With my current resources [2, 1, 2, 0, 0] (likely representing [Brick, Ore, Wool, Grain, Lumber]), I need more resources to execute my expansion strategy. My settlements at positions 0, 21, and 46 will potentially generate resources based on this roll, which could enable building new roads or settlements to expand my territory. Since resource acquisition is critical for all subsequent actions, rolling the dice is the optimal and only choice at this point.
