Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 1, 0, 1, 2]
        - Settlements: [7, 16]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 3
        - Roads Available: 8

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}

Response:
# Catanatron Decision Analysis

Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Justification: Since this is the only available action presented, I must end my turn. With my current resources [0, 1, 0, 1, 2] (representing [Brick, Lumber, Ore, Grain, Wool]), I don't have the correct combinations for building anything useful. I have 1 Lumber, 1 Grain, and 2 Wool, but I'm missing Brick (for roads) or Ore (for city upgrades). Ending my turn is the only viable strategy now to collect more resources on the next roll. My two settlements (at positions 7 and 16) will allow me to gather more diverse resources on the next turn, setting me up for potential builds in subsequent rounds. While I should typically avoid ending turns without building when possible, in this case there are no other options available.
