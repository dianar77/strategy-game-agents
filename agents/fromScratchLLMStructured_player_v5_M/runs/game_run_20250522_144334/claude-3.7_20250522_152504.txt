Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [3, 0, 1, 0, 1]
        - Settlements: [3, 5, 21]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 5
        - Roads Available: 0

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
I'll analyze this Catanatron game situation and make the best decision.

Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Justification: I have no choice but to end my turn since it's the only available action. My current resources [3, 0, 1, 0, 1] represent [Brick, Lumber, Wool, Grain, Ore] which means I have 3 brick, 1 wool, and 1 ore. This isn't enough for any building action - I can't build a road (needs brick and lumber), can't build a settlement (needs brick, lumber, wool, and grain), and can't upgrade to a city (needs 2 grain and 3 ore). With 0 roads available, I'm already at my road-building limit. The best strategy now is to end my turn and collect more resources on the next round to enable more impactful actions. I already have 3 settlements at positions 3, 5, and 21, giving me 3 VP from those, plus likely 2 more VP from other sources (possibly Longest Road or special cards), for a total of 5 VP.
