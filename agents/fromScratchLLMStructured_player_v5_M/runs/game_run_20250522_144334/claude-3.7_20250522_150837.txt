Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 1, 2, 1, 0]
        - Settlements: [0, 21]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 2
        - Roads Available: 11

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
I'll analyze the available actions in this Catanatron Minigame scenario and make the optimal decision.

Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Justification: In this situation, ending my turn is the only available action. Based on my current resources [0, 1, 2, 1, 0] (likely representing [brick, wood, sheep, wheat, ore]), I don't have sufficient materials to build any new structures. I have 1 wood, 2 sheep, and 1 wheat, but building requires specific combinations (settlement: brick, wood, sheep, wheat; road: brick, wood; city: 3 ore, 2 wheat). Since I cannot meet any building requirements with my current resources, ending my turn is the correct strategic move to collect more resources on the next round. This allows me to work toward my priority of building settlements and roads early for resource diversification.
