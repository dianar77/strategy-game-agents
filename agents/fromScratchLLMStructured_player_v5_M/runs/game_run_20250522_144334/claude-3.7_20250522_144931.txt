Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [1, 1, 0, 0, 0]
        - Settlements: [7, 16]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 3
        - Roads Available: 11

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(24, 53))
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(8, 27))

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}

========================================

Response:
I need to think carefully about which road will position me best for future expansion, since I have limited resources (just 2 resources total).

Looking at my current settlements at nodes 7 and 16, I should build a road that helps me expand toward promising resource spots and potential future settlements.

Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(5, 16))

Justification: Building a road from node 5 to my existing settlement at node 16 is the optimal choice because it extends my network in a strategic direction. This road creates a pathway toward potentially valuable resource spots and sets me up for future settlement placement. Since I already have a settlement at node 16, this road directly connects to my existing infrastructure, making it more efficient than roads that would be isolated. Building roads early is essential for expansion, and this particular road maximizes my future settlement options while using my limited brick and lumber resources effectively.
