Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [3, 0, 2, 0, 2]
        - Settlements: [7, 16]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 6
        - Roads Available: 2

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}

# Catanatron Minigame Analysis

## Action: END_TURN

## Justification:
Based on the current game state, I have no other available actions besides ending my turn, so this is my only valid move. Let me explain why:

1. **Current Resource Constraints:**
   - I have [3 Brick, 0 Wool, 2 Lumber, 0 Grain, 2 Ore]
   - With these resources, I cannot:
     - Build a settlement (costs 1 brick, 1 wool, 1 lumber, 1 grain)
     - Build a city (costs 2 grain, 3 ore)
     - Buy a development card (costs 1 wool, 1 grain, 1 ore)

2. **Strategic Position Assessment:**
   - I currently have 2 settlements at locations 7 and 16
   - I have 6 victory points already, which is substantial
   - I have 2 roads available, but cannot build more roads with current resources (need brick and lumber)

3. **Next Turn Planning:**
   - By ending my turn now, I'll collect new resources on the next dice roll
   - With more resources, I may be able to upgrade one of my settlements to a city (particularly if I get grain)
   - Or I might build new roads to expand toward valuable resource spots

Since there are no other options available in the action list, ending my turn is the only possible move, allowing me to gather more resources and pursue building opportunities on my next turn.
