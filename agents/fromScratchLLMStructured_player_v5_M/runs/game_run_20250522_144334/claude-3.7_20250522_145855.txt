Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [3, 0, 0, 0, 3]
        - Settlements: [7, 16]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 6
        - Roads Available: 5

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
I need to analyze this game state carefully to determine the best move.

Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Justification: I have limited options in this turn, with only the END_TURN action available to me. Looking at my current resources [3, 0, 0, 0, 3], I have only brick and wood, but no ore, sheep, or wheat. These resources don't allow me to build any settlements, cities, or development cards, which all require specific resource combinations I don't currently have. While I have 5 roads available, building a road costs 1 brick and 1 wood each, which would use up my resources without directly earning victory points. Since I already have 6 VPs and solid settlement positions at nodes 7 and 16, the best strategic choice is to end my turn and collect new resources on the next round, which will hopefully give me the diverse resources needed for my next development move.
