Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 1, 1, 0, 2]
        - Settlements: [22]
        - Cities: [6]
        - Victory Points (VP): 5
        - Roads Available: 9

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
I need to analyze my current position and make the best strategic decision.

Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Justification: Based on my current resources [0, 1, 1, 0, 2] (likely representing [Brick, Lumber, Wool, Grain, Ore]), I don't have enough resources to build anything valuable. I cannot build a road (costs 1 brick, 1 lumber), settlement (costs 1 brick, 1 lumber, 1 wool, 1 grain), or upgrade to a city (costs 2 grain, 3 ore). With 5 VP already from my settlements and cities, I'm in a decent position, but need to gather more resources before making my next move. Ending my turn is the only logical choice to collect more resources on the next roll. Since this is the only available action with a heuristic score of 1, I should take it and prepare for more strategic options on my next turn.
