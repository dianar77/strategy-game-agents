Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 1, 1, 0, 2]
        - Settlements: [22]
        - Cities: [6]
        - Victory Points (VP): 5
        - Roads Available: 9

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}

Response:
# Analysis of Current Game State

I'll analyze the current game state and available actions to make the optimal decision:

**Current Resources**: [0 brick, 1 wood, 1 wheat, 0 ore, 2 sheep]
**Infrastructure**: 1 settlement (at position 22), 1 city (at position 6), 9 roads available
**Victory Points**: 5 points (1 from settlement, 2 from city, possibly 2 from other sources like longest road)

## Action Decision

Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Justification: Since there is only one available action (END_TURN), I must take it. My current resource collection [0,1,1,0,2] doesn't allow me to build anything valuable - I lack brick for roads/settlements and ore for city upgrades. Ending my turn is the only strategic option, allowing me to collect new resources on the next round. With 5 VP already and established infrastructure, I'm in a solid position. After gathering more diverse resources on my next turn, I should prioritize either expanding with a new settlement (needing brick) or upgrading another settlement to a city (needing ore).
