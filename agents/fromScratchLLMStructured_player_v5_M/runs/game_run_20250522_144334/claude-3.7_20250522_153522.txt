Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 2, 2, 0, 1]
        - Settlements: [22]
        - Cities: [6]
        - Victory Points (VP): 3
        - Roads Available: 13

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}

# Action Analysis

Looking at the current game state and available actions:

**Current Resources:** [0, 2, 2, 0, 1] (Brick: 0, Ore: 2, Sheep: 2, Wheat: 0, Wood: 1)
**Available Actions:** Only END_TURN is available

## Action: END_TURN

**Justification:** With the current resources, I cannot build any meaningful structure:
- Settlement requires [1,0,1,1,1] (brick, ore, sheep, wheat, wood)
- City requires [0,3,0,2,0] (need 3 ore, 2 wheat - have 2 ore, 0 wheat)
- Road requires [1,0,0,0,1] (brick and wood - have 0 brick, 1 wood)
- Development card requires [0,1,1,1,0] (have resources for sheep and ore but no wheat)

Since I'm unable to take any constructive action with my current resources, ending my turn is the only reasonable option. This will allow me to collect new resources on the next roll and potentially have better building options on my next turn. The heuristic score of 1 for END_TURN confirms this is the only viable choice.
