Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 0, 2, 1, 0]
        - Settlements: [0, 21, 46]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 3
        - Roads Available: 6

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
I'll analyze this situation for the Catanatron minigame.

Action: END_TURN
Justification: With my current resources [0, 0, 2, 1, 0] (representing [Brick, Ore, Sheep, Wheat, Wood]), I don't have the necessary combinations to build any new settlements (requiring Brick, Sheep, Wheat, Wood), roads (requiring Brick and Wood), or cities (requiring 3 Ore and 2 Wheat). I only have 2 Sheep and 1 Wheat, which isn't sufficient for any construction action. Therefore, ending my turn is the only viable option at this moment. This will allow me to collect new resources on the next roll and potentially have enough materials for construction on my next turn. The heuristic score confirms this is the only logical choice with a score of 1.
