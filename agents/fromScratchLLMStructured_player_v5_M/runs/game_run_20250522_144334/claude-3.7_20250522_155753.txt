Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [1, 0, 3, 0, 0]
        - Settlements: [5, 3]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 2
        - Roads Available: 10

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD: 'PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD'>, value=None)
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD: 'PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD'>, value=None): 1
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
I need to analyze the available actions in the context of my current resources and game state.

Looking at my resources [1, 0, 3, 0, 0], I have 1 brick and 3 grain, but no wool, ore, or lumber. With this limited resource set, I can't build a settlement (requires brick, lumber, wool, grain), road (requires brick and lumber), or upgrade to a city (requires grain and ore).

Available actions are:
1. Play Knight Card
2. End Turn

Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD: 'PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD'>, value=None)

Justification: Since both actions have equal heuristic scores of 1, playing the Knight Card is the more strategic choice. Playing a Knight Card allows me to move the robber to a new hex, potentially disrupting my opponent's resource production, and it may let me steal a resource card from them. Additionally, Knight Cards contribute to building the "Largest Army" for 2 VP later in the game. With my current limited resources, I can't build anything this turn, so taking a defensive/offensive action that interferes with my opponent while positioning myself for the "Largest Army" bonus is more valuable than simply ending my turn.
