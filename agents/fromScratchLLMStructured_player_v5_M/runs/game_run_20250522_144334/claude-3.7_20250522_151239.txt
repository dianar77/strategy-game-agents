Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [3, 0, 2, 2, 0]
        - Settlements: [0, 21, 46]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 3
        - Roads Available: 7

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

Justification: This is the only available action at the moment, so I must roll the dice to continue the game. Rolling will determine what resources I collect next, which is essential for planning my next moves. With my current resources [3, 0, 2, 2, 0] (likely representing [Brick, Wool, Ore, Grain, Lumber]), I have some brick, ore, and grain, but I'm lacking wool and lumber. After rolling, I'll be able to evaluate whether to build roads (using brick and lumber) or work toward another settlement (which requires brick, wool, grain, and lumber). The roll outcome will directly influence my strategy for using my existing resources most effectively.
