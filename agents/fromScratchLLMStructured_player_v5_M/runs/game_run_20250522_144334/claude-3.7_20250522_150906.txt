Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [2, 2, 2, 1, 0]
        - Settlements: [0, 21]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 2
        - Roads Available: 11

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(1, 2))
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(0, 20))
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(19, 46))

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:

========================================

Response:
I need to analyze which road building option gives me the best strategic advantage for future settlements and resource acquisition.

Looking at the current state:
- I have resources [2, 2, 2, 1, 0] which allows me to build roads (costs 1 brick, 1 wood)
- I have 2 settlements at locations 0 and 21
- I need to expand my network efficiently to reach potential new settlement locations

Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(0, 5))

Justification: Building a road from node 0 (where I already have a settlement) to node 5 creates a strategic expansion path. This road extends from one of my existing settlements, which is the most efficient way to grow my network. By expanding from my current settlement, I'm creating opportunities to reach new productive intersections where I can build future settlements. This follows the priority of early expansion for resource diversity, as extending from my existing settlement position will allow me to reach new hexes with different resource types in fewer moves. Having roads connecting to both of my settlements creates two separate expansion fronts rather than just extending from one settlement location.
