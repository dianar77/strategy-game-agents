Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [2, 3, 3, 0, 3]
        - Settlements: [3, 5, 21]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 5
        - Roads Available: 0

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
I'll analyze the current game state and select the most strategic action.

Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Justification: In this case, ending my turn is the only available action. My current resources are [2, 3, 3, 0, 3], which means I have 2 brick, 3 wood, 3 ore, 0 wool, and 3 grain. I have no roads available, which limits my expansion options. I can't build new settlements without roads leading to valid building locations, and I can't upgrade my settlements to cities because each city upgrade requires 3 ore and 2 grain (I have only 3 ore). I also can't purchase development cards due to the lack of wool. Therefore, ending my turn is the optimal choice to collect more resources on my next turn, particularly wool which I currently lack completely. On my next turn, with hopefully a more diverse resource collection, I'll be in a better position to execute my strategic priorities.
