Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 4, 3, 0, 0]
        - Settlements: [22]
        - Cities: [6]
        - Victory Points (VP): 4
        - Roads Available: 13

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

Justification: Rolling the dice is the only available action at this moment, and it's necessary to continue the game. This will determine what new resources I'll receive, which will inform my next strategic decisions. With my current resources (4 brick, 3 wheat, no ore/wool/lumber), I need to diversify my resource collection to enable more building options. Rolling is the fundamental action that drives resource acquisition in Catan, and there are no alternatives to consider right now. After rolling, I'll be in a better position to decide whether to build roads, settlements, or save resources for future city upgrades based on what I receive.
