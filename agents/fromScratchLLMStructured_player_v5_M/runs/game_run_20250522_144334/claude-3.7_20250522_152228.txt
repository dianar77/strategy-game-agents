Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
        - Settlements: [3, 5, 21]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 5
        - Roads Available: 5

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
I'll analyze the current game state and determine the best action.

Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Justification: In this situation, ending my turn is the only available action. I currently have 1 brick resource but no other resources, which isn't enough to build any new roads (costs 1 brick + 1 wood) or settlements (costs 1 brick + 1 wood + 1 wheat + 1 sheep). Since I can't execute any building actions with my current resources, ending my turn is the strategic choice to potentially collect more diverse resources on the next roll. I have 3 settlements already placed at positions 3, 5, and 21, which should help me collect resources on future turns. My priority will be to use those incoming resources for strategic expansion once I have the right combination.
