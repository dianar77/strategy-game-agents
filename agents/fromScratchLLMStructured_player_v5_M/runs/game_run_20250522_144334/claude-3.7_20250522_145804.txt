Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [2, 1, 0, 1, 3]
        - Settlements: [7, 16]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 5
        - Roads Available: 6

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

========================================

Response:
I need to analyze which road building option would be most strategically advantageous for expanding my settlement network.

Looking at my resources [2, 1, 0, 1, 3], I have sufficient resources (brick and wood) to build a road. My current settlements are at positions 7 and 16, and I want to expand efficiently toward potential new settlement locations.

Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(17, 18))

Justification: I'm choosing to build a road at (17, 18) because it appears to be extending from near my existing settlement at position 16. This road builds toward position 18, which likely connects to position 40 (as indicated by another available road action). This creates a path for potential future settlement placement, following my priority to expand for resource diversity. Building in this direction seems most efficient for creating new settlement opportunities while maintaining a connected network from my existing settlements. This aligns with the early game strategy of expanding my reach to access more diverse resource tiles.
