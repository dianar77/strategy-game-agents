Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [1, 0, 0, 1, 1]
        - Settlements: [3, 5, 21, 20]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 6
        - Roads Available: 0

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Justification: In the current game state, ending my turn is the only available action. With limited resources [1 brick, 0 wool, 0 grain, 1 lumber, 1 ore] and no roads available (0), I cannot build any new settlements, cities, or development cards. Although I have 6 victory points already from my 4 settlements (3, 5, 21, 20), I need to collect more resources on my next turn to continue expanding. Ending my turn now will allow me to gather new resources from the upcoming dice roll and enable more strategic options in my next turn. With no other actions available, this is the optimal choice to maintain game momentum.
