Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 2, 0, 1, 2]
        - Settlements: [7, 16]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 3
        - Roads Available: 8

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD: 'PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD'>, value=None)
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD: 'PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD'>, value=None): 1
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}

# Catanatron Analysis

## Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

## Justification:
In the current game state, I have the choice between playing a Knight card or rolling the dice. Both actions have the same heuristic score (1), but rolling is the better strategic choice for several reasons:

1. **Resource Acquisition Priority**: With only [0, 2, 0, 1, 2] resources, I need to collect more resources to build new settlements or upgrade existing ones. Rolling gives me a chance to collect resources based on my settlement positions.

2. **Knight Card Conservation**: Knight cards are more valuable to save for strategic moments:
   - When facing resource theft from the robber
   - When competing for Largest Army (worth 2 VP)
   - When needing to block an opponent's high-producing hex

3. **Development Stage**: With 2 settlements and 8 roads available, I'm still in the expansion phase. Rolling to gain resources supports my first priority of building more settlements and roads.

Playing the Knight now would be premature since I don't have an immediate need to move the robber, and maintaining my development cards for later strategic use offers more flexibility.
