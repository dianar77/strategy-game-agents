Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [2, 0, 0, 0, 3]
        - Settlements: [7, 16]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 6
        - Roads Available: 5

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

Justification: In this situation, I need to roll the dice as it's the only available action. Rolling will generate new resources based on the board layout and the resulting dice number. With my current resource inventory [2, 0, 0, 0, 3] (likely representing brick, wool, ore, grain, and lumber), I have some brick and lumber but lack other resources needed for building. I already have 2 settlements and 6 VP, which is a strong position. After rolling, I'll have more options based on what resources I gain, potentially allowing me to build roads to expand to new locations, upgrade settlements to cities (requiring ore and grain which I currently lack), or trade resources with other players or the bank. Rolling is the necessary first step to progress my strategy.
