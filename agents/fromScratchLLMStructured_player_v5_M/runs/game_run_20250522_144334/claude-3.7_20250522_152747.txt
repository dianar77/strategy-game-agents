Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [5, 3, 4, 0, 0]
        - Settlements: [3, 5, 21, 20]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 6
        - Roads Available: 0

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}

========================================

Response:
I'll analyze the current game state and available actions to determine the most strategic move.

Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('WOOD', 'WOOD', 'WOOD', 'WOOD', 'ORE'))

Justification: Looking at our current resources [5, 3, 4, 0, 0] which corresponds to [BRICK, WOOD, SHEEP, WHEAT, ORE], we have no WHEAT or ORE, which are critical resources for city upgrades (2 WHEAT + 3 ORE). Since we already have 4 settlements built (the maximum allowed), our priority should shift toward upgrading settlements to cities to gain more VPs efficiently.

Trading 4 WOOD for 1 ORE is the most strategic choice because:
1. We have an excess of WOOD (3 units) that we can afford to trade
2. ORE is necessary for city upgrades, which give us 2 VPs per city (compared to just 1 VP per settlement)
3. Getting ORE now puts us closer to the city upgrade path, which is our most efficient VP-gaining strategy at this stage
4. While we still need WHEAT too, gathering one resource at a time through maritime trade is a necessary progression toward our goal

This trade begins our path toward city upgrades, which aligns with our second priority of "Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns."
