Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [1, 2, 2, 0, 2]
        - Settlements: [3, 5, 21]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 5
        - Roads Available: 0

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
Action: END_TURN
Justification: I have no choice but to end my turn since it's the only available action. With my current resources [1 Wood, 2 Brick, 2 Wheat, 0 Sheep, 2 Ore] and no roads available, I can't build any new settlements, cities, or development cards. I currently have 3 settlements (at positions 3, 5, and 21) giving me 5 VP total. Since I have no other options, I'll end my turn and hope to collect more favorable resources on the next roll to pursue upgrading settlements to cities (I have 2 Wheat and 2 Ore already, so I'm close to being able to build a city which requires 2 Wheat and 3 Ore) or acquiring development cards.
