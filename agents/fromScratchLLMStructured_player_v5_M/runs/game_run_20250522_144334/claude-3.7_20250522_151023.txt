Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 2, 3, 0, 0]
        - Settlements: [0, 21]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 2
        - Roads Available: 9

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
I'll analyze the current game state and make the optimal decision for the Catanatron Minigame.

Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Justification: Since there is only one available action (END_TURN), I must choose this option. Looking at my current resources [0, 2, 3, 0, 0], I have 2 Ore and 3 Grain but no Wood, Brick, or Sheep. This resource combination doesn't allow me to build any settlements (need Wood, Brick, Sheep, Grain), roads (need Wood, Brick), or cities (need 3 Ore, 2 Grain). Since I can't make any productive moves with my current resources, ending my turn is the only logical choice. On my next turn, I'll hopefully collect more diverse resources that will enable me to build settlements or roads according to priority #1, or potentially work toward upgrading to cities as per priority #2 since I already have some Ore and Grain.
