Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]
        - Settlements: [6, 22]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 2
        - Roads Available: 13

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}

# Catanatron Minigame Analysis

## Action: END_TURN

## Justification:
Looking at the current game state, I have only brick resources (2) and no other resources. Since I don't have enough or the right combination of resources to build any new settlements, cities, or roads, ending my turn is the only logical choice.

With my current holdings of just 2 brick resources, I can't:
- Build a road (requires brick + lumber)
- Build a settlement (requires brick + lumber + wool + grain)
- Build a city (requires 2 grain + 3 ore)

By ending my turn now, I'll get a chance to collect new resources on the next round based on my settlement positions (at locations 6 and 22), which should help diversify my resource pool. This aligns with the first priority of expanding for resource diversity, as I need to collect more varied resources before I can take more impactful actions.
