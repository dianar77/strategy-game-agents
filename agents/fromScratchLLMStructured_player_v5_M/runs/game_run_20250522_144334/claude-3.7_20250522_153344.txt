Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 2, 0, 0, 1]
        - Settlements: [6, 22]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 2
        - Roads Available: 13

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD: 'PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD'>, value=None)
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD: 'PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD'>, value=None): 1
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
I need to analyze the current game state and available actions to make an optimal decision.

Looking at my resources ([0, 2, 0, 0, 1]), I have:
- 0 Wood
- 2 Brick
- 0 Sheep
- 0 Wheat
- 1 Ore

With these limited resources, I can't build any settlements (need wood, brick, sheep, wheat), cities (need 3 ore, 2 wheat), or roads (need wood and brick).

My options are:
1. Play a Knight Card
2. End my turn

The heuristic scores for both actions are equal (1), suggesting neither offers a strong strategic advantage in this moment.

Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD: 'PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD'>, value=None)

Justification: Playing a Knight Card is the better choice because it provides multiple advantages. First, it allows me to move the robber to potentially disrupt my opponent's resource production while possibly stealing a resource card from them. Second, it contributes to building my army for the "Largest Army" bonus (worth 2 VP). Given my limited resources and inability to build anything this turn, using the Knight Card now is more strategically valuable than simply ending my turn without taking any action. This aligns with priority #3 of blocking opponent progress when strategically advantageous.
