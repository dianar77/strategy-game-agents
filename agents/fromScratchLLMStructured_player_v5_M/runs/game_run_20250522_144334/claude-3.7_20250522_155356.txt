Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 4, 0, 0, 0]
        - Settlements: [5, 3]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 2
        - Roads Available: 10

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('BRICK', 'BRICK', 'BRICK', 'BRICK', 'WOOD'))
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('BRICK', 'BRICK', 'BRICK', 'BRICK', 'WHEAT'))

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('BRICK', 'BRICK', 'BRICK', 'BRICK', 'WOOD')): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

# Action Analysis for Catanatron Minigame

Looking at the current game state:
- I have 4 brick resources
- I have no wood, wheat, sheep, or ore
- I have 5 settlements remaining to build and 3 settlements already placed
- I have 10 roads available to build

## Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('BRICK', 'BRICK', 'BRICK', 'BRICK', 'WOOD'))

## Justification:
Trading 4 brick for wood is the optimal choice because:

1. Early game expansion is critical - I need to build roads to access new settlement locations, and roads require wood + brick.

2. With 4 brick but no wood, I'm currently unable to build any roads. Trading for wood will enable road building if I gain additional brick in future turns.

3. While trading at 4:1 is inefficient, having a balanced resource portfolio is strategically important for flexibility.

4. The other trades (for wheat, sheep, or ore) are less valuable at this stage since:
   - Wheat and sheep would only give me 1 of the 2 resources needed for a settlement
   - Ore is primarily used for city upgrades, which is a later-game priority
   - Wood has immediate utility for road building in the early expansion phase

This trade positions me better for when I receive more brick in future turns, allowing me to execute the primary strategy of expanding through roads and settlements.
