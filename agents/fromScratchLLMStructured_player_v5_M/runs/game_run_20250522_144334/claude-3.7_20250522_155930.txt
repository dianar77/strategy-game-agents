Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [2, 0, 3, 2, 0]
        - Settlements: [5, 3]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 2
        - Roads Available: 10

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}

Response:
# Catanatron Minigame Decision

Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Justification: In this situation, I have no choice but to end my turn since it's the only available action. Looking at my current resources [2, 0, 3, 2, 0] (which appears to be [Brick, Wool, Lumber, Grain, Ore]), I don't have enough resources to build anything useful at this moment. I have 2 brick, 0 wool, 3 lumber, 2 grain, and 0 ore. Building a road requires brick and lumber, a settlement requires brick, wool, lumber, and grain, and upgrading to a city requires 2 grain and 3 ore. I'm particularly missing wool and ore, which prevents me from building settlements or cities. The best strategy is to end my turn and hope to get more diverse resources in the next round to enable expansion.
