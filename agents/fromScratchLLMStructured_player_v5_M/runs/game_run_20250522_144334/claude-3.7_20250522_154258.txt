Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 2, 0, 0, 3]
        - Settlements: [22]
        - Cities: [6]
        - Victory Points (VP): 5
        - Roads Available: 9

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}

Response:
# Catanatron Move Analysis

Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Justification: I must end my turn because it's the only available action. With my current resources [0, 2, 0, 0, 3] (representing [Brick, Wood, Sheep, Wheat, Ore]), I don't have the correct resource combinations to build anything. I have plenty of Wood (2) and Ore (3), but I'm missing essential Brick, Sheep, and Wheat needed for roads, settlements, or further city upgrades. Ending my turn will allow me to potentially collect different resources on the next roll, hopefully obtaining the missing resources needed to continue expanding my position. My current state (5 VP from one city and two settlements) shows I'm making good progress, but I need a more diverse resource collection to take further actions.
