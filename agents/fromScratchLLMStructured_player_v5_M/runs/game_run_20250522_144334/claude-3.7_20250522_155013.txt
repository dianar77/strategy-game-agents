Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 3, 3, 0, 0]
        - Settlements: [5, 3]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 2
        - Roads Available: 10

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
I notice that I don't have any other actions available besides ending my turn. This suggests that either:

1. I don't have sufficient resources to build anything (which seems to be the case since I only have 3 brick and 3 wood, but no sheep, wheat, or ore), or
2. There are no valid placements available for settlements or roads based on the current board state.

Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Justification: Since ending my turn is the only available action, I must take it. However, I should focus on my resource strategy for future turns. I currently have brick and wood, which would allow me to build roads on my next turn if I acquire just one more of either resource. My priority should be to position for settlement building, which requires collecting sheep and wheat in addition to my current resources. Ending my turn now is necessary to move the game forward and potentially collect more diverse resources on the next roll.
