Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 0, 3, 0, 0]
        - Settlements: [5, 3]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 2
        - Roads Available: 10

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
I'll analyze the game state and choose the best action based on the strategic priorities.

Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Justification: Given the current game state, I only have one available action which is to end my turn. Looking at my resources [0, 0, 3, 0, 0], I have 3 wood but no brick, which means I can't build roads (need wood+brick), and I certainly don't have enough resources for settlements (need wood+brick+sheep+wheat) or cities (need ore+wheat). With no other options available, ending my turn is the only reasonable choice. This will allow me to collect new resources on the next roll and potentially make more strategic plays in the following turn. While I wouldn't normally end my turn without taking actions, in this case it's necessary to progress the game and set up for future development.
