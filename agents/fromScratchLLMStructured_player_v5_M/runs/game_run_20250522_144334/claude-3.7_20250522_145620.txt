Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 2, 1, 1, 4]
        - Settlements: [7, 16]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 5
        - Roads Available: 8

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
# Analysis of Available Actions

Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)
Justification: Rolling the dice is the only available action at this moment and is necessary to continue the game. This is the standard way to begin a turn in Catan, allowing me to potentially collect resources based on the roll outcome. With my current resources [0, 2, 1, 1, 4], I have a decent amount of wood but need other resources, particularly brick and ore, to execute optimal building strategies. Rolling will hopefully generate the resources I need to either build a new road (requires brick and wood), a new settlement (requires brick, wood, sheep, and wheat), or upgrade to a city (requires ore and wheat). Since resource acquisition is fundamental to executing my strategic priorities, this roll action is essential to my progression in the game.
