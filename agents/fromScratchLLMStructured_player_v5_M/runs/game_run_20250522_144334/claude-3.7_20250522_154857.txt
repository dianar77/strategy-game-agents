Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 2, 4, 0, 0]
        - Settlements: [5, 3]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 2
        - Roads Available: 12

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('SHEEP', 'SHEEP', 'SHEEP', 'SHEEP', 'WOOD'))
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('SHEEP', 'SHEEP', 'SHEEP', 'SHEEP', 'WHEAT'))

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('SHEEP', 'SHEEP', 'SHEEP', 'SHEEP', 'WOOD')): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

# Action Analysis

Looking at the current game state:
- Resources: [Brick: 0, Ore: 2, Sheep: 4, Wheat: 0, Wood: 0]
- We have a good amount of sheep (4) and some ore (2)
- We don't have brick, wheat or wood

## Decision

Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('SHEEP', 'SHEEP', 'SHEEP', 'SHEEP', 'BRICK'))

Justification: I'm trading four sheep for a brick because brick is essential for building roads, which aligns with our first priority of expanding early. Currently, we have no brick, which means we can't build any roads to expand our resource collection network. By trading for brick, we're positioning ourselves to build a road on a future turn when we acquire wood (the other resource needed for roads). Expansion through roads leads to new settlement opportunities, which increases our resource diversity and victory points. The other maritime trades or ending the turn would be less strategically valuable as they don't address our immediate expansion needs as effectively.
