Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 3, 2, 0, 0]
        - Settlements: [5, 3]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 2
        - Roads Available: 12

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}

# Action Analysis for Catanatron Minigame

Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Justification: I have no choice but to end my turn since it's the only available action. With my current resources [0, 3, 2, 0, 0] (representing [Brick, Lumber, Wool, Ore, Grain]), I have lumber and wool but lack the brick and grain needed for settlements or the ore needed for city upgrades. I'm missing key resources to take any productive building action this turn. The best strategy is to end the turn now and hope for better resource rolls next turn that will complement my existing lumber and wool. On my next turn, if I receive brick and grain, I'll be able to build settlements; or if I receive ore, I can work toward city upgrades by combining it with my wool.
