Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [2, 0, 1, 1, 1]
        - Settlements: [3, 5, 21]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 5
        - Roads Available: 7

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUY_DEVELOPMENT_CARD: 'BUY_DEVELOPMENT_CARD'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUY_DEVELOPMENT_CARD: 'BUY_DEVELOPMENT_CARD'>, value=None): 7

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
I'll analyze the given game state and available actions to make the optimal decision.

Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUY_DEVELOPMENT_CARD: 'BUY_DEVELOPMENT_CARD'>, value=None)

Justification: Buying a development card is clearly the better option here with a heuristic score of 7 compared to just ending the turn (score of 1). Looking at my resources [2, 0, 1, 1, 1], I have exactly what's needed to purchase a development card (1 ore, 1 wheat, 1 sheep). Development cards provide multiple strategic benefits:
1) Potential immediate Victory Points
2) Knight cards that can be used to move the robber and potentially earn Largest Army (2 VP)
3) Progress cards that provide valuable resources or building advantages

Since I currently have 5 VP and already have a solid foundation with 3 settlements, adding development cards to my strategy makes sense. I can't build new settlements or cities with my current resources, so buying a development card is the most impactful action available, potentially bringing me closer to victory through hidden VP cards or Knights that could later become the Largest Army bonus.
