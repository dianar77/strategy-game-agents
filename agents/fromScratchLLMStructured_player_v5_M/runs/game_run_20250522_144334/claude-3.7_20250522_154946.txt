Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 3, 2, 0, 0]
        - Settlements: [5, 3]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 2
        - Roads Available: 12

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(12, 13))
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(2, 3))
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(4, 15))
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(4, 5))
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(11, 12))
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(0, 5))

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(12, 13)): 10
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(2, 3)): 10
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(4, 15)): 10
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(4, 5)): 10
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(11, 12)): 10
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(0, 5)): 10

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
I need to analyze the available actions carefully to determine the best move for maximizing victory points.

Looking at my current resources [0, 3, 2, 0, 0], which means I have:
- 0 Brick
- 3 Wood
- 2 Sheep
- 0 Wheat
- 0 Ore

Since the only actions available are all building roads, and all have the same heuristic score of 10, I need to consider which road placement will best position me for future expansion.

Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(2, 3))

Justification: I'm selecting this road placement because it appears to extend from one of my existing settlements (based on node numbering patterns). Building roads early is essential for expansion, and this road likely creates a path toward potentially valuable resource hexes or intersection points. With my current resources (3 Wood and 2 Sheep), I can build a road (requiring 1 Brick and 1 Wood) and still have resources left for future moves. This extension increases my network reach and sets me up for building additional settlements in the next few turns, which is critical for resource diversity and victory point accumulation.
