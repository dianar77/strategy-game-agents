Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 2, 1, 0, 0]
        - Settlements: [6, 22]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 2
        - Roads Available: 13

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD: 'PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD'>, value=None)
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD: 'PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD'>, value=None): 1
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
I'll analyze this game situation carefully to determine the most strategic action.

Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

Justification: In this situation, rolling the dice is the optimal choice. While both options have the same heuristic score of 1, playing a Knight card now would be premature. With current resources of [0, 2, 1, 0, 0] (presumably [Brick, Wood, Sheep, Wheat, Ore]), we have limited options for building after using the Knight. Rolling has several advantages: it could potentially bring in more resources to enable meaningful building actions afterward, preserves the Knight card for when we actually need to move the robber (either defensively or to block an opponent), and allows us to progress the game naturally. Since we have two settlements already placed, rolling gives us the opportunity to collect from potentially diverse resource spots and strengthen our position before using special cards.
