Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
        - Settlements: [5, 3]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 2
        - Roads Available: 10

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
I'll analyze the current game state and determine the optimal action.

Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

Justification: At this stage of the game, we have 2 Victory Points from our existing settlements, but currently have zero resources of any type. Rolling the dice is the only available action and is necessary to collect resources which will enable future building actions. This roll will potentially generate resources based on the numbers adjacent to our settlements, allowing us to implement our strategy of early expansion. Without resources, we cannot build roads or additional settlements, so rolling is both necessary and the optimal choice to advance our position. Once we have resources from this roll, we can make more strategic decisions about expansion paths and resource utilization.
