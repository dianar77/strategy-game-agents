Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [2, 0, 2, 0, 2]
        - Settlements: [7, 16]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 6
        - Roads Available: 2

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}

Response:
# Analysis of Current Game State and Options

Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

Justification: 
The only available action is to roll the dice, which is the correct move at this point in the game. Rolling is necessary to potentially gather more resources, which will enable future building actions. With current resources [2 brick, 0 wool, 2 lumber, 0 ore, 2 wheat], we have a decent amount of brick, lumber, and wheat, but we need more resources - particularly wool and ore - to progress. Rolling provides the opportunity to collect these missing resources based on the settlements we've already placed at positions 7 and 16. Since we already have 6 VP and 2 roads available, a good roll could position us for immediate expansion or city upgrades, depending on what resources we receive.
