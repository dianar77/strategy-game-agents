Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [1, 0, 2, 0, 0]
        - Settlements: [7, 16]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 3
        - Roads Available: 11

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD: 'PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD'>, value=None)
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD: 'PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD'>, value=None): 1
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}

# Game Analysis: Catanatron Minigame Decision

After reviewing the current game state and available options, I'll make a strategic decision:

Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

Justification: I'm choosing to roll the dice rather than play the knight card because:

1. Our resource position (1 brick, 0 wool, 2 lumber, 0 ore, 0 grain) is currently limited, and rolling gives us the opportunity to collect more resources that we urgently need for expansion.

2. With only two settlements and no cities, our income potential is restricted - rolling may help us gain crucial resources to build roads and potentially new settlements.

3. The knight card could be more valuable later when:
   - We need to break a robber placement blocking one of our key resource tiles
   - We're competing for the "Largest Army" card (2 VP)
   - We need to strategically disrupt an opponent

4. Since both actions received the same heuristic score (1), the roll action provides more potential upside with limited downside in our current early-game position.
