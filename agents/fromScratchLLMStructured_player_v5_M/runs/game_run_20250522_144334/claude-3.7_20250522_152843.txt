Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [1, 0, 0, 0, 1]
        - Settlements: [3, 5, 21, 20]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 6
        - Roads Available: 0

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
I'll analyze the current game state and select the optimal action.

Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Justification: In the current game state, I only have one available action - to end my turn. Looking at my resources, I only have 1 brick and 1 wood, which is insufficient for any construction (settlement requires 1 brick, 1 wood, 1 wheat, 1 sheep; road requires 1 brick, 1 wood; city requires 2 wheat, 3 ore). Additionally, I have 0 roads available, so I couldn't build a road even if I had the resources. With 4 settlements already placed and 6 victory points, I'm in a decent position, but need to accumulate more resources on subsequent turns to upgrade settlements to cities or build development cards. The only logical choice is to end my turn and gather more resources on the next round.
