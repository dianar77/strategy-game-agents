Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 3, 6, 0, 0]
        - Settlements: [5, 3]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 2
        - Roads Available: 10

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}

# Action Analysis

Looking at the current game state:
- Resources: [0, 3, 6, 0, 0] = [Brick: 0, Wood: 3, Sheep: 6, Wheat: 0, Ore: 0]
- Only one possible action: ROLL

## Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

## Justification: 
I need to roll the dice as it's the only available action and the beginning of my turn. Rolling will potentially provide additional resources based on the numbers associated with my settlement locations. With my current resources (3 wood, 6 sheep), I'm in a strong position for potential development, but I lack brick for roads, wheat for settlements/development cards, and ore for cities. A good roll could give me these missing resources and open up more strategic options. Since I have two settlements already placed, the probability of gaining resources on this roll is reasonably good.
