Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 2, 3, 0, 1]
        - Settlements: [22]
        - Cities: [6]
        - Victory Points (VP): 5
        - Roads Available: 11

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
I'll analyze the current game state and available actions to make an optimal decision.

Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Justification: I have no choice but to end my turn since it's the only available action. Looking at my current resources [0, 2, 3, 0, 1] (which correspond to [Brick, Ore, Sheep, Wheat, Wood]), I don't have the right combination to build any structures. I need brick and wheat to build settlements or roads, and I'm missing both brick and wheat for city upgrades. Since I already have 5 VP (from 1 city worth 2 VP and 3 settlements worth 1 VP each), I'm in a decent position, but I need to collect resources on my next turn to continue expanding. Ending my turn now is the only viable option to potentially gather more favorable resources in the next round.
