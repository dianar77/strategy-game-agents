Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]
        - Settlements: [5, 3]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 2
        - Roads Available: 10

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}

# Analysis of Catanatron Game State

I notice that I have only 1 brick resource and no other resources available. Looking at my available actions, I only have one option.

Action: END_TURN

Justification: With only 1 brick resource and no other resources, I cannot build any settlements (which require brick, lumber, wool, and grain) or roads (which require brick and lumber). Since I lack the necessary resource combinations for any construction, the only logical move is to end my turn and collect more resources on the next round. This is not an "unnecessary" end turn - it's the only possible action given my current resource constraints. On my next turn, I'll hopefully have more resources to pursue the priority of building settlements and roads for expansion.
