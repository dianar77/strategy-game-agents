Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 2, 1, 1, 1]
        - Settlements: [6, 22]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 2
        - Roads Available: 13

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUY_DEVELOPMENT_CARD: 'BUY_DEVELOPMENT_CARD'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUY_DEVELOPMENT_CARD: 'BUY_DEVELOPMENT_CARD'>, value=None): 7

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
I'll analyze the current game state and available actions to determine the best strategic move.

Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUY_DEVELOPMENT_CARD: 'BUY_DEVELOPMENT_CARD'>, value=None)

Justification: Buying a development card is clearly the optimal choice here for several reasons:
1. The heuristic score strongly favors this action (7 vs 1 for ending turn)
2. We have exactly the right resources for a development card (1 ore, 1 sheep, 1 wheat)
3. Development cards provide multiple strategic advantages:
   - Potential immediate VP cards to advance our score
   - Knight cards can disrupt opponents and contribute to Largest Army (2 VP)
   - Monopoly/Year of Plenty/Road Building cards provide powerful resource advantages
4. Our current board position is established with 2 settlements, so investing in development cards can diversify our strategy
5. Ending our turn without using our resources would waste an opportunity to improve our position

The only other option is to end our turn without using our resources, which provides no strategic benefit. By purchasing a development card now, we maintain momentum and create options for future turns.
