Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 1, 1, 0, 0]
        - Settlements: [22]
        - Cities: [6]
        - Victory Points (VP): 5
        - Roads Available: 9

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

Justification: I need to roll the dice to generate resources for future moves. Currently, I have limited resources (only 1 Wheat and 1 Brick) which isn't enough to build any significant structures. Rolling will potentially give me additional resources based on the positions of my settlements and city. With one city (providing double resources) and one settlement already placed, a good roll could significantly improve my resource position. Since this is the only available action and a necessary step to continue gameplay, rolling is the optimal choice to progress toward building more settlements, roads, or upgrading to cities.
