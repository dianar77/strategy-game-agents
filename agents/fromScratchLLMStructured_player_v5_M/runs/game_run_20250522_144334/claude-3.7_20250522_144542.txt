Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 1, 0, 0, 2]
        - Settlements: [7, 16]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 2
        - Roads Available: 13

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
I'll evaluate the current game state and available actions to make the most strategic decision.

Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Justification: With my current resources [0, 1, 0, 0, 2] (which represents [Brick, Wool, Ore, Grain, Lumber]), I don't have enough materials to build any new settlements, roads, or cities. I can't build a road (requires Brick+Lumber), a settlement (requires Brick+Wool+Grain+Lumber), or upgrade to a city (requires 3 Ore+2 Grain). Since I have no other available actions besides ending my turn, the optimal choice is to end my turn and collect more resources on the next round. This will allow me to potentially make more impactful moves in the subsequent turn when I have a better resource combination.
