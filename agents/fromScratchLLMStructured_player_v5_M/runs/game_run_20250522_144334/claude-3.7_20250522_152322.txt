Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]
        - Settlements: [3, 5, 21]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 5
        - Roads Available: 2

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Justification: In this situation, there is only one available action, which is to end my turn. With limited resources (only 1 wheat/grain and no other resources), I cannot build any settlements, cities, roads, or purchase development cards. My current position includes 3 settlements (at positions 3, 5, and 21) which have already given me 3 VP, plus 2 additional VP from other sources (likely development cards), for a total of 5 VP. While ending the turn isn't strategically optimal, it's the only option available. Ending my turn will allow me to collect more resources on the next roll, enabling more impactful actions in the next round. With only 2 roads remaining available to build, I should focus on gathering resources to upgrade my existing settlements to cities (which give 2 VP each) once I have the opportunity.
