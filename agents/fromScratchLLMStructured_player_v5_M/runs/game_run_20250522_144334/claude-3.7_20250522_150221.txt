Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [2, 0, 0, 0, 1]
        - Settlements: [7, 16]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 6
        - Roads Available: 5

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.PLAY_ROAD_BUILDING: 'PLAY_ROAD_BUILDING'>, value=None)
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.PLAY_ROAD_BUILDING: 'PLAY_ROAD_BUILDING'>, value=None): 1
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.PLAY_ROAD_BUILDING: 'PLAY_ROAD_BUILDING'>, value=None)

Justification: I'm choosing to play the Road Building development card because it allows me to place two roads for free, which is extremely valuable for expansion. Given that we have 5 roads available and two existing settlements (at nodes 7 and 16), placing more roads will extend our network and create opportunities to build new settlements at strategic locations. Since one of our primary goals is to "build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity," using this card now helps us expand our territory without spending additional resources. This is especially important since our current resources [2, 0, 0, 0, 1] are limited and wouldn't allow us to build roads otherwise (which require brick and lumber). The free roads from this card will position us for future settlement placements and potentially block opponent expansion paths.
