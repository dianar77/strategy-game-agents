Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 1, 1, 0, 1]
        - Settlements: [6, 22]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 2
        - Roads Available: 13

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
I'll analyze this situation carefully.

Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Justification: In this case, ending my turn is the only available action. With my current resources [0, 1, 1, 0, 1] (representing [Brick, Wood, Sheep, Wheat, Ore]), I don't have sufficient materials to build any new structures. I need at least [1, 1, 1, 1, 0] for a settlement or [0, 0, 0, 2, 3] for a city. I also can't build a road which requires [1, 1, 0, 0, 0]. Since I can't make any constructive moves with my current resources, ending the turn is the correct strategic choice to collect new resources in the next round. This will hopefully put me in position to expand in my next turn.
