Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [2, 0, 3, 3, 0]
        - Settlements: [5, 3]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 2
        - Roads Available: 10

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
I'll analyze the current game state and the available actions to determine the optimal move.

Action: END_TURN
Justification: With current resources [2, 0, 3, 3, 0] (representing [Brick, Lumber, Wool, Grain, Ore]), I don't have the proper combination to build any additional settlements, cities, or roads. I'm missing lumber completely, which is essential for roads and settlements. While I have brick, wool, and grain, I can't use them effectively without the missing resources. The only available action is to end the turn, which will allow me to collect more resources on the next turn. This is strategically necessary to continue expanding later when I have the right resource combinations. Ending the turn now is not a low-impact action but rather the only viable option to progress in the game.
