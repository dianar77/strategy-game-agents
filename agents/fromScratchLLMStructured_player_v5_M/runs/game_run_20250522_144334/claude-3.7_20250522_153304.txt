Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]
        - Settlements: [6, 22]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 2
        - Roads Available: 13

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.PLAY_MONOPOLY: 'PLAY_MONOPOLY'>, value='WOOD')
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.PLAY_MONOPOLY: 'PLAY_MONOPOLY'>, value='BRICK')
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.PLAY_MONOPOLY: 'PLAY_MONOPOLY'>, value='SHEEP')
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.PLAY_MONOPOLY: 'PLAY_MONOPOLY'>, value='WHEAT')
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.PLAY_MONOPOLY: 'PLAY_MONOPOLY'>, value='ORE')
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD: 'PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD'>, value=None)
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.PLAY_MONOPOLY: 'PLAY_MONOPOLY'>, value='WOOD'): 1
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.PLAY_MONOPOLY: 'PLAY_MONOPOLY'>, value='BRICK'): 1
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.PLAY_MONOPOLY: 'PLAY_MONOPOLY'>, value='SHEEP'): 1
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.PLAY_MONOPOLY: 'PLAY_MONOPOLY'>, value='WHEAT'): 1
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.PLAY_MONOPOLY: 'PLAY_MONOPOLY'>, value='ORE'): 1
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD: 'PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD'>, value=None): 1
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
I'll analyze the available actions to determine the best strategic move.

Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.PLAY_MONOPOLY: 'PLAY_MONOPOLY'>, value='BRICK')

Justification: The Monopoly card is a powerful development card that allows me to collect all of a specific resource type from all other players. Looking at my current resources [0, 2, 0, 0, 0], I have 2 BRICK but lack WOOD, which are the essential resources for building roads and settlements. Since early game priority is expanding with settlements and roads, I should target BRICK with the Monopoly card because:

1. I already have some BRICK, so getting more would allow me to potentially build multiple roads or a settlement (if I also get WOOD from a future roll)
2. BRICK is typically one of the most constrained resources in Catan and critical for early expansion
3. By monopolizing BRICK, I'm not only gaining resources for myself but also hindering opponents' ability to expand, effectively blocking their progress
4. Since the heuristic scores are all equal, choosing BRICK aligns best with the early-game priority of building settlements and roads

This move sets me up for future expansion while potentially disrupting my opponents' development strategies.
