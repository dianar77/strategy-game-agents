Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [2, 0, 0, 0, 1]
        - Settlements: [7, 16]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 6
        - Roads Available: 4

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(52, 53))
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(17, 39))
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(19, 21))

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):

Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(17, 39)): 10

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
I need to choose a road building action that will best position me for future expansion and resource diversification.

Looking at my current state:
- I have resources [2, 0, 0, 0, 1], which means I have 2 brick, 0 lumber, 0 wool, 0 grain, and 1 ore
- I have settlements at nodes 7 and 16
- I need to build roads that extend from my current positions to reach potential new settlement locations

Since all actions have the same heuristic score (10), I need to analyze which road will best connect my existing settlements to valuable future building spots.

Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(15, 17))

Justification: I'm choosing to build a road between nodes 15 and 17 because this appears to extend from or near my existing settlement at node 16. Building this road will help me create a path toward new potential settlement locations, increasing my ability to access diverse resources. Since early game strategy prioritizes expansion and resource diversity, extending my network from existing settlements is the optimal choice. This road will likely position me to reach new intersections with different resource hexes, supporting my primary goal of efficient VP accumulation through strategic placement.
