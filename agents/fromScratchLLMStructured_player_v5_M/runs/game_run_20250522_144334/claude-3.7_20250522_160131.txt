Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [2, 0, 3, 1, 0]
        - Settlements: [5, 3]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 2
        - Roads Available: 9

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}

# Analysis of Catanatron Minigame State

## Action: END_TURN

## Justification:
In the current game state, I have no choice but to end my turn since it's the only available action presented. This indicates I cannot build any roads, settlements, cities, or make any trades with my current resources.

Looking at my resource array [2, 0, 3, 1, 0], I have:
- 2 Brick
- 0 Wool
- 3 Lumber
- 1 Grain
- 0 Ore

While I have some resources, I lack the specific combinations needed for any building actions:
- Road requires 1 brick + 1 lumber (I have both but no build action is available)
- Settlement requires 1 brick + 1 lumber + 1 wool + 1 grain (missing wool)
- City upgrade requires 2 grain + 3 ore (missing sufficient grain and all ore)

Ending my turn is the optimal choice as it allows me to collect new resources on the next round, potentially gaining the wool I need for a settlement or accumulating more grain and ore for future city upgrades. With 2 settlements already placed, I'm in position to diversify my resource collection for my next strategic move.
