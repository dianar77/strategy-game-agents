Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [3, 0, 3, 0, 2]
        - Settlements: [7, 16]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 6
        - Roads Available: 2

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}

# Catanatron Decision Analysis

## Action: END_TURN

## Justification:
Looking at the current game state, I have limited options available. With resources [3, 0, 3, 0, 2] (which represents [Brick, Ore, Wool, Grain, Lumber]), I don't have the required resources for building settlements (needs 1 brick, 1 wool, 1 grain, 1 lumber) or cities (needs 3 ore and 2 grain).

While I have a decent number of brick and wool resources, I'm completely lacking ore and grain which are essential for city upgrades. With 2 settlements already built and 6 victory points accumulated, I'm in a good position, but I need to gather different resources to progress further.

Since END_TURN is the only available action, I must take my turn and hope to collect the missing resources (particularly grain) on the next roll. After ending my turn, I should focus on:
1. Collecting grain and ore to upgrade my settlements to cities
2. Acquiring resources for additional roads and settlements to expand my network
3. Considering trades on my next turn if possible to balance my resource collection
