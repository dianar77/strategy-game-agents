Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 2, 0, 1, 0]
        - Settlements: [6, 22]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 2
        - Roads Available: 13

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
Based on the information provided, I only have one available action:

Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Justification: Since this is the only action available to me, I must end my turn. With my current resources [0, 2, 0, 1, 0] (likely representing [Brick, Lumber, Wool, Grain, Ore]), I don't have the right combination to build any new roads (need Brick+Lumber), settlements (need Brick+Lumber+Wool+Grain), or cities (need 3 Ore+2 Grain). While I'd prefer to make a more impactful move, ending my turn will allow me to collect new resources on the next roll and potentially enable more strategic actions in my next turn. I currently have 2 VP from my two settlements at positions 6 and 22, and need to focus on gathering the right resources for expansion on future turns.
