Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1]
        - Settlements: [7, 16]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 6
        - Roads Available: 5

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
I'll analyze this game situation carefully.

Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Justification: There is only one available action - ending the turn. Currently, I have limited resources (only 1 wheat and 1 brick), which is not enough to build any new structures. With 2 settlements but no cities yet, and 5 roads available, I need to gather more resources before I can expand. Ending the turn is the only reasonable option, allowing me to collect new resources on the next roll. With 6 VP already, I'm in a good position, but need to gather resources to either build new settlements or upgrade to cities soon. The heuristic score of 1 confirms this is the correct strategic choice given the current limitations.
