Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 2, 3, 0, 1]
        - Settlements: [22]
        - Cities: [6]
        - Victory Points (VP): 5
        - Roads Available: 11

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

Justification: The only available action is to roll the dice, which is necessary to advance the game and potentially gather more resources. With my current resources (0 Brick, 2 Wood, 3 Sheep, 0 Ore, 1 Wheat), I don't have the right combination to build anything yet, so rolling is essential to continue gameplay. Rolling could provide the brick and ore I'm missing to build more settlements or upgrade to cities. Given my current 5 victory points (from 1 city worth 2 VP and 3 settlements worth 1 VP each), I need to continue resource collection to reach the 10 VP goal. Rolling is the only strategic option available and will drive the game forward.
