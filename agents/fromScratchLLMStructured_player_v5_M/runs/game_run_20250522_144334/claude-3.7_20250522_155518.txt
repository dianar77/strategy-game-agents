Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
        - Settlements: [5, 3]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 2
        - Roads Available: 10

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
Looking at the current game state and available actions, I notice that:

1. I have no resources available (all zeros in the resource array)
2. I have settlements at positions 5 and 3
3. I have 2 Victory Points
4. My only available action is to end my turn

Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Justification: Since I have no resources available, I cannot build any settlements, cities, or roads at this moment. The only logical move is to end my turn to collect resources from my existing settlements on positions 5 and 3. This will allow me to gather resources based on the dice roll for the next turn, which I can then use to expand my network by building new roads and settlements according to priority #1, or potentially upgrade to cities per priority #2. Ending my turn now is not a "low-impact" action but a necessary step to progress in the game given my current resource constraints.
