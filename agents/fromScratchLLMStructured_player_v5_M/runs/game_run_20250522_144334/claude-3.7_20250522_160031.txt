Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [3, 0, 6, 0, 0]
        - Settlements: [5, 3]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 2
        - Roads Available: 10

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('SHEEP', 'SHEEP', 'SHEEP', 'SHEEP', 'WOOD'))
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('SHEEP', 'SHEEP', 'SHEEP', 'SHEEP', 'WHEAT'))
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('SHEEP', 'SHEEP', 'SHEEP', 'SHEEP', 'BRICK'))
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('SHEEP', 'SHEEP', 'SHEEP', 'SHEEP', 'ORE'))

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('SHEEP', 'SHEEP', 'SHEEP', 'SHEEP', 'WOOD')): 1
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('SHEEP', 'SHEEP', 'SHEEP', 'SHEEP', 'WHEAT')): 1
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('SHEEP', 'SHEEP', 'SHEEP', 'SHEEP', 'BRICK')): 1
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('SHEEP', 'SHEEP', 'SHEEP', 'SHEEP', 'ORE')): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
Looking at the current game state and available actions, I need to make a strategic decision.

The resource count [3, 0, 6, 0, 0] indicates I have:
- 3 Wood
- 0 Brick
- 6 Sheep
- 0 Wheat
- 0 Ore

Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('SHEEP', 'SHEEP', 'SHEEP', 'SHEEP', 'BRICK'))

Justification: Since expanding is our primary goal, I need to build roads and settlements. Looking at my current resources, I have plenty of sheep (6) but no brick, which is essential for building roads. Trading 4 sheep for 1 brick allows me to start working toward road building when combined with my existing wood resources. With 3 wood and 1 brick after this trade, I'll be just 1 brick short of being able to build a road on my next turn. This maritime trade is the most strategic option because it converts my excess sheep into a resource that directly supports our top priority of early expansion.
