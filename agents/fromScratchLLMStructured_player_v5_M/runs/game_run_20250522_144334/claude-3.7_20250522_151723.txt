Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 2, 0, 1, 1]
        - Settlements: [3, 5]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 2
        - Roads Available: 11

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}

# Catanatron Minigame Analysis

## Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

## Justification: 
Since this is the only available action, I must end my turn. With current resources [0, 2, 0, 1, 1] (representing [Brick, Lumber, Ore, Grain, Wool]), I don't have enough for any builds. My priorities would be to build roads (costs 1 brick, 1 lumber) or settlements (costs 1 brick, 1 lumber, 1 grain, 1 wool), but I'm lacking brick for both options. Similarly, I can't upgrade to a city (costs 2 ore, 3 grain) due to insufficient ore and grain.

The best strategy now is to end my turn and hope to gather more diverse resources on my next roll, particularly brick which I'm missing entirely. With settlements at positions 3 and 5, I should be gaining resources steadily to prepare for expansion on future turns.
