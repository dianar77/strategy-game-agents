Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 2, 2, 0, 2]
        - Settlements: [22]
        - Cities: [6]
        - Victory Points (VP): 5
        - Roads Available: 9

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
I'll analyze the current game state and available action for the Catanatron Minigame.

Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

Justification: I must roll the dice since this is the only available action at this moment. Rolling is an essential part of the game flow that generates resources needed for future building. With my current resources [0, 2, 2, 0, 2] (likely representing [Brick, Wool, Ore, Lumber, Grain]), I have some Wool, Ore, and Grain but need Brick and Lumber for roads and settlements. A good roll could provide these missing resources, allowing me to continue expanding my network with the 9 roads I have available. The roll outcome will determine my next strategic moves, whether building new settlements (if I get Brick and Lumber) or potentially upgrading to cities (I already have Ore and Grain). This roll is a necessary step toward implementing my prioritized strategy of efficient VP accumulation.
