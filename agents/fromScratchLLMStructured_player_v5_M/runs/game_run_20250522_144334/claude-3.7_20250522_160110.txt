Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [2, 0, 1, 1, 0]
        - Settlements: [5, 3]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 2
        - Roads Available: 9

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}

# Catanatron Move Analysis

Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

Justification: Rolling the dice is the only available action at this moment. This is a necessary action that begins my turn and will potentially provide new resources based on the settlement positions. With current resources of [2, 0, 1, 1, 0] (likely representing brick, wool, lumber, grain, and ore), I'm close to being able to build roads (costs 1 brick, 1 lumber) but need additional resources to build new settlements (costs 1 brick, 1 wool, 1 lumber, 1 grain) or cities (costs 2 grain, 3 ore). The dice roll could provide these needed resources, enabling more strategic options on my next turn. Since I already have 2 settlements providing income but limited resources currently, getting a good roll is critical for my expansion strategy.
