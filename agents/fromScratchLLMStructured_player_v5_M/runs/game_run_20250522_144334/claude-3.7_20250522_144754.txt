Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [1, 0, 1, 0, 0]
        - Settlements: [7, 16]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 3
        - Roads Available: 11

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
I'll analyze the current state and available actions for this Catanatron game.

Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Justification: I only have one available action which is to end my turn. With my current resources [1, 0, 1, 0, 0] (likely representing [brick, wool, wood, grain, ore]), I don't have enough resources to build anything new. I have 1 brick and 1 wood, but building a road requires 1 brick AND 1 wood, while building a settlement requires 1 brick, 1 wood, 1 wool, and 1 grain. I'm missing critical resources for any construction. Since I already have two settlements (at positions 7 and 16) generating 3 VP, ending my turn is the only valid move to collect more resources on the next roll and prepare for future building actions. This action has a heuristic score of 1, confirming it's the optimal choice given current constraints.
