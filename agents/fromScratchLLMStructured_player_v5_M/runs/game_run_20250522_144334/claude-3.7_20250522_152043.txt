Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [2, 0, 0, 0, 0]
        - Settlements: [3, 5, 21]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 5
        - Roads Available: 7

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
I'll analyze this game state and determine the optimal move.

Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Justification: In this situation, I only have one available action, which is to end my turn. Based on the current game state, I have 2 brick resources but no other resources, which means I cannot build any settlements (requiring brick, lumber, wheat, and wool), cities (requiring ore and wheat), or roads (requiring brick and lumber). Since I don't have the necessary resource combinations to build anything, ending my turn is the only logical choice. This will allow me to collect more resources on the next round and hopefully be in a better position to execute my expansion strategy. With 3 settlements already placed and 7 roads available, I'll be in a good position to continue expanding when I gather the right resources.
