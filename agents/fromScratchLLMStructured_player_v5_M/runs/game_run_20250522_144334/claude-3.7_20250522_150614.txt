Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [3, 0, 3, 0, 2]
        - Settlements: [7, 16]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 6
        - Roads Available: 2

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}

# Catanatron Game Analysis

## Action: END_TURN

## Justification:
Looking at the current game state, I only have one available action which is to end my turn. This makes sense given my current resource holdings [3 Brick, 0 Ore, 3 Lumber, 0 Wool, 2 Grain] and the game constraints:

1. I can't build a settlement because:
   - It requires [1 Brick, 0 Ore, 1 Lumber, 1 Wool, 1 Grain]
   - I'm missing Wool completely

2. I can't build a city because:
   - It requires [0 Brick, 3 Ore, 0 Lumber, 0 Wool, 2 Grain]
   - I'm missing the 3 Ore needed

3. I can't build a road because:
   - While I have enough resources (1 Brick, 1 Lumber needed)
   - Building a road alone without a strategic plan for settlement placement would be suboptimal

The best move is to end my turn and hope for favorable dice rolls that will give me the missing resources (particularly Wool or Ore) to make meaningful progress on my next turn. With 6 Victory Points already, I'm in a good position, and making strategic use of future resources will be critical.
