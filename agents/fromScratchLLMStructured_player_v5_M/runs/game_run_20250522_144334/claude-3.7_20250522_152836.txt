Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [1, 0, 1, 1, 2]
        - Settlements: [3, 5, 21, 20]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 6
        - Roads Available: 0

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUY_DEVELOPMENT_CARD: 'BUY_DEVELOPMENT_CARD'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUY_DEVELOPMENT_CARD: 'BUY_DEVELOPMENT_CARD'>, value=None): 7

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUY_DEVELOPMENT_CARD: 'BUY_DEVELOPMENT_CARD'>, value=None)

Justification: Based on my current resources [1, 0, 1, 1, 2], I have exactly what's needed to buy a development card (1 ore, 1 wheat, 1 wool). The heuristic score of 7 for buying a development card compared to 1 for ending the turn indicates this is the strategically superior choice. Development cards can provide immediate benefits like Knight cards (which help control the robber and build toward Largest Army), Victory Point cards (hidden VP until game end), or progress cards that can help with resource acquisition or road building. With no roads available and unable to build settlements or cities with my current resources, buying a development card is the optimal way to advance my position and potentially increase my Victory Points rather than simply ending my turn.
