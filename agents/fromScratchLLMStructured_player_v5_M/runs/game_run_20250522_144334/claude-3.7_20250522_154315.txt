Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 2, 2, 0, 3]
        - Settlements: [22]
        - Cities: [6]
        - Victory Points (VP): 5
        - Roads Available: 9

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}

# Analysis of Catanatron Game State

Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Justification: In the current game state, I only have one available action which is to end my turn. Looking at my resource inventory [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] (representing [Brick, Wood, Sheep, Wheat, Ore]), I have some resources but not the right combinations to build anything. Specifically:
- I can't build a road (requires 1 brick, 1 wood)
- I can't build a settlement (requires 1 brick, 1 wood, 1 sheep, 1 wheat)
- I can't build a city (requires 3 ore, 2 wheat)
- I can't purchase a development card (requires 1 ore, 1 sheep, 1 wheat)

My current position with 5 victory points (from 1 city worth 2 points and 3 settlements worth 1 point each) is solid. The best strategy is to end my turn now and hope to collect the missing resources (particularly brick and wheat) on the next round to continue expansion. When I get those resources, I should prioritize building roads to reach new settlement locations, as that aligns with the first strategic priority of early expansion.
