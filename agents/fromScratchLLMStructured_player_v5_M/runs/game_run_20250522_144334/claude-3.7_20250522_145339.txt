Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 1, 1, 1, 3]
        - Settlements: [7, 16]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 3
        - Roads Available: 8

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

Justification: I need to roll the dice to generate resources and advance the game. Currently, I have [0 brick, 1 wood, 1 wheat, 1 sheep, 3 ore] resources, which isn't enough to build most structures. I already have two settlements (at positions 7 and 16) generating 3 VP, but need more resources to expand. Rolling is the only available action and will give me a chance to collect more resources based on the numbers adjacent to my settlements. After rolling, I'll have more options like building roads, settlements, or potentially upgrading to a city (which would require 3 ore + 2 wheat).
