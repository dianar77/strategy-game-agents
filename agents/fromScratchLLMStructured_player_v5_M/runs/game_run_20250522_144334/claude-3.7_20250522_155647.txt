Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]
        - Settlements: [5, 3]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 2
        - Roads Available: 10

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
I'll analyze the current game state and determine the best move for the Catanatron Minigame.

Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

Justification: In the current game state, I only have one legal action available - to roll the dice. This is the necessary and strategic choice since:

1. Rolling is required to progress the game and potentially gain more resources
2. I currently have very limited resources (just 1 brick) which isn't enough to build anything
3. With 2 settlements already built, rolling has the potential to generate multiple resources depending on the roll outcome and settlement placements
4. Rolling is the only way to accumulate the diverse resources needed to execute my priority of building roads and settlements for expansion

After rolling, I'll be better positioned to make strategic decisions based on the new resources gained.
