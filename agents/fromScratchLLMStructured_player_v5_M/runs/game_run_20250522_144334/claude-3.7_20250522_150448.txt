Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [2, 0, 1, 0, 1]
        - Settlements: [7, 16]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 6
        - Roads Available: 2

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD: 'PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD'>, value=None)
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD: 'PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD'>, value=None): 1
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
I need to analyze the available actions and make the best strategic choice based on the current game state.

Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD: 'PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD'>, value=None)

Justification: Playing the Knight card is the optimal choice for several reasons. First, it allows me to move the robber to potentially disrupt my opponent's resource production while possibly stealing a resource card from them. Second, playing development cards contributes toward the "Largest Army" special victory point card, which awards 2 VPs. With my current 6 VPs, I'm close to winning (10 VPs needed), so any strategic advantage matters. Since both actions have the same heuristic score of 1, but the Knight card provides tangible benefits versus simply ending my turn, it's the better strategic choice to maintain momentum and potentially gain resources or disrupt my opponent.
