Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 3, 3, 0, 1]
        - Settlements: [22]
        - Cities: [6]
        - Victory Points (VP): 3
        - Roads Available: 13

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}

Response:
# Strategic Decision Analysis

Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Justification: Since END_TURN is the only available action, I must choose it. Looking at my current resources [0, 3, 3, 0, 1] (representing [Ore, Wheat, Sheep, Wood, Brick]), I'm unable to build anything this turn. I have 3 wheat, 3 sheep, and 1 brick, but lack wood and sufficient brick for road building, and lack ore for city upgrades. This is a strategic moment to end my turn and collect new resources. With my existing settlements at locations 22 and a city at location 6, I should use the next turn to aim for wood resources to enable road building and additional settlement placement, which aligns with my priority of early expansion for resource diversity.
