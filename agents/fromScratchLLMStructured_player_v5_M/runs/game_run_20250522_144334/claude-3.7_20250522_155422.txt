Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
        - Settlements: [5, 3]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 2
        - Roads Available: 10

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}

# Game Analysis

## Action: END_TURN

## Justification:
I need to end my turn since it's the only available action. With only 1 brick and no other resources (shown as [1,0,0,0,0]), I cannot build any structures at this moment:
- A settlement requires 1 brick, 1 wood, 1 wheat, and 1 sheep
- A road requires 1 brick and 1 wood
- A city requires 2 wheat and 3 ore

By ending my turn, I'll get a new resource distribution in the next round. Since I currently have 2 VP from my existing settlements at positions 5 and 3, my priority should be to collect more diverse resources that will allow me to build roads (to expand) or upgrade to cities (for more VP). The single brick I currently have is not sufficient for any useful action, making END_TURN the correct strategic choice.
