Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [2, 1, 2, 0, 0]
        - Settlements: [0, 21, 46]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 3
        - Roads Available: 8

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(1, 2))
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(45, 46))

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

========================================

Response:
I need to evaluate the best move to make given the current resources and game state. Let me analyze the situation.

Resources: [2 brick, 1 wool, 2 lumber, 0 ore, 0 grain]
I have enough resources (1 brick + 1 lumber) to build a road, which is good because I see several BUILD_ROAD options.

Looking at my settlements (at nodes 0, 21, and 46), I should build roads that extend from these settlements to maximize future expansion potential.

Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(46, 48))

Justification: I'm choosing to build a road from node 46 (where I already have a settlement) to node 48. This is strategically valuable because:
1. It expands from my existing settlement at node 46, creating a path for future settlement placement
2. By building outward from my current position, I'm positioning myself to access new resource-producing hexes
3. With 8 roads still available after this build, extending from my settlements is optimal for early expansion
4. Since I lack ore and grain, expanding to new resource spots is crucial for diversifying my resource collection
5. This move uses my brick and lumber resources efficiently, leaving me with [1, 1, 1, 0, 0] for my next turn
