Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [3, 0, 2, 0, 1]
        - Settlements: [3, 5, 21]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 5
        - Roads Available: 2

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
I'll evaluate the current state and recommend the best action.

Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Justification: In this situation, ending my turn is the only available action. While normally I would prioritize building settlements, roads, or upgrading to cities, I currently have no other options. My resource holdings [3, 0, 2, 0, 1] (representing [Brick, Grain, Lumber, Ore, Wool]) indicate I have some brick, lumber, and wool, but I lack the specific combinations needed for any builds. For a settlement, I'd need [1,1,1,0,1], and for a road, I'd need [1,0,1,0,0]. By ending my turn now, I can collect new resources on the next roll and hopefully gain what I need to expand my network of 3 settlements. With 2 roads available and 5 VP already, I'm in a solid position to grow once I collect the right resources.
