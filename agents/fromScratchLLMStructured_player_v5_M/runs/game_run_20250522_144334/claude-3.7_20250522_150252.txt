Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [2, 0, 0, 0, 1]
        - Settlements: [7, 16]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 6
        - Roads Available: 3

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}

Response:
# Game Analysis and Decision

Action: END_TURN

Justification: I have to end my turn because it's the only available action. With my current resources [2,0,0,0,1] (representing 2 brick, 0 wool, 0 grain, 0 lumber, and 1 ore), I don't have enough materials to build any new settlements, roads, or cities. I have two settlements at positions 7 and 16, which are generating resources, and 3 roads available for future expansion. My strategy for the next turn should be to collect more diverse resources so I can build roads to expand to new settlement locations or upgrade my existing settlements to cities when I collect enough resources (3 ore and 2 grain needed per city).
