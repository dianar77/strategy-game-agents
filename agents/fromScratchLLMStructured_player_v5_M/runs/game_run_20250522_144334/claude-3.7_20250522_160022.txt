Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [2, 0, 6, 4, 0]
        - Settlements: [5, 3]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 2
        - Roads Available: 10

        Available Actions:

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

========================================

Response:
I'll analyze this game state to determine the best action.

Looking at the current resources [2, 0, 6, 4, 0], this means:
- 2 BRICK
- 0 WOOD
- 6 WHEAT
- 4 SHEEP
- 0 ORE

The available actions are either to end my turn or perform various maritime trades.

For maritime trades, I need to carefully consider what resources I need most. Looking at my goals:
1. Building a road costs 1 BRICK + 1 WOOD (I have 2 BRICK but 0 WOOD)
2. Building a settlement costs 1 BRICK + 1 WOOD + 1 WHEAT + 1 SHEEP (I have most of these except WOOD)
3. Upgrading to a city costs 2 WHEAT + 3 ORE (I have 6 WHEAT but 0 ORE)

Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'WOOD'))

Justification: Trading 4 WHEAT for 1 WOOD is the most strategic move because it allows me to potentially build a road on my next turn (using 1 BRICK + 1 WOOD). Expanding with roads is critical early in the game as it opens up new settlement opportunities. I have plenty of WHEAT (6) to spare, so trading 4 of them still leaves me with 2 WHEAT. Wood is essential for both roads and settlements, making it the most valuable resource I'm missing right now. This trade supports my primary goal of early expansion through roads and settlements, which will lead to more diverse resource production.
