Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 3, 3, 1, 0]
        - Settlements: [0, 21]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 2
        - Roads Available: 9

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
I need to evaluate the current game state and make the best decision to maximize Victory Points efficiently.

Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

Justification: Rolling the dice is the only available action at this moment. Rolling will determine what resources I receive, which will enable subsequent actions like building roads, settlements, or cities. With my current resources [0, 3, 3, 1, 0] (which appears to be [Brick, Lumber, Wool, Grain, Ore]), I have a decent amount of Lumber and Wool, and some Grain, but I'm missing Brick and Ore. Rolling is necessary to potentially gain more resources before I can execute any building strategy. After rolling, I'll be in a better position to decide whether to build roads (if I get Brick), work toward new settlements (if I get more Brick or diverse resources), or save for city upgrades (if I get Ore).
