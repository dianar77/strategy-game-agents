Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 0, 2, 0, 3]
        - Settlements: [7, 16]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 2
        - Roads Available: 12

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
I've analyzed the current game state and available actions carefully.

Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Justification: Since END_TURN is the only available action, I must end my turn now. Looking at my current resources [0, 0, 2, 0, 3], I have 2 grain and 3 wood, which isn't enough to build any meaningful structure. Building a road requires brick and wood (1 each), a settlement requires brick, wood, sheep, and grain (1 each), and upgrading to a city requires 2 grain and 3 ore. I need to collect more diverse resources through the dice roll on the next turn. My current position with 2 settlements provides income opportunities, and ending my turn is the only strategic option to continue gathering the necessary resources for future expansion.
