Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 0, 2, 0, 0]
        - Settlements: [5, 3]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 2
        - Roads Available: 10

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD: 'PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD'>, value=None)
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD: 'PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD'>, value=None): 1
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}

# Action Analysis

Looking at the current game state:
- I have 2 Grain resources
- No other resources available
- 5 Settlement and 3 City pieces left to build
- Currently at 2 Victory Points
- No immediate building options available

## Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD: 'PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD'>, value=None)

## Justification:
Playing the Knight card is the better option because:
1) It allows me to move the robber, potentially blocking a key hex for my opponent
2) It contributes toward building the "Largest Army" special card (worth 2 VP)
3) I can steal a resource from an opponent, which could provide immediate value
4) Since I cannot build anything with just 2 Grain, ending my turn without taking action would waste an opportunity
5) Playing development cards like Knight doesn't consume my actual turn, so I can still trade or build if I get useful resources from the steal

Ending my turn without taking any action would be a wasted opportunity when I have a Knight card that can potentially improve my position.
