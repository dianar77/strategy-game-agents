Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [1, 0, 1, 0, 1]
        - Settlements: [7, 16]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 6
        - Roads Available: 2

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
I'll analyze the current game state and available actions to provide the optimal move.

Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Justification: In the current situation, ending my turn is the only available action. With limited resources [1, 0, 1, 0, 1] (which appears to be 1 brick, 0 wood, 1 sheep, 0 ore, 1 wheat), I don't have enough materials to build any infrastructure. I already have two settlements (at positions 7 and 16) and 6 victory points, which is a strong position. Since I can't make any other moves with my current resources, ending my turn is the best strategic choice to collect more resources on the next round. This will help me work toward upgrading my settlements to cities (which requires ore and wheat) or building more roads (which requires brick and wood) on my next turn when I hopefully have more resources at my disposal.
