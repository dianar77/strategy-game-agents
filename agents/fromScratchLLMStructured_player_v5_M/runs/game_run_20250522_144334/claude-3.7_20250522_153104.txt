Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) efficiently by following these priorities:
        1. Build settlements and roads early to expand for resource diversity.
        2. Upgrade settlements to cities later for higher VP returns.
        3. Block opponent progress when strategically advantageous.

        Current Game State:
        - Resources: [0, 0, 3, 0, 0]
        - Settlements: [6, 22]
        - Cities: []
        - Victory Points (VP): 2
        - Roads Available: 13

        Available Actions:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Heuristic Scores for Actions (strategic breakdown by priority):
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None): 1

        Avoid repetitive or low-impact actions like ending turns unnecessarily. Instead, choose impactful actions that optimize VP growth.

        Respond with:
        Action: {Chosen Action}
        Justification: {Reasoning behind the optimal choice}
        

========================================

Response:
I need to analyze the current game state and determine the best move.

Looking at my current resources: [0, 0, 3, 0, 0]
This means I have 3 Wood, but no Brick, Sheep, Wheat, or Ore.

With this limited resource setup, I can't build anything significant:
- Roads require Wood + Brick
- Settlements require Wood + Brick + Sheep + Wheat
- Cities require Wheat + Ore

Since there's only one action available to me, and I can't use my Wood resources effectively right now:

Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Justification: I currently have 3 Wood resources but no Brick, making it impossible to build roads or other structures. The best strategy is to end my turn and collect more diverse resources on my next turn. With settlements at positions 6 and 22, I should focus on gathering Brick next turn to enable road building and expansion to new resource-producing hexes.
