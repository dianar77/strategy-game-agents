Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
I see that you're playing a game of Catan and need to make a strategic decision, but there's only one action available to you:

**Action 0**: End your turn (Color: BLUE)

Since this is the only available action, there are no alternatives to analyze. This typically means that you've already completed all possible building, trading, or playing development cards for your turn, and the only thing left to do is end your turn and let the next player go.

In Catan, when you can only end your turn, it means:
- You've used all your building opportunities
- You've completed any trades you wanted to make
- You've played any development cards you wanted to play this turn
- There are no other mandatory or optional actions available

Without any other options to consider, the choice is clear.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
