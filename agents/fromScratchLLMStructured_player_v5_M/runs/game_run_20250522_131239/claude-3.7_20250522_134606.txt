Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
Looking at your available actions, I see you only have one option:

Action 0: Roll the dice (BLUE player, ROLL action)

This is a straightforward situation. At the beginning of your turn in Catan, rolling the dice is typically the first required action to generate resources for all players based on the roll outcome. Since this is your only available action, there's no strategic decision to make at this point.

After you roll, you'll likely have more meaningful decisions about trading, building, or playing development cards depending on the resources you receive.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
