Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
Looking at your available actions in this game of Catan, I can see that you only have one option:

Action 0: End your turn (BLUE player ending their turn)

Since there is only one action available, there's no decision to be made here. This indicates that you've either already completed all possible moves for this turn (like building, trading, or playing development cards), or you don't have the resources to take any other actions.

In Catan, when you can no longer make any more moves or choose not to make additional moves during your turn, ending your turn is the appropriate action. This will pass play to the next player.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
