Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
Since there's only one available action (Action 0), your decision is straightforward. This action allows you to roll the dice, which is how you begin your turn in Catan. Rolling the dice determines which hexes produce resources for all players with settlements or cities adjacent to those hexes.

In Catan, rolling the dice is mandatory at the beginning of your turn (unless you want to play a development card before rolling), so this isn't really a strategic choice but rather the standard progression of the game.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
