Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
Based on the available actions, you only have one option:

Action 0: End your turn (Color BLUE)

Since this is the only action available to you, there's no strategic decision to make at this moment. This indicates that you've likely completed all other possible actions for your turn (such as building roads, settlements, cities, or trading) or you don't have the resources to take any other actions.

When you only have the end turn option, it means either:
1. You've already done everything you wanted to do this turn
2. You don't have sufficient resources for any building actions
3. There are no legal builds or trades available to you

Since there are no alternatives to evaluate, your only choice is to end your turn and let the next player take their turn.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
