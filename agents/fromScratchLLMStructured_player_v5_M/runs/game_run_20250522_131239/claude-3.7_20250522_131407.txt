Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
I'll help you make a strategic decision in your Catan game.

Looking at the available actions, there's actually only one option:

Action 0: End your turn (BLUE player)

Since this is the only action available, you don't have any other moves you can make at this moment. This likely means you've already done everything possible during your turn (such as rolling dice, building, trading, or playing development cards).

In Catan, when you can only end your turn, it means you've exhausted all your possible actions for this turn or you don't have the resources to do anything else.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
