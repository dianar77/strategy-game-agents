Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)
Action 1: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('WOOD', 'WOOD', 'WOOD', 'WOOD', 'ORE'))
Action 2: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('WOOD', 'WOOD', 'WOOD', 'WOOD', 'SHEEP'))
Action 3: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('WOOD', 'WOOD', 'WOOD', 'WOOD', 'WHEAT'))
Action 4: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('WOOD', 'WOOD', 'WOOD', 'WOOD', 'BRICK'))

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
I'll analyze the available actions for your Catan turn:

Action 0: End your turn without doing anything else.

Actions 1-4: Maritime trade options where you're trading 4 WOOD for:
- Action 1: 1 ORE
- Action 2: 1 SHEEP
- Action 3: 1 WHEAT
- Action 4: 1 BRICK

Since all these are maritime trades requiring 4 WOOD, this suggests you have at least 4 WOOD cards but need other resources. Without knowing your current game state (your settlements/cities, development cards, what you're planning to build, etc.), it's difficult to make the optimal recommendation.

However, let's consider what each resource might help with:
- ORE: Needed for cities (2 ore) and development cards (1 ore)
- SHEEP: Needed for settlements (1 sheep) and development cards (1 sheep)
- WHEAT: Needed for cities (2 wheat), settlements (1 wheat), and development cards (1 wheat)
- BRICK: Needed for settlements (1 brick) and roads (1 brick)

A 4:1 maritime trade is generally not very efficient. If you're not in urgent need of a specific resource, ending your turn might be better than making this expensive trade.

Since I don't have information about your specific game situation, I'll default to recommending:

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0

This preserves your resources for potentially better trades or builds on your next turn, rather than making an expensive 4:1 trade.
