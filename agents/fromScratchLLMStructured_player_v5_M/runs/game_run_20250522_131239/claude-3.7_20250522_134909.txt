You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
Looking at the available actions, there's only one option:

Action 0: Roll the dice (ROLL action for the BLUE player)

In Catan, rolling the dice is how you generate resources at the beginning of your turn. This roll will determine which hexes produce resources, and any players with settlements or cities adjacent to those hexes will collect the corresponding resources.

Since this is the only available action, there's no decision to be made - you must roll the dice to proceed with your turn.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
