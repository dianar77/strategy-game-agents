Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD: 'PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD'>, value=None)
Action 1: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
I'll analyze each option available to you in this Catan scenario:

**Action 0: Play Knight Card**
Playing a Knight Card gives you several advantages:
1. You can move the robber to block an opponent's resource production
2. You can steal a resource from the opponent you place the robber on
3. It counts toward building your "Largest Army" (which grants 2 victory points if you have 3+ knights)
4. You avoid potential negative outcomes from rolling (like a 7 that would force you to discard cards)

**Action 1: Roll the Dice**
Rolling is the standard way to gain resources in Catan:
1. You could potentially gain resources if your numbers are rolled
2. There's a risk of rolling a 7, which activates the robber
3. Rolling advances the game normally without using up your development cards

**Analysis:**
Without knowing your current hand size, board position, or the game state, it's hard to make a definitive recommendation. However:

- If you have 8+ cards in hand, playing the Knight Card is safer to avoid losing cards to a 7 roll
- If an opponent is close to winning, using the Knight to disrupt them might be wise
- If you're trying to build the Largest Army, the Knight helps
- If you need resources urgently, rolling is better

Since playing development cards is optional and rolling is mandatory on your turn (unless you play a card first), I'll slightly favor the Knight if you haven't provided more context.

**RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0**
