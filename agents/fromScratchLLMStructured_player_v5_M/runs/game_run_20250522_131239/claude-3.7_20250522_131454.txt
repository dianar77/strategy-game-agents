Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
Since there is only one available action (Action 0: Roll the dice), this is a straightforward decision. In Catan, rolling the dice is how you begin your turn and determine which resources are produced.

Action 0: Rolling the dice is mandatory at the beginning of your turn. This will generate resources for all players who have settlements or cities adjacent to hexes matching the dice roll number. After rolling, you'll have more options available like building, trading, or playing development cards.

Since this is your only available action, there are no alternatives to consider or compare.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
