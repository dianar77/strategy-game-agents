Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(13, 14))
Action 1: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(14, 37))
Action 2: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(14, 15))

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
I'll analyze each available road building option for you in Catan:

**Action 0: Build Road (13, 14)**
This road would connect from node 13 to node 14. Without seeing the full board state, I need to consider if this creates a path toward valuable resources or potential settlement locations. This appears to be connecting existing infrastructure.

**Action 1: Build Road (14, 37)**
This road would connect from node 14 to node 37. This might be extending toward a new section of the board, possibly reaching toward new settlement opportunities or resources that you don't currently have access to.

**Action 2: Build Road (14, 15)**
This road would connect from node 14 to node 15, extending in a different direction from node 14. This could be part of expanding along an edge of the board.

Without full board visibility, the most strategic choice would likely be Action 1 (14, 37) as connections between nodes with greater numerical distance often represent opportunities to expand into new areas of the board, potentially reaching new resources or blocking opponents.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 1
