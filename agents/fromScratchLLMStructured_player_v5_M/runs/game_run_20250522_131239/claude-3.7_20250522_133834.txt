Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
I'm helping you make a strategic decision in Catan. Let's analyze the available actions:

You currently have only one action available:
- Action 0: End your turn (for BLUE player)

Since this is your only option, there's not really a strategic decision to be made here. The game is requiring you to end your turn, which means you've either:
1. Already completed all the actions you wanted to take this turn
2. Don't have the resources or opportunities to do anything else this turn
3. Have just rolled the dice and received no resources

Without seeing your current resources, board position, or what you've already done this turn, I can only advise that it's time to end your turn and let the next player take their turn.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
