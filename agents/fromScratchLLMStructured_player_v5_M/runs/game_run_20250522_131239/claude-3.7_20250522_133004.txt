========================================

Response:
I'll analyze your options in this Catan situation.

You have five actions available:
- Action 0: End your turn
- Actions 1-4: Maritime trade options, all trading 4 wood for another resource (ore, sheep, wheat, or brick)

Let's consider these options:

Looking at your maritime trade options (Actions 1-4), you would be trading 4 wood to get 1 of another resource. This is a standard 4:1 port rate, which is quite expensive. It suggests you either have:
1. A lot of wood that you want to convert to something more useful
2. A desperate need for a specific resource

Without knowing your current resource count, your building plans, or the game state, it's difficult to determine if trading away 4 wood is the right move. Wood is valuable for roads and settlements.

However, if you're making this trade, you must have at least 4 wood, which is substantial. The question becomes whether you need one of these other resources more than you need the wood.

If you're considering a maritime trade, you likely need a specific resource to achieve something - perhaps building a settlement, city, or development card. 

Without more context on what you're planning to build or what resources you already have, the most conservative approach would be to end your turn (Action 0) rather than make an expensive 4:1 trade.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
