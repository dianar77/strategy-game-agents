Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
Looking at the available actions for your Catan game, I only see one option:

Action 0: End Turn (Color: BLUE)

This is a simple decision since there's only one available action. When you only have the option to end your turn, it means you've either:
1. Already completed all possible actions for this turn
2. Don't have the resources or positioning to build anything
3. Are in a phase of the game where ending your turn is the only valid move

Since there are no other options available, you should proceed with ending your turn and let the next player take their turn.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
