Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
I see that you're playing Catan and need to make a decision about your next move. Let me analyze the available options:

Currently, you only have one available action:
Action 0: Roll the dice (BLUE player)

Since this is your only available action, there's no strategic decision to make at this point. In Catan, rolling the dice is how you begin your turn, determining which resource hexes will produce resources for players with settlements or cities adjacent to them.

After rolling, you'll likely have more options based on the outcome of the roll, such as building roads, settlements, cities, or purchasing development cards.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
