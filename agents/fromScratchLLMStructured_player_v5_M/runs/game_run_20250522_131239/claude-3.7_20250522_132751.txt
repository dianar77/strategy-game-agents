Response:
# Catan Action Analysis

In this case, you only have one available action:

**Action 0:** Discard cards (DISCARD action for BLUE player)

This action indicates that you need to discard cards from your hand. In Catan, this typically happens when a 7 is rolled and you have more than 7 cards in your hand. The rule requires all players with more than 7 cards to discard half their cards (rounded down).

Since there's only one action available, there's no strategic decision to make at this moment. You must discard cards as required by the game rules.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
