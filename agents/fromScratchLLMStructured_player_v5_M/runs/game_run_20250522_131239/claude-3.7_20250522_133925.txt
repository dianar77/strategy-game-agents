Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(0, 1))
Action 1: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(0, 20))
Action 2: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(0, 5))

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
I'll analyze each road building option for the blue player in Catan:

**Action 0: Build road at (0, 1)**
This would connect node 0 to node 1. Without seeing the full board layout, I can't determine if this road extends your existing network or helps you reach valuable resources. However, roads connecting lower-numbered nodes are typically near the center of the board.

**Action 1: Build road at (0, 20)**
This would connect node 0 to node 20. The high number difference suggests this might connect across the board or to an edge region. This could be valuable for expansion but depends on resource distributions.

**Action 2: Build road at (0, 5)**
This would connect node 0 to node 5. This appears to be a more local connection, potentially expanding your network in a specific direction.

Without knowing the current board state, resource distributions, and your settlement positions, it's difficult to make a fully informed recommendation.

However, roads connecting to lower node numbers (like Action 0) often provide more central positioning and flexibility. Roads that connect to existing settlements or lead toward high-value resource hexes are generally preferable.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
