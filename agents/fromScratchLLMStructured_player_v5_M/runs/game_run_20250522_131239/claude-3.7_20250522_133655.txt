Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
Looking at the available actions for this game of Catan, I see that there is only one possible action:

Action 0: Roll the dice (ROLL action for the BLUE player)

When there's only one available action, the decision is simple. In Catan, rolling the dice is the standard way to start your turn and determine which resource-producing hexes will generate resources for all players who have settlements or cities adjacent to those hexes.

Since this is the only action available, you must roll the dice to proceed with your turn.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
