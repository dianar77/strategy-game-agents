Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
I see that you're playing Catan and need to make a strategic decision. Let me analyze the available actions.

Looking at the options, there is only one action available:
- Action 0: End your turn (BLUE player)

Since this is the only option available to you, there's no strategic decision to make in this particular moment. When only the END_TURN action is available, it means you've already completed all possible actions for your turn (like building, trading, playing development cards, etc.) or you have no legal moves to make.

Without additional context about your current game state, resources, or board position, I can only recommend the one action that's available.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
