Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
I see you're playing Catan and evaluating your available actions. In this case, there's only one option available:

Action 0: End your turn (represented by Color.BLUE with ActionType.END_TURN)

Since this is the only action available to you, there's no strategic decision to be made at this moment. When only END_TURN is available, it means you've either:
1. Already completed all possible moves for your turn
2. Don't have the resources or positioning to build anything
3. Are at a point in the game where it's time to pass to the next player

Since there are no alternative actions to analyze, the only logical choice is to end your turn.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
