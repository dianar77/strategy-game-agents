Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
I'll help you decide what action to choose in this Catan situation.

Currently, you only have one available action:
- Action 0: Roll the dice (BLUE player)

Since this is the only available action, there's nothing to compare or analyze. In Catan, rolling the dice is the standard way to start your turn, determining which resource-producing hexes will generate resources for players who have settlements or cities adjacent to them.

After rolling, you'll likely have additional options based on the resources you collect and your current position on the board, such as building roads, settlements, cities, or playing development cards.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
