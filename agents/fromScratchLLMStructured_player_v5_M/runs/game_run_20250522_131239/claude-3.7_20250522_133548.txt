Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
I only see one available action in your list:

Action 0: End Turn (Color: BLUE)

Since there is only one option available to you, there's no strategic decision to make at this moment. You need to end your turn so the game can proceed to the next player.

While I can't provide comparative analysis with only one option, ending your turn is necessary to continue the game. You've likely already completed all your possible actions for this turn (building, trading, playing development cards, etc.).

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
