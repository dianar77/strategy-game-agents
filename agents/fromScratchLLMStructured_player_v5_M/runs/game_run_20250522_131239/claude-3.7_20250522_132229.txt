Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
I see that you're playing a game of Catan and need to make a decision. Let's analyze the available action:

Action 0: Roll the dice (BLUE player, ROLL action)

Analysis:
This appears to be your only available option at the moment. In Catan, rolling the dice is the standard way to begin your turn. Rolling determines which resource-producing hexes activate, allowing players with settlements or cities adjacent to those hexes to collect resources.

Since this is the only action available, there's no strategic comparison to make with other options. Rolling the dice will move the game forward and potentially provide you with resources depending on the roll outcome and your board position.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
