Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
Looking at the available actions, I only have one option:

Action 0: Roll the dice (BLUE player, ROLL action)

This is the standard way to begin a turn in Catan. Rolling the dice will determine which resource tiles produce resources this turn. All players who have settlements or cities adjacent to hexes with the rolled number will collect those resources.

Since this is the only action available, there's no strategic decision to make at this point. The player must roll the dice to proceed with their turn.

After rolling, depending on the outcome, more action options will likely become available, such as building roads/settlements, trading, or playing development cards.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
