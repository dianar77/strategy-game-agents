Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)
Action 1: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('ORE', 'ORE', 'ORE', None, 'WOOD'))
Action 2: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('ORE', 'ORE', 'ORE', None, 'SHEEP'))
Action 3: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('ORE', 'ORE', 'ORE', None, 'WHEAT'))
Action 4: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('ORE', 'ORE', 'ORE', None, 'BRICK'))

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
I'll analyze each available action to determine the best strategic move for you in Catan:

**Action 0**: End your turn without doing anything else.
- This would forfeit your opportunity to trade resources this turn.

**Actions 1-4**: Maritime trades, all trading 3 ORE to receive 1 of another resource:
- Action 1: Trade 3 ORE for 1 WOOD
- Action 2: Trade 3 ORE for 1 SHEEP
- Action 3: Trade 3 ORE for 1 WHEAT
- Action 4: Trade 3 ORE for 1 BRICK

Since all trade options require giving up 3 ORE, this suggests you don't have a harbor that would allow a 2:1 trade, so these are standard 3:1 maritime trades.

Without knowing your:
- Current resource inventory
- What you're planning to build
- Board position and victory points
- Resources other players have

It's difficult to make a definitive recommendation. However, maritime trading at a 3:1 rate is generally inefficient, so I would only recommend trading if you:
1. Have excess ORE (more than 3)
2. Urgently need one of those resources to build something important
3. Are at risk of losing cards to the robber (have 8+ cards in hand)

Since I don't have this information, the safest option is to end your turn (Action 0) rather than make a potentially inefficient trade.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
