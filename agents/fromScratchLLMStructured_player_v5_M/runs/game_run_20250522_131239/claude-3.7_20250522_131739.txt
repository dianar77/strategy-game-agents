Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)
Action 1: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('ORE', 'ORE', 'ORE', None, 'WOOD'))
Action 2: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('ORE', 'ORE', 'ORE', None, 'SHEEP'))
Action 3: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('ORE', 'ORE', 'ORE', None, 'WHEAT'))
Action 4: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('ORE', 'ORE', 'ORE', None, 'BRICK'))

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
I'll analyze the available actions for the Catan player:

Action 0: End your turn without taking any further actions.

Actions 1-4: These are maritime trade options where you would trade 3 ORE for 1 of another resource:
- Action 1: Trade 3 ORE for 1 WOOD
- Action 2: Trade 3 ORE for 1 SHEEP
- Action 3: Trade 3 ORE for 1 WHEAT
- Action 4: Trade 3 ORE for 1 BRICK

Without additional information about your current resources, game state, or strategic goals, it's difficult to make the optimal recommendation. However, the fact that you have the option to trade 3 ORE suggests you have at least 3 ORE.

If you're looking to end your turn without trading, Action 0 is appropriate. If you want to make a maritime trade, you should choose based on what resource you need most for your next planned build (road, settlement, city, or development card).

Since I don't have enough context about your current game state and strategic needs, ending your turn (Action 0) is the conservative choice to avoid potentially disadvantageous trades.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
