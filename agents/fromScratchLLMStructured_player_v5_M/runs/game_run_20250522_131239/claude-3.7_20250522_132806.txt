Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)
Action 1: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('WOOD', 'WOOD', 'WOOD', 'WOOD', 'ORE'))
Action 2: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('WOOD', 'WOOD', 'WOOD', 'WOOD', 'SHEEP'))
Action 3: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('WOOD', 'WOOD', 'WOOD', 'WOOD', 'WHEAT'))
Action 4: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('WOOD', 'WOOD', 'WOOD', 'WOOD', 'BRICK'))

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
I'll analyze the available actions for your turn in Catan:

**Action 0**: End your turn without taking any other action.

**Actions 1-4**: These are all maritime trade options, trading 4 WOOD for one of:
- ORE (Action 1)
- SHEEP (Action 2)
- WHEAT (Action 3)
- BRICK (Action 4)

Since all the trade options require 4 WOOD, I need to consider:
1. Whether you have 4 WOOD to trade
2. Which resource would be most valuable to you right now

Without information about your current resources, development plans, or the state of the board, it's difficult to make a fully informed recommendation. However, maritime trading at a 4:1 ratio is generally inefficient unless you really need a specific resource.

If you have 4 WOOD and desperately need one of the resources to build something critical, then trading might make sense. Otherwise, ending your turn (Action 0) would be better than making an inefficient trade.

Since I don't have enough information to determine which resource would be most valuable to you, and 4:1 trades are generally not optimal, I'll recommend ending your turn.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
