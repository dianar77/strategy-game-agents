Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
Looking at the available actions, I only have one option:

Action 0: Roll the dice (BLUE player, ROLL action)

In Catan, rolling the dice is how you initiate resource production for all players. When you roll, any player with settlements or cities adjacent to hexes matching the rolled number will receive resources. This is a fundamental and mandatory action to begin your turn.

Since this is the only available action, there's no strategic decision to make at this moment. You must roll the dice to continue your turn, after which you'll likely have more options such as building, trading, or playing development cards.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
