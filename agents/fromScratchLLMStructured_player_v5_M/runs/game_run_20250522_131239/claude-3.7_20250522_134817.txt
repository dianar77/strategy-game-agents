Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)
Action 1: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUY_DEVELOPMENT_CARD: 'BUY_DEVELOPMENT_CARD'>, value=None)

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
I'll analyze the two available actions in Catan for you:

**Action 0: End Turn**
This action simply concludes your current turn, passing play to the next player. Choosing this would mean you're not making any other moves this turn.

**Action 1: Buy Development Card**
Buying a development card costs 1 sheep, 1 wheat, and 1 ore. Development cards can provide:
- Victory points (kept hidden until game end)
- Knights (to move the robber and steal resources)
- Road building (place two free roads)
- Year of plenty (take any two resources)
- Monopoly (collect all of one resource type from other players)

Without knowing your current resources, victory points, or the state of the board, I need to make assumptions. If you have the required resources to buy a development card, it's generally advantageous to do so because:
1. It could give you immediate help (knight, road building, etc.)
2. It could provide hidden victory points
3. Knights help toward the "Largest Army" bonus (2 VP)

However, if you're short on resources or have specific building plans, saving your resources might be better.

Since you're asking which action to choose, and have the option to buy a development card, I'll assume you have the required resources.

**RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 1**
