Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
I'm helping with your Catan game strategy. Let's analyze your available actions:

**Action 0: Roll the dice**
This is your only available option at the moment. Rolling the dice is how you generate resources in Catan. When you roll, all players with settlements or cities adjacent to hexes matching the roll number will collect corresponding resources.

Since this is the only action available, there's no strategic decision to make about which action to choose - you must roll the dice to continue with your turn.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
