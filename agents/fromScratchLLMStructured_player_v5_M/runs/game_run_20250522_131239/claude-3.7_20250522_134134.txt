Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
I'll analyze each available action to help you make the best strategic decision in Catan.

First, let's understand what the maritime trade actions mean. Each action with MARITIME_TRADE means trading 4 of one resource for 1 of another resource. For example, Action 1 means trading 4 sheep for 1 wood.

Let's evaluate each option:

Action 0: End your turn without making any trades.

Maritime Trade Options:
- Action 1: Trade 4 sheep for 1 wood
- Action 2: Trade 4 wheat for 1 brick
- Action 3: Trade 4 wheat for 1 sheep
- Action 4: Trade 4 sheep for 1 ore
- Action 5: Trade 4 sheep for 1 brick
- Action 6: Trade 4 wheat for 1 wood
- Action 7: Trade 4 sheep for 1 wheat
- Action 8: Trade 4 wheat for 1 ore

Since you have the option to trade both sheep and wheat at a 4:1 ratio, you appear to have at least 4 of each of these resources. 

Without knowing your current game state (victory points, board position, what you're trying to build next), it's difficult to make a perfect recommendation. However, in general:

1. Brick and wood are valuable for roads and settlements
2. Ore and wheat are valuable for cities and development cards
3. Sheep are generally less valuable unless you need development cards

Since you're trading at a 4:1 ratio (which is expensive), you should only do it if you really need a specific resource for an important build.

Action 4 (trading sheep for ore) or Action 5 (trading sheep for brick) are typically good options since sheep are usually less valuable, and ore/brick are often harder to acquire and needed for important builds.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 4
