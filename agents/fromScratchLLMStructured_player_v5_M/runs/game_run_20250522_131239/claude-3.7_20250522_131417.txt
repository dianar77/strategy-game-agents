Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
I need to analyze the available actions for a Catan game. In this case, there's only one action available:

Action 0: End Turn (Color: BLUE)

Since this is the only available action, there are no other options to compare. This indicates that you've completed all possible moves for your turn, and the only remaining option is to end your turn and allow the next player to go.

In Catan, when it's your turn, you typically:
1. Roll dice for resource production
2. Trade resources with other players or the bank
3. Build roads, settlements, cities, or buy development cards

The fact that your only option is to end your turn suggests you've either completed all desired actions or don't have the resources to perform any additional actions.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
