Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
I only have one available action to consider:

Action 0: End Turn (Color: BLUE)

This is a situation where I have no other choices available. Ending my turn is the only option I can take at this point. This typically happens when:

1. I've already performed all the actions I'm allowed to in this turn (such as building, trading, or playing development cards)
2. I don't have the resources needed to build anything
3. The game is in a state where no other actions are permitted

Since there is only one option available, the decision is straightforward.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
