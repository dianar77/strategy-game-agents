Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
I'm helping you make a strategic decision in Catan. Let's analyze the available action:

**Action 0: Roll the dice (BLUE player)**

This is the only available action at the moment. In Catan, rolling the dice is how you determine which resources are produced on your turn. When you roll, any player with settlements or cities adjacent to hexes with the rolled number will collect corresponding resources.

Since this is the only option available to you as the BLUE player, there's no strategic decision to make regarding alternative actions. Rolling the dice is a fundamental part of your turn in Catan, and it's time to see what resources might be produced.

**Analysis:**
- This is the standard way to begin your turn
- The outcome will determine resource production for all players
- After rolling, you'll likely have additional action options

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
