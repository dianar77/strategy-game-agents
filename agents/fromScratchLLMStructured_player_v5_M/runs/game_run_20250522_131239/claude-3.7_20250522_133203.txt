Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
Looking at the available actions, you only have one option:

Action 0: End your turn (Color BLUE, Action Type END_TURN)

Since this is the only action available to you, there's no strategic decision to be made at this moment. When only the END_TURN option is available, it means you've either already completed all possible actions for your turn, or the game is in a state where you cannot make any other moves (perhaps due to resource constraints or board position).

Without additional information about your current game state (resources, board position, etc.), I can only recommend taking the only action available to you, which is to end your turn and allow the game to proceed to the next player.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
