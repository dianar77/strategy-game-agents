Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
I'll analyze the available actions for this Catan turn.

There is only one action available:
- Action 0: End your turn (Color: BLUE, Action Type: END_TURN)

Since there is only one option available, you must end your turn. This means you've already completed all possible moves for this turn (building settlements/cities/roads, playing development cards, trading, etc.) or you don't have the resources to take any other actions.

When there's only the END_TURN option available, it means the game is waiting for you to finish your current turn so the next player can proceed.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
