You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)
Action 1: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'SHEEP'))
Action 2: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'BRICK'))
Action 3: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'WOOD'))
Action 4: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'ORE'))

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
I'll analyze the available actions for your Catan turn:

Action 0: End your turn without making any trades.
Actions 1-4: Trade 4 wheat for 1 of another resource (sheep, brick, wood, or ore respectively).

To make a recommendation, I need to consider:
1) How valuable wheat is to you currently
2) Which resource would be most beneficial to receive
3) Whether trading 4:1 is worth it at this stage of the game

Trading 4 wheat for 1 of any resource is quite expensive. This suggests you don't have any ports that would allow for better trade ratios. However, if you urgently need a specific resource to build something important (like a settlement, city, or development card), it might be worth the cost.

Without knowing your current building plans, resource inventory, or board position, I can only make a general recommendation. Typically:
- If you have excess wheat (5+ cards) and urgently need a specific resource
- If you're at risk of losing cards to a robber (7+ cards total)
- If you need one specific resource to make a critical build

Then making a trade could be worthwhile. Otherwise, ending your turn might be better.

Since I don't have enough context about your specific game situation, I'll recommend the most conservative option.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
