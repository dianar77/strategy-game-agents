Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
I need to analyze the available actions for a player in Catan. In this case, there's only one option:

Action 0: End Turn (Color: BLUE)

When there's only one action available, the decision is straightforward. The game is indicating that the player has completed all possible actions for their turn and must now end their turn.

Since this is the only available action, the player must choose to end their turn. There are no other options to compare or strategic decisions to weigh at this moment.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
