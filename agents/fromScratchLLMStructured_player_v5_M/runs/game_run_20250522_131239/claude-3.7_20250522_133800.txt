Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
I only see one possible action available:

Action 0: Roll the dice (BLUE player, ROLL action)

Since this is the only action available, there's no strategic decision to make at this point. When there's only one available action in Catan, it typically means you're at the beginning of your turn and need to roll the dice to determine resource production before you can take any other actions.

Rolling the dice will determine which hexes produce resources this turn, and then you'll likely have more action choices available afterward (like building roads, settlements, cities, or trading).

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
