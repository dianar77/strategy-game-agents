Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
I'm looking at your available actions for this turn in Catan.

Currently, you only have one option available:
- Action 0: End your turn (BLUE player)

Since this is the only action available, there's nothing to compare or analyze. This typically means you've already completed all possible actions for your turn - perhaps you've already built, traded, or played development cards, and now the game is prompting you to end your turn.

When there's only one available action, the decision is straightforward.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
