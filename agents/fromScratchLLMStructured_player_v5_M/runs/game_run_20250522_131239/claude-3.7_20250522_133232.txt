Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
Looking at the available actions for this turn in Catan, I can see there's only one option:

Action 0: End your turn (Color: BLUE, Action Type: END_TURN)

Since this is the only available action, there are no strategic alternatives to consider. This typically means you have already completed all possible moves for your turn (like trading, building, playing development cards, etc.) or you are unable to make any other moves due to resource limitations.

When there's only an END_TURN action available, the best course is to simply end your turn and let the next player proceed.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
