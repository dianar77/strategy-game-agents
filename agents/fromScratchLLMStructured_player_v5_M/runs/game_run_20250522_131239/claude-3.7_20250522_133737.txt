Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
Looking at the available actions for this player turn, I have only one option:

Action 0: End Turn (Color: BLUE)

This is the only action available, which means the player has already completed all possible moves for their turn (building settlements/cities, playing development cards, trading, etc.) or has no valid moves to make at this point.

Since there are no other options to consider or analyze, the player must end their turn to allow the game to continue.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
