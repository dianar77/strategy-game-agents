Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
Looking at your available actions for Catan, I notice you only have one option available:

Action 0: End your turn (Color: BLUE, Action Type: END_TURN)

Since this is the only action available to you, it means you've already completed all possible moves for your current turn (like building roads, settlements, cities, or trading). At this point, ending your turn is your only choice.

When you have only the END_TURN action available, it generally means:
- You've already used your building opportunities for this turn
- You've completed any trades you wanted to make
- You've played any development cards you wished to play

Without other options to consider, the decision is straightforward in this case.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
