Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(8, 27))
Action 1: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(26, 27))
Action 2: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(27, 28))

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
I'll analyze each road building option for the Blue player in Catan:

**Action 0: Build Road (8, 27)**
This would connect node 8 to node 27, extending your network toward what appears to be the edge of the board. Without seeing the full board state, it's hard to determine if this road leads toward valuable building spots or resources. This could be useful if you're trying to reach new settlement locations in that direction.

**Action 1: Build Road (26, 27)**
This would connect node 26 to node 27, likely creating a connection between existing parts of your network. This could be valuable for consolidating your position and potentially working toward the longest road achievement.

**Action 2: Build Road (27, 28)**
This would connect node 27 to node 28, extending your network in what appears to be a different direction from Action 0. This might open up new settlement opportunities in another area of the board.

Without more information about the board state (such as existing settlements, resource production, or opponents' positions), it's difficult to make a fully informed recommendation. However, in general, roads that connect to potential new settlement locations or that help secure the longest road bonus would be most valuable.

Based on the limited information, building roads that extend your network to new areas often provides more opportunities than roads that simply connect existing parts of your network.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 2
