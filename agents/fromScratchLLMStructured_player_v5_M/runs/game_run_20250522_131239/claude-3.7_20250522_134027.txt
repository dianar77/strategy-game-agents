Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
Looking at the available actions, there's only one option presented:

Action 0: End turn (Color BLUE)

This is a very straightforward decision since there is only one action available. When only the END_TURN action is available, it means you've completed all possible moves for your current turn, or you have no valid moves to make.

Since Action 0 is the only option, you should choose it to end your turn and allow the game to progress to the next player.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
