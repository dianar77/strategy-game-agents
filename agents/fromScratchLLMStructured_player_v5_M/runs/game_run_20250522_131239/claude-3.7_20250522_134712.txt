Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
I only see one available action for the player:

Action 0: Roll the dice (BLUE player, ROLL action)

Since this is the only available action, there's no strategic decision to make here. The player simply needs to proceed with rolling the dice, which will determine resource production for all players based on the roll outcome.

Rolling the dice is the standard way to begin a turn in Catan, and since this is the only action available, the player must take this action to continue the game.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
