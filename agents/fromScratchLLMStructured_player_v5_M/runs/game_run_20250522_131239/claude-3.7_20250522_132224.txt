Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
I see that there is only one available action for you in this turn of Catan:

Action 0: End your turn (Color: BLUE, Action Type: END_TURN)

Since this is the only option available to you, it indicates that you've already completed all possible actions for your turn (like building, trading, or playing development cards) or you cannot perform any other actions at this time. This commonly happens when:

1. You've already built/traded everything you wanted to for this turn
2. You don't have the necessary resources to perform any other actions
3. You've already rolled the dice and completed the main part of your turn

In Catan, when you have no more moves to make during your turn, ending your turn is the appropriate choice so the next player can begin their turn.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
