Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
I only have one option available: ending my turn. Since there are no other choices to analyze, this is straightforward.

Action 0: End my turn (Action Type: END_TURN). This will conclude my current turn and allow the next player to begin theirs. Since this is the only available action, there's nothing else I can do during this turn.

Since there are no alternative actions to consider, I must end my turn.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
