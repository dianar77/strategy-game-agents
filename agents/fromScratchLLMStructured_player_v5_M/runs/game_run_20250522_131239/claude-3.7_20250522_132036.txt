Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)
Action 1: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('WOOD', 'WOOD', 'WOOD', None, 'SHEEP'))
Action 2: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('WOOD', 'WOOD', 'WOOD', None, 'WHEAT'))
Action 3: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('WOOD', 'WOOD', 'WOOD', None, 'BRICK'))
Action 4: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('WOOD', 'WOOD', 'WOOD', None, 'ORE'))

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
I'll analyze the available actions for you in this Catan game:

**Action 0: End Turn**
- This would simply end your turn without taking any further actions.
- Choosing this means you're satisfied with your current position and don't want to trade resources.

**Actions 1-4: Maritime Trade Options**
All these options involve trading 3 Wood for 1 of another resource:
- Action 1: Trade 3 Wood for 1 Sheep
- Action 2: Trade 3 Wood for 1 Wheat
- Action 3: Trade 3 Wood for 1 Brick
- Action 4: Trade 3 Wood for 1 Ore

To make a recommendation, I would need to know:
1. What resources you currently have
2. What you're planning to build next
3. What resources are scarce on your accessible hexes

Without that specific information, I can only provide general guidance:
- Trade for Ore or Brick if you're planning to build a city or road
- Trade for Wheat if you need it for settlements or development cards
- Trade for Sheep if you need it for development cards or settlements

Since you're willing to trade away 3 Wood, it suggests you have excess Wood but need other resources. The 3:1 maritime trade rate indicates you don't have a 2:1 Wood port, making this an expensive trade.

Given the limited information available, the most valuable resources in Catan are typically Ore and Brick, so Actions 3 or 4 would generally be preferred, with a slight edge to Ore (Action 4) since it's needed for cities and development cards.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 4
