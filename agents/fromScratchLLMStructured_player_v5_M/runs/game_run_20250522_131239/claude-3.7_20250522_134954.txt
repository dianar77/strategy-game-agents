Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
I can see that you have only one available action in this game of Catan, which is to end your turn.

Let's analyze this situation:

Action 0: End Turn (Color: BLUE)
- This is your only available option
- Since there are no other actions listed (like building roads, settlements, cities, or trading), it suggests you either:
  * Don't have the resources needed for any builds
  * Have already completed all the actions you wanted to take this turn
  * Are in a phase of the game where ending your turn is the appropriate next step

Since there are no alternatives to consider, the decision is straightforward. You should end your turn and let the next player take their turn.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
