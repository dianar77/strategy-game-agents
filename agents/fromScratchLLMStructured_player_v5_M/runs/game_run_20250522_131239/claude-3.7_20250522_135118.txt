Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
I only see one available action:

Action 0: End Turn (BLUE player)

Since there's only one action available to you, there's no strategic decision to make at this moment. You must end your turn and pass play to the next player.

When you only have the END_TURN action available, it means you've either:
1) Already completed all possible actions for your turn
2) Don't have the resources or valid placements for building anything
3) Just rolled the dice and received resources but can't build anything with what you have

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
