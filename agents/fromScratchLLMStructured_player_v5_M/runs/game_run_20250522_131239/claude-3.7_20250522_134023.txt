You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
I'm being asked to help with a Catan game decision, but there's only one action available:

Action 0: Roll the dice (BLUE player)

Since rolling the dice is the only available action, there's no strategic decision to make at this point. Rolling is the standard way to start a turn in Catan - the result will determine which hexes produce resources for players with settlements or cities adjacent to them.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
