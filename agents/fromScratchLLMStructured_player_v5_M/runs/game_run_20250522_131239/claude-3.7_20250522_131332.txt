Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
I'm going to analyze the situation in this Catan game.

Looking at the available actions, there is only one option:
- Action 0: End your turn (Color: BLUE, Action Type: END_TURN)

Since there is only one available action, there's no strategic decision to make in this particular moment. You must end your turn.

When only END_TURN is available, it typically means:
1. You've already completed all possible building/trading actions for this turn
2. Or you don't have the resources to perform any other actions
3. Or it's not your turn to take other actions yet

Without seeing your resources, board position, or other game information, I can only recommend taking the sole available action.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
