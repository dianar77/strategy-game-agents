Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
In this situation, you only have one available action:

Action 0: Roll the dice (BLUE player)

Since there's only one choice available, this is a straightforward decision. Rolling the dice is the standard way to start your turn in Catan. The roll will determine which resource tiles produce resources, and all players with settlements or cities adjacent to those tiles will collect resources.

When you roll, there's a chance for any number 2-12 to come up, with 7 being the most common (which would activate the robber). Numbers 6 and 8 have the highest probability after 7, followed by 5 and 9, then 4 and 10, then 3 and 11, and finally 2 and 12 are least likely.

Since there is no other option available, you should proceed with rolling the dice.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
