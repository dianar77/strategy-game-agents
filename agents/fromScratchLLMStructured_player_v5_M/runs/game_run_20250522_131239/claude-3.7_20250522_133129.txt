Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
Based on the information provided, you only have one available action, which is to end your turn.

Action 0: End Turn (Color: BLUE)
- This is your only available option
- Ending your turn will allow the game to proceed to the next player's turn
- Since there are no other actions available, there are no alternative strategies to consider at this moment

Since there is only one action to choose from, the decision is straightforward.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
