Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
I'll analyze the game situation and available actions for your Catan turn.

You have two basic options:
1. End your turn (Action 0)
2. Conduct maritime trade (Actions 1-8)

Let's examine the maritime trade options:
- Actions 1, 3, 5, 7: Trade 4 WOOD for 1 BRICK/SHEEP/WHEAT/ORE respectively
- Actions 2, 4, 6, 8: Trade 4 ORE for 1 WOOD/BRICK/SHEEP/WHEAT respectively

To determine the best trade, I need to consider:
1. What resources you currently have in excess
2. What resources you need for building
3. Your current strategy and immediate goals

Since you can trade 4-to-1 with either WOOD or ORE, it suggests you have at least 4 of each. These are both valuable resources - WOOD for roads and settlements, ORE for cities and development cards.

Without knowing your exact resource count or board position, I'll make a general recommendation:

If you're focusing on expansion (roads and settlements), getting BRICK (Action 1 or 4) could be most valuable since WOOD+BRICK lets you build roads.

If you're focusing on development (cities and development cards), getting WHEAT (Action 5 or 8) might be more valuable since ORE+WHEAT are needed for cities.

Given the standard Catan strategy often prioritizes early expansion, and BRICK is often a limiting resource:

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 1

This trades 4 WOOD for 1 BRICK, which could potentially allow you to build a road if you already have other BRICK, helping you expand your territory.
