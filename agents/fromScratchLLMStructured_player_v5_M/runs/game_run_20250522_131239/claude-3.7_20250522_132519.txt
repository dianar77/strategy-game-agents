Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
I only see one available action in this situation:

Action 0: Roll the dice (BLUE player)

Since this is the only available action, there's no strategic decision to make at this point in the game. The roll action is the standard way to begin your turn in Catan, determining which resource tiles will produce resources for players with settlements or cities adjacent to them.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
