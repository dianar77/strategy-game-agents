========================================

Response:
I'll analyze each available action for your Catan strategy.

Action 0: End your turn without making any trades.
- This means you keep your current resources for future turns.

Actions 1-4: Maritime trades where you give up 4 wood to receive one resource:
- Action 1: Trade 4 wood for 1 ore
- Action 2: Trade 4 wood for 1 sheep
- Action 3: Trade 4 wood for 1 wheat
- Action 4: Trade 4 wood for 1 brick

These trades aren't very favorable (standard 4:1 maritime ratio), which means you likely don't have a port for better exchange rates. Trading 4 wood for 1 of another resource would only make sense if:
1) You have excess wood
2) You specifically need one of these resources for an immediate build
3) You're concerned about losing resources to a robber if a 7 is rolled

Without knowing your current resource count, victory points, building plans, and board position, it's difficult to recommend a specific trade. However, since the trade ratio is so poor (4:1), it's generally better to wait for a better opportunity unless you have a specific immediate need.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
