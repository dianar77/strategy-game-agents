Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
I need to analyze the possible actions for this Catan turn.

Currently, there's only one action available:
Action 0: Roll the dice (BLUE player's turn to roll)

In Catan, rolling the dice is how players generate resources at the beginning of their turn. This is a mandatory first step before building, trading or playing development cards.

Since there's only one possible action available, the choice is clear. The player needs to roll the dice to see what resources they'll receive this turn based on the number rolled and their settlements/cities adjacent to hexes with that number.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
