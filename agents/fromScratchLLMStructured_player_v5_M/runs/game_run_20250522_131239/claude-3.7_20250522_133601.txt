Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
I need to analyze the available actions for your Catan turn.

In this case, there's only one available action:
- Action 0: Roll the dice (BLUE player)

Since rolling the dice is the standard way to begin your turn in Catan, and it's the only option available to you right now, there's no strategic decision to make at this point. Rolling will determine which resource hexes produce resources on this turn, potentially giving you and other players new resources.

After rolling, you'll likely have more action choices depending on the roll outcome and your current resources.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
