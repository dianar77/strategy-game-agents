Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
Looking at the available actions, there's actually only one option available to you:

Action 0: Roll the dice (ROLL action for the BLUE player)

This is the standard way to start your turn in Catan. When you roll the dice, all players who have settlements or cities adjacent to hexes with the rolled number will collect the corresponding resource cards.

Since this is the only available action, there's no strategic decision to make at this moment. You need to roll the dice and see what resources might be produced before you can decide on your next moves like building, trading, or playing development cards.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
