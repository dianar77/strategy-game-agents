Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
I see that there's only one available action for the Blue player, which is to roll the dice.

In Catan, rolling the dice is how you determine which hexes produce resources on each turn. When you roll, any player with settlements or cities adjacent to hexes matching the rolled number will receive resources from those hexes.

Since this is the only action available, there's really no strategic decision to make at this point in the game. You need to proceed by rolling the dice to move the game forward.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
