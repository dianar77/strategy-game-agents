Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
I see that the only available action is to end your turn. Since there are no other options to consider, the strategic decision is straightforward.

In Catan, ending your turn happens after you've completed all your desired actions for your turn, such as building roads, settlements, cities, or purchasing development cards. Since this is the only action available, it means you've either already done everything you wanted to do this turn, or you don't have the resources to take any other actions.

Without additional context about your current game state (such as resources in hand, board position, etc.), I can only recommend taking the one available action.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
