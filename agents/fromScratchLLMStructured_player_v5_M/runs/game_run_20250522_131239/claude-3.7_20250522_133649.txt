You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
I'm analyzing the available actions for your Catan turn.

Currently, there is only one available action:
- Action 0: Roll the dice (BLUE player's turn to roll)

In Catan, rolling the dice is the standard way to start your turn (unless you have development cards you want to play first, but that doesn't appear to be an option here). When you roll, resource production will occur based on the result.

Since there's only one action available, the choice is straightforward.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
