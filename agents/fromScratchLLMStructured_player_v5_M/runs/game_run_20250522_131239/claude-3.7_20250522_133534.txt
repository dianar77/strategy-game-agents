You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)
Action 1: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(9, 10))
Action 2: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(0, 20))
Action 3: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(2, 3))
Action 4: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(8, 9))
Action 5: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(0, 5))
Action 6: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(1, 6))

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
I'll analyze each available action to help you make the best strategic decision in Catan.

**Action 0: End Turn**
- This would end your turn without using your resources to build anything
- Generally not optimal if you have resources to build roads

**Action 1: Build Road at (9, 10)**
- Need to evaluate where this road is on the board and what expansion opportunities it provides
- Could be valuable if it extends toward unoccupied resource-rich areas or potential settlement spots

**Action 2: Build Road at (0, 20)**
- Need to understand if this connects to your existing network
- Could be valuable for expanding to new resources or blocking opponents

**Action 3: Build Road at (2, 3)**
- Similar evaluation needed for strategic value
- Potential for settlement locations or Longest Road points

**Action 4: Build Road at (8, 9)**
- Need to evaluate connectivity to existing roads and potential future expansion

**Action 5: Build Road at (0, 5)**
- Need to evaluate position on the board relative to your existing infrastructure
- Could potentially connect valuable areas

**Action 6: Build Road at (1, 6)**
- Similar evaluation needed for strategic value

Without seeing the current board state, exact resource availability, or the position of these coordinates relative to settlements and other players, it's difficult to make the optimal recommendation.

However, building roads is generally preferable to ending your turn without using resources, as roads provide opportunities for future settlements and cities, which generate victory points.

Given the limited information and assuming you have the resources to build a road, I would recommend building one that extends your network toward valuable resources or potential settlement locations.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 1
