# Catan Strategy Analysis

Let me analyze your available actions in this situation:

**Current Options:**
- Action 0: End your turn
- Actions 1-4: Trade 4 WOOD for either ORE, SHEEP, WHEAT, or BRICK through maritime trade

To make the best decision, I need to consider what resources would be most valuable for you right now. Since you're trading away 4 WOOD (a high cost), you should only do this if you:
1. Have excess WOOD
2. Urgently need another resource for building

Without knowing your current hand composition, building plans, or board state, I can't definitively say which resource would be most valuable. However, I can rank the typical value of resources:

- ORE is typically very valuable for city upgrades and development cards
- BRICK is essential for roads and settlements
- WHEAT is versatile, needed for settlements, cities, and development cards
- SHEEP is generally less valuable unless you specifically need development cards

Since you only have the option to end your turn or trade WOOD at an expensive 4:1 ratio, I recommend:

**RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0**

The 4:1 trade ratio is quite inefficient, and unless you have a specific need for another resource to make an immediate build, ending your turn is likely better than depleting your WOOD supply at such a high cost.
