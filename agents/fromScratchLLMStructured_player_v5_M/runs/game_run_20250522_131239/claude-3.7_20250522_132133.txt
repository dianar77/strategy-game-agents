Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(1, 2))
Action 1: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(2, 3))
Action 2: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(2, 9))

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"

Response:
# Analyzing Catan Road Building Options

I'll analyze each of the three road building options to determine which provides the most strategic advantage.

## Action 0: Build Road at (1, 2)
This would connect from node 1 to node 2. Without seeing the full board configuration, I need to consider what this might achieve:
- Is this extending your existing road network?
- Does it move toward valuable unoccupied intersections?
- Does it block an opponent's potential expansion?

## Action 1: Build Road at (2, 3)
This connects from node 2 to node 3, which appears to be extending from the area where Action 0 would end. This suggests:
- This could be part of a path toward a strategic settlement location
- May be connecting through node 2 which is a key junction

## Action 2: Build Road at (2, 9)
This connects from node 2 to node 9, which moves in a different direction from Action 1. This indicates:
- Node 2 appears to be an important junction with multiple possible extensions
- This road heads in a direction that might access different resources

Without seeing the full board state, the most strategic approach would typically be to:
1. Connect toward high-value building spots (good resource combinations)
2. Block opponents' expansion paths
3. Work toward longest road

Based on the fact that node 2 appears in all options, it seems to be a central junction point. Building in a direction that opens up the most future possibilities would be optimal.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 2
