Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
I need to analyze the available actions for this Catan turn.

Currently, there is only one action available:
- Action 0: Roll the dice (BLUE player's turn to roll)

In Catan, rolling the dice is the standard way to begin your turn. The roll determines which hexes produce resources for all players who have settlements or cities adjacent to those hexes. Since this is the only action available, there's no strategic decision to make here regarding which action to choose.

The player should roll the dice and then evaluate their options based on what resources they and other players receive from the roll.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
