Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
I'll help you analyze the available actions for your Catan game.

Currently, there is only one available action:
- Action 0: Roll the dice (BLUE player's turn to roll)

In Catan, rolling the dice is how you determine which resource-producing hexes will generate resources on a given turn. This is typically the first action you take on your turn (unless you have development cards you want to play before rolling).

Since there is only one available action, there's no strategic decision to make at this moment. You need to roll the dice to continue your turn.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
