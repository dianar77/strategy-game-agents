Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)
Action 1: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'SHEEP'))
Action 2: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'BRICK'))
Action 3: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'WOOD'))
Action 4: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'ORE'))

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
I'll analyze each of your available actions in this Catan scenario.

**Action 0**: End your turn without making any trades. This would be appropriate if you don't need any resources right now or prefer to hold onto your wheat.

**Actions 1-4**: These are all maritime trades where you're giving up 4 wheat to receive 1 of another resource:
- Action 1: Trade 4 wheat for 1 sheep
- Action 2: Trade 4 wheat for 1 brick
- Action 3: Trade 4 wheat for 1 wood
- Action 4: Trade 4 wheat for 1 ore

The 4:1 maritime trade ratio is quite expensive. To determine the best option, I'd need to know:
- What you're planning to build next (road, settlement, city, development card)
- What resources you already have
- What your position on the board is

Without that information, it's difficult to make a strong recommendation. However, if you have excess wheat and need a specific resource to complete a build:
- Brick or wood would help with roads or settlements
- Ore is critical for cities and development cards
- Sheep is needed for settlements and development cards

Since I don't have your full game state, and a 4:1 trade is quite expensive (usually better options exist like 3:1 or 2:1 ports), I would recommend:

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0

This preserves your resources until you can make a more efficient trade, or until you have a clearer building goal that requires a specific resource.
