Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
In this case, you only have one available action: rolling the dice (Action 0). 

In Catan, rolling the dice is the standard way to start your turn (unless you have development cards you want to play first). The roll will determine which resource-producing hexes activate, potentially giving resources to players who have settlements or cities adjacent to those hexes.

Since this is your only option, there's no strategic decision to make at this moment - you need to roll the dice to proceed with your turn.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
