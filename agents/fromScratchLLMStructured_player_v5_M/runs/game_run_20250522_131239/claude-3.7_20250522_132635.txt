Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
I see that you're playing a game of Catan and need to make a strategic decision, but there's only one available action:

Action 0: Roll the dice (BLUE player, ROLL action)

Since this is the only action available to you, there's no strategic decision to make at this point. In Catan, rolling the dice is how you begin your turn and determine which resources are produced. All players who have settlements or cities adjacent to hexes with the rolled number will receive resources.

After rolling, you'll likely have more action choices like building roads, settlements, cities, or trading resources.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
