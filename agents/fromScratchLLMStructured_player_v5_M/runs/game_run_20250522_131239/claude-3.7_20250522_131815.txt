Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)
Action 1: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('ORE', 'ORE', 'ORE', None, 'WOOD'))
Action 2: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('ORE', 'ORE', 'ORE', None, 'SHEEP'))
Action 3: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('ORE', 'ORE', 'ORE', None, 'WHEAT'))
Action 4: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('ORE', 'ORE', 'ORE', None, 'BRICK'))

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
I'll analyze the available actions to help you make the best decision in your Catan game.

**Current Options:**
- Action 0: End your turn
- Actions 1-4: Trade 3 ore for either wood, sheep, wheat, or brick

To make a recommendation, I need to consider what resources would be most valuable for you right now. Since I don't have detailed information about your current board position, victory points, or what you're trying to build next, I'll analyze these options based on general Catan strategy.

**Analysis:**
- If you have excess ore (more than 3 pieces) and absolutely need another resource to build something immediately, trading might make sense
- However, trading 3:1 is generally inefficient - you're losing significant resource value
- If you don't urgently need another resource, it's usually better to keep your ore for future development cards, cities, or potential better trades

Without knowing your immediate building goals or resource distribution, ending your turn (Action 0) is likely the most prudent move. Ore is a valuable resource for cities and development cards, and trading 3 ore for 1 of another resource is usually not efficient unless you have a very specific and urgent need.

**RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0**
