You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)
Action 1: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(9, 10))
Action 2: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(1, 2))
Action 3: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(0, 20))
Action 4: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(2, 3))
Action 5: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(8, 9))
Action 6: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(0, 5))
Action 7: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(1, 6))

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
I'll analyze each available action for your Catan strategy:

**Action 0: End Turn**
- This would mean not using your available resources to build anything.
- Generally not optimal if you have the resources to build roads.

**Actions 1-7: Build Road options**
Let me analyze each road building location:

**Action 1: Build Road (9, 10)**
- Need to see where this extends your network and what resources/building spots it might access.

**Action 2: Build Road (1, 2)**
- Could be expanding toward new settlement locations.

**Action 3: Build Road (0, 20)**
- This likely connects to the edge of the board at node 20.

**Action 4: Build Road (2, 3)**
- Continues expansion in sequence from nodes 1→2→3.

**Action 5: Build Road (8, 9)**
- Connects to the road that would be built in Action 1.

**Action 6: Build Road (0, 5)**
- Expands in a different direction from node 0.

**Action 7: Build Road (1, 6)**
- Creates expansion options from node 1.

Without seeing the full board state, the best choices appear to be actions that extend your network toward valuable resources or potential settlement locations. Actions 2 and 4 look promising as they appear to create a consecutive path (1→2→3), which could lead toward a good settlement spot or prepare for longest road.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 2
