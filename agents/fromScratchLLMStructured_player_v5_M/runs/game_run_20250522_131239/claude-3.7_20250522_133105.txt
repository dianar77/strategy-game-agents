Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.DISCARD: 'DISCARD'>, value=None)

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
In this situation, you only have one available action, which is to discard cards as the Blue player.

When the discard action appears in Catan, it typically means a 7 was rolled and you have more than 7 cards in your hand, requiring you to discard half of them (rounded down). This is a mandatory action - you must discard when required by the game rules.

Since there is only one action available:
- Action 0: Discard cards as the Blue player

There's no decision to make here as you must follow the game rules and discard the required number of cards. When you select this action, you'll likely be prompted separately to choose which specific resource cards to discard.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
