Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
Looking at the available actions for your turn in Catan, I can see that you only have one option:

Action 0: End your turn (Color: BLUE, Action Type: END_TURN)

Since this is the only action available to you right now, there are no strategic choices to be made at this moment. This typically happens when:
- You've already completed all possible building or trading actions for this turn
- You've just rolled the dice and no resources were produced or you can't use the resources you have
- It's not actually your turn to make any other type of move

Without seeing the full game state, I cannot analyze why no other options are available, but the only valid move is to end your turn and pass play to the next player.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
