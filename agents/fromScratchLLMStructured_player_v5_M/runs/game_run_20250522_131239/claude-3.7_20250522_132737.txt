Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
I notice there's only one available action here:

Action 0: Roll the dice (BLUE player, ROLL action)

In Catan, rolling the dice is the standard way to begin your turn (unless you have special cards to play before rolling). Rolling generates resources for all players who have settlements or cities adjacent to hexes matching the roll number.

Since this is the only available action, there's no strategic decision to make at this moment. You need to roll the dice to proceed with your turn.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
