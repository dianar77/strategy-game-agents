Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)
Action 1: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_CITY: 'BUILD_CITY'>, value=2)

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
I'll analyze each available action for your Catan game and recommend the best choice.

**Action 0: End Turn**
- This would simply end your turn without using any resources or gaining any advantages.
- You would pass the turn to the next player without improving your position.
- This is generally only the best choice when you have no good building options or want to save resources for a future turn.

**Action 1: Build a City (at position 2)**
- Building a city upgrades one of your settlements to a city.
- Cities produce double the resources compared to settlements (2 resources instead of 1) when the connected hexes' numbers are rolled.
- Cities are worth 2 victory points (compared to 1 for settlements).
- This would cost you 3 ore and 2 wheat.
- This directly increases your resource production capacity and your victory point total.

Analysis:
Building a city is almost always a strong move in Catan because:
1. It permanently increases your resource income
2. It adds an additional victory point
3. Cities are limited (each player can only build 4), so securing them early is advantageous

Without seeing the full game state (your current resources, victory points, the board layout, etc.), I can still confidently say that if you have the resources to build a city, it's generally better than ending your turn without building anything.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 1
