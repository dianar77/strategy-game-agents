Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
I see that you're playing a game of Catan, and you need to make a decision about your next move. However, there's only one action available to you at this moment:

**Action 0:** End your turn (Color: BLUE, Action Type: END_TURN)

Since this is the only option available, you don't have any strategic decisions to make at this point. This typically happens when:
- You've already completed all the available moves for your turn
- You've already built/traded what you wanted to or could
- It's time to pass play to the next player

When only the END_TURN action is available, it means the game is waiting for you to confirm that you're finished with your turn.

**RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0**
