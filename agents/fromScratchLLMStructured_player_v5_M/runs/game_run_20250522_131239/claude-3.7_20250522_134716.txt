Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
Looking at the available actions, there's actually only one option presented:

**Action 0**: End Turn (Color: BLUE)

Since this is the only action available, you don't have any other choices at this moment. This typically happens when you've already completed all your possible moves for this turn (such as building, trading, playing development cards, etc.) or when there are no valid moves available to you.

In Catan, ending your turn passes play to the next player and is necessary to continue the game. Sometimes the strategic decision is simply recognizing when you've done everything you can in your turn.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
