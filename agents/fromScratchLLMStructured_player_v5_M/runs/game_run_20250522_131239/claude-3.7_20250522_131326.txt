Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
I need to analyze what to do in a game of Catan where the only available action is to roll the dice.

In this situation, there's only one possible choice: rolling the dice (Action 0). 

In Catan, rolling the dice is a fundamental part of the game that initiates resource production. When you roll, all players who have settlements or cities adjacent to hexes matching the roll number receive resources. This is the standard way to start your turn in Catan when you don't have any special actions available.

Since there are no alternative options presented, the decision is straightforward - you must roll the dice to continue with your turn.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
