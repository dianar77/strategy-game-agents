Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
Looking at the available actions, there's only one option presented:

Action 0: End Turn (Color BLUE)

When there's only one available action, the decision is straightforward. Since ending your turn is the only valid move at this point, you should take that action.

This typically means you've already completed all available moves for your turn (such as building roads, settlements, cities, or development cards), or you don't have the resources to take any other actions. Ending your turn will allow the game to progress to the next player.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
