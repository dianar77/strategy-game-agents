You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
Looking at the available actions, there's actually only one option available to you:

Action 0: Roll the dice (BLUE player, ROLL action)

This is a straightforward situation - when it's your turn in Catan and rolling is available, it's always the first step of your turn. Rolling the dice will generate resources for all players who have settlements or cities adjacent to hexes matching the roll number.

Since this is your only available action, there's no strategic decision to make at this point. After rolling, you'll likely have more options available such as building, trading, or playing development cards.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
