Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
I see that you're playing Catan and need to decide which action to take. Let's analyze the available options:

There's only one action available:
- Action 0: Roll the dice (BLUE player, ROLL action)

In Catan, rolling the dice is the standard way to begin your turn, determining which resource-producing hexes will activate. Since this is the only action available, there's no strategic decision to make at this point - you must roll the dice to continue your turn.

After rolling, you'll likely have more meaningful decisions to make depending on what resources you receive and what the board state is.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
