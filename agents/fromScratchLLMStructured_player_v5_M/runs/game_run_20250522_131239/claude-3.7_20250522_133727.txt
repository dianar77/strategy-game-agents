Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)
Action 1: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(0, 20))
Action 2: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(2, 3))
Action 3: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(8, 9))
Action 4: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(0, 5))
Action 5: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(1, 6))

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
I need to evaluate each road-building option strategically to determine which will provide the best advantage for your Blue player.

**Analysis of Available Actions:**

**Action 0:** End Turn - This would forfeit the opportunity to build a road with your available resources.

For the road-building options, I need to consider:
- Which roads extend your network most effectively
- Which roads help you reach valuable building spots
- Which roads block opponents or secure key paths

Let me analyze each road location:

**Action 1:** Build Road at (0, 20)
This would extend your network to the edge of the board. Without seeing the full board, it's difficult to determine if this leads to valuable resources or building spots.

**Action 2:** Build Road at (2, 3)
This appears to be connecting nodes 2 and 3, likely extending your network in the interior of the board.

**Action 3:** Build Road at (8, 9)
This connects nodes 8 and 9, extending your network in what seems to be another direction.

**Action 4:** Build Road at (0, 5)
This connects nodes 0 and 5, potentially creating another path from an existing settlement.

**Action 5:** Build Road at (1, 6)
This connects nodes 1 and 6, expanding your network in yet another direction.

Without seeing the full board state including resource distributions, settlement locations, and opponent positions, it's difficult to make a completely informed decision. However, interior roads (like options 2, 3, 4, and 5) generally offer more flexibility for future expansion than edge roads (like option 1).

Based on the limited information, I would recommend building a road that continues your network toward valuable building spots. Roads in the interior of the board typically provide more options for future expansion.

**RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 2**

This recommendation is based on limited information. With a view of the full board state, resource distributions, and opponent positions, I could provide a more accurate recommendation.
