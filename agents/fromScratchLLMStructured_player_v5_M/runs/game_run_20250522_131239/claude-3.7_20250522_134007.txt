Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
Looking at the available actions, you only have one option:

Action 0: End your turn (ActionType.END_TURN)

This is a situation where you have no other valid moves to make at this point in the game. In Catan, once you've completed all possible building, trading, or development card activities for your turn, ending your turn is the appropriate action to take.

Since there are no alternative actions available, you should end your turn and pass play to the next player.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
