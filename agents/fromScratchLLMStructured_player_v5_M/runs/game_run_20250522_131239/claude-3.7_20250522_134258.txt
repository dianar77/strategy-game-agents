Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
I'll help you analyze your options in Catan, though in this case there's only one available action.

**Analysis:**
You currently have only one option available:
- **Action 0**: Roll the dice (BLUE player)

In Catan, rolling the dice is the standard way to begin your turn. The roll determines which hexes produce resources for all players who have settlements or cities adjacent to those hexes. Rolling is mandatory at the beginning of your turn unless you have special cards that allow you to take different actions before rolling.

Since you only have one option, there's no strategic decision to make at this point. After rolling, you'll likely have more meaningful choices based on the resources you collect and the game state.

**RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0**
