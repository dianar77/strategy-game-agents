========================================

Response:
I'll help you analyze the available actions for your Catan turn.

**Current Options:**
- Action 0: End your turn
- Actions 1-4: Trade 3 ORE for either WOOD, SHEEP, WHEAT, or BRICK using maritime trade

To make a good recommendation, I need to consider what resources would be most valuable for you right now. Since you're trading at a 3:1 ratio, you clearly have at least 3 ORE but might need other resources for building settlements, cities, roads, or development cards.

Looking at the standard building costs:
- Road: 1 BRICK + 1 WOOD
- Settlement: 1 BRICK + 1 WOOD + 1 WHEAT + 1 SHEEP
- City: 2 WHEAT + 3 ORE
- Development card: 1 ORE + 1 WHEAT + 1 SHEEP

Without knowing your exact resource holdings beyond having at least 3 ORE, or your specific game situation (board position, victory points, etc.), it's difficult to make a perfect recommendation.

However, since you're willing to trade away ORE, I assume you don't need it for city building right now. The most versatile choice would be to get a resource that helps with multiple building options.

WOOD or BRICK would help with roads and settlements.
WHEAT would help with settlements, cities, and development cards.
SHEEP would help with settlements and development cards.

Given these considerations, WHEAT tends to be the most versatile resource as it's used in multiple building types.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 3 (Trade 3 ORE for 1 WHEAT)
