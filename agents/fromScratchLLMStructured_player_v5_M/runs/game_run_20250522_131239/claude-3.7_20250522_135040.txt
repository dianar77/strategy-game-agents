Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)
Action 1: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUY_DEVELOPMENT_CARD: 'BUY_DEVELOPMENT_CARD'>, value=None)

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
I'll analyze these available actions for your Catan game:

**Action 0: END_TURN**
This action would end your turn without making any additional moves. This would be appropriate if:
- You don't have enough resources for other actions
- You want to avoid holding too many cards in case a 7 is rolled
- You're saving resources for a specific strategy next turn

**Action 1: BUY_DEVELOPMENT_CARD**
This action would use your resources (1 ore, 1 wheat, 1 sheep) to purchase a development card. Development cards provide:
- Knights: Can move the robber and steal resources (and contribute to Largest Army)
- Victory Points: Hidden victory points until revealed for the win
- Progress Cards: Road Building, Monopoly, or Year of Plenty
- Strategic flexibility and surprise element

Without knowing your current game state (resources, victory points, board position), buying a development card is generally a good strategic option if you can afford it. Development cards add unpredictability to your strategy and can provide critical advantages.

Since these are your only two options and you apparently have the resources to buy a development card, getting a development card is likely the better choice rather than simply ending your turn with no action.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 1
