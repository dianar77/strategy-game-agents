Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD: 'PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD'>, value=None)
Action 1: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
I'll analyze the two available actions for your Catan game:

**Action 0: Play Knight Card**
This action would allow you to:
- Move the robber to a new hex, potentially disrupting other players' resource production
- Steal a random resource card from an adjacent player
- Count toward building the "Largest Army" (which gives 2 victory points if you have 3+ knights)

**Action 1: End Turn**
This simply ends your turn without taking any additional actions.

Without knowing more about the current game state (like where the robber is, who has the Largest Army, what resources other players are collecting, or your current victory points), it's hard to make the optimal recommendation.

However, generally speaking, playing a Knight card is usually more beneficial than simply ending your turn, as it:
1. Disrupts opponents' resource generation
2. Gives you a free resource
3. Advances your progress toward Largest Army

Unless you have a strategic reason to save the Knight card for later (like you're planning a big development card play next turn), the better option is usually to play the Knight.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
