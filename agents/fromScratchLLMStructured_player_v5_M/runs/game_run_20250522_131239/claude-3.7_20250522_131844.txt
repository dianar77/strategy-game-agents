Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
Looking at the available actions for your Catan game, I notice there's only a single option:

Action 0: End your turn (BLUE player)

Since there are no other actions available to you at this moment, this indicates you've likely already completed all possible moves for your current turn (such as building settlements/roads, trading, playing development cards, etc.).

When there's only an END_TURN action available, it means the game is waiting for you to conclude your turn so the next player can begin theirs.

Without any alternatives to analyze, the decision is straightforward - you need to end your turn.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
