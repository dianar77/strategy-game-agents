Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD: 'PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD'>, value=None)
Action 1: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
I'll help you analyze these two available options in Catan.

**Action 0: Play Knight Card**
Playing a Knight card provides several benefits:
- Move the robber to any hex, blocking resource production and potentially stealing a resource card from an opponent
- Counts toward building the "Largest Army" special victory point card (2 VP)
- Prevents any negative outcome from the upcoming dice roll (like a 7, which would trigger the robber and potentially make you discard cards)
- Strategic robber placement can disrupt opponents' resource generation

**Action 1: Roll the Dice**
Rolling the dice is the standard move to begin your turn:
- Could generate resources for you and other players based on settlements/cities
- Risks rolling a 7, which activates the robber and forces players with >7 cards to discard half
- Proceeds with the normal flow of your turn

**Analysis:**
Without knowing more context (like how many cards you have, if you're close to getting Largest Army, the board state, etc.), I would generally recommend playing the Knight card first. This gives you control over the robber's placement and allows you to potentially steal a resource, which is more proactive than just rolling the dice.

Playing the Knight card also protects you from potentially rolling a 7, which could force you to discard cards if you have more than 7 resources. After playing the Knight card, you would still get to roll the dice afterward.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
