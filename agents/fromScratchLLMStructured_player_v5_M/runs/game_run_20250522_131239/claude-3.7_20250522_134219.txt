Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
Looking at the available actions, you only have one option:

Action 0: End your turn (Color: BLUE, Action Type: END_TURN)

Since this is your only available action, there's no strategic decision to make at this moment. This typically means you've already completed all the possible actions for your turn (like building roads, settlements, cities, or trading), or you don't have the resources to take any other actions.

When you only have the END_TURN option, it's time to pass the turn to the next player and wait for your next opportunity.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
