Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
Looking at the available actions for your Catan turn, there is only one option presented:

Action 0: Roll the dice (BLUE player, ROLL action)

In Catan, rolling the dice is the standard way to begin your turn, determining which hexes produce resources for all players. Since this is your only available action, there's no strategic decision to make at this moment.

Rolling will trigger resource production based on the number rolled, and after that, you'll likely have more action options (building, trading, playing development cards, etc.).

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
