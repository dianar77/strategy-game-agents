Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
Looking at the available actions for this turn in Catan, I can see that there is only one option:

Action 0: End your turn (Color BLUE)

Since this is the only available action, it indicates that you've either:
1. Already completed all possible moves for this turn (building roads, settlements, cities, buying development cards, etc.)
2. Don't have the resources to do anything else
3. Have reached a point in the game phase where ending your turn is the only valid move

Without any alternatives to consider, the strategic choice here is straightforward. You should end your turn and prepare for your next opportunity to build or trade.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
