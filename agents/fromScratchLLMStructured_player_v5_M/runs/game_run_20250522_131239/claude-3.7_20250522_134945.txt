Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
I only have one option to analyze here:

Action 0: End Turn (BLUE player)
This is the only action available to you right now, which means you've completed all possible moves for this turn. When END_TURN is the only option, it indicates that you've already placed buildings, traded resources, played development cards, or performed other actions that were available to you this turn.

Since this is your only option, the decision is straightforward - you need to end your turn and allow the next player to take their turn.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
