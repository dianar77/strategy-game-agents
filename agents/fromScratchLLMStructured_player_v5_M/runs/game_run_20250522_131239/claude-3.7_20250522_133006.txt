Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
I only have one action available, which is to roll the dice. In Catan, rolling is how resources are generated each turn, so this is a necessary and straightforward choice when it's available.

Since rolling the dice is my only option (Action 0), I should proceed with this action. This will determine which hexes produce resources this turn based on the number rolled.

Without any alternative actions to evaluate, there's no strategic decision to make at this point in the game.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
