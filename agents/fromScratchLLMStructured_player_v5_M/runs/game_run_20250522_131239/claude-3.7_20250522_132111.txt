Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(0, 1))
Action 1: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(0, 20))
Action 2: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(0, 5))

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"

# Analyzing Catan Road Building Options

Looking at the three road building options for the blue player, I'll analyze the strategic implications of each.

## Action 0: Build Road at (0, 1)
This would create a road connection between nodes 0 and 1. Without seeing the full board, I can't determine exactly where this is located or what resources it might help access. However, node positions with low numbers are typically near the starting positions.

## Action 1: Build Road at (0, 20)
This connects node 0 to node 20. The higher node number (20) suggests this road might extend further from the starting area, potentially reaching toward new resource hexes or opening expansion opportunities. However, it might be a more ambitious extension that doesn't provide immediate benefits.

## Action 2: Build Road at (0, 5)
This connects node 0 to node 5. Like Action 0, this appears to be building in the vicinity of what might be your starting settlement (assuming node 0 has one of your settlements). The low node numbers suggest this is building in your initial area.

Without seeing the complete board state (including resource distributions, other players' positions, and your current settlements), I have limited information to make a fully informed recommendation.

In general, early road building in Catan should focus on:
1. Expansion toward valuable resource hexes
2. Blocking opponents' expansion paths
3. Working toward the longest road
4. Setting up future settlement locations

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0

Note: With more information about the board state, I could provide a more tailored recommendation.
