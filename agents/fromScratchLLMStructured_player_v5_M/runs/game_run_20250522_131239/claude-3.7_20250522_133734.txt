You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
Looking at the available actions for your Catan game, there's only a single option available:

**Action 0**: Roll the dice (BLUE player, ROLL action)

In Catan, rolling the dice is how you begin your turn and determine which resource hexes produce resources for all players. This is a mandatory first step of your turn (unless you have special development cards that allow for different initial actions, which doesn't appear to be the case here).

Since there are no other options available, you must roll the dice to proceed with your turn. After rolling, you'll likely have more actions available based on the outcome of the roll and your current position in the game.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
