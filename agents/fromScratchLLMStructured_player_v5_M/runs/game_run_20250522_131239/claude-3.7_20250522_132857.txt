========================================

Response:
Looking at your available actions, I need to determine the best strategic move for you in Catan.

You have 5 options:
- Action 0: End your turn without doing anything
- Actions 1-4: Trade 4 wood for either ore, sheep, wheat, or brick

To make the best decision, I need to consider what resources would be most valuable for you right now. Since your only trade options involve giving up 4 wood for 1 of another resource, this indicates:
1) You have at least 4 wood cards
2) You likely don't have a wood port (which would allow 2:1 trades)
3) You're considering if any other resource is worth this expensive 4:1 trade

Trading 4 wood for 1 of another resource is generally inefficient, so it should only be done if you urgently need a specific resource to make an important build (like a settlement, city, or development card).

Without knowing your specific game state (your current buildings, resources, victory points, or immediate goals), the default recommendation would be to avoid making such expensive trades unless absolutely necessary.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
