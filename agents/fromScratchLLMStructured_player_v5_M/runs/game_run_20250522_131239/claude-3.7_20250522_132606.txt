Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
I need to help you choose the best action in Catan. Let me analyze the available actions.

Currently, there is only one available action:
- Action 0: Roll the dice (BLUE player)

Since this is the only action available to you as the BLUE player, there's no strategic decision to make at this moment. Rolling the dice is the standard way to begin your turn in Catan, which will determine resource production for all players.

Rolling will generate resources for players who have settlements or cities adjacent to hexes matching the dice roll number. After rolling, you'll likely have more options available such as building roads, settlements, cities, or trading.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
