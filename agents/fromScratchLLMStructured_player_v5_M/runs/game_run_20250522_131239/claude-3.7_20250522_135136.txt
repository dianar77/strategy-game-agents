Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
I'll help you with this decision in Catan.

Looking at the available actions, there is only one option:
- Action 0: End your turn (Color BLUE)

Since there is only one possible action available, the choice is straightforward. You don't have any other options like building roads, settlements, cities, or trading resources at this moment. This suggests that either you don't have the necessary resources for building anything, or you've already completed all the actions you wanted to take during this turn.

In Catan, when you've completed all the desired actions for your turn (or cannot perform any more actions), ending your turn is the appropriate move to allow the game to progress.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
