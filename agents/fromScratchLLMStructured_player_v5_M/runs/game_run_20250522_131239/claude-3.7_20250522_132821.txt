Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)
Action 1: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('WOOD', 'WOOD', 'WOOD', 'WOOD', 'ORE'))
Action 2: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('WOOD', 'WOOD', 'WOOD', 'WOOD', 'SHEEP'))
Action 3: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('WOOD', 'WOOD', 'WOOD', 'WOOD', 'WHEAT'))
Action 4: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('WOOD', 'WOOD', 'WOOD', 'WOOD', 'BRICK'))

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
I'll analyze each available action for your Catan turn:

Action 0: END_TURN
This would simply end your turn without making any trades or plays.

Actions 1-4: MARITIME_TRADE options
All of these actions involve trading 4 WOOD for another resource:
- Action 1: Trade 4 WOOD for 1 ORE
- Action 2: Trade 4 WOOD for 1 SHEEP
- Action 3: Trade 4 WOOD for 1 WHEAT
- Action 4: Trade 4 WOOD for 1 BRICK

To evaluate these options, I need to consider:
1. You have at least 4 WOOD available to trade
2. The 4:1 maritime trade is generally expensive - this suggests you don't have a better harbor trade ratio for wood
3. You must really need one of these resources to make this expensive trade worthwhile

Without knowing your current hand, resources needed for your next build, or the game state, I can only make a general recommendation:

If you need a specific resource urgently to build something important (like preventing another player from winning), then trade for that resource.

Otherwise, ending your turn may be better than making an expensive 4:1 trade that doesn't immediately help your position.

Given the limited information and that 4:1 trades are typically used only when necessary, I'll recommend:

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
