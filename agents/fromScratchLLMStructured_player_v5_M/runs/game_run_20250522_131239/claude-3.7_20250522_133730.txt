Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
In this situation, you only have one possible action available: to end your turn.

Since this is the only option available, there's no strategic decision to make at this moment. You must end your turn and pass play to the next player.

Action 0 is to end your turn, indicated by the ActionType.END_TURN value. Your color is Blue, and there is no additional value associated with this action.

When there's only one available action, it means you've likely completed all the actions you can take during your turn, such as trading, building, or playing development cards.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
