Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
Looking at the available actions, you only have one option:

Action 0: Roll the dice (BLUE player, ROLL action)

In Catan, rolling the dice is how you generate resources at the start of your turn. This initiates resource production for all players based on the settlements and cities adjacent to hexes matching the dice roll.

Since this is your only available action, there's no strategic decision to make at this moment. You need to roll the dice to proceed with your turn.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
