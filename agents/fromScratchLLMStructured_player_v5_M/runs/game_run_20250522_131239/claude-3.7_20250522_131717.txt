Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)
Action 1: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('ORE', 'ORE', 'ORE', None, 'WOOD'))
Action 2: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('ORE', 'ORE', 'ORE', None, 'SHEEP'))
Action 3: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('ORE', 'ORE', 'ORE', None, 'WHEAT'))
Action 4: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('ORE', 'ORE', 'ORE', None, 'BRICK'))

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
I'll analyze each available action for your Catan turn:

**Action 0: End Turn**
- This simply ends your turn without any further actions.
- You'd keep all your current resources for the next turn.

**Actions 1-4: Maritime Trade Options**
All of these involve trading 3 ore for another resource:
- Action 1: Trade 3 ore for 1 wood
- Action 2: Trade 3 ore for 1 sheep
- Action 3: Trade 3 ore for 1 wheat
- Action 4: Trade 3 ore for 1 brick

Since you have the option to trade ore, you must have at least 3 ore cards. The question is whether you should trade them and for what resource.

Without knowing your exact game state (your current resources beyond ore, your building plans, board position, etc.), it's difficult to make a fully informed recommendation. However:

1. A 3:1 maritime trade is generally not very efficient
2. You must have enough ore that you're considering trading some away
3. You likely need one of these other resources for an immediate build

If you're planning to build a settlement (needs brick, wood, wheat, sheep) or road (needs brick and wood), Actions 1 (wood) or 4 (brick) might be most useful.

Given the limited information, and since trading 3 resources for 1 is expensive, I would recommend:

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0

Unless you urgently need a specific resource to make a critical play, keeping your ore (which is valuable for cities and development cards) is likely better than the 3:1 trade ratio.
