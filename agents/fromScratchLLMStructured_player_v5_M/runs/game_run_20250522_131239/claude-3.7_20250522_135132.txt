Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)
Action 1: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUY_DEVELOPMENT_CARD: 'BUY_DEVELOPMENT_CARD'>, value=None)

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
I'll analyze each available action to determine the best strategic choice in this Catan game.

**Action 0: End Turn**
This action simply passes play to the next player. Choosing this action means you don't want to make any more moves this turn, perhaps because you don't have the resources for other actions or you're saving resources for a future turn.

**Action 1: Buy Development Card**
Buying a development card costs 1 sheep, 1 wheat, and 1 ore. Development cards provide several potential benefits:
- Knights: Help move the robber and defend against the largest army
- Victory Point cards: Secret points toward victory
- Progress cards: Special abilities like Road Building, Monopoly, or Year of Plenty

Since these are your only two options, you must either have the exact resources needed for a development card (1 sheep, 1 wheat, 1 ore) or not enough resources for any other builds (roads, settlements, cities).

Development cards are generally good investments because:
1. They can provide direct victory points
2. Knights help control the board and can earn the Largest Army (2 VP)
3. Progress cards can provide significant advantages at crucial moments

Without seeing your current resources, victory points, or board position, buying a development card is typically the better strategic choice if you have the resources for it. Development cards add an element of surprise and can turn the game in your favor.

**RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 1**
