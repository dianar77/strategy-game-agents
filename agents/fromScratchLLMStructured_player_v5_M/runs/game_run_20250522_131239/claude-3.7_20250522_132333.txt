Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
Looking at the available actions for this Catan turn, I see that there's only one option:

Action 0: Roll the dice (BLUE player's turn to roll)

This is the standard way to begin a turn in Catan. Rolling the dice determines which resource hexes will produce resources for players with settlements or cities adjacent to those hexes. Since this is the only action available, it's clearly the correct choice at this point in the game.

After rolling, you'll likely have more decisions to make based on the outcome of the roll, such as building roads, settlements, cities, or trading resources.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
