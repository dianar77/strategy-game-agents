Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(28, 29))
Action 1: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(10, 29))
Action 2: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(29, 30))

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
I'll analyze each available road building option for the blue player in Catan:

**Action 0: Build road between points 28 and 29**
- This would connect from an existing settlement/road at point 28 toward point 29
- Opens up expansion toward the center of the board
- May help in creating a path toward building additional settlements

**Action 1: Build road between points 10 and 29**
- This would connect from an existing settlement/road at point 10 toward point 29
- Also provides access to the center area of the board
- Could be valuable for creating connectivity between different parts of your network

**Action 2: Build road between points 29 and 30**
- This would extend from point 29 (which you don't yet have a road to) toward point 30
- This option doesn't make sense currently since you need to have a road to point 29 first before you can build from there to point 30

Without seeing the complete board state, Actions 0 and 1 appear most logical since they both connect to point 29 from existing infrastructure. Between these, the choice depends on your longer-term strategy and which direction offers better future settlement locations.

However, Action 2 seems invalid at this moment since you would need to build to point 29 first before extending to point 30.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
