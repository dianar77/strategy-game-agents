# Catan Strategic Decision Analysis

In this situation, you only have one available action:

**Action 0**: Discard action for the blue player

When there's only one available action in Catan, it typically means you're in a forced situation. In this case, you're being required to discard cards, which happens when a 7 is rolled and you have more than 7 resource cards in your hand.

The discard action requires you to select half (rounded down) of your cards to discard. Since this is the only option available, there's no strategic decision to make about whether to discard - you must do so according to the rules.

When executing this action, you would typically want to discard your least valuable resources or those you have in abundance. However, since we don't have information about your current hand composition, I can only advise that you select the action itself.

**RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0**
