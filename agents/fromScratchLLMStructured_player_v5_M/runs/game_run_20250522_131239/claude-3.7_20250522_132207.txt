Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
I see that you only have one available action in this game of Catan:

Action 0: Roll the dice (BLUE player)

In Catan, rolling the dice is the standard way to begin your turn and determine resource production. Since this is your only available action, there's no strategic decision to make at this moment.

Rolling the dice will determine which hexes produce resources - any player with settlements or cities adjacent to hexes matching the roll number will collect those resources.

Since there are no alternatives presented, your only course of action is to roll the dice and see what resources you and other players will receive.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
