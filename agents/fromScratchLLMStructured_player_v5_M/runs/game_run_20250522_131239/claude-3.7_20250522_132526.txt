Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)
Action 1: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('ORE', 'ORE', 'ORE', 'ORE', 'BRICK'))
Action 2: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('ORE', 'ORE', 'ORE', 'ORE', 'WOOD'))
Action 3: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('ORE', 'ORE', 'ORE', 'ORE', 'SHEEP'))
Action 4: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('ORE', 'ORE', 'ORE', 'ORE', 'WHEAT'))

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
I'll analyze your options in this Catan scenario.

Looking at the available actions:
- Action 0: End your turn
- Actions 1-4: Maritime trades where you give 4 ORE to get either BRICK, WOOD, SHEEP, or WHEAT

Analysis:
1. You have at least 4 ORE to potentially trade, which is good resource flexibility
2. Maritime trades at 4:1 are generally inefficient unless you really need a specific resource
3. Without knowing your current resources, victory points, or building plans, it's difficult to determine which resource you need most

The decision depends on:
- What you're planning to build next (road, settlement, city, or development card)
- What resources you're currently lacking
- What your opponents are collecting

Since maritime trading at 4:1 is quite expensive, I would only recommend it if you absolutely need a specific resource to make an important move. Without more information about your current game state, ending your turn (Action 0) is likely the most prudent choice rather than making an inefficient trade.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
