Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
In this case, you only have one available action: rolling the dice (Action 0). In Catan, rolling the dice is how you begin your turn and determine which resources are produced.

When you roll the dice, any player who has settlements or cities adjacent to hexes with the corresponding number will collect resources. This is the primary way to gather resources in the game, which you'll need for building roads, settlements, cities, and buying development cards.

Since there are no other options available, your decision is straightforward.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
