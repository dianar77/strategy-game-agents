Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
I'll analyze the situation for this game of Catan.

Looking at the available actions, there is only one option:
- Action 0: End your turn (Color: BLUE, Action Type: END_TURN)

Since this is the only action available to you, there's no strategic decision to make at this moment. This typically happens when you've completed all possible actions for your turn (building, trading, playing development cards), or when you've just rolled the dice but don't have any valid moves to make with your current resources.

The fact that END_TURN is your only option indicates that you've either:
1. Already completed all desired actions for this turn
2. Don't have sufficient resources to build anything
3. Have no valid trades to propose
4. Have no development cards to play

Without additional options to consider, the only course of action is to end your turn and let the game proceed to the next player.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
