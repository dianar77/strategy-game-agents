Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
Looking at the available actions, there's actually only one option:

Action 0: End your turn (BLUE player)

Since this is the only available action, there's no need to compare multiple options. When there's only an END_TURN action available, it means you've completed all the actions you can take during your current turn, and now it's time to pass play to the next player.

In Catan, the END_TURN action is selected when:
- You've finished building roads, settlements, or cities
- You've completed any trades you wanted to make
- You've played any development cards you wished to play
- You have no other valid moves remaining

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
