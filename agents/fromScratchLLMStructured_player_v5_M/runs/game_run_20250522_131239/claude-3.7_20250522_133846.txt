Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
I'm helping you with your Catan game. Let's analyze your available actions.

Currently, you only have one action available:
- Action 0: End your turn (Color: BLUE, Action Type: END_TURN)

Since this is the only action available, there are no alternatives to compare. This typically means you've completed all possible moves for your turn (like building, trading, playing development cards) or you're in a situation where you must end your turn to proceed with the game.

When you have only the END_TURN action available, it means either:
1. You've already used your available resources optimally this turn
2. You don't have enough resources to perform any other actions
3. You've already played a development card or completed other limited actions for this turn

Without having more context about your current game state (resources, current buildings, etc.), I can only recommend taking the one action that's available to you.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
