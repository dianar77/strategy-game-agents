Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
Looking at your available actions, I only see one option:

Action 0: End your turn (Color BLUE)

Since this is the only action available, there's no strategic decision to make at this moment. You must end your turn and let the next player proceed with their turn.

When you only have the END_TURN action available, it means you've either:
1. Already completed all possible actions for your turn
2. Just rolled the dice and didn't get resources to build anything
3. Already traded, built, or played development cards as much as possible this turn

Without seeing the current game state, I can't analyze what happened during your turn, but the only valid move now is to end it.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
