Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
I'll analyze the available actions in this Catan scenario.

The actions involve either ending your turn or performing various maritime trades where you trade 3 ORE to get 1 of another resource.

Let's consider each option:

Action 0: End your turn without making any trades
- This makes sense if you don't need any of the resources offered or want to save your ore for other purposes

Actions 1-4: Maritime trades exchanging 3 ORE for 1 of another resource
- Action 1: Trade 3 ORE for 1 WOOD
- Action 2: Trade 3 ORE for 1 SHEEP 
- Action 3: Trade 3 ORE for 1 WHEAT
- Action 4: Trade 3 ORE for 1 BRICK

Without knowing your current resource holdings, game position, or strategic goals, it's difficult to make a definitive recommendation. Maritime trades at 3:1 are generally inefficient, but sometimes necessary if you urgently need a specific resource.

Since I lack information about your current needs, the most conservative approach would be to end your turn and preserve your resources until you have a clearer plan or more favorable trade options.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
