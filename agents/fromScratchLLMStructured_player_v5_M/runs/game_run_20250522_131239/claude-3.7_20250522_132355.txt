Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
Looking at the available actions, I only see one option:

Action 0: End Turn (BLUE player)

This means your turn is over and there are no other valid moves you can make at this time. When there's only a single available action, the decision is straightforward - you must end your turn.

In Catan, ending your turn passes play to the next player. Since this is your only available action, you've likely already completed whatever moves you wanted to make this turn (building roads, settlements, cities, or playing development cards).

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
