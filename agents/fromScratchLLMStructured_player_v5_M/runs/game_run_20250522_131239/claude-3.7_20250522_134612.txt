Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
I see that you're playing Catan and need help deciding your next move. Let's analyze the current situation:

You only have one available action:
- Action 0: End your turn (Color BLUE)

Since this is the only action available to you right now, there isn't really a strategic decision to make here. You must end your turn to allow the game to progress.

This suggests that either:
1. You've already completed all possible actions for this turn
2. You don't have the resources necessary to build anything
3. It's not your turn to act except to end it

Without additional information about your current resources, the board state, or what actions you've already taken this turn, I can only recommend the one option available.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
