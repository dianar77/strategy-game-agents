Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
Looking at the available actions, there's only one option:

Action 0: End Turn (Color: BLUE)

This is a straightforward situation as you only have one choice. When there's only one available action, it means either:
1) You've already completed all the actions you wanted to for your turn
2) You don't have the resources or valid placements for other actions
3) It's the beginning of your turn but you rolled a 7 and need to move the robber first

Since ending your turn is the only option, there's nothing else to consider at this moment.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
