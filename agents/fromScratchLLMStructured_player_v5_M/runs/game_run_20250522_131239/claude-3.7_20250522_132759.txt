Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
Looking at the available actions, there's only one option presented:

**Action 0**: Roll the dice (ROLL action for BLUE player)

Since there's only one action available, this suggests you're at the dice-rolling phase of your turn in Catan. Rolling the dice is the standard way to begin your turn (unless you have special cards to play before rolling), as it determines resource production for all players.

Rolling is mandatory at this stage of your turn, and since there are no alternative actions presented, this is clearly your only valid move.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
