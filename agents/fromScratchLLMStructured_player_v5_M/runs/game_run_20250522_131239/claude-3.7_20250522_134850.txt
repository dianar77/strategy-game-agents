You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
I'm helping you make a decision in Catan. Looking at your available actions, there's only one option:

**Action 0:** Roll the dice (BLUE player, ROLL action)

This is the standard way to start your turn in Catan. Rolling the dice will determine which resource hexes produce resources this turn. All players with settlements or cities adjacent to hexes matching the roll number will collect those resources.

Since this is your only available action, there's no strategic decision to make at this point. You need to roll the dice to proceed with your turn.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
