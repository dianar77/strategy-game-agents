Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
In this case, you only have one available action, which is to roll the dice as the BLUE player. This is a standard start to a turn in Catan, where you first roll to determine resource production before making other decisions like trading or building.

Since you have no alternative choices at this moment, the decision is straightforward.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
