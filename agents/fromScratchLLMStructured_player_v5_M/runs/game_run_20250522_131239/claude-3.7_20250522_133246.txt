Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)
Action 1: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('WOOD', 'WOOD', 'WOOD', 'WOOD', 'ORE'))
Action 2: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('WOOD', 'WOOD', 'WOOD', 'WOOD', 'SHEEP'))
Action 3: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('WOOD', 'WOOD', 'WOOD', 'WOOD', 'WHEAT'))
Action 4: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('WOOD', 'WOOD', 'WOOD', 'WOOD', 'BRICK'))

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
I'll analyze the available actions in this game of Catan:

Action 0: End your turn without trading.
Actions 1-4: Maritime trades where you give up 4 wood to receive 1 of either ore, sheep, wheat, or brick.

Looking at these options, you have enough wood to make a maritime trade (at least 4 wood in your hand). The question is whether trading 4 wood for 1 of another resource is beneficial right now.

Maritime trades at a 4:1 ratio are generally inefficient, but can be necessary when you urgently need a specific resource. Without knowing:
- Your current resource inventory
- What you're trying to build next
- Board state (settlements/cities/roads you have)
- Victory points status

It's difficult to make the optimal recommendation. However, I can analyze the general value of each resource:

- Ore: Needed for cities (3 ore) and development cards (1 ore)
- Sheep: Needed for settlements (1 sheep) and development cards (1 sheep)
- Wheat: Needed for settlements (1 wheat), cities (2 wheat), and development cards (1 wheat)
- Brick: Needed for settlements (1 brick) and roads (1 brick)

If you have a surplus of wood but need one of these resources to complete a critical build, a trade might make sense. Otherwise, ending your turn and waiting for better trading opportunities is likely better.

Without additional context, and given the high cost of maritime trade (4:1 ratio), I would generally recommend:

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0

This preserves your resources for more efficient trades or builds in future turns.
