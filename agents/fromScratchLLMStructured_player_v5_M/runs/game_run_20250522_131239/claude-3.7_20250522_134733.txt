Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
Looking at the available actions, there is only one option:

Action 0: End your turn (Color: BLUE, Action Type: END_TURN)

Since this is the only action available to you right now, there are no alternatives to consider. This typically means you've already completed all other possible actions for your turn (like trading, building, or playing development cards), or it's time to pass the turn to the next player.

In Catan, when you see only the END_TURN option, it means you've either:
1. Already taken all the actions you can for this turn
2. Don't have the resources to build anything
3. Have completed your turn actions and must now pass to the next player

With only one option available, the decision is clear.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
