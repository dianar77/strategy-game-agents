Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
Looking at the available actions, you have only one option:

Action 0: End your turn (Color BLUE)

Since this is your only available action, there's no strategic decision to make here. Your turn has reached a point where you must end it, allowing the next player to take their turn.

In Catan, ending your turn is a mandatory action after you've completed all your desired building, trading, and other actions for that turn. Since this is the only action available, it suggests you've either:
1. Already completed all possible actions for this turn
2. Don't have the resources necessary to build or develop further
3. Have reached a point in the game flow where ending your turn is the next required step

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
