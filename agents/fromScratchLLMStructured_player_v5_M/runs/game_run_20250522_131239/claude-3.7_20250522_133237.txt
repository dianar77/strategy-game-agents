Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
I'm analyzing your options in Catan, but I notice you only have one available action at this time.

Action 0: Roll the dice (BLUE player)
- This is the standard way to begin your turn in Catan
- Rolling will generate resources for all players who have settlements or cities adjacent to terrain hexes showing the rolled number
- This is your only available action, so there's no strategic decision to make at this point

Since this is the beginning of your turn and rolling is mandatory, you should proceed with this action. Rolling the dice will determine which resources are produced this turn, and then you'll have more meaningful decisions to make afterward (trading, building, etc.).

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
