Response:
# Catan Discard Decision Analysis

You only have one available action:

**Action 0**: Discard cards (BLUE player)

Since this is the only option available, it means you must be in a situation where you need to discard cards due to a 7 being rolled or a Knight card being played. When this happens in Catan, any player with more than 7 cards must discard half (rounded down) of their hand.

There's no strategic decision to make here - you must discard cards as the rules require. When selecting which cards to discard, you would typically want to:

1. Keep balanced resources
2. Prioritize keeping resources needed for your immediate building plans
3. Consider discarding resources that other players might have in abundance

However, since I don't have information about your current hand composition or building plans, I can only recommend taking the mandatory discard action.

**RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0**
