Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
In this scenario, you're playing Catan and have only one available action: to roll the dice.

Action 0: Roll the dice (BLUE player)
- This is the standard way to begin your turn in Catan
- Rolling will determine which resource-producing hexes activate
- All players with settlements or cities adjacent to hexes showing the rolled number will collect resources
- This is a mandatory action to progress the game

Since there is only one available action, there's really no decision to make here. You must roll the dice to continue your turn. After rolling, you'll likely have additional options based on the resources you collect and the game state.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
