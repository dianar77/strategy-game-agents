Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
I need to analyze the available actions for your turn in Catan. 

Currently, there is only one action available:
- Action 0: End your turn (Color: BLUE, Action Type: END_TURN)

Since this is the only option available to you, it indicates that you've already completed all possible actions for your turn (like trading, building, or playing development cards) or you have no valid moves to make at this time.

In Catan, when END_TURN is the only available action, it means you've either:
1. Already used all your resources for this turn
2. Don't have the right combination of resources to build anything
3. Have already played a development card this turn if you had one
4. Have completed any trading you wanted to do

With only one option available, the choice is clear.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
