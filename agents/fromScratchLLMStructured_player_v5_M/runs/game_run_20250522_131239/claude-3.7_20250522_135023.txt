You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)
Action 1: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'SHEEP'))
Action 2: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'BRICK'))
Action 3: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'WOOD'))
Action 4: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'ORE'))

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
I'll analyze each available action for your Catan turn:

**Action 0: End Turn**
This simply ends your turn without making any trades.

**Actions 1-4: Maritime Trade Options**
All these actions involve trading 4 WHEAT for another resource:
- Action 1: Trade 4 WHEAT for 1 SHEEP
- Action 2: Trade 4 WHEAT for 1 BRICK
- Action 3: Trade 4 WHEAT for 1 WOOD
- Action 4: Trade 4 WHEAT for 1 ORE

To determine the best trade, I need to consider:
1. Which resources you need most for building
2. The relative scarcity of each resource
3. Your current building strategy (roads/settlements/cities/development cards)

Without seeing your current resource inventory or game state, the 4:1 maritime trade ratio is quite expensive. However, if you have excess wheat and desperately need another resource, it could be worthwhile.

- BRICK and WOOD are critical for roads and settlements
- ORE is essential for cities and development cards
- SHEEP is needed for settlements and development cards

Since cities give the best long-term production increase and development cards can provide victory points or Knights for the largest army, I would generally prioritize ORE if you're in the mid-to-late game and have settlements to upgrade.

Without more context, I recommend:

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 4

Trading for ORE is often the most strategic choice, as it's required for cities (2 ore per city) and development cards (1 ore per card), both of which are crucial for victory point accumulation.
