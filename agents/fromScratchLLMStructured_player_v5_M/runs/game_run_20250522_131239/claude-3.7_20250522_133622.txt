Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
In this case, there's only one available action for you to take in Catan:

Action 0: Roll the dice (ROLL action for BLUE player)

Since rolling the dice is the fundamental action that starts your turn in Catan, and it's the only option currently available, there's no strategic decision to make at this moment. Rolling will determine which resource-producing hexes activate this turn.

After the roll, you'll likely have more meaningful decisions to make based on the resources you collect and your current game situation.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
