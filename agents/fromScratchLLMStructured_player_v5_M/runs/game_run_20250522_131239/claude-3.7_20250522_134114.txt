Action 1: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'SHEEP'))
Action 2: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'BRICK'))
Action 3: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'WOOD'))
Action 4: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'ORE'))

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
I'll analyze each of the available actions for your Catan turn.

**Available Actions Analysis:**

**Action 0: End Turn**
- This simply ends your turn without taking any further actions.
- Choosing this would mean you're not using your resources this turn.

**Actions 1-4: Maritime Trade Options**
All these options involve trading 4 WHEAT for another resource:
- Action 1: Trade 4 WHEAT for 1 SHEEP
- Action 2: Trade 4 WHEAT for 1 BRICK
- Action 3: Trade 4 WHEAT for 1 WOOD
- Action 4: Trade 4 WHEAT for 1 ORE

Without additional information about your current board state, resource needs, or strategic goals, it's difficult to determine which resource would benefit you most. However, some general considerations:

- A 4:1 trade is the standard port rate and is quite inefficient
- You must have at least 4 WHEAT to make these trades
- This suggests you may have a surplus of WHEAT but need other resources

Since I don't have specific information about:
- What resources you currently need for your next building objective
- What settlements/cities/roads you're planning to build
- What resources you're already producing well
- What resources you're lacking

The most prudent choice may be Action 0 (End Turn) to avoid making an inefficient trade without a clear strategic need. Unless you have an immediate use for one of these resources, saving your WHEAT might be better than trading at the standard 4:1 ratio.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
