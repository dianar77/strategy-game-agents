You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)
Action 1: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'SHEEP'))
Action 2: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'BRICK'))
Action 3: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'WOOD'))
Action 4: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'WHEAT', 'ORE'))

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
I'll analyze each available action to determine the best strategic choice in Catan:

**Action 0: End Turn**
This simply ends your turn without making any trades.

**Actions 1-4: Maritime Trade Options**
All these actions involve trading 4 wheat for another resource:
- Action 1: Trade 4 wheat for 1 sheep
- Action 2: Trade 4 wheat for 1 brick
- Action 3: Trade 4 wheat for 1 wood
- Action 4: Trade 4 wheat for 1 ore

To make the best decision, I need to consider:
1. You have at least 4 wheat to trade
2. The 4:1 maritime trade is generally expensive
3. Which resource would be most valuable for your current strategy

Without knowing your current resource count (beyond having 4+ wheat), your building plans, or the board state, it's difficult to make a fully informed recommendation. However, I can offer some general guidance:

- Brick and wood are essential for roads and settlements
- Ore is crucial for city upgrades and development cards
- Sheep is often the least valuable resource

If you're looking to expand with new settlements and roads, Action 2 (brick) or Action 3 (wood) would be most helpful.
If you're pursuing a city-building strategy, Action 4 (ore) would be better.

Without more context, I would suggest ending your turn (Action 0) rather than making an expensive 4:1 trade unless you have an urgent need for a specific resource to make a critical play.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
