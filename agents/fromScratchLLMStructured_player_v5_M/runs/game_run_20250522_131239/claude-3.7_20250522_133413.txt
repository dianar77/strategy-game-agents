========================================

Response:
I'll analyze your available actions for your turn in Catan:

**Action 0: End Turn**
This would simply end your turn without taking any further actions.

**Actions 1-4: Maritime Trade Options**
All these options involve trading 4 WOOD for a different resource:
- Action 1: Trade 4 WOOD for 1 ORE
- Action 2: Trade 4 WOOD for 1 SHEEP
- Action 3: Trade 4 WOOD for 1 WHEAT
- Action 4: Trade 4 WOOD for 1 BRICK

To evaluate these options, I need to consider:
1. You must have at least 4 WOOD to make any of these trades
2. The trade is expensive (4:1 ratio) which suggests you don't have a harbor for better rates
3. You're considering trading away WOOD, which implies you have excess of it

Without knowing your resource inventory, victory points, building plans, or what other players have, it's difficult to determine which resource you need most. Trading 4 WOOD for 1 of another resource is generally only advisable if:
- You have excess WOOD
- You urgently need a specific resource to make a strategic build
- You cannot get a better trade ratio elsewhere

Since I don't see information about your immediate building needs or resource inventory, ending your turn (Action 0) is the safest choice unless you have a specific resource need. The 4:1 maritime trade is quite expensive and should only be used when necessary.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
