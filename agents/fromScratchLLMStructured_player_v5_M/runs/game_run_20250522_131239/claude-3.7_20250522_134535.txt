Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
I'll analyze the available actions for your Catan turn.

Currently, there is only one available action:
- Action 0: End your turn (Color: BLUE, Action Type: END_TURN)

Since this is the only option presented, it means you've likely already completed all possible building, trading, or development card actions for this turn. When END_TURN is the only available action, it indicates you have no other valid moves remaining in your current turn.

In Catan, once you've made all your desired moves for a turn (like building roads, settlements, cities, buying development cards, or trading resources), ending your turn is the appropriate next step so the game can continue.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
