Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
I can help you make a strategic decision for your turn in Catan.

In this case, I only see one available action:
- Action 0: End your turn (Color BLUE)

Since this is the only option available to you, it means that either:
1. You've already completed all possible actions for your turn (building, trading, playing development cards)
2. You don't have the resources to do anything else
3. It's the beginning of the game and you've already placed your initial settlements and roads

Without seeing the current game state (your resources, board position, etc.), I can't provide more specific analysis, but when the only available action is to end your turn, it means there's nothing else you can do at this moment.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
