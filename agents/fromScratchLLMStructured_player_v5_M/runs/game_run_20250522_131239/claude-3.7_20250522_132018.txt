Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
It appears you only have one action available: ending your turn.

Looking at Action 0:
- You're playing as BLUE
- The only available action type is END_TURN
- There's no value associated with this action

Since this is the only option available to you right now, it means you've either already completed all possible moves for your turn or you don't have the resources to take any other actions at this point in the game.

Without any alternatives to compare against, the decision is straightforward. You should end your turn and allow the game to proceed to the next player.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
