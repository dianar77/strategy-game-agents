========================================

Response:
I'll analyze each available action for your Catan turn.

**Action 0: End Turn**
- This simply ends your turn without making any moves.
- You would retain all your current resources for the next turn.

**Action 1: Buy Development Card**
- Costs 1 sheep, 1 wheat, and 1 ore.
- Development cards can provide victory points, knights (for largest army), monopoly, road building, or year of plenty.
- These are generally good investments toward victory.

**Actions 2-5: Maritime Trade (4:1)**
- All of these options involve trading 4 wheat for 1 of another resource.
- Action 2: Trade 4 wheat for 1 sheep
- Action 3: Trade 4 wheat for 1 brick
- Action 4: Trade 4 wheat for 1 wood
- Action 5: Trade 4 wheat for 1 ore

Since you have the option to buy a development card (Action 1), it suggests you have the necessary resources (1 sheep, 1 wheat, 1 ore). Development cards are usually more valuable than a 4:1 maritime trade, which is quite inefficient.

The maritime trade options indicate you have at least 4 wheat, but trading 4 resources for 1 is generally a last resort when you desperately need a specific resource.

Unless you have a specific need for one of the resources (like needing brick or wood to build a critical road), buying a development card is typically the strongest play since it could give you victory points or useful special abilities.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 1
