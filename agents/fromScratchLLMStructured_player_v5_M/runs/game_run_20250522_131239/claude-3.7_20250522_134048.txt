Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
I'm helping you with a Catan decision, but in this case, you actually only have one option available:

Action 0: Roll the dice (BLUE player)

Since rolling the dice is the standard way to start your turn in Catan and there are no other actions available to choose from, this is a straightforward decision. Rolling will generate resources based on the number rolled and the position of settlements/cities adjacent to hexes with that number.

Since this is your only option, there's no strategic comparison needed - you must roll the dice to proceed with your turn.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
