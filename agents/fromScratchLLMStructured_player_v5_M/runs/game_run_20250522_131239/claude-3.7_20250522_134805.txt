Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
I'll help you analyze your available actions in this Catan turn.

Currently, you only have one option available:
- Action 0: End your turn (BLUE player)

Since there's only one possible action, there's no strategic decision to make here. You must end your turn and pass play to the next player. This typically happens when:
1. You've already completed all available actions for this turn (building roads, settlements, etc.)
2. You don't have resources to build anything
3. You've just rolled the dice and collected resources but don't wish to build or trade

Without additional context about your current game state (resources, board position, etc.), I can only confirm that ending your turn is your only available option.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
