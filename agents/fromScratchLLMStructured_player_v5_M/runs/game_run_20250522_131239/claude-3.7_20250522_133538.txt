Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
Looking at the available actions for your Catan turn, I notice there is only one option:

Action 0: End your turn (Color: BLUE, Action Type: END_TURN)

Since this is the only available action, it indicates that you've already completed all possible moves for this turn, such as building roads, settlements, cities, or trading resources. The game is now requiring you to end your turn so the next player can take their turn.

When there's only one action available in Catan, it typically means you've either:
- Used all your available resources and can't build anything else
- Already built something this turn and certain actions are now restricted
- Have no legal moves remaining

Since ending your turn is the only option, that's what you should select.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
