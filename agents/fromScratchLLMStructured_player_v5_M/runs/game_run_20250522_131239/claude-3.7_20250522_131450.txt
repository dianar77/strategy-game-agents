Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
I only have one action available to me, which is to end my turn. This indicates that I've either completed all the actions I wanted to take this turn, or I have no other valid actions available. Since there are no other options to analyze, the decision is straightforward.

When there's only one action available in Catan, it generally means:
- I've already built what I wanted to build this turn
- I've already traded what I wanted to trade
- I've already played any development cards I wanted to play
- I don't have the resources or legal placements for additional builds

Without seeing the current board state, resource counts, or other game information, I can't provide more strategic context about what might come next, but ending my turn is the only option available.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
