Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
I see you're playing Catan and it's your turn to roll the dice. In this case, you only have one option available to you:

Action 0: Roll the dice (BLUE player)

When you're at the dice rolling phase in Catan, this is the standard way to begin your turn. Rolling determines which resource tiles produce resources for all players who have settlements or cities adjacent to those tiles.

Since there is only one available action (rolling the dice), there's no strategic decision to make at this moment. You simply need to roll and then you'll likely have more decisions to make afterward based on the roll outcome and the resources you receive.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
