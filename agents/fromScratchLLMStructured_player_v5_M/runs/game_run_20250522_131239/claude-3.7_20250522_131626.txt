Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
Looking at the available actions, I only see one option:

Action 0: Roll the dice (BLUE player's turn to roll)

Since there's only one available action, there aren't any strategic decisions to make at this moment. Rolling the dice is the standard way to start your turn in Catan, determining which resource hexes will produce resources based on the number rolled.

After rolling, you'll likely have more interesting decisions to make, such as building roads, settlements, cities, or trading resources with other players.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
