Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
I see you have only one available action in this game of Catan:

Action 0: End your turn (Color: BLUE, Action Type: END_TURN)

Since this is the only option available to you, there's no strategic comparison needed. This typically happens when:
- You've already completed all possible building/trading actions for this turn
- You've just rolled the dice and don't have resources or opportunities to build
- It's simply time to pass play to the next player

Without additional information about your game state (like your resources, the board state, your current settlements/cities/roads, etc.), I can only confirm that ending your turn is the only option you have right now.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
