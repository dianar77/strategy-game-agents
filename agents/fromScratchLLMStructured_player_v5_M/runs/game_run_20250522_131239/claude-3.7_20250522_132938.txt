Response:
# Catan Action Analysis

In this situation, you only have one available action: to discard cards. This happens in Catan when a 7 is rolled and you have more than 7 cards in your hand (exceeding the hand limit).

When a 7 is rolled in Catan:
1. All players with more than 7 cards must discard half of their cards (rounded down)
2. The player who rolled the 7 gets to move the robber and steal a card

Since this is your only option, you must discard cards. The game will likely prompt you afterward about which specific cards to discard, but for now you need to acknowledge that you must discard.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
