Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
I'll analyze your available actions in this game of Catan.

In this situation, you only have one available action:

Action 0: End your turn (passing control to the next player)

When there's only one available action in Catan, it typically means you've completed all possible moves for your turn (like building roads/settlements, trading, playing development cards, etc.) or you're unable to make any other moves at this time due to resource constraints or board position limitations.

Since there are no other options to consider, the decision is straightforward in this case.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
