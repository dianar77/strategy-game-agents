Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
I'll analyze your available actions in this Catan turn.

In this situation, you only have one option available:

**Action 0**: End your turn (Color BLUE, ActionType END_TURN)

Since this is the only action available to you, it indicates that you've completed all possible moves for your current turn. In Catan, this typically means you've already:
- Rolled the dice
- Collected any resources you were entitled to
- Built any roads, settlements, or cities you wanted to (or couldn't afford to build anything)
- Played any development cards you wanted to play
- Made any trades you wished to make

With no other options available, the logical choice is to end your turn and let the next player take their turn.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
