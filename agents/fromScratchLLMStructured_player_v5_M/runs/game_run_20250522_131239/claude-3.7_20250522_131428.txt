Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
I'll help you analyze your options in this Catan scenario.

Currently, there is only one available action:

Action 0: End your turn (Color: BLUE, Action Type: END_TURN)

Since this is the only option available to you, there's no strategic decision to make at this moment. When only END_TURN is available, it means you've either:
- Already used all your possible moves for this turn
- Don't have the resources or positions available to build anything
- Have completed whatever other actions were available

In Catan, ending your turn passes play to the next player and potentially triggers resource production if dice are rolled.

Since there are no alternatives to consider, the only possible choice is to end your turn.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
