Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
I'm analyzing your options in Catan, but it appears you only have one available action at this moment:

Action 0: Roll the dice (BLUE player)

Since rolling the dice is the primary way to begin your turn and generate resources in Catan, and it's your only option right now, this is clearly what you should do. Rolling will determine which resource hexes produce resources for all players who have settlements or cities adjacent to those hexes.

After rolling, you'll likely have more options available to you depending on the resources you collect and the game state.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
