Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
Looking at the available actions, I see that you only have one option:

Action 0: End your turn (Color: BLUE, Action Type: END_TURN)

This is a straightforward situation. Since there's only one action available, you must end your turn. This typically happens when you've already completed all possible moves for your turn (like building, trading, playing development cards) or when you've just rolled the dice and didn't get resources/don't have anything you can build.

In Catan, when you can only end your turn, it means you've either:
1. Already done everything possible on this turn
2. Don't have enough resources to build anything
3. Just rolled the dice with no favorable outcome

Since there are no other options, your only choice is to end your turn and let the next player proceed.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
