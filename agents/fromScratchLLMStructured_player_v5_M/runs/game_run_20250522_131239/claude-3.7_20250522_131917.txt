Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
Looking at the available actions, there's only one option presented:

Action 0: End Turn (Color: BLUE)

This is a situation where there are no other available actions to consider. When there's only one action available in Catan, it usually means one of the following:
- You've already completed all the actions you can take in your turn
- You don't have the resources needed for building or development
- You're in a phase of the game where ending your turn is the only appropriate action

Since there are no alternatives to analyze, the only reasonable recommendation is to end your turn and allow the next player to take their turn.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
