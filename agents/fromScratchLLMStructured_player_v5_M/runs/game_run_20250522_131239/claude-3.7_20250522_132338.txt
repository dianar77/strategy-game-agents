Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
Looking at your available actions, I see that you only have one option:

Action 0: End your turn (Action.END_TURN)

Since this is the only action available to you, it means you've completed all other possible actions for your turn (such as building roads, settlements, cities, or trading). At this point, the only thing you can do is end your turn and let the next player take their turn.

Without other options to compare, and since the game cannot proceed until you end your turn, this is clearly the action you need to take.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
