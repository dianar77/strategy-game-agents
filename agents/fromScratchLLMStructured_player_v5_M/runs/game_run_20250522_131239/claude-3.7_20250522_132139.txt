Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
Looking at the available actions, there is only one option:

Action 0: Roll the dice (BLUE player, action type: ROLL)

This is the standard way to start your turn in Catan, where you roll two dice to determine which resource hexes produce resources. All players who have settlements or cities adjacent to hexes matching the roll number will collect corresponding resources.

Since there is only one action available, there's no strategic decision to make at this point. You need to roll the dice to proceed with your turn.

After rolling, you'll likely have more interesting decisions to make, such as building roads/settlements, trading, playing development cards, etc.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
