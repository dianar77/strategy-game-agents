Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
I only have one option available:

Action 0: Roll the dice (BLUE player, ROLL action)

In Catan, rolling the dice is how you determine resource production for all players. When it's your turn to roll, you typically want to do this before taking any other actions like building or trading.

Since this is the only action available to me, I'll recommend rolling the dice. This will generate resources based on the roll outcome and the settlements/cities positioned on the corresponding numbered hexes.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
