Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
Looking at your available actions for this turn in Catan, I see that you only have one option:

Action 0: END_TURN (Color: BLUE)

This means your turn is over, and you've likely already completed any building, trading, or other actions you wanted to take this turn. Since this is the only action available to you, there's no strategic decision to make at this moment.

When you have only the END_TURN action available, it means:
1. You've already used your build/trade opportunities for this turn
2. Or you don't have the resources needed to build anything
3. Or you're at a point in the game where ending your turn is mandatory

Since no other options are presented, the only valid move is to end your turn and let the next player take their turn.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
