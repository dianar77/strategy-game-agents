Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
I'm helping you make a strategic decision in Catan. Let's analyze your available actions:

Currently, you only have one option available:
Action 0: Roll the dice (BLUE player, ROLL action)

This is the standard beginning of a turn in Catan. Rolling the dice will determine which resource hexes produce resources for all players who have settlements or cities adjacent to those hexes.

Since this is your only available action, there's no strategic decision to make at this point. You must roll the dice to proceed with your turn.

After rolling, depending on the outcome, you'll likely have more strategic options like building, trading, or playing development cards.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
