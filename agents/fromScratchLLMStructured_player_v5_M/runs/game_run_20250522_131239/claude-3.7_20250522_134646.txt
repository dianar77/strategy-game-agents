Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
Looking at the available actions, there is only one option:

Action 0: End my turn (BLUE player)

Since this is the only action available, I don't need to compare multiple options. When there's only one available action in Catan, it typically means you've completed all possible moves for your turn (such as building, trading, or playing development cards), and the only remaining option is to end your turn and let the next player take their turn.

Without seeing the current game state, resources, or other potential actions that may have been available earlier in your turn, I can only advise you to take the sole remaining action.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
