Action 4: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('ORE', 'ORE', 'ORE', None, 'BRICK'))

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
I'll help you decide the best action for your Catan turn.

Looking at the available actions:
- Action 0: End your turn
- Actions 1-4: Maritime trade options where you trade 3 ORE for either WOOD, SHEEP, WHEAT, or BRICK

To make a strategic decision, I need to consider:
1. What resources you currently have (besides the ORE you'd be trading)
2. What you're trying to build next (roads, settlements, cities, development cards)
3. Your position on the board and expansion opportunities

Without this context information, I need to make a general analysis:

- Trading 3 ORE for 1 of another resource is an expensive 3:1 maritime trade
- ORE is valuable for cities (3 ORE + 2 WHEAT) and development cards (1 ORE, 1 WHEAT, 1 SHEEP)
- You must have at least 3 ORE to consider these trades

Since I don't have specific information about your current game state, I'll recommend ending your turn rather than making an expensive trade. It's usually better to wait for better trade opportunities unless you urgently need a specific resource.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
