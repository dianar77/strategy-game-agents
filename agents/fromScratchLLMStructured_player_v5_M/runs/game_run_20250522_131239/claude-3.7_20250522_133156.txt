========================================

Response:
I need to analyze the maritime trade options available to you as the Blue player in Catan.

You have the option to trade 4 wood for one of these resources:
- Action 1: Trade 4 wood for 1 ore
- Action 2: Trade 4 wood for 1 sheep
- Action 3: Trade 4 wood for 1 wheat
- Action 4: Trade 4 wood for 1 brick
- Action 0: End your turn without trading

To make this decision properly, I would need to know:
1. Your current resources
2. What you're planning to build next
3. What resources are scarce on your settlements/cities

Without this information, I have to make an educated guess:

- Ore is valuable for city upgrades and development cards
- Brick and wood together are needed for roads and settlements
- Sheep and wheat are needed along with ore for development cards
- Wheat is also needed for cities

Since maritime trade is expensive (4:1 ratio), it's usually best to only trade when you need a specific resource to make an important build.

Given that you're willing to trade away wood, I assume you have surplus wood but need another resource urgently. Ore is typically the most valuable resource in mid to late game since it's needed for cities and development cards.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 1 (Trade 4 wood for 1 ore)
