Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
I'll analyze your available actions in this Catan turn.

Looking at the available actions, you only have one option:

Action 0: End your turn (Color: BLUE, Action Type: END_TURN)

Since there is only one available action, there's nothing to compare or analyze in terms of strategic options. You must end your turn at this point, which suggests you've either:
1. Already completed all possible moves for this turn
2. Cannot make any other moves due to resource constraints
3. Have reached a point in the game flow where ending your turn is the only valid action

Without additional information about your current board position, resources, or previous actions taken this turn, I can only recommend the single available action.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
