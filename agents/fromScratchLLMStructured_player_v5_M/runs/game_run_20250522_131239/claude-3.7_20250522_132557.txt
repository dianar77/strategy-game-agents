Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
I'll analyze each available action to determine the best strategic move for you in Catan.

**Action 0: End Turn**
This simply ends your turn without making any moves. Given that you have other potential actions, this would be suboptimal unless you're saving resources for a specific future strategy.

**Actions 1 and 2: Build City**
Building a city upgrades a settlement to produce double resources and is worth 2 victory points instead of 1. You can build a city at position 0 or position 2. This costs 3 ore and 2 wheat. Since you have enough ore to consider these options, building a city is a strong play that increases your resource production and brings you closer to winning.

**Actions 3-6: Maritime Trade**
These all involve trading 4 ore for 1 of another resource (brick, wood, sheep, or wheat). This is a 4:1 trade ratio, which is generally inefficient. You appear to have excess ore, but trading 4 ore for 1 of another resource should only be done if absolutely necessary.

**Analysis:**
Since you have the option to build cities, it suggests you have the required resources (3 ore + 2 wheat per city). Building a city is significantly more valuable than making a maritime trade at a 4:1 ratio.

Between Actions 1 and 2, I need to consider which settlement location would benefit most from being upgraded to a city. Without knowing the specific board positions and what resources they produce, I'll recommend building a city as the optimal move. If one settlement is on a high-probability resource tile (like 6 or 8), that would be the preferred location.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 1
