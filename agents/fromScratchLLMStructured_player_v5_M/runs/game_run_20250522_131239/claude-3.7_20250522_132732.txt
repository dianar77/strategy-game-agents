========================================

Response:
I'll analyze the available actions for this Catan turn:

**Action 0**: End your turn without taking any further action.
**Actions 1-4**: Maritime trade options, all trading 4 WOOD to get one of:
- Action 1: Get 1 ORE
- Action 2: Get 1 SHEEP
- Action 3: Get 1 WHEAT
- Action 4: Get 1 BRICK

To evaluate these options, I need to consider:
1. You have at least 4 WOOD to trade
2. The 4:1 maritime trade ratio is quite expensive
3. Which resource would be most valuable to acquire

Since all trade options require 4 WOOD, you would be left with significantly less wood. Without knowing your current resources, building plans, or the state of the board, it's difficult to determine which resource would be most beneficial.

However, maritime trading at a 4:1 ratio is generally only recommended when you really need a specific resource to make an important build. If you're not in urgent need of any specific resource, it's usually better to save your wood until you can make a more favorable trade.

Given the limited information and the expensive nature of the 4:1 trade, the most conservative approach would be to end your turn rather than making a potentially suboptimal trade.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
