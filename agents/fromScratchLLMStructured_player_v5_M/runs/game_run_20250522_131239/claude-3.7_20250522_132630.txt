Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
I only see one available action for you to choose from:

Action 0: End Turn (Color: BLUE)

Since this is the only available action, there's no strategic decision to make at this moment. You must end your turn and pass play to the next player.

Often in Catan, when you only see the END_TURN action available, it means you've completed all possible actions for your turn, such as rolling the dice, trading resources, building, and/or playing development cards.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
