Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
Looking at the available actions for your turn in Catan, I notice there is only one option:

Action 0: End your turn (Color BLUE)

This is a straightforward situation where you have no other actions available to perform. This typically happens when:
- You've already completed all possible building actions for this turn
- You've already played any development cards you wanted to play
- You've completed any trades you wished to make
- You may have just rolled the dice and collected resources, but don't have enough to build anything

Since there are no other options available, the only strategic choice is to end your turn and allow the game to proceed to the next player.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
