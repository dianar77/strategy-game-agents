========================================

Response:
I'll analyze your options in this Catan situation to help make the best decision.

You have the option to end your turn or make a maritime trade, exchanging 4 wood for another resource (ore, sheep, wheat, or brick).

Since maritime trade requires a 4:1 ratio, this suggests you don't have a port that would give you a better exchange rate. Let's evaluate each option:

Action 0: End your turn without making any trades.
- This conserves your wood resources for future turns.
- Choose this if you have no immediate building needs or if wood is valuable for your strategy.

Actions 1-4: Trade 4 wood for another resource.
- This only makes sense if you urgently need that specific resource to build something this turn.
- If you have plenty of wood but are missing another critical resource for immediate building, a trade might be worthwhile.

Without information about:
- Your current resources beyond wood
- What you're planning to build next
- The board state and your position
- Victory points situation

I must assume you're asking because you need to convert excess wood into something more immediately useful.

Among the trade options, the most commonly needed resources tend to be brick (for roads/settlements) and ore (for cities/development cards). But without knowing your specific needs, I can't confidently recommend one resource over another.

If you don't have an immediate building need that requires the traded resource this turn, it's generally better to end your turn and save your wood.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
