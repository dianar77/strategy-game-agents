Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
Looking at your available actions for this turn in Catan, I only see one option:

Action 0: End your turn (Color BLUE)

Since this is the only action available to you right now, there's no strategic decision to make in this case. When you only have the END_TURN action available, it means you've either:

1. Already completed all possible actions for your turn (building, trading, playing development cards)
2. Just rolled the dice but don't have resources or legal placements to build anything
3. Are at a point in the game sequence where ending your turn is the only valid move

Without seeing your current resources, board position, and other game state information, I can only confirm that ending your turn is currently your only option.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
