Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
Looking at the available actions for the game of Catan, there's only one option available:

**Action 0**: Roll the dice (BLUE player, ROLL action)

Since this is the only action available, the decision is straightforward. In Catan, rolling the dice is how you generate resources at the beginning of your turn. This roll will determine which numbered hexes produce resources, and any player with settlements or cities adjacent to those hexes will collect the corresponding resources.

Given that there are no other options presented, you should proceed with rolling the dice to start your turn.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
