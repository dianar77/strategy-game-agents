Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
I see you only have one available action in this turn of Catan, which is to end your turn.

Action 0: End your turn (Color: BLUE)

Since this is the only action available to you right now, there's no strategic decision to make in this particular moment. This typically happens when:
- You've already completed all the actions you wanted to for this turn
- You don't have the necessary resources to build anything
- You're in a phase of the game where you must end your turn to proceed

Without additional information about your current game state (resources, board position, etc.), I can only acknowledge that ending your turn is your only option at this point.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
