Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
In this situation, you only have one available action:

Action 0: Roll the dice.

This is the standard first action of a player's turn in Catan. After rolling the dice, you'll determine which resource-producing hexes are activated, and players with settlements or cities adjacent to those hexes will collect the corresponding resources.

Since there are no other options available, this is clearly the action you should take.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
