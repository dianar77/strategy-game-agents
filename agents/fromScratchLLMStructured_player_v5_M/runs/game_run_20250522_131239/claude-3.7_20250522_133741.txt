Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
I need to analyze the available actions in this Catan scenario. However, in this case, there is only one action available:

Action 0: Roll the dice (for the BLUE player)

This is a very straightforward decision since there are no alternatives. In Catan, rolling the dice is the standard way to begin your turn and determine which resource-producing hexes will generate resources for players who have settlements or cities adjacent to them.

Since rolling the dice is the only option provided, there's no strategic comparison needed with other potential actions.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
