========================================

Response:
Looking at the available actions for Catan, I can see you currently only have one option:

Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.DISCARD: 'DISCARD'>, value=None)

This is a discard action, which indicates that a 7 was rolled or a Knight card was played, and you (the BLUE player) need to discard cards because you have more than 7 resources in your hand.

When the discard action is required, you must select which resources to discard. The game rule is that you must discard half your resources (rounded down) when you have more than 7 cards and a 7 is rolled or a Knight is played.

Since there's only one action available, you don't have a choice but to execute this discard action. You'll need to select which specific resources to discard in the next step of the game.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
