Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
In this case, you only have one available action, which is to roll the dice (Action 0).

In Catan, rolling the dice is how you generate resources at the beginning of your turn. When you roll, any player with settlements or cities adjacent to hexes with the rolled number will collect resources from those hexes. This is the standard way to begin your turn in Catan.

Since this is your only available action, there's no strategic decision to make at this moment. You must roll the dice to proceed with your turn.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
