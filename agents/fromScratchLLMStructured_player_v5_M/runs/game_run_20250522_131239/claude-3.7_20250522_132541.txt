You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)
Action 1: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('ORE', 'ORE', 'ORE', 'ORE', 'BRICK'))
Action 2: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('ORE', 'ORE', 'ORE', 'ORE', 'WOOD'))
Action 3: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('ORE', 'ORE', 'ORE', 'ORE', 'SHEEP'))
Action 4: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('ORE', 'ORE', 'ORE', 'ORE', 'WHEAT'))

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
I'll analyze each available action for your Catan turn:

**Action 0: End Turn**
This simply ends your turn without making any trades or builds.

**Actions 1-4: Maritime Trade (4:1 ratio)**
All these actions involve trading 4 ore for another resource:
- Action 1: Trade 4 ore for 1 brick
- Action 2: Trade 4 ore for 1 wood
- Action 3: Trade 4 ore for 1 sheep
- Action 4: Trade 4 ore for 1 wheat

Since all the maritime trade options require 4 ore, this suggests you have at least 4 ore cards. However, without knowing:
- Your current resource inventory
- Your development cards
- Your building plans (roads, settlements, cities, dev cards)
- Board position and available building spots
- Other players' positions

It's difficult to determine which resource would be most valuable to you.

Given the limited information, I'd recommend trading for brick (Action 1) if you're looking to expand with roads and settlements, as brick is often harder to obtain. However, if you don't have immediate needs for any specific resource, ending your turn (Action 0) would be better than making an inefficient 4:1 trade.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
