Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
I need to analyze the available actions for this turn in Catan.

Looking at the given information, there's actually only one action available:
- Action 0: End Turn (for Blue player)

Since this is the only option available, it means that you've either already performed all possible actions for this turn (like building, trading, or playing development cards), or you don't have the resources or valid locations to take any other actions.

In Catan, when you can only end your turn, it typically means you've exhausted all beneficial moves for the current turn or don't have sufficient resources to do anything else.

Since there's only one option provided, the choice is clear.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
