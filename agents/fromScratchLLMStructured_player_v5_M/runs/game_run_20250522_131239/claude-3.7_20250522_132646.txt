Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)
Action 1: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('WOOD', 'WOOD', 'WOOD', 'WOOD', 'ORE'))
Action 2: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('WOOD', 'WOOD', 'WOOD', 'WOOD', 'SHEEP'))
Action 3: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('WOOD', 'WOOD', 'WOOD', 'WOOD', 'WHEAT'))
Action 4: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('WOOD', 'WOOD', 'WOOD', 'WOOD', 'BRICK'))

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
I'll help analyze the available actions for your Catan turn.

First, let's understand what each action means:
- Action 0: End your turn without doing anything else
- Actions 1-4: Maritime trade options where you would trade 4 WOOD for either ORE, SHEEP, WHEAT, or BRICK

To make a good recommendation, I need to consider what resources would be most valuable to you. However, I don't have information about:
- Your current resources (besides having at least 4 WOOD)
- What you're trying to build (roads, settlements, cities, development cards)
- The current state of the board

Since you have enough WOOD to make a maritime trade, the question is whether trading is better than simply ending your turn. Maritime trades are generally inefficient (4:1), but they can be useful when you really need a specific resource.

Without knowing your specific needs, here's my analysis:
- ORE is valuable for cities (3 ORE + 2 WHEAT) and development cards (1 ORE + 1 WHEAT + 1 SHEEP)
- BRICK is valuable for roads (1 WOOD + 1 BRICK) and settlements (1 WOOD + 1 BRICK + 1 WHEAT + 1 SHEEP)
- SHEEP and WHEAT are useful for various builds but often easier to obtain than ORE or BRICK

Since I don't have specific information about your current needs, I would recommend:

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0

Rationale: A 4:1 maritime trade is quite inefficient. Unless you urgently need a specific resource to make a critical build before another player's turn, it's typically better to hold your resources and wait for more favorable trading opportunities (with other players at 3:1 or 2:1 rates) or to get more resources through the dice rolls.
