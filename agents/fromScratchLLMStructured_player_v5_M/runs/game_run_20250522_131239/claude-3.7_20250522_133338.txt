Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)
Action 1: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('WOOD', 'WOOD', 'WOOD', 'WOOD', 'ORE'))
Action 2: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('WOOD', 'WOOD', 'WOOD', 'WOOD', 'SHEEP'))
Action 3: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('WOOD', 'WOOD', 'WOOD', 'WOOD', 'WHEAT'))
Action 4: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('WOOD', 'WOOD', 'WOOD', 'WOOD', 'BRICK'))

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
I need to analyze the available actions for the Blue player in Catan:

Action 0: End turn without doing anything else
Actions 1-4: Maritime trades where you give up 4 WOOD to receive either ORE, SHEEP, WHEAT, or BRICK

To evaluate these options, I need to understand whether trading 4 WOOD for another resource is worthwhile right now. The maritime trade ratio of 4:1 is quite expensive, so it should only be done if:
1. You have excess WOOD
2. You urgently need one of the other resources to build something important

Without knowing your:
- Current resource inventory
- Building plans
- Board position
- Victory points situation

It's difficult to make a precise recommendation. However, maritime trading at a 4:1 ratio is generally a last resort option that should only be used when you have a surplus of a resource and desperately need another one.

Given the limited information, ending your turn (Action 0) is likely the safest choice. If you don't have an immediate need for the other resources that would justify the expensive trade, it's better to wait for better trading opportunities or more favorable dice rolls.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
