Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
Based on the available actions, you only have one option: Action 0, which is to roll the dice as the Blue player.

In Catan, rolling the dice is the standard way to begin your turn, determining which resource-producing hexes will activate. Since this is your only available action, there's no strategic decision to make at this point.

After rolling, you'll likely have more meaningful choices such as building roads, settlements, cities, or trading resources based on what you receive from the roll.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
