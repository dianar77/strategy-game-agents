Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
I'm helping you decide what action to take in Catan. Let's analyze the options:

Currently, there's only one action available:
- Action 0: Roll the dice (BLUE player, ROLL action)

Since you only have one option available, this is a straightforward decision. In Catan, rolling the dice is how you generate resources at the beginning of your turn. This roll will determine which hexes produce resources, and any players with settlements or cities adjacent to those hexes will collect the corresponding resources.

Given that this is your only available action, you should proceed with rolling the dice.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
