Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)
Action 1: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('ORE', 'ORE', 'ORE', None, 'WOOD'))
Action 2: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('ORE', 'ORE', 'ORE', None, 'SHEEP'))
Action 3: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('ORE', 'ORE', 'ORE', None, 'WHEAT'))
Action 4: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('ORE', 'ORE', 'ORE', None, 'BRICK'))

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
I'll analyze your available actions in this game of Catan.

You have 5 options:
- End your turn
- Trade 3 Ore for 1 Wood
- Trade 3 Ore for 1 Sheep
- Trade 3 Ore for 1 Wheat
- Trade 3 Ore for 1 Brick

Since you can only perform maritime trades, this suggests you have at least 3 Ore cards. Let me consider what resource would be most valuable to acquire:

1. Wood: Essential for roads and settlements
2. Sheep: Needed for settlements and development cards
3. Wheat: Required for cities and development cards
4. Brick: Necessary for roads and settlements

Without knowing your exact board position, hand, or game state, it's difficult to give perfect advice. However:

- If you need to build roads to expand, Wood or Brick would be valuable
- If you're looking to build settlements, you'd need Wood, Brick, Sheep, and Wheat
- If you want to upgrade to cities, you need Ore (which you already have) and Wheat

Given a 3:1 trade ratio is expensive, I would only recommend trading if you urgently need a specific resource to make a strategic play. Otherwise, ending your turn might be better to wait for more favorable trades or rolls.

Since I don't have enough context about your specific game situation, the most conservative recommendation would be:

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0

This preserves your resources until you can make a more efficient trade or get what you need through dice rolls.
