Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
In this scenario, you only have one available action:

**Action 0**: Roll the dice

Since rolling the dice is the only available action, there's no strategic decision to be made here. Rolling the dice is the standard way to begin your turn in Catan, and it will determine which resource hexes produce resources for all players.

Rolling will generate resources for players who have settlements or cities adjacent to hexes matching the roll number. After rolling, you'll likely have more options available such as building roads, settlements, cities, or development cards, trading with other players, or ending your turn.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
