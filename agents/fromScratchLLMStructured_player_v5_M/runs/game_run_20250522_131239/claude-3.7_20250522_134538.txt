Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
Since there is only one action available to you, the choice is straightforward:

Action 0: Roll the dice. This is the standard way to begin your turn in Catan. When you roll, all players with settlements or cities adjacent to hexes showing the rolled number will collect the corresponding resources.

Rolling the dice will determine which resources are produced this turn, and is a mandatory part of your turn. After rolling, you'll likely have additional options available such as building, trading, or playing development cards.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
