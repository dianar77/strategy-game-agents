Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
I'm helping with your Catan game decision. Looking at the available actions, there's actually only one option presented:

Action 0: End your turn (BLUE player)

Since this is the only available action, there's no strategic decision to make at this point. When there's only one action available in Catan, it typically means you've completed all possible moves for your turn (building, trading, playing development cards, etc.) or you're in a situation where you must end your turn to proceed with the game.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
