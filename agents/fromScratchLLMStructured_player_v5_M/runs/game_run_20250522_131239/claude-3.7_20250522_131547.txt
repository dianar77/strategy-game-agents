Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
Looking at the available actions, you have only one option:

Action 0: End your turn (Color: BLUE, Action Type: END_TURN)

Since this is the only action available to you, there are no alternative options to analyze. This typically means that you've completed all the possible moves for your current turn (such as building, trading, or playing development cards), or perhaps it's the beginning of your turn but you don't have resources or valid locations to build anything.

When there's only an END_TURN action available, the game is essentially telling you that you have no more meaningful decisions to make during this turn.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
