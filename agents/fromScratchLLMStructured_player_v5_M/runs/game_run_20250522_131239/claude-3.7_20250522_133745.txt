Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
Looking at the available actions for this Catan turn, I only see one option:

Action 0: End Turn (BLUE player)

Since there is only one available action, there's no strategic decision to make here. This suggests that you've already completed all possible moves for your turn (such as building roads, settlements, cities, or playing development cards), or perhaps it's not your turn to make those kinds of actions.

When there's only an END_TURN action available, it means it's time to pass play to the next player.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
