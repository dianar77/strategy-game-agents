Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
Looking at the available actions, there's only one option:

Action 0: End your turn (BLUE player)

This is a situation where you have no other possible moves to make during your turn. In Catan, this happens when:
- You have no legal builds (roads, settlements, or cities) you can afford or place
- You have no development cards to play
- You've already rolled the dice for your turn
- You've already completed any trades you wanted to make

Since ending your turn is the only available action, you should take it. This will pass play to the next player.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
