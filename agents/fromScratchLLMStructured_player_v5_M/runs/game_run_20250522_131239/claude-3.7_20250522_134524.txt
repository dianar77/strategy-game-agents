========================================

Response:
I'll analyze the available actions for your turn in Catan:

Action 0: End your turn without making any trades.
Actions 1-4: Maritime trades where you'd give up 4 bricks to receive:
- Action 1: 1 wheat
- Action 2: 1 wood
- Action 3: 1 ore
- Action 4: 1 sheep

This suggests you have at least 4 brick resources, and you're considering whether to trade them for another resource or just end your turn.

The 4:1 maritime trade is generally considered inefficient - you're giving up a lot to get very little. Unless you absolutely need a specific resource right now to build something critical, it's usually better to:
1. Try for better trade ratios (3:1 ports or 2:1 specialized ports)
2. Trade with other players (often at better rates)
3. Save your resources for when you have better options

Without knowing your specific board position, building goals, and what resources other players have, it's difficult to recommend a specific trade. However, given the standard inefficiency of 4:1 trades, ending your turn is likely the better option.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
