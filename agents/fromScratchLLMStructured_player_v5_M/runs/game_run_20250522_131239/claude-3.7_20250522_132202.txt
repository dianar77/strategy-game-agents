Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
Looking at your available actions, I only see one option available to you:

Action 0: End your turn (Blue player)

Since this is the only action available to you, there's nothing to compare or analyze in terms of strategic options. This typically means you've already completed all possible moves for your turn (like trading, building, or playing development cards), and the only thing left is to end your turn and pass to the next player.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
