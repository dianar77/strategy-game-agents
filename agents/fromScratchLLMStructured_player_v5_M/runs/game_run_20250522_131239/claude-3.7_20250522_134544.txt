Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
Looking at the provided information, you only have one available action:

Action 0: End your turn (Color: BLUE, Action Type: END_TURN)

Since there's only one option available, there's no strategic decision to make here. You must end your turn and let the next player take their turn.

In Catan, ending your turn happens after you've completed all your possible moves for that turn, such as building settlements, roads, cities, or playing development cards. Once you've done everything you wanted to do with your available resources, ending your turn is the appropriate choice.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
