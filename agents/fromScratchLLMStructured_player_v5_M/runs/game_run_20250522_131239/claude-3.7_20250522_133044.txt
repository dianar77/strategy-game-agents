Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
I see you're playing Catan and need to decide on your next move. Let's analyze the available actions:

Action 0: Roll the dice (BLUE player)

This is actually your only available option right now. In Catan, rolling the dice is the standard way to begin your turn. When you roll, resource production will occur based on the number rolled and the hexes where players have settlements or cities.

Since this is the only action available, there's no strategic decision to make at this moment. You should roll the dice and see what resources you'll collect this turn. After the roll, you'll likely have more action options based on the resources you receive and your position on the board.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
