You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
It seems you are in a game of Catan and currently have only one possible action available.

Let me analyze the action:

Action 0: Roll the dice (BLUE player)

This is the standard way to begin your turn in Catan. When you roll the dice, resource production is determined based on the number rolled and which hexes have that number. All players who have settlements or cities adjacent to those hexes will receive the corresponding resources.

Since this is the only action available, there's no real choice to make here. Rolling the dice is the fundamental mechanism for gathering resources in Catan, which you'll need to build roads, settlements, cities, and development cards.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
