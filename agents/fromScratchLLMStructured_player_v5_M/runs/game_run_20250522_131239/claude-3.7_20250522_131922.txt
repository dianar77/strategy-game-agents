Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
In this case, there's only one available action for you in Catan:

Action 0: Roll the dice (BLUE player, ROLL action)

Rolling the dice is the standard way to start your turn in Catan. When you roll, the number that comes up will determine which hexes produce resources. All players who have settlements or cities adjacent to hexes with the rolled number will collect the corresponding resources.

Since there are no other actions available, this is straightforward - you need to roll the dice to proceed with your turn.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
