Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
Looking at the available actions for your Catan turn, there's actually only one option presented:

Action 0: Roll the dice (BLUE player, ROLL action)

This is the standard way to begin your turn in Catan. Rolling the dice will generate resources for all players who have settlements or cities adjacent to hexes matching the rolled number.

Since this is the only action available, there's no strategic comparison needed between multiple options. You must roll the dice to proceed with your turn.

After rolling, you'll likely have more options available such as building roads, settlements, cities, or trading, depending on what resources you receive from the roll and what resources you already have.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
