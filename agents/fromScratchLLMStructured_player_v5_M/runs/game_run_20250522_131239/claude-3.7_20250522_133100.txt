Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
I only have one action available, which is to roll the dice. In Catan, rolling the dice is how resources are distributed at the beginning of each turn, so this is a standard action to take when starting your turn.

When you roll the dice, any player with settlements or cities adjacent to hexes with the rolled number will collect resources from those hexes. For settlements, players collect 1 resource per matching hex, and for cities, they collect 2 resources per matching hex.

Since there's only one action available, there are no strategic options to weigh against each other. The only thing to do is to roll the dice and see what resources you and the other players will collect this turn.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
