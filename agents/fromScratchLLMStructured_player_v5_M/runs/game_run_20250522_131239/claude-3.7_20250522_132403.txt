Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
I'll help you make a strategic decision for your Catan turn.

Currently, you only have one available action:

Action 0: End your turn (BLUE player ends turn)

Since this is the only option available to you right now, there's nothing else you can do this turn. This typically happens when:
- You've already built or purchased what you want/can this turn
- You don't have the resources to build anything else
- You've already rolled the dice and completed your main turn actions

Without additional context about the game state (like your resources, board position, what you've already done this turn), I can only confirm that ending your turn is the only valid move at this point.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
