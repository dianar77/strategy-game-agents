Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.DISCARD: 'DISCARD'>, value=None)

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
In this situation, you only have one available action:

**Action 0**: Discard cards (DISCARD action for BLUE player)

When you have only a discard action available, it means you likely have more than 7 cards in your hand and the robber was activated (typically by someone rolling a 7). According to Catan rules, any player with more than 7 cards when a 7 is rolled must discard half of their cards (rounded down).

Since this is your only option, you must discard cards. The game interface will likely prompt you for which specific cards to discard after you select this action. When choosing which cards to discard:

- Consider discarding resources you have in abundance
- Try to keep a balanced set of resources for your immediate building plans
- If possible, keep resources that are harder for you to obtain based on your settlement/city positions

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
