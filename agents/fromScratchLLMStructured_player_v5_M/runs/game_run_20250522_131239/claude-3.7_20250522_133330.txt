Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
In this case, your available actions list has only one option:

**Action 0**: Roll the dice (BLUE player, ROLL action)

The decision is straightforward since you only have one choice. In Catan, rolling the dice is the standard way to begin your turn and determine which resource-producing hexes will generate resources for players with settlements and cities adjacent to them.

Since this is your only available action, you should proceed with rolling the dice to see what resources you and the other players will receive based on the roll outcome.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
