Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
I see you're playing Catan and need to decide what action to take. Currently, there's only one option available:

Action 0: Roll the dice (BLUE player, ROLL action)

This is a straightforward decision because:
1. Rolling the dice is your only available option
2. Rolling is how you generate resources in Catan
3. This appears to be the beginning of your turn

When there's only one action available, the decision is clear. You need to roll the dice to see what resources you and other players will collect based on the settlement/city positions.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
