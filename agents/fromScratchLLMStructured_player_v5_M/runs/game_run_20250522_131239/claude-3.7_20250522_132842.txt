Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)
Action 1: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('WOOD', 'WOOD', 'WOOD', 'WOOD', 'ORE'))
Action 2: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('WOOD', 'WOOD', 'WOOD', 'WOOD', 'SHEEP'))
Action 3: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('WOOD', 'WOOD', 'WOOD', 'WOOD', 'WHEAT'))
Action 4: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('WOOD', 'WOOD', 'WOOD', 'WOOD', 'BRICK'))

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
I'll analyze the available actions for the player in Catan:

Action 0: End the turn without doing anything else.
Actions 1-4: Maritime trade options, all trading 4 WOOD to get different resources:
- Action 1: Trade 4 WOOD for 1 ORE
- Action 2: Trade 4 WOOD for 1 SHEEP
- Action 3: Trade 4 WOOD for 1 WHEAT
- Action 4: Trade 4 WOOD for 1 BRICK

Without specific information about the current game state (like what resources you currently have, what you're planning to build, or the board position), making an optimal recommendation is difficult.

The maritime trade rate of 4:1 is quite expensive. Typically, you'd only want to do this if:
1. You really need a specific resource
2. You have excess wood
3. There are no better trading options with other players
4. You can't build a port to get better trading rates

Since I don't have enough context, and 4:1 trades are generally inefficient, ending your turn (Action 0) is likely the safest option unless you desperately need a specific resource to make a critical build.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
