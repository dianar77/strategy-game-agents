Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
I only have one action available to choose from, which is Action 0 to end my turn. Since there are no other options to consider, my analysis is straightforward:

Action 0: End Turn (Color BLUE)
- This will complete my turn and allow the next player to take their turn
- Since this is the only action available, it means I've either already used all my possible actions for this turn or I have no valid moves to make in the current game state
- Ending the turn is mandatory when there are no other actions to take

With only one option available, there's no strategic decision to make here.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
