Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
I'll analyze the available actions for your Catan turn:

**Action 0**: End your turn without any trades.

**Actions 1-4**: These are all maritime trades where you're giving up 4 WHEAT resources to get one resource in return:
- Action 1: Trade 4 WHEAT for 1 SHEEP
- Action 2: Trade 4 WHEAT for 1 BRICK
- Action 3: Trade 4 WHEAT for 1 WOOD
- Action 4: Trade 4 WHEAT for 1 ORE

This is a steep exchange rate (4:1) which suggests you don't have access to better harbor trade ratios for wheat. The decision depends on:

1. How much wheat you currently have
2. Which resources you need most urgently
3. Your immediate building goals (roads, settlements, cities, development cards)

Since I don't have information about your current resources or specific building goals, it's difficult to recommend a specific trade. However, the 4:1 trade is generally not favorable unless you're desperately in need of a specific resource and have excess wheat.

Without additional context about your game state, ending your turn (Action 0) is likely the most conservative choice. If you have an abundance of wheat and a specific need, then one of the trades might be worthwhile.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
