Action 8: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('ORE', 'ORE', 'ORE', None, 'WHEAT'))

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
I'll analyze each available action to determine the best strategic move for you in Catan.

Looking at your options, you have two main resources you can trade: ORE (3:1 ratio) and WOOD (3:1 ratio). Let me evaluate each potential trade based on what you might need:

Action 0: End your turn without making any trades.

Maritime Trade Options:
- Actions 1 & 7: Trade ORE for WOOD or WOOD for ORE - These are generally inefficient as you're trading 3:1 between resources you already have.
- Actions 2 & 4: Trade WOOD or ORE for BRICK - Brick is valuable for roads and settlements.
- Actions 3 & 6: Trade WOOD or ORE for SHEEP - Sheep is useful for development cards and settlements.
- Actions 5 & 8: Trade WOOD or ORE for WHEAT - Wheat is needed for cities and development cards.

Without knowing your specific needs (what you're building next, your current victory points, or what resources you need), it's difficult to make a highly tailored recommendation. However, I can make some general observations:

Since you have enough ORE and WOOD to make multiple maritime trades, you likely have excess of these resources. Trading for resources that complement what you already have would be most beneficial.

BRICK is often in high demand for expansion (roads and settlements), while WHEAT is crucial for city upgrades and development cards. SHEEP tends to be more common and sometimes less valuable.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 2 (Trade WOOD for BRICK)

Trading wood for brick is typically a good choice as brick is often scarce yet essential for expansion. However, if you're specifically focusing on city upgrades, Action 5 (trade for wheat) might be better.
