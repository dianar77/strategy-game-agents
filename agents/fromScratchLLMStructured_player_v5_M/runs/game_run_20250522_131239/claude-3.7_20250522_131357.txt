Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
Looking at the available actions, I can see that you only have one option:

Action 0: End your turn (Color: BLUE, Action Type: END_TURN)

Since this is the only action available to you, there are no strategic decisions to make at this moment. When only END_TURN is available, it means you've completed all possible actions for your turn or you have no valid moves to make.

In Catan, this typically happens when:
- You've already completed your building/trading for this turn
- You don't have the resources to build anything
- You've already rolled the dice and completed all possible actions

Without additional context about your current game state (your resources, board position, etc.), I can only recommend taking the only available action.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
