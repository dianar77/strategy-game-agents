You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
Looking at the available actions for this game of Catan, I can see there is only one option available to you:

Action 0: Roll the dice (BLUE player, ROLL action)

Since this is the only action available, there's no strategic decision needed at this moment. Rolling the dice is the standard way to begin your turn in Catan, which will determine which resource hexes produce resources for all players.

After rolling, you'll likely have more action choices based on the resources you receive and what you can build or trade.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
