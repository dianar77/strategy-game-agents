Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
Since there's only one action available to you (Action 0), which is to roll the dice, there's no strategic decision to be made at this moment in the game.

Rolling the dice is the standard way to start your turn in Catan. The roll will determine which hexes produce resources, and all players who have settlements or cities adjacent to those hexes will collect the corresponding resources.

Since this is your only option, you should proceed with rolling the dice and then evaluate your next moves based on the resources you and other players receive.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
