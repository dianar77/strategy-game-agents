Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
I only see one available action here, which is to end your turn (Action 0). 

Since this is the only option available to you at this moment in the game, there are no alternative actions to analyze or compare. When there's only one legal action available in Catan, it usually means you've completed all possible moves for your turn (building, trading, playing development cards) or you're in a situation where you can't do anything else.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
