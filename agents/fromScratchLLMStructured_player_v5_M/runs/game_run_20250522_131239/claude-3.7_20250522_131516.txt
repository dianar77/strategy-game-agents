Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
Since there's only one action available to choose from, this is an easy decision:

Action 0: Roll the dice. Rolling is the standard way to begin your turn in Catan, determining which resource-producing hexes will activate.

When you roll the dice, any hex with the corresponding number will produce resources for players who have settlements or cities adjacent to that hex. This is how you collect resources that you'll need for building and development.

Since this is your only option right now, you should proceed with rolling the dice.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
