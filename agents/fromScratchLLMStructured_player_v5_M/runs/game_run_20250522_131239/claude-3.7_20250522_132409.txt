# Catan Action Analysis

There's only one available action here, which is to roll the dice for the Blue player.

In Catan, rolling the dice is the primary way to generate resources at the beginning of your turn. When you roll, any hexes with the corresponding number will produce resources for players with settlements or cities adjacent to those hexes.

Since this is the only action available, there's no strategic decision to make at this moment - you need to roll to continue your turn.

**RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0**
