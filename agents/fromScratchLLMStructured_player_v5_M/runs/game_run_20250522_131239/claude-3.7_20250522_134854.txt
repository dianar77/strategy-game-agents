Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
Looking at the available actions, I only see a single option:

Action 0: End Turn (for BLUE player)

Since there is only one action available, there's no strategic decision to make here. You must end your turn as you have no other actions available to perform at this moment.

This usually happens when you've already completed all possible actions for your current turn (like building, trading, playing development cards, etc.) or when you're unable to take any other actions due to resource constraints.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
