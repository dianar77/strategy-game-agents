Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
I only see one available action option:

Action 0: Roll the dice (for the BLUE player)

Since there are no other options available, this is clearly the only choice. In Catan, rolling the dice is the standard way to begin a turn, determining which resources players will receive based on the hexes adjacent to their settlements and cities.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
