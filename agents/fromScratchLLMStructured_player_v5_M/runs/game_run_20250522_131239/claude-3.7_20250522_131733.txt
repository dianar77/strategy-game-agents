You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
Looking at the available actions for this turn in Catan, I see there's only one option:

Action 0: Roll the dice (BLUE player)

This is the beginning of your turn, and rolling the dice is the first mandatory action in Catan. Rolling will determine which resource hexes produce resources for all players who have settlements or cities adjacent to those hexes.

Since this is the only available action, there's no strategic decision to make at this point. After rolling, you'll likely have more options based on the outcome (trading, building, playing development cards, etc.).

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
