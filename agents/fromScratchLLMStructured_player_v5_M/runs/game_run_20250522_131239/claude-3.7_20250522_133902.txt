Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
Looking at the available actions, there is only one option:

Action 0: Roll the dice (Color BLUE, Action Type ROLL)

This is the standard beginning of a turn in Catan where you roll the dice to determine which resource hexes produce resources. Since this is the only available action, there's no strategic decision to make at this point.

Rolling the dice will determine which number is rolled and consequently which players receive resources based on their settlements and cities adjacent to hexes with that number. After the roll, you'll likely have more options available such as trading, building, or playing development cards.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
