Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
Looking at the available actions, there's only one option presented:

Action 0: End Turn (Color: BLUE)

This is a simple decision since you have no alternatives. When there's only an END_TURN action available, it means you've either:
1. Already completed all possible moves for your turn
2. Have no valid moves to make at this point in the game
3. Must end your turn as the next required step in the game flow

Without any alternatives to consider or additional context about the game state, the only reasonable choice is to end your turn.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
