Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
Since there is only one available action (Action 0: Roll), there's no strategic decision to make here. 

In Catan, rolling the dice is a fundamental part of the game - it determines resource production for all players. Rolling is mandatory at the beginning of your turn unless you have other pre-roll actions available (which doesn't appear to be the case here).

When you roll, any settlements or cities adjacent to hexes with the rolled number will produce resources for their owners. This is the main way players collect resources in the game.

Since this is your only option, you should proceed with rolling the dice.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
