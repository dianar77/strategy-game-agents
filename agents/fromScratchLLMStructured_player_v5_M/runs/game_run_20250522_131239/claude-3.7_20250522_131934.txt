Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
I need to analyze the options for your turn in Catan. However, I only see one available action:

Action 0: End your turn (Color BLUE)

Since this is the only option available to you, it indicates that you've already performed all possible actions for this turn or have no valid moves remaining. In Catan, this typically happens when:
- You've already built/purchased what you wanted this turn
- You don't have sufficient resources for any additional builds
- You've already traded if you wanted to
- You've already played a development card if you wanted to

Without seeing other possible actions or your current game state (resources, building options, etc.), I can only recommend the one available choice.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
