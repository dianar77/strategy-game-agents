Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
Looking at the available actions for this Catan turn, there is only one option presented:

Action 0: End your turn (BLUE player)

This is a straightforward situation where you have no other choices available. This typically occurs when:
- You have already performed all the actions you're allowed in this turn
- You've already built what you can afford to build
- You've already played any development cards you wanted to play
- You've completed any trades you wanted to make

Since there's only one option available, the decision is clear.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
