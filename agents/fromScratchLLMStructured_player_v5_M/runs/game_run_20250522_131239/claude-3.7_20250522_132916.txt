========================================

Response:
I need to analyze the strategic options for trading in Catan. Let's examine each action:

Action 0: End your turn without making any trades.

Actions 1-4: These are all maritime trade options where you're trading 4 WOOD to receive one of the following resources:
- Action 1: Trade 4 WOOD for 1 ORE
- Action 2: Trade 4 WOOD for 1 SHEEP
- Action 3: Trade 4 WOOD for 1 WHEAT
- Action 4: Trade 4 WOOD for 1 BRICK

Without knowing your current resource counts, victory points, or building plans, the maritime trade ratio of 4:1 is generally inefficient. These trades should only be considered if you're specifically trying to build something immediately and just need one more resource.

Since I don't have information about your specific resource needs or immediate building goals, ending your turn (Action 0) is likely the most conservative choice. Maritime trades at 4:1 are usually suboptimal unless you really need a specific resource and have no better way to get it.

If you do decide to trade, consider which resource you most urgently need for your next building project (settlement, city, or development card).

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
