AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
I'll help you analyze your options for this turn in Catan.

In this case, there's actually only one available action:
- Action 0: Roll the dice (BLUE player, action type ROLL)

Rolling the dice is how you start each turn in Catan. After rolling, resources will be produced based on the outcome, and then you'll have additional options like building roads, settlements, cities, or trading.

Since there's only one available action, the decision is straightforward. You need to roll the dice to begin your turn.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
