# Game State Analysis

I'll analyze the current game state and available actions to provide a strategic recommendation.

## Current Position
- You have 4 victory points vs. opponent's 6 points
- Resources: 0 WOOD, 1 BRICK, 4 SHEEP, 0 WHEAT, 1 ORE
- Buildings: 2 settlements, 0 cities, 3 roads

## Action Analysis

Your options are to either end your turn or perform a maritime trade trading 4 SHEEP for another resource.

Since we're in the early game and falling behind in victory points, we need to focus on expansion. To build either roads or settlements, we need:
- Road: 1 BRICK + 1 WOOD
- Settlement: 1 BRICK + 1 WOOD + 1 SHEEP + 1 WHEAT

Looking at your current resources:
- You already have 1 BRICK and 4 SHEEP
- You're missing WOOD and WHEAT for building

Since expansion is the priority and you mentioned securing WOOD and BRICK as a strategic consideration, getting WOOD through maritime trade would allow you to build a road immediately.

**RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 2** (Maritime trade 4 SHEEP for 1 WOOD)

This would give you the WOOD and BRICK needed to build a road, continuing your expansion strategy. This is preferable to ending your turn without using your abundant SHEEP resource, and better than trading for other resources that won't enable immediate building.
