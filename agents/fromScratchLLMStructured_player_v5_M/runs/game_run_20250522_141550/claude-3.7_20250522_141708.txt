Current Game State:
Your color: Color.BLUE
Your victory points: 2
Your resources: {'WOOD': 2, 'BRICK': 1, 'SHEEP': 1, 'WHEAT': 0, 'ORE': 1}
Your buildings: {'settlements': 2, 'cities': 0, 'roads': 4}

Opponents:
- Color.RED: 3 victory points, Buildings: {'settlements': 3, 'cities': 0, 'roads': 6}

Strategic Considerations:
- Early Game: Focus on expanding by building roads and settlements.
- Prioritize securing BRICK and WOOD resources for expansion.

# Game State Analysis

Looking at your current game state:
- You have 2 victory points (from your 2 settlements)
- Resources: 2 WOOD, 1 BRICK, 1 SHEEP, 0 WHEAT, 1 ORE
- You can build a road with your current resources (costs 1 WOOD, 1 BRICK)
- Your opponent is slightly ahead with 3 victory points

## Road Building Options

Let me analyze each road building option:

Action 1: Road at (3, 4)
Action 2: Road at (19, 20)
Action 3: Road at (20, 22)
Action 4: Road at (2, 9)
Action 5: Road at (0, 5)
Action 6: Road at (3, 12)
Action 7: Road at (1, 6)

Without seeing the full board layout, I need to focus on strategic principles:
- Roads should lead to potential settlement spots
- Ideally, we want to expand toward high-value resource hexes or ports
- We should try to block opponent expansion when possible
- Roads that extend our network and create future building options are preferable

Since this is early game and you need expansion, building a road is better than ending your turn. Building a road uses your available BRICK (which is crucial for expansion) and one of your WOOD resources.

Based on the action numbering and typical board layouts, actions like Action 2 (19, 20) and Action 3 (20, 22) are likely extending from one of your current settlements toward new building opportunities.

## Recommendation

Without seeing the specific board layout, I'll recommend building a road based on early game strategy principles.

**RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 2**

This road at (19, 20) is likely extending your network from an existing settlement toward valuable building locations. By building this road, you're using your limited BRICK resource effectively and setting yourself up for future settlement placement to catch up with your opponent's victory points.
