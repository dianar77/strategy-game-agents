# Game State Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state and available actions:

## Current Status
- I have 4 victory points (likely from 2 settlements)
- Opponent has 6 victory points
- I have resources: 1 WOOD, 1 BRICK, 0 SHEEP, 0 WHEAT, 1 ORE
- I have 2 settlements, 0 cities, and 3 roads built
- The opponent has 4 settlements and 14 roads

## Available Actions
All available actions except for ending turn involve building roads at different locations. Building a road costs 1 WOOD + 1 BRICK, which I currently have.

## Strategic Analysis
1. I'm 2 points behind the opponent, and it's early game
2. I have exactly the resources needed to build one road
3. Building a road is a necessary step toward placing new settlements
4. Since I can't immediately build a settlement (would need sheep and wheat too), I should focus on positioning for future settlement locations

Without seeing the actual board layout, I need to make an educated guess about which road position gives me the best strategic advantage. I should build a road that:
- Extends toward valuable resource hexes
- Opens up potential settlement spots
- Blocks the opponent from expanding into key areas

Since I don't have specific information about the board layout, I'll choose a road that likely extends my current network based on node numbering. Roads (12,13) and (3,12) might be extending from one of my existing settlements.

## Recommendation

**RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 1** - Build a road at position (12,13)

This appears to be extending from my existing network and positions me for future settlement construction. Building a road now uses my available resources efficiently and follows the early game strategy of expansion.
