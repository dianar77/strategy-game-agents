# Game State Analysis

Looking at your current state:
- You have 2 victory points, trailing opponent's 3 points
- You have strong WOOD (4) and BRICK (3) resources, which are ideal for road and settlement expansion
- You're lacking WHEAT, which will be needed for settlements and cities

## Action Analysis

You have several options:
1. **End your turn** (Action 0) - Not optimal since you have resources to use
2. **Build roads** (Actions 1-7) - This would use 1 WOOD + 1 BRICK, leaving you with 3 WOOD and 2 BRICK
3. **Maritime trade** (Actions 8-11) - These are inefficient 4:1 trades of your WOOD for other resources

The most strategic approach now is to build a road to enable future settlement placement since:
- You need settlements to gain more victory points
- You need to expand your network to reach new settlement spots
- You have sufficient WOOD and BRICK resources

Among the road options, I need to select the one that opens up the most promising future settlement locations or blocks your opponent's expansion. Without seeing the full board layout, I'll recommend building a road since you have the necessary resources.

**RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 1**
Building a road at (1, 2) will extend your network and set you up for future settlement construction. This uses your resources efficiently while working toward increasing your victory points.
