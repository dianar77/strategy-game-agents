Prompt:
Current Game State:
Your color: Color.BLUE
Your victory points: 2
Your resources: {'WOOD': 0, 'BRICK': 2, 'SHEEP': 0, 'WHEAT': 3, 'ORE': 3}
Your buildings: {'settlements': 2, 'cities': 0, 'roads': 2}

Opponents:
- Color.RED: 5 victory points, Buildings: {'settlements': 1, 'cities': 2, 'roads': 3}

Strategic Considerations:
- Early Game: Focus on expanding by building roads and settlements.
- Prioritize securing BRICK and WOOD resources for expansion.

Available Actions (3):
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)
Action 1: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_CITY: 'BUILD_CITY'>, value=0)
Action 2: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_CITY: 'BUILD_CITY'>, value=2)

Analyze each available action and recommend the best one. Consider your current resources, victory points, and building opportunities. Aim to maximize your chances of winning by securing key resources and building strategically.

Specify your choice by indicating 'RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X' where X is the action index.

# Action Analysis for Blue Player

Let me analyze the current game state and available actions to provide a strategic recommendation.

## Current Situation Assessment
- You have 2 victory points (from 2 settlements)
- Opponent (Red) has 5 victory points (from 1 settlement and 2 cities)
- You have BRICK (2), WHEAT (3), and ORE (3), but no WOOD or SHEEP
- Your available actions are ending your turn or upgrading one of your settlements to a city

## Action Analysis

**Action 0: End Turn**
- This would waste your current resources
- No progress toward victory points
- Given the opponent's 3-point lead, this is not recommended

**Action 1: Build City at Location 0**
- Costs: 2 WHEAT + 3 ORE (which you have exactly)
- Benefits: +1 victory point (from 2 to 3)
- Would use all your WHEAT and ORE resources

**Action 2: Build City at Location 2**
- Costs: 2 WHEAT + 3 ORE (which you have exactly)
- Benefits: +1 victory point (from 2 to 3)
- Would use all your WHEAT and ORE resources

## Strategic Recommendation

Both building actions would give you the same immediate benefit (+1 victory point). The choice between locations 0 and 2 should depend on:

1. Which settlement has better resource production potential
2. Which location has more strategic value for future expansion

Since we don't have specific information about the locations' resource yields, either option is better than ending your turn with unused resources.

**RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 1** (Build City at Location 0)

This will increase your victory points to 3 and double the resource production at this settlement, helping you catch up to your opponent who already has 5 points.
