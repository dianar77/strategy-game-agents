# Analysis of Robber Placement Options

Looking at the current game state, I need to make a strategic decision about where to place the robber and potentially steal a card from the RED player, who has 3 victory points.

## Key Considerations:
1. RED is my only opponent and has more roads (5) than me (2), suggesting they're focusing on expansion
2. I should target RED's resource production to slow them down
3. Ideally, I want to place the robber on a high-value hex that RED has access to

## Available Options to Target RED:
- Action 0: Hex (0, 0, 0), can steal from RED
- Action 3: Hex (-1, 0, 1), can steal from RED
- Action 4: Hex (-1, 1, 0), can steal from RED
- Action 5: Hex (0, 1, -1), can steal from RED
- Action 6: Hex (1, 0, -1), can steal from RED
- Action 14: Hex (-1, 2, -1), can steal from RED
- Action 15: Hex (1, 1, -2), can steal from RED

Without knowing the exact resource production values of each hex, I'll need to make my best guess. Since RED has built 5 roads but only 3 settlements, they likely have good access to BRICK and WOOD. Targeting these resources would be most effective to slow their expansion.

Looking at RED's building pattern, they appear to be focusing on expansion with roads. Actions 0, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are on the central hexes, which typically have better number tokens and therefore higher resource production probability. Among those, I'd prioritize hexes that might produce BRICK or WOOD.

## RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
This targets hex (0, 0, 0) and allows me to steal from RED. Central hexes typically have higher production value, and this placement has the potential to disrupt RED's ability to gather critical expansion resources.
