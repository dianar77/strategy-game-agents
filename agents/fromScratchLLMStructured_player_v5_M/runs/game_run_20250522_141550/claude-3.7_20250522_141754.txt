# Game State Analysis and Action Recommendation

I'll analyze the current game state and each available action to determine the best move.

## Current Situation
- You have 3 victory points vs. opponent's 9 points
- Resources: 4 WOOD, 0 BRICK, 4 SHEEP, 0 WHEAT, 1 ORE
- Buildings: 3 settlements, 0 cities, 6 roads
- You're in the mid-game and significantly behind in points

## Strategy Assessment
You need to catch up quickly by:
- Focusing on city upgrades (need WHEAT and ORE)
- Potentially purchasing development cards
- You're completely missing WHEAT and need more ORE and BRICK

## Action Analysis:
- Actions 1-8 are maritime trades (4:1 ratio)
- Trading SHEEP for WHEAT (Action 7) or WOOD for WHEAT (Action 8) makes the most sense given the strategic consideration to acquire WHEAT for city upgrades
- Between these options, Action 7 (trading SHEEP for WHEAT) is better since you have equal amounts of WOOD and SHEEP, but WOOD is more versatile for roads

## Decision
Trading SHEEP for WHEAT is the best option because:
1. It addresses your immediate resource gap (you have 0 WHEAT)
2. It helps move toward city upgrades (need WHEAT + ORE)
3. It preserves WOOD which can be used with BRICK for roads later
4. You'll still have 0 SHEEP remaining after the 4:1 trade

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 7
