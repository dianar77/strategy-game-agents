# Robber Placement Analysis

Looking at your situation, I need to choose a robber placement that will most effectively impede your opponent (RED) who is currently leading with 5 victory points while creating the best advantage for you.

## Key Observations:
- RED is ahead with 5 victory points versus your 2
- You have WHEAT and ORE resources but lack WOOD and SHEEP (with only 1 BRICK)
- You need to focus on expansion to catch up to RED
- All available actions are MOVE_ROBBER actions

## Best Robber Placements to Target RED:
I'll analyze the actions where RED can be targeted:
- Actions 1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 all allow you to steal a card from RED

Since RED is in the lead with 5 points, targeting them is the optimal strategy. The goal should be to:
1. Disrupt their highest-producing hex
2. Steal a potentially useful resource from them (ideally WOOD or BRICK which you need for expansion)

Looking at the coordinates, it's difficult to tell exactly which hexes are most productive without a visual representation. However, the most effective strategy would be to target a hex that:
- RED relies on for resources
- Produces resources you currently need (WOOD or SHEEP)
- Has the highest probability of being rolled (numbers closest to 7)

Action 2 ((-1, 0, 1) targeting RED) is particularly promising as this coordinate pattern often corresponds to more central, valuable hexes on the board.

## RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 2
This places the robber on hex (-1, 0, 1) and allows you to steal a card from RED. This should help slow their progress while potentially gaining a resource you need for expansion, which is your current strategic priority.
