# Robber Placement Strategy Analysis

I need to choose where to move the robber, and this is a critical decision that can impact the game. Let me analyze the situation systematically:

## Current Game State Assessment
- I have 3 victory points vs RED's 6 points (RED is clearly ahead)
- I have WHEAT and ORE resources but no WOOD, BRICK, or SHEEP
- RED has more buildings than I do (2 settlements, 2 cities vs my 1 settlement, 1 city)

## Robber Placement Priority
Since RED is ahead with 6 victory points (double mine), I should definitely target them to slow their progress. Actions 0-3, 6-11 all target RED player, which aligns with this strategy.

## Hex Selection Considerations
Without knowing the exact resource production of each hex or their probability values, I'll focus on:
1. Targeting RED player to steal a resource
2. Blocking their likely key resource production

Looking at the structure of the actions, I notice actions 0-5 are probably the inner hexes (higher likelihood of good number tokens), while 6-17 are outer hexes.

Since RED has 2 cities and 2 settlements, they likely have better resource generation than I do. Given they're ahead in victory points, they might have access to good WOOD and BRICK hexes which I'm lacking.

## Decision
I'll choose one of the inner hexes that targets RED, as these are typically more productive hexes:

**RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0**

This places the robber on hex (1, -1, 0) and targets the RED player. This gives me a chance to:
1. Steal a resource from RED
2. Block what is likely an important production hex for them
3. Slow down their progress while I work on catching up

The inner hexes generally have better number tokens, so disrupting RED's access to one of these hexes should have more impact than choosing an outer hex.
