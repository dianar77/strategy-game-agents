# Analysis of Available Actions

Looking at your current game state and the available actions, I'll evaluate each option:

## Current Situation
- You have 2 victory points vs. Red's 5 points (you're behind)
- Your resources: 4 WOOD, 0 BRICK, 0 SHEEP, 3 WHEAT, 2 ORE
- You need to expand but lack BRICK resources for roads/settlements

## Action Analysis

**Action 0: End Turn**
- This wastes your opportunity to improve your position
- With Red at 5 points, you need to be proactive

**Action 1: Maritime Trade - 4 WOOD for 1 BRICK**
- You have excess WOOD (4)
- BRICK is critically needed for expansion
- This would give you 1 BRICK, enabling potential road building
- Aligns with your strategic goal of expanding with roads and settlements

**Actions 2-4: Maritime Trade for WHEAT/ORE/SHEEP**
- You already have sufficient WHEAT (3) and ORE (2)
- Getting more SHEEP could help with future settlements but BRICK is more urgent

## Strategic Recommendation
Since you're behind in points and need to expand, trading for BRICK is clearly the best option. BRICK is your limiting resource for road/settlement expansion, which you critically need to increase your victory points.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 1

Trading 4 WOOD for 1 BRICK will enable you to build a road (1 WOOD + 1 BRICK) and set yourself up for future settlement placement, which is essential for catching up to the leading player.
