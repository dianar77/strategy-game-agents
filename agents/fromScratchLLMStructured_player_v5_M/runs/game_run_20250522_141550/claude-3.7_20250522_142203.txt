# Game State Analysis

Looking at the current game state, I notice:
- You have 3 victory points vs. Red's 6 victory points (Red is ahead by 3 points)
- Your resources are limited: primarily ORE (3) and WHEAT (1)
- You have built 1 settlement, 1 city, and 3 roads
- You're still in early game based on your victory points
- Red has more developed buildings with 2 settlements, 2 cities, and 4 roads

## Available Actions Analysis

**Action 0: PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD**
- Playing a knight card would allow you to:
  - Move the robber to block an opponent's resource production
  - Potentially steal a resource from Red
  - Contribute toward the "Largest Army" special victory card (worth 2 points)
- However, this doesn't directly help your immediate need for BRICK and WOOD resources

**Action 1: ROLL**
- Rolling gives you a chance to collect resources based on your settlements/cities
- This could potentially get you the BRICK and WOOD you need for expansion
- Rolling is the standard progression action to continue your turn

## Recommendation

Since you need BRICK and WOOD resources for expansion and your current resources (ORE and WHEAT) aren't immediately useful without those basic expansion resources, rolling is your better option to potentially gain needed resources.

The knight card can be saved for a more strategic moment, such as when:
- You're competing for largest army
- You need to block a critical resource hex from Red
- You need to steal a specific resource to complete a build

**RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 1** (ROLL)
