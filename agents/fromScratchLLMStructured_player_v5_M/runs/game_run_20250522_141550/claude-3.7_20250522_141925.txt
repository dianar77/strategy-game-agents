# Game Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state and available actions:

## Current Situation
- You have 2 victory points (from 2 settlements)
- Resources: 1 WOOD, 0 BRICK, 1 SHEEP, 1 WHEAT, 1 ORE
- This is early game with only 2 settlements and 2 roads

## Available Actions
- Action 0: END_TURN
- Action 1: BUY_DEVELOPMENT_CARD (costs 1 ORE, 1 WHEAT, 1 SHEEP)

## Analysis

You have exactly the resources needed to purchase a development card (1 ORE, 1 WHEAT, 1 SHEEP). Development cards can be extremely valuable as they may provide:
- Victory points (kept hidden until used for victory)
- Knights (help gain Largest Army = 2 VP)
- Year of Plenty (get 2 resources of your choice)
- Monopoly (collect all of one resource type from opponents)
- Road Building (build 2 roads for free)

Your lack of BRICK is a concern for expansion, making immediate road/settlement building impossible. Since you can't build anything else this turn, and development cards are valuable strategic assets, purchasing one would be the optimal move.

The alternative is to end your turn with unused resources, which risks losing them to a robber roll (7) before your next turn.

## Recommendation

**RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 1**

Buying a development card is your best move because:
1. You have the exact resources required
2. It potentially brings you closer to victory through hidden VP or special abilities
3. You can't build roads or settlements due to lack of BRICK
4. It's better to use resources now than risk losing them to a robber
