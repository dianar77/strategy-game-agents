# Robber Placement Analysis

I need to choose the best hex to place the robber, targeting RED (who has more victory points) where possible.

## Strategic Goals:
- Disrupt the RED player (who has 3 VP vs my 2 VP)
- Block hexes that are most valuable to RED
- Choose hexes where I can steal resources from RED

## Available Actions:
I can place the robber on any hex, but only hexes with RED's settlements/cities give me the opportunity to steal from them. These are:
- Action 1: Hex (1, -1, 0) and steal from RED
- Action 2: Hex (0, -1, 1) and steal from RED  
- Action 5: Hex (1, 0, -1) and steal from RED
- Action 7: Hex (1, -2, 1) and steal from RED
- Action 15: Hex (1, 1, -2) and steal from RED
- Action 16: Hex (2, 0, -2) and steal from RED
- Action 17: Hex (2, -1, -1) and steal from RED

Since RED has more victory points and buildings than me, I should definitely choose an action where I can steal from them. Without knowing the exact resource production of each hex, I'll prioritize disrupting RED's ability to build more.

Given RED's extensive road network (5 roads), they're likely planning to expand further. The best strategy is to place the robber on a hex that's producing resources RED needs most for expansion (BRICK and WOOD).

## Decision:
Without specific hex resource information, the optimal strategy is to place the robber on a hex where RED has settlements and I can steal from them. This slows their progress while potentially giving me resources.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 1

This places the robber at hex (1, -1, 0) and allows me to steal from RED. Placing the robber early in the board coordinates suggests this might be a central, high-value hex that would significantly disrupt RED's resource gathering.
