Prompt:
Current Game State:
Your color: Color.BLUE
Your victory points: 1
Your resources: {'WOOD': 0, 'BRICK': 0, 'SHEEP': 0, 'WHEAT': 0, 'ORE': 0}
Your buildings: {'settlements': 1, 'cities': 0, 'roads': 0}

Opponents:
- Color.RED: 1 victory points, Buildings: {'settlements': 1, 'cities': 0, 'roads': 1}

Strategic Considerations:
- Early Game: Focus on expanding by building roads and settlements.
- Prioritize securing BRICK and WOOD resources for expansion.

Available Actions (3):
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(0, 1))
Action 1: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(0, 20))
Action 2: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(0, 5))

Analyze each available action and recommend the best one. Consider your current resources, victory points, and building opportunities. Aim to maximize your chances of winning by securing key resources and building strategically.

Specify your choice by indicating 'RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X' where X is the action index.

# Action Analysis for Blue Player

Let me analyze each of the available road building options to determine the most strategic move.

## Current Situation
- You're early in the game with just 1 settlement and 0 roads
- You have no resources currently
- Your opponent (Red) has 1 settlement and 1 road
- You need to expand by building roads to reach new settlement locations

## Action Analysis

**Action 0: Build Road at (0, 1)**
- This connects from your current settlement toward hex coordinate 1
- Road positioning could lead toward: [analysis incomplete without board visualization]

**Action 1: Build Road at (0, 20)**
- This connects from your current settlement toward hex coordinate 20
- Road positioning could lead toward: [analysis incomplete without board visualization]

**Action 2: Build Road at (0, 5)**
- This connects from your current settlement toward hex coordinate 5
- Road positioning could lead toward: [analysis incomplete without board visualization]

## Strategic Evaluation

Without seeing the full board layout, resource tiles, or number tokens, I must make my recommendation based on general early-game Catan strategy:

1. The ideal road should lead toward unclaimed high-probability resource spots
2. Priority should be given to directions that could secure brick and wood (for further expansion)
3. Roads should extend toward 3-way intersections for more building flexibility

Given the limited information provided, I'll need to make a recommendation based on standard opening strategy, assuming these are free starting roads in the setup phase.

## RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 2

Action 2 (building a road at (0, 5)) appears to be the most promising option as the lower vertex number suggests it might be closer to the center of the board where resource diversity is typically better. This is based on common vertex numbering patterns in digital Catan implementations.

However, I note that without seeing the actual board configuration (resource types, number tokens, and existing pieces), this recommendation carries uncertainty.
