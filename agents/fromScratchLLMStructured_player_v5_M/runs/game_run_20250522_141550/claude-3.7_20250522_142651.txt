# Move Robber Action Analysis

Looking at the current game state, I need to make a strategic decision about where to place the robber. Since this is a forced move after a 7 was rolled or a Knight card was played, I should use this opportunity to hinder my opponent while potentially gaining resources.

## Key Observations:
- I'm behind in victory points (2 vs. 3)
- The RED player has more settlements (3 vs. my 2) and more roads (5 vs. my 2)
- I have no resources currently
- All available actions are MOVE_ROBBER actions

## Strategic Priorities:
1. Target the RED player since they're ahead of me
2. Place the robber on a hex that disrupts their resource generation
3. Choose a location where I can steal a resource from RED

## Action Analysis:
Looking at the available actions, several allow me to target the RED player:
- Actions 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 13, 14, and 15 all allow me to place the robber on a hex and steal from RED

Without knowing the exact resource production of each hex, I need to make an educated guess. Given that our strategic considerations mention prioritizing BRICK and WOOD for expansion, I should target hexes that might produce these resources for my opponent.

Since Actions 0, 2, 3, 4, and 5 involve hexes closer to the center of the board (coordinates with smaller absolute values), these are likely to be more valuable productive hexes.

## RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0

By selecting Action 0, I place the robber on the (0, 0, 0) hex (likely a central, high-value hex) and steal a resource from the RED player. This targets my opponent who is currently in the lead while potentially disrupting their resource generation on a valuable hex.
