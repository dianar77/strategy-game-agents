# Analysis of Available Actions

Let me analyze the current game state and available actions to determine the best strategic move.

## Current Situation
- You have 4 victory points with 2 settlements (worth 2 VP each)
- Your resources: 1 WOOD, 1 BRICK, 3 SHEEP, 0 WHEAT, 1 ORE
- You can build roads (cost: 1 WOOD, 1 BRICK)
- You have exactly enough resources for one road

## Action Analysis

All your available actions except ending your turn involve building a road, which makes sense since you have exactly the right resources (1 WOOD, 1 BRICK).

When deciding where to build a road, I need to consider:
1. Which road positions will lead toward potential new settlement locations
2. Which road will help block opponent expansion
3. Which road extends your existing network most efficiently

Since I don't have complete information about the board layout, I need to make some assumptions about the connections between these nodes and potential settlement spots.

The actions that build roads connected to your existing network are likely Actions 1-5, as they seem to have node numbers that suggest connectivity. Action 6 (29, 30) appears potentially disconnected from your current network.

Roads that extend toward unoccupied intersections with good resource potential would be ideal, but without that information, I should recommend extending in the direction that gives you the most options for future expansion.

## Recommendation

Based on the early game strategy of expanding your network, and having exactly the resources needed for one road:

**RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 1** (Build a road at (10, 11))

This appears to be extending from one of your existing settlements or roads, which will help you continue your expansion path. Building this road now will use your BRICK and WOOD efficiently before your turn ends, setting you up to potentially build a settlement in a future turn once you acquire more resources.

If you end your turn without building a road, you waste the opportunity to use your BRICK and WOOD resources effectively, which are critical for early game expansion.
