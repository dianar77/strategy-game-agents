Strategic Considerations:
- Early Game: Focus on expanding by building roads and settlements.
- Prioritize securing BRICK and WOOD resources for expansion.

# Analysis of Available Actions

I need to assess which road building option provides the best strategic advantage in this early game situation.

## Current Situation
- We have 2 victory points (from our 2 settlements)
- Resources: 1 wood and 2 brick - perfect for building a road
- We're in the early game where expansion is critical
- We have 1 road already built

## Action Analysis

**Action 0: BUILD_ROAD at (3, 4)**
This builds a road connecting nodes 3 and 4. Without seeing the full board layout, I need to evaluate if this expands towards valuable resource tiles or potential settlement locations.

**Action 1: BUILD_ROAD at (2, 3)**
This builds a road connecting nodes 2 and 3. This could potentially extend from one of our existing settlements.

**Action 2: BUILD_ROAD at (3, 12)**
This builds a road connecting nodes 3 and 12. This may offer expansion in a different direction.

## Strategic Assessment

Without seeing the full board layout including resource hexes, I'll prioritize:
- Roads that extend from our existing settlements
- Roads that lead toward high-value resource hexes (particularly sheep, wheat, or ore which we currently lack)
- Roads that block opponent expansion paths
- Roads that open up future settlement placement options

Based on the node numbering system, road (2,3) likely connects to an existing settlement, while (3,4) and (3,12) extend our network in different directions. In early game, creating expansion paths is essential.

## RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 1

Building a road at (2,3) seems most likely to extend from one of our existing settlements, which is a priority in the early game. This should create a path for future expansion and potential new settlement locations.
