Your resources: {'WOOD': 0, 'BRICK': 1, 'SHEEP': 3, 'WHEAT': 1, 'ORE': 1}
Your buildings: {'settlements': 2, 'cities': 0, 'roads': 3}

Opponents:
- Color.RED: 6 victory points, Buildings: {'settlements': 4, 'cities': 0, 'roads': 10}

Strategic Considerations:
- Early Game: Focus on expanding by building roads and settlements.
- Prioritize securing BRICK and WOOD resources for expansion.

Available Actions (2):

# Strategic Analysis

Let me evaluate the current game state and available actions:

## Current Position
- You have 4 victory points vs opponent's 6 points
- Your resources: BRICK (1), SHEEP (3), WHEAT (1), ORE (1)
- You're lacking WOOD (0)
- You have 2 settlements and 3 roads built

## Action Analysis

**Action 1: Buy Development Card (costs SHEEP + WHEAT + ORE)**
- You have exactly the resources needed (1 SHEEP, 1 WHEAT, 1 ORE)
- Development cards can provide:
  - Victory points (immediate but hidden)
  - Knights (defense against robber + potential Largest Army bonus)
  - Road Building (free roads to expand)
  - Year of Plenty or Monopoly (resource advantages)
- This would use most of your resources, leaving you with just 1 BRICK and 2 SHEEP

**Action 0: End Turn**
- Conserves your resources
- Allows you to collect more resources next turn
- Delays any strategic moves

## Strategic Recommendation

Given that you're 2 points behind your opponent and have limited building options (no WOOD for roads or settlements), buying a development card is a strategic choice that could:
1. Potentially give you an immediate victory point
2. Provide a knight or special card to improve your position
3. Use resources that aren't immediately helpful for building

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 1 (Buy Development Card)

This gives you the best chance to close the gap with your opponent while awaiting better resource combinations in future turns.
