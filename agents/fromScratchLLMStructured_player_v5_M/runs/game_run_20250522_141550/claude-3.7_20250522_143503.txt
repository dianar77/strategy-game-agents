# Game State Analysis

Looking at the current game state, here's what stands out:
- You're at 4 victory points while your opponent has 6
- You have limited resources: 1 SHEEP, 1 WHEAT, 2 ORE
- You only have two available actions: END_TURN or BUY_DEVELOPMENT_CARD

## Resource Analysis
You can buy a development card with 1 ORE + 1 WHEAT + 1 SHEEP, which matches exactly what you have. This would leave you with 1 ORE remaining.

## Strategic Considerations
1. Your opponent is 2 points ahead, so you need to accelerate your progress
2. You lack BRICK and WOOD which are needed for expansion (roads and settlements)
3. Development cards could provide:
   - Victory point cards (immediate hidden points)
   - Knight cards (toward Largest Army bonus - 2 points)
   - Road Building, Monopoly, or Year of Plenty cards (strategic advantages)

## Decision Reasoning
Buying a development card is optimal because:
- It uses resources you currently have that don't help with building roads/settlements
- It could provide an immediate victory point or strategic advantage
- You can't build anything else with your current resources
- Ending your turn without using your resources isn't efficient

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 1 (BUY_DEVELOPMENT_CARD)
