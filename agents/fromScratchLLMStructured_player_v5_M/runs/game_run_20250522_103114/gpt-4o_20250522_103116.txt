Response:
To advise properly, I need key details about the board: resource hex placements, number distributions, and settlements/roads placement. Generally, prioritize high-frequency resources (e.g., 6s/8s for brick, wood, ore, wheat, or sheep). If resource balance is poor, prioritize settlements on diverse numbers to ensure steady production. Early goals should lean towards roads/settlements if expansion spots are contested, or fast city-building if Ore/Wheat/Sheep synergy is strong. Trade shrewdly to patch shortages and block opponents aggressively at key chokepoints.
