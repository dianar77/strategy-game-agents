Response:
To provide actionable advice, I need to know the board layout, Color.BLUE's starting settlements, roads, and available resources. Generally, prioritize **wood, brick, and ore** for early expansion and city upgrades. Focus on **connecting settlements via roads** to valuable resource hexes and securing ports if possible. If you lack a key resource (e.g., brick), target trades or monopolize adjacent hexes. Expand toward strong production hexes with high probability (5, 6, 8, 9). Build settlements first to claim resources, then cities to scale production. If specific board details are available, I can refine this further.
