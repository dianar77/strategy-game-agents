Prompt:
Current Game State:
Your color: Color.BLUE
Your victory points: 1
Your resources: {'WOOD': 0, 'BRICK': 0, 'SHEEP': 0, 'WHEAT': 0, 'ORE': 0}
Your buildings: {'settlements': 1, 'cities': 0, 'roads': 0}

Opponents:
- Color.RED: 1 victory points, Buildings: {'settlements': 1, 'cities': 0, 'roads': 1}

Strategic Considerations:
- Early Game: Focus on expanding by building roads and settlements.
- Prioritize securing BRICK and WOOD resources for expansion.

Available Actions (3):
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(6, 23))
Action 1: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(23, 52))
Action 2: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(22, 23))

Analyze each available action and recommend the best one. Consider your current resources, victory points, and building opportunities. Aim to maximize your chances of winning by securing key resources and building strategically.

Specify your choice by indicating 'RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X' where X is the action index.

# Strategic Analysis of Available Actions

I'll analyze the three road-building options based on the current game state and strategic considerations.

## Current Situation
- You have 1 victory point from your single settlement
- You have no resources currently
- This appears to be the initial road placement phase since you're placing your first road
- The opponent (RED) has already placed a settlement and a road

## Action Analysis

All three actions involve building a road connected to node 23, which suggests your settlement is likely at node 23. Let's analyze each road option:

**Action 0: Build road between nodes 6 and 23**
- This road extends from your settlement toward node 6
- Direction may lead to new resource opportunities

**Action 1: Build road between nodes 23 and 52**
- This road extends from your settlement toward node 52
- Different direction, offering alternative expansion paths

**Action 2: Build road between nodes 22 and 23**
- This road extends from your settlement toward node 22
- Third possible expansion direction

## Strategic Recommendation

Without a map visualization, it's difficult to determine exactly which nodes provide better resource access. However, in the early game, the key priority is to build roads that enable you to:
1. Access diverse resources (especially BRICK and WOOD for further expansion)
2. Reach valuable unclaimed nodes for future settlements
3. Block potential expansion paths for opponents

Since this is likely your initial road placement, picking the direction that allows access to the resources you lack (especially BRICK and WOOD) would be most beneficial.

Without specific terrain information, I recommend choosing Action 0 as it's typically best to expand toward numbered hexes with higher probability of producing resources.

**RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0**
