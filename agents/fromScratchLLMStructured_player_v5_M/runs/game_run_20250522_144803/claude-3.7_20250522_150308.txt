Response:
# Game State Analysis

I'll analyze the current game state and available actions to recommend the best move.

## Current Assessment
- We're early in the game (initial placement phase) with 1 settlement and 1 road already placed
- We have 0 resources, which means this is likely the second settlement placement in the initial setup
- The opponent (RED) has already placed both settlements (2 victory points)

## Strategic Analysis for Second Settlement Placement
During initial setup, it's critical to:
1. Diversify resource access
2. Target high-probability number tiles
3. Focus on BRICK and WOOD for early expansion
4. Consider ports if strategically valuable
5. Position for future expansion

Without seeing the board configuration (resource types and probability numbers), I can only make general recommendations based on the action types. All the available actions are settlement placements, which confirms we're in the initial setup phase.

Since this is the second settlement placement, we should prioritize resources that complement our first settlement's location, to ensure diverse resource collection. Ideally, we want access to all five resource types across our two settlements.

## Recommendation
Since all the actions are settlement placements and I don't have information about the resource tiles or numbers at each location, I cannot make a fully informed decision about which specific location is best.

In this situation, I would rely on the general principles for second settlement placement:
- Choose a location that gives access to resources you don't already have from your first settlement
- Prioritize high probability numbers (6, 8, 5, 9)
- Ensure good access to BRICK and WOOD if possible
- Look for locations with 3 different resources

**RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 20**

Note: Without board information showing resource types and probability numbers at each possible settlement location, this recommendation is essentially arbitrary. In a real game, you would want to carefully analyze the specific resources and probabilities at each potential settlement location.
