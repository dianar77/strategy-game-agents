# Analysis of Available Actions

Looking at the current game state and available actions, I'll analyze the best strategic move for BLUE.

## Current Situation Assessment
- You have 2 victory points with 2 settlements and 2 roads
- Resource inventory: 3 WOOD, 0 BRICK, 4 SHEEP, 0 WHEAT, 2 ORE
- Red player also has 2 victory points but slightly more infrastructure (3 roads)

## Action Analysis

**Action 0: End Turn**
- This would waste your opportunity to improve your position this turn.

**Actions 1-4: Maritime Trade Options**
All these trades involve giving up 4 SHEEP to get 1 of another resource:
- Action 1: Trade 4 SHEEP for 1 WOOD (would give you 4 WOOD total)
- Action 2: Trade 4 SHEEP for 1 WHEAT (would give you 1 WHEAT)
- Action 3: Trade 4 SHEEP for 1 ORE (would give you 3 ORE)
- Action 4: Trade 4 SHEEP for 1 BRICK (would give you 1 BRICK)

## Strategic Priority
Your strategic considerations correctly note that you should prioritize BRICK and WOOD for expansion. You already have 3 WOOD but 0 BRICK. Without BRICK, you cannot build roads or settlements.

For immediate expansion (roads and settlements), the most valuable trade would be for BRICK, which you completely lack. One BRICK would let you use some of your WOOD to build a road.

## Recommendation

**RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 4**

Trade 4 SHEEP for 1 BRICK. This will give you the necessary resource to build a road in a future turn (when combined with your existing WOOD). Early expansion through roads and settlements is critical, and this trade supports that goal directly.
