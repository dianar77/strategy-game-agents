Prompt:
Current Game State:
Your color: Color.BLUE
Your victory points: 1
Your resources: {'WOOD': 0, 'BRICK': 0, 'SHEEP': 0, 'WHEAT': 0, 'ORE': 0}
Your buildings: {'settlements': 1, 'cities': 0, 'roads': 0}

Opponents:
- Color.RED: 0 victory points, Buildings: {'settlements': 0, 'cities': 0, 'roads': 0}

Strategic Considerations:
- Early Game: Focus on expanding by building roads and settlements.
- Prioritize securing BRICK and WOOD resources for expansion.

Available Actions (2):
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(26, 27))
Action 1: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(25, 26))

Analyze each available action and recommend the best one. Consider your current resources, victory points, and building opportunities. Aim to maximize your chances of winning by securing key resources and building strategically.

Specify your choice by indicating 'RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X' where X is the action index.

# Game State Analysis

I'll analyze the current game state and available actions to determine the best strategic move.

## Current Situation
- You have 1 victory point from your single settlement
- You have no resources currently
- You have two possible road building options
- It's early in the game where expansion is critical

## Action Analysis

**Action 0: Build Road at (26, 27)**
This would extend a road from your settlement to position 27.

**Action 1: Build Road at (25, 26)**
This would extend a road from your settlement to position 25.

## Strategic Considerations
Since you have no resources but are being offered road building options, this appears to be the initial placement phase of the game where you get free roads connected to your starting settlements.

The decision comes down to which direction offers better expansion opportunities. Without seeing the full board layout, resource distributions, or number tokens, I need to make a recommendation based on general early game principles:

1. Roads should lead toward high-probability resource hexes
2. Roads should point toward areas that aren't already crowded with opponents
3. Roads should create pathways to build future settlements

Without complete board information, both actions appear equally viable. However, choosing a direction that gives you flexibility for future expansion is important.

## RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0

I recommend Action 0 to build the road at (26, 27), as this will help you expand your network and work toward additional settlements, which are crucial for early resource generation and victory points.
