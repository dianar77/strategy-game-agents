========================================

# Analysis of Current Game State

I notice this appears to be the initial settlement placement phase of Settlers of Catan, where players place their first settlements without needing resources. Currently:
- You have 1 victory point (from your first settlement)
- The opponent has 1 victory point
- You have no resources
- You need to select a location for your second settlement

## Strategy for Second Settlement Placement

For the second settlement, I should focus on:
1. Diversifying resource access (getting access to resources I don't have from my first settlement)
2. Prioritizing high-probability numbers
3. Accessing brick and wood (critical for early expansion)
4. Positioning for potential future expansion

Without knowing the specific board layout (resource types and number tokens), I can't give perfect advice. However, in the initial placement, it's generally wise to secure access to as many different resource types as possible, with particular emphasis on brick and wood.

## Decision

Without specific board information showing resource types and probability numbers at each vertex, I can't make a fully informed recommendation based on the exact optimal spot.

In this situation, I would normally recommend placing the settlement at a vertex that gives access to brick and wood if possible, or a spot with high-probability numbers across three different resources.

Since I don't have that specific board information, I'll recommend:

**RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 22**

This action represents building a settlement at vertex 28, which is an arbitrary choice without seeing the actual board configuration. In a real game, I would analyze the specific resources and probability numbers at each potential settlement location before making this decision.
