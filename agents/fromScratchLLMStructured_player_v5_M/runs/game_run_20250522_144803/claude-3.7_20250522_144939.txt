# Game State Analysis

I'll analyze the current game state and available actions to determine the optimal move.

## Current Status
- You have 2 victory points (behind Red's 3 points)
- Resources: WOOD (1), BRICK (0), SHEEP (4), WHEAT (2), ORE (0)
- Buildings: 2 settlements, 0 cities, 4 roads

## Available Actions
- End turn
- Four maritime trade options to convert 4 SHEEP into either: WOOD, WHEAT, ORE, or BRICK

## Strategic Analysis

You're in the early game with a focus on expansion, and currently have an abundance of SHEEP but lack BRICK completely. For expansion, BRICK and WOOD are essential resources as:
- Road = 1 BRICK + 1 WOOD
- Settlement = 1 BRICK + 1 WOOD + 1 WHEAT + 1 SHEEP

Since you already have 1 WOOD and 2 WHEAT but 0 BRICK, acquiring BRICK would be most beneficial to enable building roads and potentially settlements.

Trading 4 SHEEP for 1 BRICK (Action 4) would allow you to build at least one road when combined with your existing WOOD. This aligns with your early game strategy of expansion and secures a critical resource you're completely missing.

## Decision

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 4

This maritime trade will convert 4 SHEEP into 1 BRICK, allowing you to build a road immediately and positioning you for potential settlement expansion on your next turn. This is the most efficient use of your abundant SHEEP resource to address your most critical shortage.
