# Analysis of Robber Placement Options

Looking at the current game state, I see that:
- You have 2 victory points compared to RED's 4 points
- RED is ahead with 2 cities while you have 2 settlements
- You have limited resources (only 2 WOOD)
- This is a robber placement decision

## Strategic Considerations:

Since RED is ahead with 4 victory points (double your current score), the best strategy is to slow them down by targeting their resource production.

Looking at the available actions, I notice several options that allow you to place the robber on a hex adjacent to RED's buildings (indicated by "<Color.RED: 'RED'>" in the action description).

The actions that target RED are:
- Action 0: Place robber at (1, -1, 0)
- Action 3: Place robber at (-1, 1, 0)
- Action 6: Place robber at (2, -2, 0)
- Action 12: Place robber at (-2, 2, 0)
- Action 13: Place robber at (-1, 2, -1)
- Action 17: Place robber at (2, -1, -1)

Since RED has built cities (which produce double resources), it's most strategic to place the robber on a hex adjacent to one of their cities, if possible. Without specific board information about which hexes are most productive or which resources RED needs most, targeting RED directly is the best general approach.

Among these options, I'd prioritize ones that might block RED's high-probability resource tiles (though we don't have that specific information).

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0

This will place the robber at (1, -1, 0) and target RED, potentially stealing a resource and impeding their production. This should help slow down their progress while you work on catching up in victory points.
