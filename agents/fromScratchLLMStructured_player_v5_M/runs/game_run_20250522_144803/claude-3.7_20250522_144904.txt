Response:
# Analysis of Available Actions

I'll analyze the current game state and evaluate each available action to determine the optimal strategy.

## Current Situation
- You have 2 victory points with 2 settlements (same as opponent)
- Resources: 2 WOOD, 0 BRICK, 4 SHEEP, 1 WHEAT, 0 ORE
- You need more BRICK to continue expanding (roads and settlements)

## Action Analysis

**Action 0: End Turn**
- Passing your turn without using your resources
- Not ideal when you have enough resources for a beneficial trade

**Action 1: Maritime Trade (4 SHEEP for 1 WOOD)**
- You already have 2 WOOD
- Getting a 3rd WOOD without BRICK doesn't help immediate building opportunities

**Action 2: Maritime Trade (4 SHEEP for 1 WHEAT)**
- You already have 1 WHEAT
- Getting a 2nd WHEAT doesn't enable any immediate building

**Action 3: Maritime Trade (4 SHEEP for 1 ORE)**
- You currently have 0 ORE
- Getting 1 ORE alone doesn't enable any immediate building
- Cities require 3 ORE and 2 WHEAT

**Action 4: Maritime Trade (4 SHEEP for 1 BRICK)**
- You currently have 0 BRICK
- BRICK is critical for expansion (roads cost 1 WOOD + 1 BRICK)
- Would allow you to build a road with your existing 2 WOOD
- Expansion is the priority in early game as mentioned

## Recommendation

**RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 4** (Maritime Trade: 4 SHEEP for 1 BRICK)

This action provides the resource you most urgently need for expansion. You'll be able to immediately build a road (1 WOOD + 1 BRICK), which puts you closer to building more settlements and increasing your victory points. Since you're in the early game phase, expansion via roads and settlements is the correct strategic focus.
