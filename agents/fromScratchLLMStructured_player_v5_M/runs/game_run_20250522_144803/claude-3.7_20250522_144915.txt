Prompt:
Current Game State:
Your color: Color.BLUE
Your victory points: 2
Your resources: {'WOOD': 2, 'BRICK': 1, 'SHEEP': 0, 'WHEAT': 1, 'ORE': 0}
Your buildings: {'settlements': 2, 'cities': 0, 'roads': 3}

Opponents:
- Color.RED: 2 victory points, Buildings: {'settlements': 2, 'cities': 0, 'roads': 4}

Strategic Considerations:
- Early Game: Focus on expanding by building roads and settlements.
- Prioritize securing BRICK and WOOD resources for expansion.

Available Actions (7):
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)
Action 1: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(0, 20))
Action 2: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(3, 4))

Action 6: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(1, 6))

Analyze each available action and recommend the best one. Consider your current resources, victory points, and building opportunities. Aim to maximize your chances of winning by securing key resources and building strategically.

# Game State Analysis

I'll analyze the current game state and available actions to determine the optimal move:

## Current Resources
- WOOD: 2
- BRICK: 1
- SHEEP: 0
- WHEAT: 1
- ORE: 0

These resources allow for building roads (each road costs 1 WOOD + 1 BRICK), and you have exactly enough for one road.

## Building Options
You have 6 potential road placements available. The key consideration is which road position:
1. Extends toward valuable resource nodes
2. Blocks opponent expansion
3. Creates paths toward future settlement locations

Since this appears to be early game (both you and opponent have 2 VP), expansion is critical. Without a map visualization, I can't determine the exact resource locations near each possible road placement.

## Strategy Analysis
Since you have exactly enough resources for one road and cannot build settlements (which would require WOOD + BRICK + WHEAT + SHEEP), the best approach is to build a road that maximizes future expansion opportunities.

Without specific map information, the optimal choice would be to build a road that:
- Extends from your current network in a direction that leads to high-value hexes
- Creates potential for future settlement locations
- Potentially blocks your RED opponent from key areas

Given the limited information about the board layout, I'll recommend building a road as the most strategic move rather than ending your turn, as expansion is crucial in the early game.

## RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 3

I recommend building a road at position (2, 9). This uses your available WOOD and BRICK resources to continue expanding your network. Without more specific board information, this represents making progress rather than passing your turn.
