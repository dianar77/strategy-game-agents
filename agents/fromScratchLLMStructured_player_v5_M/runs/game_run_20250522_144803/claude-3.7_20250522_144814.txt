Prompt:
Current Game State:
Your color: Color.BLUE
Your victory points: 2
Your resources: {'WOOD': 1, 'BRICK': 0, 'SHEEP': 0, 'WHEAT': 2, 'ORE': 0}
Your buildings: {'settlements': 2, 'cities': 0, 'roads': 1}

Opponents:
- Color.RED: 1 victory points, Buildings: {'settlements': 1, 'cities': 0, 'roads': 1}

Strategic Considerations:
- Early Game: Focus on expanding by building roads and settlements.
- Prioritize securing BRICK and WOOD resources for expansion.

Available Actions (3):
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(1, 2))
Action 1: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(2, 3))
Action 2: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(2, 9))

Analyze each available action and recommend the best one. Consider your current resources, victory points, and building opportunities. Aim to maximize your chances of winning by securing key resources and building strategically.

Specify your choice by indicating 'RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X' where X is the action index.

# Strategic Analysis of Available Actions

## Current Situation Assessment
You're in the early game with 2 victory points from your two settlements. You have limited resources (1 WOOD, 2 WHEAT) and need to plan your expansion carefully. You have enough resources to build a road (requires 1 WOOD and 1 BRICK), but you currently have 0 BRICK.

## Action Analysis

All three available actions are BUILD_ROAD options, which suggests this might be part of initial placement or you've been given a free road opportunity, as you don't currently have the required BRICK resource.

**Action 0: Build road at (1, 2)**
- Connects from your current position toward coordinate 1
- Potential direction for future expansion

**Action 1: Build road at (2, 3)**
- Connects from your current position toward coordinate 3
- Another potential expansion direction

**Action 2: Build road at (2, 9)**
- Connects from your current position toward coordinate 9
- A third expansion option

Without knowing the full board layout, including the resource tiles and number tokens, it's difficult to determine precisely which road would be optimal. However, in the early game, you want to prioritize roads that:

1. Lead toward high-probability resource tiles
2. Move toward unoccupied intersections where you can build settlements
3. Block opponent expansion paths if necessary
4. Lead toward BRICK and WOOD resources which you'll need for further expansion

Since all options appear to be free road placements (as you lack BRICK), I would need more information about the board configuration to make a fully informed decision.

Based on the limited information provided, and considering typical Catan strategy:

**RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0**

This recommendation is based on the assumption that direction (1, 2) offers good settlement opportunities or leads toward valuable resources, but with the available information, all actions appear relatively equal without more context about the board layout.
