# Robber Placement Analysis

Looking at the current game state, I need to make a strategic robber placement. Let's analyze the situation:

1. I'm significantly behind with only 2 victory points, while RED has 9 points (close to winning).
2. I need to prioritize actions that directly hinder RED's progress.
3. I should target hexes that both block RED's resource production and might allow me to steal a resource from them.

## Actions that Target RED

Actions 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 16, and 17 all allow me to place the robber on a hex adjacent to RED's settlements/cities AND steal a resource from them.

Since RED is close to winning with 9 victory points, disrupting their resource generation and stealing from them is my highest priority.

## Analyzing Optimal Placement

Without a detailed map showing which resources are on which hexes, I'll need to make a strategic decision based on RED's building pattern:
- RED has 3 cities and 15 roads, suggesting they have strong resource production
- With 3 cities, RED likely has good access to ORE and WHEAT
- The hex coordinates might indicate productive locations

Actions 12 and 13 target hexes (-2, 2, 0) and (-1, 2, -1), which appear to be in a corner region of the board. These might be premium resource locations that RED has developed with cities.

## Decision

Given RED's substantial lead, I need to make the most impactful move possible to disrupt their production.

**RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 12**

This places the robber at coordinates (-2, 2, 0) and allows me to steal a resource from RED. Without knowing the exact resource production of each hex, this appears to be an edge/corner hex that could potentially be a high-value location that RED has built around, given their strong position in the game.
