# Action Analysis for Blue Player

Looking at the current game state:
- You have 2 victory points vs Red's 6
- You only have 3 WHEAT resources
- You need to focus on expanding with roads and settlements

## Analysis of Available Actions:

**Action 0: End Turn**
- This would waste your opportunity to use your WHEAT resources
- Not recommended when you can make a strategic trade

**Actions 1-4: Maritime Trade Options**
- All trade options require 3 WHEAT for 1 resource
- This is a standard 3:1 maritime trade ratio
- Let's evaluate each potential resource acquisition:

**Action 1: Trade 3 WHEAT for 1 SHEEP**
- Sheep alone won't help immediate expansion
- Not a priority resource for roads or settlements

**Action 2: Trade 3 WHEAT for 1 ORE**
- Useful for city upgrades and development cards
- But you need WOOD and BRICK first for expansion

**Action 3: Trade 3 WHEAT for 1 WOOD**
- WOOD is critical for roads and settlements
- This starts building your expansion resources

**Action 4: Trade 3 WHEAT for 1 BRICK**
- BRICK is essential for roads and settlements
- This starts building your expansion resources

## Strategic Decision:

Since you're significantly behind in victory points (2 vs 6), immediate expansion is crucial. The strategic considerations specifically mention prioritizing BRICK and WOOD for expansion.

Between WOOD and BRICK, I would recommend trading for BRICK as it's typically the more scarce resource of the two essential building materials.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 4

This trade gives you 1 BRICK, which is a step toward building a road (requiring 1 WOOD + 1 BRICK). In future turns, you can focus on acquiring WOOD to continue your expansion strategy.
