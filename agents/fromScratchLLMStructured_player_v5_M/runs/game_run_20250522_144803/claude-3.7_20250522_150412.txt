# Robber Placement Analysis

I need to decide where to place the robber, considering its impact on my opponent who is ahead with 3 victory points compared to my 2 points.

## Key Considerations:
- RED opponent is ahead with 3 VP and has more buildings than me
- I should target RED where possible to slow their progress
- Need to focus on gaining WOOD and BRICK resources for expansion

## Analysis of Actions:
The robber placement actions that specifically target RED are:
- Action 3: ((−1, 0, 1), RED)
- Action 4: ((0, 1, −1), RED)
- Action 9: ((−1, −1, 2), RED)
- Action 10: ((−2, 0, 2), RED)
- Action 13: ((−1, 2, −1), RED)

Without knowing the exact resource production of each hex, I need to make a strategic decision based on what's available. Since RED has a city and more roads, they likely have better resource generation that I need to disrupt.

Among these options, I'll prioritize one that targets RED and potentially blocks a valuable resource hex. Since we're in the early game and I need WOOD and BRICK for expansion, preventing RED from getting those resources would be ideal.

## RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 4
Moving the robber to (0, 1, -1) and targeting RED seems to be the most strategic choice. This allows me to potentially steal a resource from RED and block one of their productive hexes, which could slow down their progress while I work on catching up.
