# Analysis of Available Actions

## Current Situation
- You have 2 victory points vs opponent's 3 points
- Limited resources: 2 WOOD and 1 ORE
- Early game phase with 2 settlements and 3 roads built

## Action 0: Play Knight Card
Playing a Knight card would:
- Allow you to move the robber to any hex
- Steal a random resource from an opponent
- Contribute toward the "Largest Army" special card (worth 2 victory points)

However, I don't see confirmation that you actually have a Knight card in your hand. The action is available, but playing development cards usually requires having purchased them previously.

## Action 1: End Turn
Ending your turn would:
- Allow you to collect resources on the next dice roll
- Give you a chance to build on your next turn after gathering more resources

## Strategic Assessment
With your current resources (2 WOOD, 1 ORE), you cannot build any new settlements, roads, or cities. You need BRICK for roads and settlements, which you currently lack.

Since you cannot build anything useful with your current resources and there's uncertainty about whether you actually have a Knight card, ending your turn to collect more resources is the most reasonable choice.

**RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 1** (End Turn)

This allows you to collect more resources on the next turn and potentially expand your position. Next turn, focus on acquiring BRICK to enable road and settlement building to catch up to your opponent.
