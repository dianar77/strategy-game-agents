Current Game State:
Your color: Color.BLUE
Your victory points: 1
Your resources: {'WOOD': 0, 'BRICK': 0, 'SHEEP': 0, 'WHEAT': 0, 'ORE': 0}
Your buildings: {'settlements': 1, 'cities': 0, 'roads': 0}

Opponents:
- Color.RED: 1 victory points, Buildings: {'settlements': 1, 'cities': 0, 'roads': 1}

Strategic Considerations:
- Early Game: Focus on expanding by building roads and settlements.
- Prioritize securing BRICK and WOOD resources for expansion.

Available Actions (3):
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(28, 29))
Action 1: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(10, 29))
Action 2: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(29, 30))

Analyze each available action and recommend the best one. Consider your current resources, victory points, and building opportunities. Aim to maximize your chances of winning by securing key resources and building strategically.

# Action Analysis for Blue Player

I'll analyze each of the three road building options available to determine which offers the best strategic advantage.

## Current Status
- You have 1 settlement and no roads yet
- Red opponent has 1 settlement and 1 road
- You currently have no resources
- You need to expand to gain access to more resources

## Available Actions
All three actions involve building roads from node 29, which must be where your current settlement is located.

### Action 0: Build Road (28, 29)
This road connects your settlement to node 28, opening up expansion northward.

### Action 1: Build Road (10, 29)
This road connects your settlement to node 10, potentially allowing you to expand westward.

### Action 2: Build Road (29, 30)
This road connects your settlement to node 30, allowing expansion eastward.

## Strategic Evaluation
Since we're in the early game and have no resources currently, the key consideration is which road provides the best path for future expansion:

1. We need to create paths to new potential settlement locations
2. We should aim to reach high-value resource hexes that we currently don't have access to
3. We should consider which direction might block the opponent's expansion

Without detailed information about the board layout (resource distributions and number tokens), I need to make a general recommendation based on expansion opportunity.

## Recommendation
In the early game, it's generally best to build roads that open up the most options for future settlements while targeting key missing resources (especially BRICK and WOOD).

Based on the node numbering pattern (which typically follows some logical order on the board), building toward node 30 likely moves toward the edge of the board, while the other options might provide more central expansion opportunities.

**RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 1**

This road connection to node 10 likely provides expansion toward the center of the board, giving you more flexibility for your next settlement and potentially access to new resource types. However, if you have specific knowledge about valuable resource locations, you should adjust this recommendation accordingly.
