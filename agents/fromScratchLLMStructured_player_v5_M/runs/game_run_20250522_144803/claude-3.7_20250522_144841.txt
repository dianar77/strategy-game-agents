Prompt:
Current Game State:
Your color: Color.BLUE
Your victory points: 2
Your resources: {'WOOD': 1, 'BRICK': 1, 'SHEEP': 3, 'WHEAT': 1, 'ORE': 0}
Your buildings: {'settlements': 2, 'cities': 0, 'roads': 2}

Opponents:
- Color.RED: 2 victory points, Buildings: {'settlements': 2, 'cities': 0, 'roads': 4}

Strategic Considerations:
- Early Game: Focus on expanding by building roads and settlements.
- Prioritize securing BRICK and WOOD resources for expansion.

Available Actions (6):
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)
Action 1: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(0, 20))
Action 2: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(2, 3))
Action 3: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(2, 9))
Action 4: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(0, 5))
Action 5: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(1, 6))

Analyze each available action and recommend the best one. Consider your current resources, victory points, and building opportunities. Aim to maximize your chances of winning by securing key resources and building strategically.

Specify your choice by indicating 'RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X' where X is the action index.

# Catan Action Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state and available actions:

## Current Resources
- Wood: 1
- Brick: 1
- Sheep: 3
- Wheat: 1
- Ore: 0

## Current Situation
- You have exactly enough resources (1 Wood + 1 Brick) to build one road
- You have 2 victory points from your 2 settlements
- You're tied with the Red player who also has 2 victory points
- Building a road now will help with future settlement expansion

## Action Analysis
All five building actions (1-5) require the same resources (1 Wood + 1 Brick), so the decision comes down to strategic road placement.

Without seeing the exact board layout, I need to evaluate which road position would:
1. Progress toward potential settlement locations
2. Block opponent expansion
3. Lead toward resource diversity (particularly Brick and Wood which you need)

The best approach in early game is to extend from your current settlements toward promising building locations or to claim important pathways before your opponent.

Based on the action indices and typical Catan strategy, building a road that creates a path toward future settlement locations while potentially blocking the opponent's expansion route would be most advantageous.

## RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 2
Building a road at (2, 3) appears to be a strategic choice to expand your network. This allows you to progress toward new settlement locations while using your available Wood and Brick resources effectively.

After building this road, focus on acquiring more Wood and Brick to continue expanding, or gather resources for your next settlement (which will require Wood, Brick, Sheep, and Wheat).
