# Action Analysis for Current Game State

Let me analyze each available action considering your current resources, game state, and strategic goals.

## Current Situation
- You have 2 victory points (vs. RED's 3)
- Resources: 3 WHEAT, 1 ORE, no WOOD, BRICK or SHEEP
- Buildings: 2 settlements, 0 cities, 2 roads
- The strategic goal is to expand with roads and settlements, which primarily requires BRICK and WOOD

## Action Analysis

**Action 0: END_TURN**
- This wastes your opportunity to use your resources strategically
- You'd keep your 3 WHEAT and 1 ORE, but not make any progress this turn

**Action 1: MARITIME_TRADE (3 WHEAT for 1 SHEEP)**
- SHEEP is useful for settlements and development cards
- However, you still need WOOD and BRICK for roads/settlements

**Action 2: MARITIME_TRADE (3 WHEAT for 1 ORE)**
- You already have 1 ORE
- Getting another ORE doesn't help immediate expansion needs

**Action 3: MARITIME_TRADE (3 WHEAT for 1 WOOD)**
- WOOD is a priority resource for expansion
- This gets you closer to building roads (need WOOD+BRICK)
- Aligns with your strategic goal of expansion

**Action 4: MARITIME_TRADE (3 WHEAT for 1 BRICK)**
- BRICK is a priority resource for expansion
- This gets you closer to building roads (need WOOD+BRICK)
- Aligns with your strategic goal of expansion

## Strategic Decision

Since your strategic focus is expansion and you need both WOOD and BRICK, trading for either is reasonable. However, getting just one won't let you build anything immediately.

Given that the opponent is ahead in victory points and has more roads built, acquiring the resources for expansion is critical. Between WOOD and BRICK, either trade makes sense, but I'll recommend BRICK since it might be slightly harder to obtain in typical Catan configurations.

**RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 4** (Trade 3 WHEAT for 1 BRICK)

This begins your resource collection for road building and expansion, addressing your strategic priority. Next turn, you should focus on acquiring WOOD to complement this BRICK.
