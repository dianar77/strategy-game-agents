Response:
# Analysis of Robber Placement Options

I need to carefully evaluate where to place the robber to maximize my strategic advantage while hindering my opponent who has 7 victory points (significantly ahead of my 2 points).

## Opponent Analysis
- Color.RED has 7 victory points with 1 settlement, 2 cities, and 11 roads
- They are in a strong position and should be targeted

## My Resource Situation
- I have WOOD: 1, WHEAT: 2, but critically lack BRICK which is essential for expansion

## Robber Placement Evaluation

Looking at the available actions, I need to prioritize:
1. Placing the robber on a hex where RED has buildings
2. Potentially stealing a resource from RED
3. Ideally targeting hexes that produce resources I don't need or that benefit RED significantly

The actions that allow me to target RED (including stealing) are:
- Actions 3, 4, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13

Since RED is ahead with 7 victory points versus my 2, I should absolutely target them with my robber placement. Looking at the available options, any placement that targets RED is preferable to a placement that doesn't affect any player.

Among the options that target RED, the optimal choice would be to place the robber on a hex that:
1. Blocks a valuable resource that RED needs
2. Doesn't block resources I critically need (BRICK and WOOD for expansion)

Since I don't have specific information about which resources each hex produces, the best general approach is to place the robber where it can impact RED's strongest production points, likely near their cities.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 4

This places the robber at coordinate (0, 1, -1) and targets RED for stealing a resource, which helps me both block RED's production and potentially gain a resource I need.
