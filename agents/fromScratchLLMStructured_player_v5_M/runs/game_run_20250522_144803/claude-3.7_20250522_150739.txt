Prompt:
Current Game State:
Your color: Color.BLUE
Your victory points: 2
Your resources: {'WOOD': 1, 'BRICK': 0, 'SHEEP': 0, 'WHEAT': 0, 'ORE': 0}
Your buildings: {'settlements': 2, 'cities': 0, 'roads': 1}

Opponents:
- Color.RED: 2 victory points, Buildings: {'settlements': 2, 'cities': 0, 'roads': 2}

Strategic Considerations:
- Early Game: Focus on expanding by building roads and settlements.
- Prioritize securing BRICK and WOOD resources for expansion.

Available Actions (2):
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(31, 32))
Action 1: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(30, 31))

Analyze each available action and recommend the best one. Consider your current resources, victory points, and building opportunities. Aim to maximize your chances of winning by securing key resources and building strategically.

Specify your choice by indicating 'RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X' where X is the action index.

Response:
# Action Analysis for Blue Player

I'll analyze the two road-building options available to you in the current game state.

## Current Situation
- You have 2 VP (from 2 settlements)
- You only have 1 WOOD resource
- Both available actions require building a road, which costs 1 BRICK + 1 WOOD
- You don't have any BRICK, so you can't currently execute either action

## Action Analysis

**Action 0: Build Road at (31, 32)**
- This would extend your road network to hex coordinate 32
- Without seeing the game board, I can't tell what resources this might give access to

**Action 1: Build Road at (30, 31)**
- This would extend your road network to hex coordinate 30
- Without seeing the game board, I can't tell what resources this might give access to

## Recommendation

Since you don't currently have the required resources (missing BRICK) to build a road, neither action can be executed immediately. 

Without more information about the board layout and what resources are at coordinates 30 and 32, I cannot make a fully informed recommendation based on future potential. In a real game situation, you would need to:
1. Trade to get a BRICK resource first
2. Choose the road that leads toward valuable resource hexes (especially BRICK or WOOD)
3. Consider which road helps you toward the longest road achievement

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Neither action is immediately executable due to resource constraints. You need to acquire 1 BRICK first through trading or waiting for resource production.
