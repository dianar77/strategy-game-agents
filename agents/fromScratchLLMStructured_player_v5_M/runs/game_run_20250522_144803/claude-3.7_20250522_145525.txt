Prompt:
Current Game State:
Your color: Color.BLUE
Your victory points: 2
Your resources: {'WOOD': 3, 'BRICK': 1, 'SHEEP': 0, 'WHEAT': 0, 'ORE': 2}
Your buildings: {'settlements': 2, 'cities': 0, 'roads': 2}

Opponents:
- Color.RED: 2 victory points, Buildings: {'settlements': 2, 'cities': 0, 'roads': 3}

Strategic Considerations:
- Early Game: Focus on expanding by building roads and settlements.
- Prioritize securing BRICK and WOOD resources for expansion.

Available Actions (8):
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)
Action 1: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(9, 10))
Action 2: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(1, 2))
Action 3: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(10, 11))
Action 4: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(28, 29))
Action 5: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(2, 3))
Action 6: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(8, 9))
Action 7: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(29, 30))

Analyze each available action and recommend the best one. Consider your current resources, victory points, and building opportunities. Aim to maximize your chances of winning by securing key resources and building strategically.

Specify your choice by indicating 'RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X' where X is the action index.

Response:
# Analysis of Current Situation

I'll analyze the current game state and available actions to make a strategic recommendation.

## Current Resources
- WOOD: 3
- BRICK: 1
- ORE: 2
- SHEEP: 0
- WHEAT: 0

## Key Observations
- We're in the early game with 2 victory points (2 settlements)
- We have enough resources (1 BRICK + 1 WOOD) to build one road
- All available actions are either to build a road or end turn
- Building a road now will use our BRICK, which is a valuable early-game resource
- We need to determine which road position offers the best strategic advantage

## Road Building Analysis
Without seeing the full board layout, I need to consider the general principles:
- Roads should lead toward potential settlement locations
- Roads should connect to resource-rich areas
- Roads should help block opponent expansion paths
- Roads should work toward the longest road bonus (2 VP)

Since we have 7 different road placement options, these likely represent extensions from our current settlements and roads. Without specific information about the board layout, hexes, and numbers, I'll recommend building a road to continue our expansion strategy.

## Decision
Building a road now uses our limited BRICK resource, but it's generally better to use resources rather than holding them, especially in the early game. Since expansion is key early on, and we have the resources to build a road:

**RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 1** (Build a road at position (9, 10))

This recommendation is based on the principle of continuing expansion in the early game, though the optimal road would depend on the specific board layout which is not fully described in the provided game state.
