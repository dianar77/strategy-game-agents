# Action Analysis

Let me analyze the current state and available actions:

## Current Situation
- You have 2 victory points vs. opponent's 4 points
- You have only wood resources (2 WOOD)
- You're in the early game and need to focus on expansion
- You need BRICK resources for roads/settlements

## Available Actions
**Action 0: PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD**
- Advantages:
  - Would allow you to move the robber and potentially steal a resource
  - Knights can eventually lead to Largest Army (2 VPs)
- Disadvantages:
  - You don't have enough resources to build anything right now, so immediate benefit is limited
  - Using a development card early may be premature when you need basic resources

**Action 1: ROLL**
- Advantages:
  - Chance to gain more resources needed for expansion
  - Particularly important to get BRICK which you currently lack
  - Standard progression of play when you don't have immediate building options

## Analysis
Given your limited resources and early game position, the best strategy is to gain more resources through rolling. Playing the Knight card now has less value since you can't immediately build with any stolen resource. You're better off rolling to potentially collect multiple resources that could enable building.

## RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 1
Roll the dice to acquire more resources needed for expansion, particularly BRICK which you currently lack.
