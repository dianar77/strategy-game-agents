# Action Analysis

Looking at the current game state, I'll analyze each available action to determine the best strategic move.

## Current Situation
- You have 2 victory points vs. opponent's 9 points
- Resources: 1 WOOD, 0 BRICK, 1 SHEEP, 3 WHEAT, 0 ORE
- Buildings: 2 settlements, 0 cities, 3 roads

## Action Analysis

**Action 0**: End your turn
- This would waste your opportunity to improve your position
- You currently cannot build anything with your resources

**Action 1-4**: Maritime Trade options
- All options involve trading 3 WHEAT for 1 of another resource:
  - Action 1: Get 1 SHEEP (would give you 2 SHEEP total)
  - Action 2: Get 1 ORE (would give you 1 ORE total)
  - Action 3: Get 1 WOOD (would give you 2 WOOD total)
  - Action 4: Get 1 BRICK (would give you 1 BRICK total)

## Strategic Evaluation

Since you're in the early game and need to expand, roads and settlements are your priority. For this you need BRICK and WOOD.

Currently you have:
- 1 WOOD but no BRICK: cannot build a road (need 1 WOOD + 1 BRICK)
- Cannot build a settlement (need 1 WOOD + 1 BRICK + 1 WHEAT + 1 SHEEP)

Trading for BRICK would allow you to build a road with your existing WOOD, increasing your expansion potential.

Additionally, with your remaining resources (1 SHEEP, 0 WHEAT after trade), you'd be closer to building a settlement if you acquire more resources on the next turn.

## RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 4
Trade 3 WHEAT for 1 BRICK, which combined with your 1 WOOD will allow you to build a road and continue your expansion strategy.
