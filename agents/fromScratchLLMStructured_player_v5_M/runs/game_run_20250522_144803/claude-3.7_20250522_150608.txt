# Analysis of Robber Placement Options

Looking at the current game state, I need to make a strategic robber placement to slow down the RED player who has 7 victory points (significantly ahead of my 2 points).

## Game Situation Assessment
- RED player is leading with 7 victory points and has developed significantly (2 cities, 11 roads)
- I'm in the early game with just 2 settlements and limited resources
- My primary goal should be to hinder RED while I develop my position

## Robber Placement Strategy
The best robber placements would be those that:
1. Target the RED player (since they're winning)
2. Block their most productive or valuable hexes
3. Potentially allow me to steal a resource from them

Looking at the available actions, I notice several options (actions 3, 4, 5, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13) that allow me to target RED by placing the robber on a hex adjacent to their settlement or city.

Among these options, I should prioritize blocking hexes that are likely providing RED with key resources - especially if they have cities on those hexes which would normally provide double resources.

Without knowing the exact resource types on each hex, I'll select the option that maximizes my chances by targeting a hex where RED has significant development.

## Decision

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 4

Action 4 places the robber at coordinates (-1, 1, 0) and targets the RED player for a resource steal. This is likely a productive hex for RED that will disrupt their resource generation while also allowing me to potentially gain a resource I need for expansion.
