# Game State Analysis

Looking at the current game state:
- You have 2 victory points vs. opponent's 5 points
- Your resources: 1 WOOD, 0 BRICK, 4 SHEEP, 1 WHEAT, 0 ORE
- You're lacking BRICK which is essential for road and settlement expansion

## Action Analysis

The available actions are:
- End your turn
- Trade 4 SHEEP for 1 WOOD
- Trade 4 SHEEP for 1 WHEAT
- Trade 4 SHEEP for 1 ORE
- Trade 4 SHEEP for 1 BRICK

Since you're in the early game and significantly behind in victory points, expansion should be your priority. You already have roads and need to build more settlements, which require WOOD, BRICK, SHEEP, and WHEAT.

You currently have:
- WOOD (1) - need more for expansion
- BRICK (0) - critical resource you're completely missing
- SHEEP (4) - you have excess
- WHEAT (1) - have some but not enough

## Best Action Determination

Action 4 (trading 4 SHEEP for 1 BRICK) is optimal because:
- BRICK is essential for building roads and settlements
- You currently have 0 BRICK, making it impossible to expand
- You have excess SHEEP to trade
- This trade would give you 1 BRICK, 1 WOOD, and 1 WHEAT - getting you closer to building a settlement

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 4
