- Early Game: Focus on expanding by building roads and settlements.
- Prioritize securing BRICK and WOOD resources for expansion.

Available Actions (6):
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)
Action 1: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(26, 27))
Action 2: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(28, 29))

Response:
# Analysis of Available Actions

Let me analyze the current game state and evaluate each possible action:

## Current Situation
- You have 2 victory points vs RED's 7 points - you're significantly behind
- Your resources: 1 WOOD, 1 BRICK, 0 SHEEP, 0 WHEAT, 2 ORE
- You have exactly enough resources to build one road (costs 1 WOOD, 1 BRICK)

## Action Analysis

**Action 0: END_TURN**
- Not recommended when you can build something with your resources

**Actions 1-5: BUILD_ROAD options**
I need to determine which road provides the best strategic advantage:
- A road should ideally lead toward valuable resource tiles
- A road should help extend your network toward potential settlement locations
- You need to catch up quickly to RED who has a substantial lead

Without seeing the full board layout, I need to prioritize roads that might lead to new settlement opportunities. Since you already have 7 roads built but only 2 settlements, building a road that could lead to a settlement spot soon would be optimal.

Since I don't have specific information about which road position would be most advantageous in terms of resource access or blocking opponents, I'll recommend building a road based on the principle of continuing your expansion strategy.

## Recommendation

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 1

Building a road is better than ending your turn without using resources. Without more detailed board information, I'm recommending Action 1 (BUILD_ROAD at (26, 27)) as it gives you something built while preserving your ability to make more strategic decisions next turn.

If you can provide additional details about the board layout, resource distribution, or your existing road network, I could offer more tailored advice on which specific road position would be most advantageous.
