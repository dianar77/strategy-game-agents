# Robber Placement Analysis

I need to analyze where to place the robber to hinder my opponent while advancing my position. Since I'm early in the game with only 2 victory points, a strategic robber placement can give me an advantage.

## Analyzing Options with Stealing Potential

First, I'll focus on actions that allow me to steal from the RED player, which are:
- Action 0: Placing robber at (0, 0, 0) and stealing from RED
- Action 5: Placing robber at (0, 1, -1) and stealing from RED
- Action 6: Placing robber at (1, 0, -1) and stealing from RED
- Action 16: Placing robber at (2, 0, -2) and stealing from RED
- Action 17: Placing robber at (2, -1, -1) and stealing from RED

Since RED and I have the same number of victory points (2), I want to target RED's most valuable resources. Without specific information about which hexes produce which resources, I need to make a strategic choice based on the likely setup.

## Strategic Considerations

1. I should target hexes that:
   - Likely produce BRICK or WOOD (since these are critical for early expansion)
   - Have high probability numbers (typically 6 or 8)
   - Block multiple RED settlements

2. Since we're tied at 2 victory points each, slowing RED's progress while improving my position is critical.

3. I currently have only 1 SHEEP resource, which isn't immediately useful on its own.

## Decision

Without specific information about the resource types on each hex, I'll choose a robber placement that gives me the opportunity to steal from RED. The numbered actions (0, 5, 6, 16, 17) all allow this.

Among these options, I'll select Action 0, placing the robber at (0, 0, 0) and stealing from RED. This central hex location is likely to be a valuable resource and may block access to multiple settlements.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0

This allows me to potentially gain a resource I need (hopefully BRICK or WOOD) while simultaneously blocking what could be a productive hex for my opponent.
