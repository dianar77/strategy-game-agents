# Robber Placement Analysis

I need to decide where to move the robber to disrupt my opponent while potentially gaining resources.

## Key Observations:
- RED has 5 victory points (3 more than me) and is ahead with settlements/cities
- I need resources to expand, particularly BRICK and WOOD which I'm completely lacking
- There are 5 locations where I can target the RED player

## Actions That Target RED Player:
- Action 2: Move robber to (-1, 0, 1) and steal from RED
- Action 6: Move robber to (2, -2, 0) and steal from RED
- Action 9: Move robber to (-1, -1, 2) and steal from RED
- Action 10: Move robber to (-2, 0, 2) and steal from RED
- Action 17: Move robber to (2, -1, -1) and steal from RED

Since RED is ahead with 5 victory points and I need to slow them down, I should definitely target them. Without seeing the full board layout showing which hexes produce which resources, I'll need to make my decision based on strategic positioning.

Given that I need BRICK and WOOD, and the RED player likely has these resources (as they've built many roads), I should target RED at one of their productive hexes.

Among the available options, I'll choose:

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 10

This targets RED at position (-2, 0, 2), which is likely a productive hex given that it has RED's settlement or city adjacent to it. By placing the robber here, I can potentially block an important resource for RED while also stealing a resource from them.
