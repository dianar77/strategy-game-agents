# Game State Analysis

Currently, you have:
- 2 victory points
- Resources: 2 WOOD, 0 BRICK, 0 SHEEP, 0 WHEAT, 3 ORE
- Buildings: 2 settlements, 0 cities, 2 roads

The available actions are all maritime trades (3:1 ratio) using ORE to get various resources or ending your turn.

## Strategy Analysis

In the early game phase, your priority should be expansion through building roads and settlements, which primarily requires WOOD and BRICK resources.

- You already have 2 WOOD but no BRICK
- You have 3 ORE which is useful later for city upgrades, but less valuable now
- The most pressing need is BRICK to continue expansion

Looking at the available actions:
- Action 1-3: Trading ORE for WHEAT, SHEEP, or WOOD - These are less useful right now
- Action 4: Trading 3 ORE for 1 BRICK - This aligns with your expansion needs
- Action 0: Ending your turn without taking advantage of your resources

## Recommendation

Trading 3 ORE for 1 BRICK (Action 4) is the optimal choice because:
1. It gives you the resource you need most for early game expansion
2. It allows you potentially build another road on a future turn (when you combine it with your existing WOOD)
3. ORE is less valuable in the early game compared to BRICK and WOOD

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 4

This trade will position you to expand your road network on your next turn, assuming you can acquire one more WOOD resource.
