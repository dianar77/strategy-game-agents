# Analysis of Available Actions

Looking at the current game state, I'll analyze each option carefully:

## Current Situation Assessment
- You have 2 victory points compared to opponent's 3
- Resources: 1 SHEEP, 3 WHEAT, no BRICK/WOOD/ORE
- You need BRICK and WOOD urgently for expansion

## Action Analysis

**Action 0: End Turn**
- Ending your turn without doing anything means missing an opportunity to improve your position
- Given the resource gap and point deficit, this isn't optimal

**Actions 1-4: Maritime Trade Options**
All involve trading 3 WHEAT for:
- Action 1: Get 1 SHEEP (you already have 1)
- Action 2: Get 1 ORE (useful for future city upgrades, but not immediate expansion)
- Action 3: Get 1 WOOD (needed for roads/settlements)
- Action 4: Get 1 BRICK (needed for roads/settlements)

## Strategic Recommendation

Since you need both BRICK and WOOD for expansion (building roads and settlements), and you have 3 WHEAT to spare, the best option is to acquire one of these critical resources.

Between WOOD and BRICK, both are equally important for your expansion needs. However, since the strategic guidance specifically mentioned securing these resources and you currently have zero of both, acquiring either will be beneficial.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 4

Trading 3 WHEAT for 1 BRICK will give you one of the critical resources needed for expansion. In future turns, you could focus on obtaining WOOD to complete the resource pair needed for road building, which is essential for your expansion strategy in this early game phase.
