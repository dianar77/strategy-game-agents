# Game State Analysis

Looking at your current position:
- You have 2 victory points (2 settlements)
- You have plenty of WHEAT (5) and SHEEP (3), but only 1 WOOD and no BRICK or ORE
- You can't build settlements or roads without BRICK
- You're in the early game where expansion is critical

## Action Analysis

Action 0: End your turn without making any moves. This doesn't improve your position.

Actions 1-4: Maritime trades that exchange 4 WHEAT for another resource:
- Action 1: Trade for WOOD - You already have 1 WOOD, but need BRICK more urgently
- Action 2: Trade for BRICK - This would give you 1 BRICK, which combined with your existing WOOD would allow you to build a road
- Action 3: Trade for SHEEP - You already have 3 SHEEP, so this isn't a priority
- Action 4: Trade for ORE - Not immediately useful since you need BRICK and WOOD first for expansion

## Strategic Recommendation

Since your priority is expansion and you need BRICK for both roads and settlements, getting BRICK is most valuable. The 4:1 trade ratio is expensive, but you have excess WHEAT to spare, and BRICK is essential for your strategy.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 2 (Trade 4 WHEAT for 1 BRICK)

This will allow you to build a road on your next turn (using your 1 WOOD and the new BRICK), continuing your expansion strategy while still maintaining 1 WHEAT and your other resources.
