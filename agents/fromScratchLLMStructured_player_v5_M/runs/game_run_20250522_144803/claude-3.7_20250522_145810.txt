Prompt:
Current Game State:
Your color: Color.BLUE
Your victory points: 2
Your resources: {'WOOD': 1, 'BRICK': 0, 'SHEEP': 0, 'WHEAT': 0, 'ORE': 0}
Your buildings: {'settlements': 2, 'cities': 0, 'roads': 1}

Opponents:
- Color.RED: 1 victory points, Buildings: {'settlements': 1, 'cities': 0, 'roads': 1}

Strategic Considerations:
- Early Game: Focus on expanding by building roads and settlements.
- Prioritize securing BRICK and WOOD resources for expansion.

Available Actions (2):
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(28, 29))
Action 1: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(27, 28))

Analyze each available action and recommend the best one. Consider your current resources, victory points, and building opportunities. Aim to maximize your chances of winning by securing key resources and building strategically.

Specify your choice by indicating 'RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X' where X is the action index.

# Strategic Analysis for Blue Player

I'll analyze each of the available road-building options based on the current game state.

## Current Position Assessment
- You have 2 victory points (from your 2 settlements)
- You have 1 WOOD resource and no BRICK, which means you can't build roads right now
- You're in the early game with limited expansion so far

## Action Analysis

**Action 0: Build Road at (28, 29)**
- This would extend your road network toward vertex 29
- Would create potential for a future settlement if vertex 29 has legal placement
- Need to consider what resources might be accessible from this direction

**Action 1: Build Road at (27, 28)**
- This would extend your road network toward vertex 27
- Would create potential for a future settlement if vertex 27 has legal placement
- Need to consider what resources might be accessible from this direction

## Key Consideration
The most important factor to note is that **you currently lack the resources to build either road**. Road building requires 1 WOOD and 1 BRICK, but you only have 1 WOOD and 0 BRICK.

Therefore, neither action is executable in the current turn. You would need to acquire BRICK resources first, likely through trading or waiting for resource production, before building additional roads.

## RECOMMENDED ACTION: None applicable
You should focus on acquiring the necessary resources (particularly BRICK) before attempting to build more roads. Consider trading with other players or banking, or wait until your settlements produce the needed BRICK resource.
