Prompt:
Current Game State:
Your color: Color.BLUE
Your victory points: 2
Your resources: {'WOOD': 0, 'BRICK': 0, 'SHEEP': 1, 'WHEAT': 0, 'ORE': 0}
Your buildings: {'settlements': 2, 'cities': 0, 'roads': 1}

Opponents:
- Color.RED: 2 victory points, Buildings: {'settlements': 2, 'cities': 0, 'roads': 2}

Strategic Considerations:
- Early Game: Focus on expanding by building roads and settlements.
- Prioritize securing BRICK and WOOD resources for expansion.

Available Actions (2):
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(30, 31))
Action 1: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(29, 30))

Analyze each available action and recommend the best one. Consider your current resources, victory points, and building opportunities. Aim to maximize your chances of winning by securing key resources and building strategically.

Specify your choice by indicating 'RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X' where X is the action index.

# Action Analysis for Blue Player

Looking at the current game state, I need to evaluate which road building option gives you the best strategic advantage.

## Current Situation Assessment
- You have 2 victory points from your 2 settlements
- You're very limited on resources with only 1 sheep
- You're in the early game with just 2 settlements and 1 road
- You need to prioritize access to BRICK and WOOD resources for future expansion

## Action Analysis

**Action 0: Build Road at (30, 31)**
- Would extend your road network toward vertex 31
- Need to consider what resources are accessible in this direction

**Action 1: Build Road at (29, 30)**
- Would extend your road network toward vertex 29
- Need to consider what resources are accessible in this direction

Without specific information about the board layout and what resources are available at these locations, I need to consider general strategic principles. In the early game, roads should ideally:
1. Lead toward unoccupied, high-value resource intersections
2. Open paths toward ports if beneficial
3. Block opponent expansion when appropriate

Based on the strategic considerations mentioned, I should prioritize a road that moves you toward BRICK or WOOD resources since those are critical for early expansion and you currently have none.

## Recommendation

Without specific board layout information, I'll recommend based on the action numbers provided:

**RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0**

This choice is based on the assumption that road (30, 31) likely leads toward favorable resource access. However, if you have specific knowledge about resource locations on the board that I don't have access to, consider which road would better position you to access BRICK and WOOD resources.
