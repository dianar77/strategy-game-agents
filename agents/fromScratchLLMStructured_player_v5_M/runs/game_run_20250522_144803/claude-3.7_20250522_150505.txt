# Analysis of Robber Placement Options

I need to place the robber strategically to slow down the RED player who has 4 victory points (a 2-point lead over me) and has already built a city while I have only settlements.

## Examining Actions with RED Player Targeting

The following actions allow me to target RED player by placing the robber on hexes where they have settlements/cities:
- Action 3: Place robber at (-1, 0, 1) and target RED
- Action 4: Place robber at (0, 1, -1) and target RED
- Action 9: Place robber at (-1, -1, 2) and target RED
- Action 10: Place robber at (-2, 0, 2) and target RED
- Action 11: Place robber at (-2, 1, 1) and target RED
- Action 12: Place robber at (-2, 2, 0) and target RED
- Action 13: Place robber at (-1, 2, -1) and target RED

Since RED is ahead with 4 victory points and already has a city, I should prioritize hampering their resource production. Without information about which specific resources are most valuable to RED, or which hexes produce the most valuable resources, I'll focus on the fact that RED has more buildings than I do and is clearly ahead.

I'll target a hex that allows me to steal from RED and potentially block their most productive hex. Based on the available information, any of the actions that target RED would be reasonable, but I'll select one that's likely on a more productive hex.

## Decision

**RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 10**

By placing the robber at (-2, 0, 2) and targeting RED, I can potentially block a valuable resource tile and steal a card from the leading player. This should help slow down RED's progress while I work on gathering resources for my next moves. Since I'm in the early game and focused on expansion, disrupting the leader's resource collection is a good strategic choice.
