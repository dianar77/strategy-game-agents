Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Here is the current game state:
        <catanatron.game.Game object at 0x7f1782b6ccd0>

        Here are the actions you can choose from:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Please provide the best action to take based on maximizing Victory Points (VP) and achieving strategic goals.
        

========================================

Response:
Based on the provided game state and available actions, the only action you can take is:

**Action:** End Turn.

Since there are no other actions currently provided (e.g., building, trading, or other moves), the logical and mandatory choice is to **end your turn** and wait for further opportunities in the game. Ending your turn will allow other players to act, and you can re-evaluate your strategy once your turn comes around again.

Let me know if you'd like further assistance as the game progresses! ðŸš€
