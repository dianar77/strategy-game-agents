Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Here is the current game state:
        <catanatron.game.Game object at 0x7f1784423450>

        Here are the actions you can choose from:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Please provide the best action to take based on maximizing Victory Points (VP) and achieving strategic goals.
        

========================================

Response:
Based on the provided game state, the only available action is `END_TURN`. Since there are no other options to consider, the best strategic move is to choose:

**Action:**  
`Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)`

Ending the turn is a necessary step in the flow of Catan, as it signals that you have completed all possible moves for this turn. After ending your turn, you'll re-evaluate the game when it's your turn again to maximize your Victory Points (VP) and pursue strategic goals like expanding settlements, acquiring development cards, building roads, or working toward objectives like Longest Road or Largest Army.
