Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Here is the current game state:
        <catanatron.game.Game object at 0x7f1782b6ccd0>

        Here are the actions you can choose from:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

        Please provide the best action to take based on maximizing Victory Points (VP) and achieving strategic goals.
        

========================================

Response:
Given the current game state and the available actions, you only have one action to take:

- **Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)**

Rolling the dice is mandatory at the start of your turn to determine resource production. Since this is the only option provided, you should choose this action:

**Best action:** **ROLL** the dice.

Once resources are distributed and you gain more actionable options, I can help you strategize further based on the new game state and available actions.
