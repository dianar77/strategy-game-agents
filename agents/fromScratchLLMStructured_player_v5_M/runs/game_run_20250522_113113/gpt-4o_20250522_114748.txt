Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Here is the current game state:
        <catanatron.game.Game object at 0x7f1782b6ccd0>

        Here are the actions you can choose from:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Please provide the best action to take based on maximizing Victory Points (VP) and achieving strategic goals.
        

========================================

Response:
Based on the current game state, the only available action is:

**Action: END_TURN**

Since no other actions are currently available, the best possible move is to select this action and conclude your turn. Ending your turn strategically allows other players to take their moves, and you'll regain the opportunity to act once it's your turn again. Make sure to assess the board and plan your strategy carefully for your next moves! ðŸ˜Š

Action taken:
**End Turn**
