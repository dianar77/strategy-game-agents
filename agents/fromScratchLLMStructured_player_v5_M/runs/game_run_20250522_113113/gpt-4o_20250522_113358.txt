========================================

Response:
Based on maximizing Victory Points (VP) and achieving strategic goals in Catan, the decision comes down to choosing between ending the turn or buying a development card.

1. **Buying a Development Card**: Development cards can provide various benefits:
   - Knights: Help you move the robber, potentially gaining Longest Army (+2 VP in the future).
   - Victory Points: Immediate hidden VP which count toward your total.
   - Progress cards: Offer strategic advantages, like road-building, monopoly, or year of plenty.

2. **Ending the Turn**: Ending the turn without buying a card would reserve your resources for future trades or builds. This is applicable if you're saving for a specific strategic goal, such as building settlements, cities, or roads.

### Recommended Action:
- **Buy a Development Card**: This is likely the best choice if you have sufficient resources to afford the cost (1 sheep, 1 wheat, 1 ore) as it could immediately (or indirectly) contribute to your VP or strategy. Development cards often have a strong impact on the game, and failing to use excess resources could lead to resource loss later (e.g., due to the robber or opponents).

The only reason to end your turn without buying would be if you're specifically saving resources for an important build in the next turn. However, without additional context about your resource situation or game position, buying a development card is the generally optimal approach.
