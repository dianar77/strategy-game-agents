========================================

Response:
Based on the provided game state and available actions, the **only action** available is:

- **Action**: End Turn.  
   **Reason**: Currently, you only have the option to end your turn. While there isn't additional context about game progress or current resources, ending your turn is necessary to advance the game and allow the next player to take their actions.  

If you're aiming to maximize VP and achieve strategic goals, you should review your current holdings (settlements, cities, roads) and resources during your next turn to determine optimal strategies like expanding settlements, upgrading to cities, or pursuing development cards. 

Action taken: **END_TURN**.
