Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Here is the current game state:
        <catanatron.game.Game object at 0x7f1782faf7d0>

        Here are the actions you can choose from:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

        Please provide the best action to take based on maximizing Victory Points (VP) and achieving strategic goals.
        

========================================

Response:
Since you only have one available action:

**Action: Roll**  
This is the best action to take because it's the only one currently available. Rolling the dice will initiate resource generation and advance the game state. This is a necessary step to unlock future strategic opportunities and accumulate resources for building settlements, cities, roads, and development cards â€” all of which contribute to maximizing Victory Points (VP).  

Let me know the updated game state after rolling, and I can help you reevaluate strategic options!
