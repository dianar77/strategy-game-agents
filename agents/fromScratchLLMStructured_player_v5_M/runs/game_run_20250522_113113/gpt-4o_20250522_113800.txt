Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Here is the current game state:
        <catanatron.game.Game object at 0x7f1784423450>

        Here are the actions you can choose from:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.DISCARD: 'DISCARD'>, value=None)

        Please provide the best action to take based on maximizing Victory Points (VP) and achieving strategic goals.
        

========================================

Response:
It appears that the only action available to you is a **DISCARD** action for the **BLUE** player. Since the specific implementation of the Catanatron Minigame is abstracted and the game state is not provided in detail, here's a general approach to discarding resources strategically:

### Strategic Goals When Discarding:
1. **Minimize impact on your plans**: Discard resources you are less likely to use immediately or that align least with your strategy (e.g., if you're focusing on building settlements, prioritize keeping brick, wood, and wheat).
2. **Preserve flexibility**: Try to keep a balanced hand that allows you to pivot based on dice rolls and trades.
3. **Avoid losing valuable setups**: If you're close to a significant purchase, like a city or development card, prioritize keeping what you need to complete it.

However, since the game state and resource counts are hidden, I'll follow the principle of **minimizing harm to your objectives**. Discard the least critical resources that contribute to your current strategic goals.

If you can provide more context on your resource hand or your current goals (e.g., settlement building, city expansion, or Longest Road), I'd be happy to refine the choice further!
