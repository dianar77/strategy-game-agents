Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Here is the current game state:
        <catanatron.game.Game object at 0x7f1782b6ccd0>

        Here are the actions you can choose from:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Please provide the best action to take based on maximizing Victory Points (VP) and achieving strategic goals.
        

========================================

Response:
Based on the given game state and available action, the only choice you can make is to **end your turn**.

### Strategic Rationale:
- Ending your turn is necessary to conclude your current phase and allow progression of the game. Since maximizing Victory Points (VP) and achieving strategic goals is a long-term effort in Catan, ending your turn efficiently when there are no productive moves left is optimal.

### Recommended Action:
**Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)**
