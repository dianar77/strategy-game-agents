Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Here is the current game state:
        <catanatron.game.Game object at 0x7f1782b6ccd0>

        Here are the actions you can choose from:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Please provide the best action to take based on maximizing Victory Points (VP) and achieving strategic goals.
        

========================================

Response:
Given the game state and available action, the only option presented is to **end your turn**:

Action:  
- **END_TURN**

Since there are no other actions available, the best strategic decision is to execute the **END_TURN** action and prepare for your next turn. Ending your turn will allow you to analyze the game state further when it evolves, such as through resource gains, other players' actions, or new opportunities to progress toward achieving high VP and strategic objectives.

Let me know if there are additional details or guidance you would like!
