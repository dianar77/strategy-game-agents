Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Here is the current game state:
        <catanatron.game.Game object at 0x7f1784423450>

        Here are the actions you can choose from:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Please provide the best action to take based on maximizing Victory Points (VP) and achieving strategic goals.
        

========================================

Response:
Based on the given game state, the only available action is to **end the turn** for the blue player. Since there are no other possible actions to choose from, the best move is:

**Action:** End Turn.

By ending the turn, you allow other players to proceed, potentially setting up better opportunities for resource trading, development, or positioning in future turns. If you have additional details about the board state, resources, developments, or strategies, feel free to share, and I can help optimize gameplay further!
