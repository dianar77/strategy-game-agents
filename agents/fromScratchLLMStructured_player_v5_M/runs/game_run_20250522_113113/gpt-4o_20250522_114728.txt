Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Here is the current game state:
        <catanatron.game.Game object at 0x7f1782b6ccd0>

        Here are the actions you can choose from:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Please provide the best action to take based on maximizing Victory Points (VP) and achieving strategic goals.
        

========================================

Response:
Based on the provided game state, the only available action is to **END_TURN** for the Blue player. Since you cannot perform other strategic moves (such as building, trading, or placing settlements/roads), the best choice is to take the available action:

**Recommended Action**:  
`Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)`

Strategic Note: Ending your turn is mandatory when no other actions are available. After your turn ends, the focus should shift toward preparing for upcoming opportunities to maximize Victory Points (VP) during future turns. Prioritize resource management, settlement expansion, or acquiring development cards to achieve strategic goals.
