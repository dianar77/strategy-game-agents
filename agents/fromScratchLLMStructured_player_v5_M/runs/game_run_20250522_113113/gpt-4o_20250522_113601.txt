Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Here is the current game state:
        <catanatron.game.Game object at 0x7f1784423450>

        Here are the actions you can choose from:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Please provide the best action to take based on maximizing Victory Points (VP) and achieving strategic goals.
        

========================================

Response:
Based on the provided game state and the available actions, the only action you can choose is:

**Action**:  
`END_TURN`

Since there are no other actions available, ending your turn is the best and only valid move. It indicates that you have likely completed all possible tasks (e.g., trading, building, or placing), or your resources and current state do not allow for further gameplay actions. Ending your turn lets the game progress to the next phase or to the next player's turn, ultimately bringing the game closer to its conclusion and victory point maximization.
