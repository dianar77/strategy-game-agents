Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Here is the current game state:
        <catanatron.game.Game object at 0x7f1782b6ccd0>

        Here are the actions you can choose from:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Please provide the best action to take based on maximizing Victory Points (VP) and achieving strategic goals.
        

========================================

Response:
Given the current game state and the action options available, it seems the only action you can take is to end your turn:

**Selected Action:**
`Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)`

### Explanation:
- The game state you provided does not include further details about resources, infrastructure, or other potential moves, and there is only one available action.
- Ending your turn is typically necessary when no other actions (e.g., building, trading, or playing a Development Card) can be performed.
- By ending your turn efficiently, you can progress the game while preparing for future turns to optimize your strategy.
