        Please provide the best action to take based on maximizing Victory Points (VP) and achieving strategic goals.
        

========================================

Response:
Given the provided game state and the only action available is `END_TURN`, it's clear that no other moves or decisions can be made at this time.

### Recommended Action:
- **Take the action: `END_TURN`.**

Ending your turn is mandatory when no other actions or opportunities are available, allowing the game to progress and giving other players a chance to act. Moving forward, focus on upcoming turns and opportunities to maximize Victory Points and achieve strategic goals such as building settlements, cities, and roads, or acquiring development cards depending on your resource availability and the current board state.
