========================================

Response:
Based on the current game state, you are presented with only one available action:

**Action**: Roll the dice.  
**Reason**: Rolling the dice is a required action at the start of a turn to determine which resources are distributed to players. This action is essential for progressing in the game and planning your next moves based on the resources generated. Without any additional game state details, rolling is the only step forward to continue advancing toward building settlements, cities, and other strategic goals to maximize Victory Points (VP).

**Action to take**:  
`Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)`
