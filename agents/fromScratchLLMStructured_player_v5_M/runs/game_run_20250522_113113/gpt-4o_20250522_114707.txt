Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Here is the current game state:
        <catanatron.game.Game object at 0x7f1782b6ccd0>

        Here are the actions you can choose from:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Please provide the best action to take based on maximizing Victory Points (VP) and achieving strategic goals.
        

========================================

Response:
Based on the provided game state and the list of actions you can choose from, the **only available action** is:

`Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)`

This indicates that **ending your turn** is the best and only course of action right now. Without further context about the game's current state (resources, settlements/cities, dev cards, etc.), it's evident there are no other valid moves available for you to take.

### Recommended Action:
Choose: **End Turn**
