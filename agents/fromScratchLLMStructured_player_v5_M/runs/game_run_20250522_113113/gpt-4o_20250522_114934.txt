========================================

Response:
To determine the best action among the provided options, let's analyze the potential benefits for maximizing Victory Points (VP) and achieving strategic goals.

### Explanation:
1. **END_TURN**: Ending the turn immediately is typically a low-opportunity action unless there are no other viable actions to make progress. Given that there are options available for maritime trade, ending the turn wouldn't advance your position.

2. **MARITIME_TRADE (WOOD for another resource)**:
   - You seem to have an abundance of **WOOD** (4 pieces can be traded). Trading it for a different resource has the potential to help you:
     - Build settlements (requires BRICK, WHEAT, WOOD, SHEEP).
     - Upgrade to cities (requires WHEAT, ORE).
     - Build roads (requires WOOD, BRICK).
     - Buy development cards (requires WHEAT, SHEEP, ORE).
   
   Thus, trading WOOD for a resource you're lacking is a strong strategic move. To choose the best trade, consider the game's strategic goals:
   - **SHEEP, BRICK, WHEAT, ORE** are all candidates, but selecting the right one depends on your current goals and shortages.

3. **Strategic Goals to Maximize VP**:
   - If you're aiming to expand your settlements, prioritize resources like BRICK (for roads/settlements) or WHEAT (for settlements and cities).
   - If you're close to upgrading a settlement to a city, prioritize WHEAT or ORE.
   - If you're pursuing development cards, prioritize SHEEP and ORE.

### Recommendation:
Since the exact details of your current resource inventory and goals are not provided, the **best general choice** would be to:
   - Trade 4 WOOD for **BRICK** if you're planning to expand (build roads/settlements).
   - Trade 4 WOOD for **WHEAT** if you're aiming for a city or need it for settlements.

If you're unsure of your goals or need a balanced choice, **4 WOOD for WHEAT** is often a versatile and strategic option.

Lastly, **DO NOT END TURN** without taking action, as it's better to optimize your resource conversion while you have the opportunity.
