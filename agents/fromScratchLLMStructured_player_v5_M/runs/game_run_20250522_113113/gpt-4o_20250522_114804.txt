        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Here is the current game state:
        <catanatron.game.Game object at 0x7f1782b6ccd0>

        Here are the actions you can choose from:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Please provide the best action to take based on maximizing Victory Points (VP) and achieving strategic goals.
        

========================================

Response:
Based on the provided game state, it appears you only have one action available:

**Action:** End your turn.

### Recommended Action:
- Select the action: **END_TURN**.

This moves the game forward to the next player's turn. Since no other actions are available, ending your turn is the optimal (and only) choice to maintain game progression. On future turns, focus on achieving your strategic goals (e.g., building settlements, cities, roads, or trading resources) to maximize your Victory Points.
