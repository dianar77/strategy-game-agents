Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Here is the current game state:
        <catanatron.game.Game object at 0x7f1784423450>

        Here are the actions you can choose from:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Please provide the best action to take based on maximizing Victory Points (VP) and achieving strategic goals.
        

========================================

Response:
Based on the provided game state and the available actions, the **only action** you can currently take is to:

### **Action: END_TURN**

This will end your turn and pass control to the next player. Since no other actions (e.g., building, trading, rolling the dice) are listed, there is no additional context or strategic decision-making necessary at this time. Ending your turn is the optimal and required move to progress the game forward.

ðŸ’¡ **Note:** In future turns, you should:
- Aim to maximize resource efficiency by prioritizing settlements, cities, and roads that contribute toward achieving **Victory Points (VP)**.
- Build toward key goals like the **Longest Road** or **Largest Army** if viable.
- Use trades or strategic positioning of structures to block opponents while expanding your resource production.

For now, go ahead and **END TURN!**
