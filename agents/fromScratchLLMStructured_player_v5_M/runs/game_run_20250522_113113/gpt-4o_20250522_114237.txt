Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Here is the current game state:
        <catanatron.game.Game object at 0x7f1782faf7d0>

        Here are the actions you can choose from:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

        Please provide the best action to take based on maximizing Victory Points (VP) and achieving strategic goals.
        

========================================

Response:
Based on the provided game state, you only have one available action you can take:

**Action:**
- `Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)`

Rolling the dice is mandatory in Catan to progress the turn and determine resource distribution. Since this is the only action available, it is both the optimal and required move to maximize your chances of improving your position and achieving strategic goals.

**Recommended Action:**  
Choose the action: **ROLL**.

Once the dice are rolled, additional actions (e.g., resource collection, trading, building roads or settlements) will become available depending on the outcome and your current resources. Let me know the updated state after rolling the dice, and Iâ€™ll guide further!
