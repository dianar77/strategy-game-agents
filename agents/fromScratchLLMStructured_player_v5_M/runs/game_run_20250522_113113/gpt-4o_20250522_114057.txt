Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Here is the current game state:
        <catanatron.game.Game object at 0x7f1782faf7d0>

        Here are the actions you can choose from:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)

        Please provide the best action to take based on maximizing Victory Points (VP) and achieving strategic goals.
        

========================================

Response:
Based on the current game state and the available action, the only choice is to:

**Take the action:**

`Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)`

### Why?
- Rolling the dice is typically required at the start of your turn to generate resources for all players based on their settlements and the roll results. It is a mandatory step before taking other actions.
- Rolling the dice will provide the necessary resources for progressing toward strategic goals like building settlements, cities, or development cards, which ultimately maximize Victory Points.

Let me know the outcome of the roll or whether other actions become available, and I will guide you further!
