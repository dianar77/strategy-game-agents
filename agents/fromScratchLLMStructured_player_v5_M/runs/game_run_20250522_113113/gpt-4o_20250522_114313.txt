        Please provide the best action to take based on maximizing Victory Points (VP) and achieving strategic goals.
        

========================================

Response:
To determine the best action, let us consider maximizing victory points (VP) and achieving strategic goals. Among the options provided, we are trading 4 WOOD for a single resource via Maritime Trade. The resources we can obtain are SHEEP, ORE, BRICK, or WHEAT. 

### Strategic considerations:
1. **WHEAT**: Essential for building settlements, upgrading to cities, and purchasing development cards.
2. **ORE**: Critical for upgrading settlements to cities and purchasing development cards.
3. **BRICK**: Useful for building roads and settlements but not as versatile as WHEAT and ORE.
4. **SHEEP**: Necessary for settlements and development cards but less critical than WHEAT and ORE.

### Recommended action:
Given that we aim to maximize VP and achieve strategic goals, WHEAT and ORE are generally the most valuable resources. If you're close to upgrading a settlement to a city or need WHEAT for settlements or development cards, **trade for WHEAT**. If ORE is currently the pivotal resource for city upgrades or development cards, **trade for ORE**.

However, without a detailed view of your current resource inventory and game state, it's advisable to prioritize WHEAT due to its broader utility.

### Best action to take:
```python
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('WOOD', 'WOOD', 'WOOD', 'WOOD', 'WHEAT'))
