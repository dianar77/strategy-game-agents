========================================

Response:
Given the current available actions, the goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) and achieve strategic objectives in Catan. Here's how I'll evaluate this scenario:

### Analysis of Actions:
1. **END_TURN:**
   - Ending your turn without taking any further action may not be optimal unless you cannot make significant progress with your resources.

2. **MARITIME_TRADE (Trading 4 WOOD for SHEEP, ORE, BRICK, or WHEAT):**
   - Maritime trades allow you to exchange 4 WOOD for a resource of your choice. This implies you have excess WOOD, and you may lack the flexibility to build without balancing your resource mix.
   - The significance of each trade depends on your current position:
     - **SHEEP**: Useful for building settlements or purchasing development cards.
     - **ORE**: Essential for upgrading settlements into cities or purchasing development cards.
     - **BRICK**: Necessary for building roads or settlements.
     - **WHEAT**: Critical for settlements, cities, or development cards.

### Strategic Considerations:
- If you are close to building a **settlement**, prioritize BRICK or SHEEP, as settlements require BRICK and SHEEP along with WOOD and WHEAT.
- If you can upgrade a settlement into a **city**, prioritize ORE and WHEAT.
- If you need a strategic push via **development cards**, prioritize SHEEP, WHEAT, and ORE.

### Recommendation:
The best action depends on your specific resource inventory and objectives. Without seeing the exact state of your resources, here's the general strategy:
- **Pick the resource that helps fulfill your immediate goal.**
- If you can build or upgrade soon, trade for the resource that completes the requirement for that action.

#### Likely Optimal Action:
- **Trade WOOD -> WHEAT or WOOD -> ORE:**
   - Choose **WHEAT** if you're close to building settlements or upgrading to cities.
   - Choose **ORE** if you're working towards a city upgrade or development cards.

If no trades can meaningfully improve your position, **END_TURN** is a fallback option.
