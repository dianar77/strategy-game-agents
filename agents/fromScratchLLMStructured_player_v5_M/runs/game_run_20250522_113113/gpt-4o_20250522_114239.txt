Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Here is the current game state:
        <catanatron.game.Game object at 0x7f1782faf7d0>

        Here are the actions you can choose from:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Please provide the best action to take based on maximizing Victory Points (VP) and achieving strategic goals.
        

========================================

Response:
Based on the current game state representation and the available action, you only have one option:

**Action: End Turn**

Since the only action presented to you is to end your turn, this is the best and only course of action. In this situation, use the time between turns to plan your strategy, review the board, and determine your next moves to maximize Victory Points and achieve long-term objectives such as expanding settlements, upgrading to cities, or building roads to secure the Largest Army or Longest Road bonus. Ending your turn efficiently is essential to maintaining momentum and preparing for your next opportunity.
