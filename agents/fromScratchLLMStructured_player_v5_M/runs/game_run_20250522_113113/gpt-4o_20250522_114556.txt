========================================

Response:
In the game of Catan, your goal is to maximize Victory Points (VP) by building settlements, cities, roads, or purchasing development cards. To determine the best action, we need to analyze your current situation, especially in terms of resource management and strategic goals.

Here are the available options and the reasoning:

1. **END_TURN**: If you don't have a clear plan to use resources effectively or there's no immediate benefit to maritime trading, ending your turn might be the best choice to avoid wasting resources.

2. **MARITIME_TRADE**:
   - Trading 4 WOOD for 1 SHEEP, ORE, BRICK, or WHEAT:
     You have a large surplus of WOOD and can trade 4 WOOD for another resource. The best trade depends on your immediate resource needs:
     - **SHEEP**: Useful for building a settlement or purchasing development cards.
     - **ORE**: Needed to upgrade settlements to cities or purchase development cards.
     - **BRICK**: Useful for building roads or settlements.
     - **WHEAT**: Essential for upgrading settlements to cities or building settlements.

### Recommendation:
- If you have a concrete path to using WHEAT (e.g., upgrading to a city or building a settlement) that contributes directly toward VP, **trade 4 WOOD for WHEAT**.
- If you're focusing on purchasing development cards or upgrading settlements to cities, and you’re short on ORE, **trade 4 WOOD for ORE**.
- If you aren't able to immediately spend the resource (or the trade doesn’t significantly contribute to your goals), the best move is likely **END_TURN** to conserve resources for a future opportunity.

Given the provided options and the goal of maximizing VP:

**Optimal Action:** **Trade 4 WOOD for WHEAT** if obtaining WHEAT contributes directly toward building or upgrading something related to VP. Otherwise, END_TURN.
