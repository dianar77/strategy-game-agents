========================================

Response:
Based on the game state and actions available, here's the thought process for determining the best course of action:

### Analysis of the actions:
1. **END_TURN**:
   - If no better options are available to use resources strategically, ending the turn is a safe action.
   
2. **MARITIME_TRADE - Trading 4 WOOD for SHEEP, ORE, BRICK, or WHEAT**:
   - Maritime trade involves trading 4 wood for 1 resource of the specified type.
   - Since details of your hand, settlements, possible builds, or development cards aren't explicitly provided, strategic choices depend on typical priorities:
     - Look for current immediate needs for building settlements, roads, cities, or purchasing development cards (Soldiers, Victory Points, etc.).
     - Consider trading for resources that further a strategic goal, such as expanding on the board or upgrading infrastructure (Cities have a high VP reward).

### Strategic Goals to Maximize Victory Points:
1. **Building a Settlement**:
   - Requires BRICK and WHEAT, plus WOOD and SHEEP.
   - If you trade for BRICK or WHEAT, it could help towards building a Settlement if you already have enough other resources (SHEEP and WOOD).

2. **Upgrading to a City**:
   - Requires 3 ORE and 2 WHEAT.
   - Trading for ORE or WHEAT is valuable if you’re aiming to upgrade a Settlement to a City.

3. **Development Cards**:
   - Requires 1 SHEEP, 1 WHEAT, and 1 ORE.
   - Trading for any of these resources (especially the rare ones) can enable purchasing a Development Card, which could lead to Victory Points or other strategic advantages.

4. **Road-building**:
   - Requires WOOD and BRICK.
   - Trading for BRICK might be useful if you’re looking to expand your road network.

---

### Best Action:
Given that you already have at least **4 WOOD**, the best action depends on your current resource needs. Assuming a generic strategy to maximize VP:

- If you're aiming for **Settlements**, prioritize trading **4 WOOD for BRICK** or **4 WOOD for WHEAT** to collect resources that are harder to obtain.
- If you're aiming for **Cities**, trading **4 WOOD for ORE** or **4 WOOD for WHEAT** is ideal.
- If you lack specific goals or cannot complete anything strategic with the traded resources, **END_TURN** would be the most prudent choice.

### Recommended Action:
**Trade 4 WOOD for ORE**  
Reason: ORE is a critical resource for upgrading to a City or purchasing Development Cards, both of which provide significant VP boosts.
