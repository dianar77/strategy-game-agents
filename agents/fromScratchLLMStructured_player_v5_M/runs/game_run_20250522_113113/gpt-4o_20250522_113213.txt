========================================

Response:
Based on the game state you've provided, it looks like you are currently in a situation where the **only available action is to DISCARD resources** (ActionType.DISCARD). While I cannot directly access the game object `<catanatron.game.Game>` to analyze the board state, here’s how to approach this situation to maximize your Victory Points (VP) and pursue a strong strategic position:

### Key Considerations:
1. **Resource Scarcity and Importance**: Evaluate resources based on their utility at this stage in the game. Discard resources that are less critical to your immediate goals (e.g., building settlements, cities, roads, or purchasing development cards).
   - High-priority resources like **wheat, ore, and brick** are crucial, especially if you're building settlements or cities.
   - Lower-priority resources like **wood and sheep** may be better candidates for discarding if they don’t align with your current strategy.

2. **Rule of Discarding**: If this is triggered by a **7 being rolled**, you must discard **half your cards** (rounded down) if you have more than 7 cards in your hand. Plan your discard order accordingly to retain resources for strategic plays.

3. **Strategic Goals**:
   - Aim to maintain resources for your next high-VP move, such as upgrading settlements to cities (wheat + ore) or expanding with settlements (wood + brick).
   - If you're pursuing the Largest Army card, prioritize saving resources for development cards (wheat, sheep, and ore).

### Recommended Action:
Since this is your only available action and the details of your resource hand are unknown, follow these general guidelines:
- Discard resources that align the least with your next strategic move or are abundant relative to your production capabilities.
- **Preserve diversity** in your hand — avoid discarding all instances of a single resource type unless you have no choice.

Without knowing your actual resource hand or game details, it’s challenging to specify which resources to discard exactly. However, the intention should always be to position yourself for high-VP plays as soon as possible.

### The Action to Take:
- **Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.DISCARD>, value=None)**

Make sure you deliberately discard resources in a way that aligns with the above strategy! Let me know if there's additional context or if the game feeds more information for a refined strategy.
