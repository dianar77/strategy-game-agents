Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Here is the current game state:
        <catanatron.game.Game object at 0x7f1782b6ccd0>

        Here are the actions you can choose from:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Please provide the best action to take based on maximizing Victory Points (VP) and achieving strategic goals.
        

========================================

Response:
Based on the information provided, the only available action is:

- **END_TURN**

Since no other actions (e.g., building roads, settlements, or cities, or trading) are available at this time, I recommend choosing the **END_TURN** action.

This will allow the game to proceed to the next player's turn. Hopefully, in subsequent turns, you will have more opportunities to carry out actions that maximize your Victory Points (VP) and help you achieve strategic goals!
