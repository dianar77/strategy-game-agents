Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Here is the current game state:
        <catanatron.game.Game object at 0x7f1784423450>

        Here are the actions you can choose from:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Please provide the best action to take based on maximizing Victory Points (VP) and achieving strategic goals.
        

========================================

Response:
Based on the current game state and the available actions, the best action is:

**Action:** `END_TURN`

**Reasoning:**  
- Since the only available action is ending the turn, no decisions about resource allocation, trades, or development can be made.
- Ending your turn advances the game and allows for new opportunities in subsequent turns to maximize Victory Points (VP) or pursue strategic goals, like expanding settlements, building roads, or acquiring development cards.
