========================================

Response:
To choose the best action in the Catanatron Minigame, we aim to maximize Victory Points (VP) and pursue strategic goals such as resource balance or specific objectives like building settlements, cities, roads, or purchasing development cards.

### Analyzing Available Actions:

1. **Action: END_TURN**
   - This ends your turn with no further actions. Should be chosen if there are no beneficial actions left to take.

2. **Action: MARITIME_TRADE (Convert 4 WOOD for one resource)**
   - You have multiple options to trade 4 WOOD for 1 SHEEP, 1 ORE, 1 BRICK, or 1 WHEAT.
   - Determining the best option depends on your immediate needs. Evaluate:
     - What you currently lack to build key structures (e.g., Settlements, Cities, Roads)?
     - Whether obtaining specific resources would help in a broader strategy.

### General Strategy Considerations:
- **Settlement Building:** Requires BRICK + WOOD + SHEEP + WHEAT.
  - If you are missing BRICK, WHEAT, or SHEEP, consider trading WOOD for the missing resource.
- **City Building:** Requires ORE + WHEAT (3 ORE + 2 WHEAT).
  - If you need ORE or WHEAT to upgrade a Settlement to a City, prioritize trading for those resources.
- **Road Building:** Requires BRICK + WOOD.
  - If you are aiming to expand your road network for strategic positioning or the Longest Road, you might prioritize BRICK.
- **Development Cards:** Requires SHEEP + ORE + WHEAT.
  - If buying development cards is a viable play, you should prioritize trading for these resources.

Without explicit details about your current resource stock and objectives, I'll suggest the best general option based on typical strategies.

### Recommendation:
- **Trade 4 WOOD for 1 BRICK** if building a Settlement or Roads is your immediate priority and you lack BRICK.
- **Trade 4 WOOD for 1 WHEAT** if you are aiming to build a City or need it for a Settlement/Development Card.
- **Trade 4 WOOD for 1 SHEEP** if you are close to building a Settlement but lack SHEEP.
- **Trade 4 WOOD for 1 ORE** if focusing on upgrading to a City or buying Development Cards.

If none of these align with your strategy or resources are insufficient for immediate use, **END_TURN**.

Please provide more details on your current resource cards and goals if you'd like a more targeted recommendation!
