Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Here is the current game state:
        <catanatron.game.Game object at 0x7f1782b6ccd0>

        Here are the actions you can choose from:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Please provide the best action to take based on maximizing Victory Points (VP) and achieving strategic goals.
        

========================================

Response:
Given the current game state and the available actions you presented, the only option is to **END_TURN**. As there are no other actions to consider, you must select this action.

### Action:
**END_TURN**

Reasoning:
- Ending your turn is the only available action.
- During your next turn, assess the board state, available resources, and strategic opportunities, such as building settlements, roads, cities, or buying development cards to maximize Victory Points and secure strong positions.
