Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Here is the current game state:
        <catanatron.game.Game object at 0x7f1782faf7d0>

        Here are the actions you can choose from:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Please provide the best action to take based on maximizing Victory Points (VP) and achieving strategic goals.
        

========================================

Response:
Based on the current game state, the only action available to you is:

**Action:** `END_TURN`

Since this is the only available action, there are no other strategic decisions to make at the moment. Ending your turn will allow the game to progress, giving you opportunities in the future to make decisions that maximize your Victory Points and achieve your strategic goals.

**Recommendation:** End your turn.
