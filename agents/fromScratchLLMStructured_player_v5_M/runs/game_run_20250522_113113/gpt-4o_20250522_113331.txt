Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Here is the current game state:
        <catanatron.game.Game object at 0x7f1784423450>

        Here are the actions you can choose from:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Please provide the best action to take based on maximizing Victory Points (VP) and achieving strategic goals.
        

========================================

Response:
Based on the provided game state and the available actions, the only choice presented is to **end your turn**. Since no other action is available (e.g., building, trading, or resource management), the optimal move is to execute this action and prepare for the next turn.

### Suggested Action:
**Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)**

This will end your turn, allowing the game to proceed while you continue working towards maximizing Victory Points and pursuing strategic goals during future turns.
