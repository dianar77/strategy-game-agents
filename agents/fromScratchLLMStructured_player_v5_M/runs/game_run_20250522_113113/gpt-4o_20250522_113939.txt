Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Here is the current game state:
        <catanatron.game.Game object at 0x7f1782faf7d0>

        Here are the actions you can choose from:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Please provide the best action to take based on maximizing Victory Points (VP) and achieving strategic goals.
        

========================================

Response:
Based on the given game state, the only available action is:

- **End Turn**: This means no other moves are currently available in this turn.

If there were additional actions, I could evaluate the best decision for maximizing Victory Points or strategic goals. However, in this case, the best action you can take is to **End Turn** and prepare for the next opportunity.
