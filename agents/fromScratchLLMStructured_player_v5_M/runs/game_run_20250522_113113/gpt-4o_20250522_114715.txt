========================================

Response:
Here's how we analyze the situation:

1. **Evaluate Resources**: Your available trade options suggest you have an excess of "WOOD". Trading "WOOD" can help you diversify your resources for strategic goals such as building Settlements, Cities, Roads, or buying Development Cards.

2. **Prioritize Strategic Goals**: 
   - **Settlements** require BRICK, WOOD, SHEEP, and WHEAT.
   - **Cities** require ORE and WHEAT.
   - **Roads** require WOOD and BRICK.
   - **Development Cards** require ORE, SHEEP, and WHEAT.
   - Decide which objective aligns best with your current board position.

3. **Review Trade Options**:
   - Trade 4 "WOOD" for "SHEEP" if you are looking to build Settlements or buy Development Cards.
   - Trade 4 "WOOD" for "ORE" if you are aiming to build Cities or buy Development Cards. This could be valuable if you already have sufficient SHEEP and WHEAT to complement it.
   - Trade 4 "WOOD" for "BRICK" if you want to expand with Roads or prepare for Settlements.
   - Trade 4 "WOOD" for "WHEAT" if you need it for settling, upgrading to Cities, or purchasing Development Cards.

4. **When to End Turn**: If none of the trades above contribute immediately to progressing toward a VP-rewarding goal, it's better to end your turn and retain the resources for future use.

### Recommended Action:
If you are seeking to maximize VP and advance your strategy:
- **Trade 4 "WOOD" for "ORE"** if Cities or Development Cards are your current best path to VP.
  
OR

- **Trade 4 "WOOD" for "SHEEP"** if you need SHEEP for Settlements or Development Cards.

If you already have the necessary complementary resources, these trades will be most effective. Otherwise, **END TURN** if none of the trades advance your position toward a meaningful goal. Consider additional context, such as potential trades with other players, your overall resource availability, and proximity to completing Catan objectives.
