Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Here is the current game state:
        <catanatron.game.Game object at 0x7f1784423450>

        Here are the actions you can choose from:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)

        Please provide the best action to take based on maximizing Victory Points (VP) and achieving strategic goals.
        

========================================

Response:
Based on the provided game state and available actions, the only action available to take is:

**END_TURN**

If this is the sole option, I recommend taking it since there are no other proactive choices for resource management, trading, or construction at this moment. Once the action is taken, you'll progress to subsequent game phases where new opportunities may arise to maximize your Victory Points (VP) and achieve strategic goals.
