Prompt:

        You are playing the Catanatron Minigame.
        Here is the current game state:
        <catanatron.game.Game object at 0x7f1782faf7d0>

        Here are the actions you can choose from:
        Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('WOOD', 'WOOD', 'WOOD', 'WOOD', 'SHEEP'))
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('WOOD', 'WOOD', 'WOOD', 'WOOD', 'ORE'))
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('WOOD', 'WOOD', 'WOOD', 'WOOD', 'BRICK'))
Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.MARITIME_TRADE: 'MARITIME_TRADE'>, value=('WOOD', 'WOOD', 'WOOD', 'WOOD', 'WHEAT'))

        Please provide the best action to take based on maximizing Victory Points (VP) and achieving strategic goals.

Response:
Given the provided options, let me analyze the situation step-by-step:

1. **Understanding the Board State**: Since I can't directly examine the `<catanatron.game.Game>` object, I'll make decisions based on common strategies in Catan, maximizing Victory Points (VP) and planning for long-term success.

2. **Actions Overview**:
   - **END_TURN**: Simply ends the current turn.
   - **MARITIME_TRADE**: All trade options involve trading **4 WOOD** for another resource (SHEEP, ORE, BRICK, or WHEAT). This action suggests you have at least 4 WOOD and possibly an excess of it.

3. **Key Considerations for Strategy**:
   - You should aim to trade for resources that will help you immediately build something (settlement, city, road) or secure cards like VP development cards.
   - Evaluate which resource you are missing to complete your immediate goals.
   - If no immediate use exists for the traded resource (e.g., if you can't build or strategize directly afterward), it may be better to **END_TURN** and save resources for later use.

4. **Resource Value Hierarchy**:
   - **BRICK/WHEAT**: Crucial for building settlements, which grant additional VP and unlock new resources for your economy.
   - **ORE/WHEAT**: Required for cities, which provide stronger resource income per turn and aid in long-term VP success.
   - **SHEEP**: Useful for settlements and development cards, though generally slightly less valuable over the long run compared to BRICK/WHEAT/ORE.
   - Focus on trading WOOD for resources you lack to achieve a high-priority goal.

5. **Recommended Action**:
   Without specific information about the current board or your resource hand, I recommend choosing the **MARITIME_TRADE** option that aligns with your immediate goals. For example:
   - If you're close to building a settlement and need resources like BRICK or WHEAT, prioritize that.
   - If you're focusing on upgrading a settlement to a city or aiming for development cards, trade for ORE or WHEAT.

If you don't have a clear plan to spend resources after a trade, the **END_TURN** action might be the best choice to conserve resources for a future opportunity.

Would you like to share more about your resource hand or current goals to refine this decision?
