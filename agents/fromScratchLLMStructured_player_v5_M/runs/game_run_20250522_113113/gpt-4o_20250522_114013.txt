========================================

Response:
To decide the best action in the Catanatron Minigame, we need to evaluate each available option based on maximizing Victory Points (VP) and achieving strategic goals. Building a road can support objectives like:

1. Expanding settlement or city building opportunities.
2. Working toward the Longest Road bonus.
3. Blocking opponents from expanding or achieving their own goals.

Let's analyze the actions:

### Available Actions
1. **END_TURN:** This option does nothing unless no other beneficial actions are possible, which is unlikely here because roads can typically be strategically valuable.
   
2. **BUILD_ROAD** options:
   - **(0, 20):**
   - **(4, 15):**
   - **(6, 7):**
