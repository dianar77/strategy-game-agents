Prompt:
Current Game State:
Your color: Color.BLUE
Your victory points: 2
Your resources: {'WOOD': 0, 'BRICK': 0, 'SHEEP': 0, 'WHEAT': 0, 'ORE': 1}
Your buildings: {'settlements': 2, 'cities': 0, 'roads': 1}

Opponents:
- Color.RED: 1 victory points, Buildings: {'settlements': 1, 'cities': 0, 'roads': 1}

Available Actions (2):
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(35, 36))
Action 1: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(34, 35))

Analyze each available action and recommend the best one. Consider your current resources, victory points, and building opportunities. Aim to maximize your chances of winning by securing key resources and building strategically.

Specify your choice by indicating 'RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X' where X is the action index.

# Game State Analysis

## Current Situation
- You have 2 victory points from 2 settlements
- Your resources are very limited: just 1 ORE
- Opponent (RED) has only 1 victory point with 1 settlement

## Action Analysis

**Action 0: Build Road from (35, 36)**
- This would extend your road network in one direction
- Building a road costs 1 BRICK + 1 WOOD, which you don't currently have

**Action 1: Build Road from (34, 35)**
- This would extend your road network in the other direction
- Building a road costs 1 BRICK + 1 WOOD, which you don't currently have

## Recommendation

Neither action is valid with your current resources. You need at least 1 BRICK and 1 WOOD to build a road, but you only have 1 ORE.

It appears there may be a discrepancy between the available actions shown and your actual resource inventory. Since these actions are listed as available but you can't afford them, I should note this inconsistency.

If you must choose between these actions (assuming the game allows it despite resource constraints):

**RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0**

This choice is based on the assumption that expanding toward position 36 might provide better future settlement opportunities, but without seeing the full board layout, this is speculative.
