Prompt:
Current Game State:
Your color: Color.BLUE
Your victory points: 1
Your resources: {'WOOD': 0, 'BRICK': 0, 'SHEEP': 0, 'WHEAT': 0, 'ORE': 0}
Your buildings: {'settlements': 1, 'cities': 0, 'roads': 0}

Opponents:
- Color.RED: 1 victory points, Buildings: {'settlements': 1, 'cities': 0, 'roads': 1}

Available Actions (2):
Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(26, 27))
Action 1: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(25, 26))

Analyze each available action and recommend the best one. Consider your current resources, victory points, and building opportunities. Aim to maximize your chances of winning by securing key resources and building strategically.

Specify your choice by indicating 'RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X' where X is the action index.

# Game State Analysis

Looking at the current game state:
- You're playing as BLUE with 1 victory point (from your single settlement)
- You have no resources currently
- The RED player also has 1 point with 1 settlement and 1 road
- You're in the initial setup phase where you can place roads without using resources

## Action Analysis

You have two road building options:
- **Action 0**: Build a road between points 26 and 27
- **Action 1**: Build a road between points 25 and 26

Both options connect to your existing settlement (since you can only build roads connected to your pieces). The key consideration is which direction offers better future expansion opportunities.

Without seeing the full board layout, I need to consider which direction might:
1. Lead toward better resource tiles
2. Give you room for future settlements
3. Potentially block opponent expansion paths
4. Progress toward the Longest Road achievement

Since this is your first road placement, securing expansion space is critical. Without more specific board information, both options would be equally valid. However, in general, I would recommend pursuing a direction that extends toward varied resource types to ensure balanced access to resources.

## Recommendation

Without additional board information, I'll make a recommendation based on the numerical sequence suggesting Action 1 leads back toward the center of the board.

**RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 1**

This road placement (25-26) likely takes you in a more central direction on the board, potentially offering more expansion options in the future than extending outward.
