# Game State Analysis

Let me analyze the current situation:

- You have 3 victory points vs. opponent's 6 points (you're behind)
- Your resources: 1 BRICK, 3 SHEEP, 0 WOOD, 0 WHEAT, 5 ORE
- Your buildings: 1 settlement, 1 city, 3 roads
- Available actions are to end turn or perform various maritime trades

## Resource Analysis
You have an abundance of ORE (5) and sufficient SHEEP (3), but you're lacking WOOD and WHEAT completely, with only 1 BRICK.

## Maritime Trade Options
The available maritime trades all involve trading 4 ORE for one of:
- WHEAT (Action 1)
- SHEEP (Action 2) - not useful since you already have 3
- WOOD (Action 3)
- BRICK (Action 4) - less useful since you already have 1

## Strategic Considerations
Looking at your resources, you're currently unable to build any major structures:
- Settlement needs WOOD, BRICK, WHEAT, SHEEP (missing WOOD and WHEAT)
- City needs 3 ORE and 2 WHEAT (missing WHEAT)
- Development Card needs ORE, WHEAT, SHEEP (missing WHEAT)
- Road needs WOOD and BRICK (missing WOOD)

Getting WHEAT would give you the most immediate options, as you could then potentially build a development card (with 1 ORE, 1 WHEAT, 1 SHEEP).

## Recommendation
Since you're behind in victory points, you need to capitalize on your ORE surplus to get resources that enable building.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 1 (Trade 4 ORE for 1 WHEAT)

This will allow you to potentially purchase a development card on your next turn (if you still have the other resources), which could give you a victory point, a knight, or other advantages.
