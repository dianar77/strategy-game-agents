# Game State Analysis

Looking at the current situation:

- You have 2 victory points (same as your opponent)
- Your resources: 4 WOOD, 0 BRICK, 0 SHEEP, 1 WHEAT, 2 ORE
- Your buildings: 2 settlements, 0 cities, 3 roads

## Action Analysis

Your available actions are to end your turn or perform maritime trades:

- **Action 0**: End your turn without doing anything
- **Action 1-4**: Trade 4 WOOD for 1 of another resource (SHEEP, WHEAT, BRICK, or ORE)

## Strategic Considerations

1. With 4 WOOD, you have the opportunity to trade for a resource you need.
2. To build a road, you need WOOD + BRICK, but you have no BRICK.
3. To build a settlement, you need WOOD + BRICK + SHEEP + WHEAT, but you're missing BRICK and SHEEP.
4. To upgrade to a city, you need 2 WHEAT + 3 ORE. You have 1 WHEAT and 2 ORE, so you're closest to this build.

Looking at your needs:
- BRICK would help you build more roads
- SHEEP is needed for settlements
- Additional WHEAT would help toward a city upgrade
- Additional ORE would also help toward a city upgrade

Since you're closest to building a city (needing 1 more WHEAT and 1 more ORE), and cities are worth 2 victory points, trading for one of these resources makes the most sense.

## Recommendation

**RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 2** - Trade 4 WOOD for 1 WHEAT

This gives you 2 WHEAT (combined with your existing 1), putting you closer to the 2 WHEAT needed for upgrading a settlement to a city. You'd still need 1 more ORE after this trade, but you're making progress toward a high-value build.
