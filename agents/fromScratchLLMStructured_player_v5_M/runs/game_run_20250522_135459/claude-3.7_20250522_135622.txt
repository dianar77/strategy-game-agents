Response:
# Game State Analysis

I'll analyze the current game state and available actions to make a strategic recommendation.

## Current Resources
- WOOD: 1
- BRICK: 1
- SHEEP: 0
- WHEAT: 1
- ORE: 0

## Building Costs Reminder
- Road: 1 WOOD + 1 BRICK
- Settlement: 1 WOOD + 1 BRICK + 1 SHEEP + 1 WHEAT
- City: 2 WHEAT + 3 ORE

## Analysis of Available Actions

First, I notice we have exactly the resources needed to build one road (1 WOOD + 1 BRICK). We have 6 possible road locations to choose from, so I need to evaluate which would be most strategic.

When placing roads, we want to:
1. Expand toward valuable resource hexes
2. Block opponent expansion paths if possible
3. Work toward the "longest road" special card
4. Create paths to future settlement locations

Since we have 2 settlements already, extending our road network is the logical next step toward building our 3rd settlement once we gather those resources.

Without seeing the full board layout, I need to consider which road placement maximizes our future opportunities. Roads that extend from our current positions and lead toward diverse resources would be ideal.

Since all actions are BUILD_ROAD with different coordinates, and without seeing the full board visualization, I would need to choose based on these coordinates to determine which provides the best expansion path.

Action 1 through Action 6 all involve building roads at different locations. Without more context about the board state, I'll recommend building a road that likely extends our current network.

## Recommendation

Since I can't visually see which road placement leads to the most valuable future building spots, I'll recommend using our resources to build a road rather than ending our turn.

**RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 1**

This builds a road at coordinates (0, 1), which I'm assuming connects to one of our existing settlements and extends our network in a promising direction. After building this road, we should focus on gathering the remaining resources needed for our next settlement (SHEEP).
