# Game State Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state and available actions:

## Current Situation
- You have 3 victory points vs. opponent's 4 points
- You have 6 sheep but no other resources
- You need 1 settlement and 1 road to build, or resources to upgrade to a city

## Available Actions
- **Action 0**: End your turn without doing anything
- **Actions 1-4**: Maritime trade options to exchange 4 sheep for another resource (wood, ore, brick, or wheat)

## Resource Analysis
Since you only have sheep, trading is your only option to gain other resources. Let's consider what would be most valuable:

1. **Wood + Brick**: Needed for roads and settlements
2. **Wheat + Ore**: Needed for cities and development cards
3. **Single resource considerations**:
   - Wood: Useful for roads and settlements
   - Brick: Useful for roads and settlements
   - Ore: Needed for cities and development cards
   - Wheat: Needed for settlements, cities, and development cards

Given you're behind in points and have buildings available to place, getting resources that let you build something immediately would be best.

## Recommendation
Between the trading options, brick or wood would be most valuable as they could help you build a road (with a future resource gain), putting you closer to a new settlement.

**RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 3** (Trade 4 sheep for 1 brick)

This will help you work toward expanding your settlement network, which is crucial since you're behind in victory points.
