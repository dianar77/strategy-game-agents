# Game State Analysis

Looking at the current game state:
- I have 2 victory points vs. opponent's 4 VP
- My resources: 4 WOOD, 0 BRICK, 0 SHEEP, 1 WHEAT, 3 ORE
- I have 2 settlements, 0 cities, and 3 roads
- The available actions are ending my turn or various maritime trades (4 WOOD for another resource)

## Action Analysis

**Action 0: End Turn**
This would maintain my current resources, but I'm trailing in victory points and should try to improve my position if possible.

**Action 1: Trade 4 WOOD for 1 SHEEP**
Getting a SHEEP would give me: 0 WOOD, 0 BRICK, 1 SHEEP, 1 WHEAT, 3 ORE. This doesn't create any immediate building opportunities.

**Action 2: Trade 4 WOOD for 1 WHEAT**
Getting another WHEAT would give me: 0 WOOD, 0 BRICK, 0 SHEEP, 2 WHEAT, 3 ORE. This brings me closer to a city (2 WHEAT + 3 ORE), but I'd still need 1 more WHEAT.

**Action 3: Trade 4 WOOD for 1 BRICK**
Getting a BRICK would give me: 0 WOOD, 1 BRICK, 0 SHEEP, 1 WHEAT, 3 ORE. This doesn't create any immediate building opportunities.

**Action 4: Trade 4 WOOD for 1 ORE**
Getting another ORE would give me: 0 WOOD, 0 BRICK, 0 SHEEP, 1 WHEAT, 4 ORE. This doesn't help with immediate builds.

## Recommendation

Action 2 (trading for WHEAT) seems most beneficial as it moves me closest to building a city (need 3 ORE + 2 WHEAT). I'll still need one more WHEAT, but this puts me in the best position for future turns.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 2
