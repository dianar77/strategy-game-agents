# Analysis of Available Actions

Let me evaluate each available action considering your current resource situation:

**Current Resources**: 1 WOOD, 0 BRICK, 4 SHEEP, 1 WHEAT, 0 ORE

## Action 0: END_TURN
This would simply end your turn without using your resources or making any trades.

## Actions 1-4: MARITIME TRADE
All these actions involve trading 4 SHEEP for another resource:
- Action 1: Trade 4 SHEEP for 1 WOOD (resulting in 2 WOOD, 0 BRICK, 0 SHEEP, 1 WHEAT, 0 ORE)
- Action 2: Trade 4 SHEEP for 1 ORE (resulting in 1 WOOD, 0 BRICK, 0 SHEEP, 1 WHEAT, 1 ORE)
- Action 3: Trade 4 SHEEP for 1 BRICK (resulting in 1 WOOD, 1 BRICK, 0 SHEEP, 1 WHEAT, 0 ORE)
- Action 4: Trade 4 SHEEP for 1 WHEAT (resulting in 1 WOOD, 0 BRICK, 0 SHEEP, 2 WHEAT, 0 ORE)

## Strategic Analysis

You have 4 SHEEP which are more than you need right now. Trading is a good option since maritime trading is typically at a 4:1 ratio.

Your building situation shows:
- For a new road: Need 1 WOOD + 1 BRICK (missing BRICK)
- For a new settlement: Need 1 WOOD + 1 BRICK + 1 SHEEP + 1 WHEAT (missing BRICK)
- For a city upgrade: Need 2 WHEAT + 3 ORE (missing 1 WHEAT and 3 ORE)

Trading for BRICK would help you build a road or work toward a settlement (which is worth 1 victory point). Getting a road built could help with expansion and potentially working toward the "Longest Road" bonus.

## Recommendation

**RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 3**

Trading 4 SHEEP for 1 BRICK allows you to immediately build a road (since you already have 1 WOOD). This supports your expansion strategy and positions you to build more settlements in future turns, which is critical for increasing your victory points.
