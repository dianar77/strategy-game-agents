# Move Robber Action Analysis

I need to decide where to move the robber to disrupt my opponent while advancing my position. Let's analyze the available moves.

## Looking at Available Actions
All actions are of type MOVE_ROBBER, which means I rolled a 7 or played a Knight card. I need to place the robber on a new hex and can potentially steal a card from an opponent who has a settlement adjacent to that hex.

## Evaluating Opponent Position
My opponent (RED) is ahead of me with 3 victory points vs. my 2 points. They have more settlements (3 vs 2) and roads (3 vs 2) than I do. Slowing them down should be a priority.

## Actions With Stealing Opportunity
Actions 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 11, 12, and 15 all allow me to steal a card from the RED player. These are generally more valuable than moves that don't let me steal.

## Optimal Strategy
I should target a hex that:
1. Blocks a productive resource tile for my opponent
2. Allows me to steal a card from them
3. Minimizes disruption to my own resource collection

Without a map showing the exact positions and production values of each hex, I'll prioritize actions that let me steal from RED, as they're ahead of me in victory points.

## RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 1
Action 1: Move the robber to coordinates (1, -1, 0) and steal from RED.

This is a strategic choice because:
1. It allows me to steal a resource from the player who's ahead
2. Having only 1 ORE and no other resources, I desperately need to acquire more resources
3. Since RED has more buildings, they likely have more resources I can steal
4. This disrupts their resource generation at a key location

If I knew more about the resource production values of each hex or which resources RED needs most, I could make an even more targeted recommendation, but with the information available, stealing from the player who's ahead is the most strategic choice.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 1
