Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
["Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)"]

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
I only have one possible action available, which is to end my turn. Since there are no other options to consider, the choice is straightforward.

When you only have the end turn option available, it means that either:
1. You've already used your main action for the turn (like building or trading)
2. You don't have the resources or legal moves to take any other actions
3. It's the cleanup phase of your turn after completing other actions

Since ending the turn is the only available option, there's no strategic decision to make at this point.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
