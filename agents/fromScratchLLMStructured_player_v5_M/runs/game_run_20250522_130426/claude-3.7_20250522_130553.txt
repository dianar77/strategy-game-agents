Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
Looking at the available actions, there's actually only one option available to you right now:

Action 0: Roll the dice (BLUE player, ROLL action)

In Catan, rolling the dice is how you generate resources at the beginning of your turn. When you roll, all players with settlements or cities adjacent to hexes matching the dice roll number will collect resources from those hexes.

Since this is your only available action, there's no strategic decision to be made at this moment. You need to roll the dice to continue with your turn.

After rolling, you'll likely have more options such as building roads/settlements, trading, or playing development cards depending on your resources and game state.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
