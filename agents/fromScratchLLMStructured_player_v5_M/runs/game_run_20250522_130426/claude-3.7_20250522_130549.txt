Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
["Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)"]

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
Based on the available actions, you only have one option:

**Action 0**: End your turn (Color: BLUE, Action Type: END_TURN)

Since this is the only available action, there are no alternatives to analyze. This situation typically occurs when:
1. You have already completed all possible moves for your turn
2. You don't have the resources or legal placement options to build anything
3. You've already used your development card (if you had one) for this turn
4. You've already completed any trading you wanted to do

With only one available action, the decision is straightforward.

**RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0**
