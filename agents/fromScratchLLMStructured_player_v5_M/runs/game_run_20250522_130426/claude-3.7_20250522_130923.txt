Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
["Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)"]

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
Based on the available actions, you have only one option:

**Action 0: End your turn (BLUE player)**

This is your only available action at this moment. In Catan, ending your turn means you've completed all possible moves for this round (building roads, settlements, cities, playing development cards, or trading) and are ready to pass play to the next player.

Since there are no other options to consider, you must end your turn now and wait for your next opportunity to make strategic moves.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
