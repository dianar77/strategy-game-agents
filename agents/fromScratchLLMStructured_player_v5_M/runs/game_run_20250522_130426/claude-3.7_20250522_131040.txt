Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
["Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)"]

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
Looking at your available actions for this turn in Catan, I notice you have only one option:

Action 0: End your turn (Blue player)

Since this is the only available action, you don't have any other options to consider. This typically happens when you've already completed all possible actions for your turn (like building, trading, playing development cards) or when you're unable to take any actions due to resource constraints.

In Catan, ending your turn passes play to the next player and triggers the next dice roll. When you only have the END_TURN option available, it means you've either:
1. Already made all the moves you wanted to make this turn
2. Don't have sufficient resources to build anything
3. Have already used a development card this turn (if applicable)

Since there are no alternatives to analyze, the decision is straightforward.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
