Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
["Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)"]

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
Based on the available actions, this is a very straightforward decision:

You only have one option available - Action 0, which is to roll the dice. In Catan, rolling the dice is how you begin your turn and determine which resource-producing hexes will generate resources for players with adjacent settlements or cities.

Since there's only one action available, there's no strategic decision to be made at this point. You must roll the dice to proceed with your turn.

After rolling, you'll likely have additional options based on the roll result, such as building roads, settlements, cities, or development cards, trading resources, or using development cards.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
