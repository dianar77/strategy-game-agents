Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
["Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)"]

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
Looking at the available actions, I only have one option:

Action 0: End my turn (Color BLUE)

Since this is the only action available to me, I don't have any alternatives to compare. When there's only one legal action in Catan, it typically means that I've either:

1. Already completed all the actions I wanted to do this turn
2. Cannot build anything due to lack of resources
3. Have just rolled the dice and cannot take any other actions
4. Have just completed a trade and need to end my turn

Without more context about the current game state, resources, or previous actions, I simply need to end my turn and pass play to the next player.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
