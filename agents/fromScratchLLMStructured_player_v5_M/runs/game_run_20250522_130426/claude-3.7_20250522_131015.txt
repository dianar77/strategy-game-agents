Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
["Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)", "Action 1: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(26, 27))", "Action 2: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(31, 32))", "Action 3: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(8, 9))", "Action 4: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(27, 28))", "Action 5: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(7, 8))", "Action 6: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(29, 30))"]

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
I'll analyze each available action for your Catan turn.

**Action 0: End Turn**
- This would simply end your turn without building anything.
- Since you have opportunities to build roads, ending your turn now would waste these building opportunities.

**Actions 1-6: Build Road options**

Let me analyze each road building location:
- Action 1: Road at (26, 27) - Need to evaluate if this extends toward valuable resources or potential settlement locations
- Action 2: Road at (31, 32) - Similar consideration as Action 1
- Action 3: Road at (8, 9) - This appears to be in the upper portion of the board
- Action 4: Road at (27, 28) - Continuing from the area of Action 1
- Action 5: Road at (7, 8) - Near Action 3, potentially creating a path in the upper board
- Action 6: Road at (29, 30) - Another road option, possibly connecting to other structures

Without seeing the full board layout, resource distributions, or your current settlements, it's difficult to make a fully informed decision. However, building roads is generally better than ending your turn if you have the resources.

Priority factors for road building:
1. Roads that lead toward high-value resource hexes
2. Roads that block opponent expansion
3. Roads that help you achieve longest road
4. Roads that connect to potential settlement spots

Without more context, I'd suggest either Action 3 or Action 5 (roads at 8,9 or 7,8) as they appear to be connected and might help you establish a path in what seems to be the upper portion of the board.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 3
