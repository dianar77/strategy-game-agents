Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
["Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)"]

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
I can see that in this Catan scenario, you only have one available option:

Action 0: End your turn (Color BLUE)

Since you only have one legal action available, there's no strategic decision to make here. You must end your turn.

When you only have the END_TURN action available, it means:
- You've already completed all the actions you can take during this turn
- You don't have resources/options to build anything
- You have no trades or other plays to make

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
