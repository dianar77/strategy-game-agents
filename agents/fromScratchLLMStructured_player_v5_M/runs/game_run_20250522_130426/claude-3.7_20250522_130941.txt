Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
["Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)"]

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
I need to analyze the available actions for a Catan player.

In this case, there is only one available action:

**Action 0**: Roll the dice (BLUE player, ROLL action)

Since this is the only option available to you right now, there's no strategic decision to make at this moment. Rolling the dice is the standard way to begin your turn in Catan. After rolling, you'll collect resources based on the result, and then you'll likely have additional actions available (building settlements, roads, development cards, or trading).

Since there is only one available action, my recommendation is straightforward:

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
