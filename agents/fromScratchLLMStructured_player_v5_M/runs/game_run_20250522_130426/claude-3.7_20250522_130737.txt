Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
["Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)"]

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
I see that you only have one available action: ending your turn.

Since there are no other options presented (like building settlements, roads, cities, buying development cards, or trading), it appears that either:

1. You have no resources left to build anything
2. You've already taken other actions this turn and now need to end your turn
3. You're in a situation where ending your turn is the only valid move

Given that Action 0 (ending your turn) is the only option available, there's no strategic decision to make between multiple choices.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
