Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
["Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)"]

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
I see that you're playing a game of Catan and need to make a decision, but there's only one available action right now:

Action 0: End your turn (BLUE player)

Since there's only one legal action available to you at this moment, there's no strategic decision to make. You must end your turn.

This situation typically occurs when:
- You've already played your development card (if any)
- You've already built or traded what you could afford
- Your turn is complete and the game is waiting for you to pass to the next player

Without any alternatives to consider, the choice is straightforward.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
