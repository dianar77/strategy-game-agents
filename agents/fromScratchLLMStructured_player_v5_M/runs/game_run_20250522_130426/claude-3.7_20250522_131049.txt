Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
["Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)"]

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
Looking at your available actions, you have only one option:

Action 0: End your turn (Color BLUE, Action Type END_TURN)

This is a situation where you have no other choices available - you can't build anything, trade, play development cards, or perform any other actions. When this is the case in Catan, it means you've either:

1. Already completed all the actions you wanted to take this turn
2. Don't have the resources to do anything else
3. Have reached a mandatory end of turn after certain other actions

Since ending your turn is your only option, there's no strategic decision to be made at this point. You should proceed with Action 0 and end your turn, allowing the next player to take their turn.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
