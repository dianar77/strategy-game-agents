Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
["Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)"]

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
Looking at the available actions, there's actually only one choice:

**Action 0**: End my turn (BLUE player)

Since this is the only action available, I don't need to compare different options. This suggests that either:
1. I've already performed all possible actions during my turn (like building, trading, etc.)
2. I don't have the resources to do anything else
3. I'm at a point in the game where ending the turn is the only valid move (perhaps immediately after rolling dice and not being able to build anything)

Without more information about my current resources, board position, or what actions I've already taken this turn, I can only recommend the single available option.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
