Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
["Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)"]

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
I only have one option available: ending my turn (Action 0). 

Since this is the only action listed, there are no alternatives to analyze or compare. This means either:

1. I've already completed all possible moves for this turn
2. I currently don't have the resources or valid placements for any other actions
3. It's not my turn yet and I need to end my turn to proceed with the game

Without additional information about the current game state, my resources, or what moves I've already made this turn, I can only recommend the one available action.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
