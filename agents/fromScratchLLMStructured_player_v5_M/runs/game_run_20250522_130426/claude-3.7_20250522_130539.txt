Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
["Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)"]

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
Looking at the available actions for this turn in Catan, I only see one option:

Action 0: End your turn (Color: BLUE, Action Type: END_TURN)

This indicates that you've already completed all possible actions for this turn, such as building roads, settlements, cities, or trading resources. Since there is only one legal move available - ending your turn - there are no alternative actions to consider.

When there's only one available action, it means you've either:
1. Already taken all possible actions for this turn
2. Don't have the necessary resources to build or develop
3. Have reached a point in the game where ending your turn is the only legal move

Since ending your turn is the only option available, you should proceed with it and plan your strategy for your next turn.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
