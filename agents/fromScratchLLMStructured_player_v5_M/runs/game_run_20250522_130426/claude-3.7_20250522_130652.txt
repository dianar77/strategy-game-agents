Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
["Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)"]

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
I'm helping you with your Catan game decision.

In this case, you only have one possible action available:

**Action 0**: Roll the dice (BLUE player)

This is the standard way to begin your turn in Catan. Rolling the dice will generate resources for all players who have settlements or cities adjacent to hexes matching the roll number. Since this is your only available action, there's no strategic decision to make here - you need to roll to continue your turn.

After rolling, depending on the outcome, you'll likely have additional actions available like building roads, settlements, cities, or trading resources.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
