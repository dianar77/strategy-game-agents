Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
["Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)"]

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
I see that there is only one available action in this game of Catan:

Action 0: Roll the dice (for the blue player)

In Catan, rolling the dice is how you start your turn. This roll will determine which resource tiles produce resources and which players collect those resources. Since this is the only available action, there's nothing to analyze or compare.

Rolling the dice is a mandatory action at the beginning of your turn in Catan, so you must proceed with this action.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
