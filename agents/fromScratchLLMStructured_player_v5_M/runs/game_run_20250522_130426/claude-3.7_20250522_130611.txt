Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
["Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)"]

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
I can see that there's only one available action in this case: rolling the dice (Action 0).

In Catan, rolling the dice is how you start your turn and determine which hexes produce resources. This is a mandatory action at the beginning of your turn (unless you have special cards that allow you to skip rolling).

Since there's only one option available, the decision is straightforward. You need to roll the dice to proceed with your turn. After rolling, you'll collect resources if your settlements or cities are adjacent to hexes matching the roll number, and then you'll have more action options (like building, trading, or playing development cards).

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
