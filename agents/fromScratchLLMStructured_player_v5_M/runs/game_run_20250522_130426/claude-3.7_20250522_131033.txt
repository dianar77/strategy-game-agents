You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
["Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)", "Action 1: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(9, 10))", "Action 2: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(26, 27))", "Action 3: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(31, 32))", "Action 4: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(2, 9))", "Action 5: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(27, 28))", "Action 6: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(7, 8))", "Action 7: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(29, 30))"]

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
I'll analyze each of the available road building options for the Blue player in Catan:

Action 1: Build Road at (9, 10)
- This would connect to your existing infrastructure
- Could extend your network in a potentially valuable direction
- Helps work toward longest road

Action 2: Build Road at (26, 27)
- Extends your road network in another direction
- May provide access to new building spots

Action 3: Build Road at (31, 32)
- Extends your road network
- May provide access to new resources or building locations

Action 4: Build Road at (2, 9)
- Connects to your existing infrastructure
- Creates a more interconnected network

Action 5: Build Road at (27, 28)
- Extends your reach in what appears to be the direction of your current expansion

Action 6: Build Road at (7, 8)
- Connects to your existing network
- May open up new settlement opportunities

Action 7: Build Road at (29, 30)
- Extends your network in another direction
- May provide strategic positioning

Without seeing the full board state including resource hexes, settlements, and other players' positions, I have to make a general recommendation. The most valuable roads are typically ones that:
1. Extend toward valuable resource hexes
2. Block opponents' expansion paths
3. Help you reach new settlement spots
4. Contribute to longest road

Since I don't have this specific information, I'll recommend Action 1 as it appears to connect to your existing infrastructure based on the coordinates.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 1
