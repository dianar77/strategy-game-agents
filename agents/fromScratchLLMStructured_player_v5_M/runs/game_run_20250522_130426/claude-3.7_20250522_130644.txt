Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
["Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)"]

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
I'll help you analyze your options in Catan.

Currently, you only have one available action:
- Action 0: Roll the dice (BLUE player, ROLL action)

In Catan, rolling the dice is how you generate resources at the beginning of your turn. This will determine which hexes produce resources, and players with settlements or cities adjacent to those hexes will collect resources accordingly.

Since this is your only available action, there's no strategic decision to make at this point. You need to roll the dice to continue your turn, after which you'll likely have more meaningful choices (building, trading, etc.) depending on what resources you and other players receive from the roll.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
