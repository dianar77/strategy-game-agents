Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
I'll analyze this situation for you. This appears to be the first settlement placement in a game of Catan, which is a crucial decision since it determines your initial resource access.

To evaluate the best settlement location, I need to consider:
1. Resource diversity
2. High-probability number tiles
3. Future expansion possibilities

Since we only have the settlement placement action numbers without a map showing which resources are at each location or what the probability numbers are, I can't make a fully informed recommendation.

However, based on typical Catan board layouts, some rules of thumb apply:
- Aim for 3 different resources if possible
- Prioritize high probability numbers (6, 8, 5, 9)
- Consider future road and settlement expansion
- Look for ports if they provide strategic advantage

Without specific board information, I would typically recommend choosing a spot that:
- Is at the intersection of 3 productive resource hexes
- Has diverse resources (especially brick and wood for early expansion)
- Has good probability numbers

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 20

Note: Without seeing the actual board layout, this is essentially a blind recommendation. In a real game, I would analyze the specific resources, numbers, and board position of each potential settlement location.
