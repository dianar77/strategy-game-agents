Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
["Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)"]

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
Based on the information provided, there is only one available action:

Action 0: End your turn (Color BLUE)

Since this is the only available action, there's no strategic decision to make at this moment. When there's only one option available in Catan, it typically means you've completed all possible actions for your turn (such as trading, building, playing development cards) or you're unable to take any other actions due to resource limitations.

Without additional context about your current game state (resource cards, potential builds, etc.), I can only recommend taking the only available action.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
