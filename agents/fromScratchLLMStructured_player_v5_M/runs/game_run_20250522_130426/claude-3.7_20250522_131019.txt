Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
["Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)"]

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
Looking at the available actions, there is only one option:

**Action 0**: End your turn (Color: BLUE)

Since this is the only action available to you right now, there's no strategic decision to make at this moment. This typically means you've already completed all possible moves for your turn (like trading, building, playing development cards) or you don't have the resources to take any other actions.

When there's only the END_TURN option available, it means the game is waiting for you to conclude your turn so the next player can proceed.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
