Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
["Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)"]

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
I see you're playing a game of Catan and trying to decide what action to take. Looking at the available actions, you only have one option:

Action 0: End your turn (Color: BLUE, Action Type: END_TURN)

Since this is the only action available to you, it suggests that you've either:
1. Already performed all possible actions during your turn (like building, trading, etc.)
2. Don't have the resources necessary to perform any other actions
3. Are at a point in the game where ending your turn is the only valid move

Without any alternatives to consider or additional information about your current game state (resources, board position, etc.), the decision is straightforward - you need to end your turn.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
