Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
["Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD: 'PLAY_KNIGHT_CARD'>, value=None)", "Action 1: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)"]

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
I'll analyze each available action for this Catan situation:

**Action 0: Play Knight Card**
Playing a Knight card would allow you to:
- Move the robber to block an opponent's resource production
- Steal a resource card from an opponent
- Contribute to building your "Largest Army" (worth 2 victory points if you have 3+ knights)
- Save the roll for later when you might need a specific resource

**Action 1: Roll the Dice**
Rolling the dice is the standard move to start your turn and:
- Potentially generate resources for all players based on the number rolled
- Move forward with your turn immediately
- Take advantage of any productive settlements/cities you currently have

**Analysis:**
Without additional context about your current game situation (like how many knight cards you've already played, what resources you need, positions of settlements, etc.), it's hard to make a highly optimized recommendation.

However, in general, playing development cards like Knights is often most valuable when:
1. You want to block a critical resource that opponents need
2. You're close to getting "Largest Army"
3. You want to steal a specific resource from an opponent
4. You're worried about rolling a 7

Simply rolling is the more straightforward option if you don't have any specific tactical need for the Knight card right now.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 1
