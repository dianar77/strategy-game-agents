Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
["Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(26, 27))", "Action 1: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(8, 27))", "Action 2: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(27, 28))"]

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"

Response:
# Analysis of Available Catan Road Building Options

Let me analyze each road building option to determine which would be most strategic for your position in the game.

## Action 0: Build road between points 26 and 27
This connects two points on the board, potentially extending your network in one direction. Without seeing the full board state, I can't determine if this leads toward valuable resource tiles or potential settlement spots.

## Action 1: Build road between points 8 and 27
This would connect point 8 to point 27. This might be creating a junction in your road network, possibly connecting two separate road segments. This could be useful for creating more flexibility in your expansion options.

## Action 2: Build road between points 27 and 28
This extends from point 27 to point 28, continuing your road network in another direction. This might lead toward unclaimed settlement spots or valuable resources.

Without seeing the full board configuration, it's difficult to determine the exact strategic value of each option. However, building roads that create multiple path options typically provides more flexibility.

Based on the information provided and the fact that point 27 appears in all three options (suggesting it's a key intersection in your network), Action 1 connecting points 8 and 27 might be most valuable as it potentially bridges different areas of your network, creating more expansion possibilities.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 1
