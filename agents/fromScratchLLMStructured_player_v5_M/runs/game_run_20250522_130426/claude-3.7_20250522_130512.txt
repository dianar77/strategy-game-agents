Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
["Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)"]

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
I only have one available action to analyze:

**Action 0: Roll the dice**
This is the standard way to begin your turn in Catan. Rolling the dice will generate resources for all players who have settlements or cities adjacent to hexes matching the rolled number. Since this is the only available action, you must roll the dice to proceed with your turn.

Rolling is always a bit of a gamble, as you can't control what numbers come up. A roll of 7 would activate the robber, allowing you to potentially disrupt an opponent's strategy. Any other roll will generate resources based on the board layout.

Since there are no alternative actions available at this moment, the decision is straightforward.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
