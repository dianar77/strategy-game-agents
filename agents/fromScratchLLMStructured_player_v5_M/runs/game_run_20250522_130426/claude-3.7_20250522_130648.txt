Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
["Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)"]

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
I see that you're playing a game of Catan, and currently you only have one available action:

Action 0: End your turn (for the BLUE player)

Since there's only one possible action available to you, there's no strategic decision to make at this moment. You must end your turn to allow the game to continue.

In Catan, ending your turn passes play to the next player, who will roll the dice and continue the game. Since you have no other options (like building settlements, roads, cities, or trading), you need to end your turn.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
