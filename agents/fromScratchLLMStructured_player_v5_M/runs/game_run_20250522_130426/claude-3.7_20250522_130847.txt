Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
["Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)", "Action 1: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUY_DEVELOPMENT_CARD: 'BUY_DEVELOPMENT_CARD'>, value=None)"]

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
Let me analyze the available actions for your Catan turn:

**Action 0: End Turn**
This would simply end your turn without taking any further actions, conserving your current resources for future turns.

**Action 1: Buy Development Card**
This would allow you to purchase a development card for the cost of 1 ore, 1 wool, and 1 grain. Development cards can provide:
- Victory points (kept hidden until needed)
- Knight cards (to move the robber and steal resources)
- Road Building (place 2 free roads)
- Year of Plenty (take 2 resources of your choice)
- Monopoly (collect all of one resource type from all players)

Since these are the only two options presented, and we don't have information about:
- Your current resources
- Your position on the board
- Other players' positions
- Victory point count

I need to make a recommendation with limited information. Generally, buying development cards is a strong strategic move in Catan when you can afford them, as they can provide hidden victory points and/or powerful effects.

However, without knowing if you have the required resources (ore, wool, grain), it's difficult to definitively recommend Action 1.

Given the limited information, if you have the required resources, buying a development card is usually advantageous for long-term strategy.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 1
