Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
["Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)"]

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
I need to evaluate the available actions in this Catan situation.

Looking at the provided information, I can see that there is only one action available:
- Action 0: End Turn (for Blue player)

Since this is the only option available to you right now, there's no strategic decision to make between multiple choices. This typically happens when:
1. You've already completed all other possible actions for your turn
2. You might have just completed a trade, built something, or played a development card
3. It's now time to pass the turn to the next player

Without seeing more context about your current game state (resources, settlements, roads, etc.), I can only advise that ending your turn is appropriate when you've exhausted all beneficial actions for this round.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
