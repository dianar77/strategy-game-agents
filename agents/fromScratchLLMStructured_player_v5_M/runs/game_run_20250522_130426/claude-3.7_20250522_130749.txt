Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
["Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)"]

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
I see you're playing Catan and need to make a decision about your next move. Let's analyze your options:

The only available action is:
- Action 0: End your turn (Color: BLUE)

Since this is the only option presented, there's not really a strategic choice to make here. This typically means you've completed all possible actions for your turn (like building, trading, playing development cards), and the game is prompting you to formally end your turn so the next player can begin theirs.

When you only have the END_TURN option available, it means you've either:
1. Already taken all the actions you wanted to for this turn
2. Don't have the resources to perform any other actions
3. Have completed a mandatory action (like moving the robber after rolling a 7)

With only one option available, the decision is straightforward.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
