Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
["Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)"]

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
I'm helping you with your Catan game decision. Let's analyze your available actions:

Currently, you only have one option available:
- Action 0: Roll the dice (Blue player)

In Catan, rolling the dice is the standard way to begin your turn. The roll determines which resource hexes produce resources and which players collect those resources. Since this is your only available action, there's no strategic decision to make regarding action selection at this moment.

After rolling, you'll likely have more interesting decisions based on the outcome of the roll - like building roads, settlements, cities, or trading.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
