Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
["Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)"]

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
I only have one option available, which is to roll the dice:

Action 0: Roll the dice (BLUE player)

Since this is the only action available, there's no strategic decision to make here. Rolling the dice is the standard way to begin your turn in Catan, determining which resources players will collect based on the number rolled and their settlements/cities adjacent to corresponding hexes.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
