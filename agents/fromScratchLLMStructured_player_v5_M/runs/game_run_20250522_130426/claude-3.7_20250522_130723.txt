Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
["Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)"]

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
Looking at your available actions, there's only one option:

**Action 0**: Roll the dice (BLUE player)

This is the standard way to begin your turn in Catan. Rolling the dice will determine which hexes produce resources for all players who have settlements or cities adjacent to those hexes. 

When you roll:
- If you roll a 7, you'll activate the robber and potentially force players with more than 7 cards to discard half
- Any other number will generate resources for players with settlements/cities on the corresponding hex

Since this is the only action available, and rolling is how you begin your turn to collect resources, this is clearly the best option.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
