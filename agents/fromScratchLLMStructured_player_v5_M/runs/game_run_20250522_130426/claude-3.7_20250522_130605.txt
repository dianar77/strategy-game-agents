Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
["Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)"]

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
Looking at your available actions, you only have one option:

**Action 0**: End your turn (Color BLUE, ActionType END_TURN)

Since this is your only available action, there's no strategic decision to make at this moment. You must end your turn and pass control to the next player.

This suggests that:
1. You've already used all your available building or trading actions for this turn
2. Or it's the very beginning of the game and you've completed your setup phase
3. Or you don't have the resources necessary to build anything

Without seeing the current game state (your resources, the board, etc.), I can't provide more specific analysis, but the system is only presenting you with the option to end your turn.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
