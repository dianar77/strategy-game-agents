Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
["Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)"]

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
Looking at your available actions for Catan, I only see one option available:

**Action 0**: End your turn (Color: BLUE, Action Type: END_TURN)

Since this is the only action available to you, you don't have any strategic decisions to make at this moment. This typically means you've already completed all possible building, trading, or development card actions for your turn, and the only remaining option is to pass play to the next player.

In Catan, when you can only end your turn, it means:
- You've used all your building opportunities
- You've completed any trades you wanted to make
- You've played any development cards you wanted to use this turn
- You have no other legal moves remaining

With only one option available, the decision is straightforward.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
