Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
["Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)"]

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
I'll help you analyze your available actions in Catan.

Currently, you only have one action available:
- **Action 0**: Roll the dice (BLUE player, ROLL action)

In Catan, rolling the dice is how resource production is determined at the start of each turn. When you roll, all players who have settlements or cities adjacent to hexes matching the dice roll number receive resources from those hexes.

Since this is your only available action, there's no strategic decision to make at this moment. Rolling the dice is mandatory at the beginning of your turn (unless you have other special actions that could be taken before rolling, which doesn't appear to be the case here).

After rolling, you'll likely have more options based on the resources you collect and the game state.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
