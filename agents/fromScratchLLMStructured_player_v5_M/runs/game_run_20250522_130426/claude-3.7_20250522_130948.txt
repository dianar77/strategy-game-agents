Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
["Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)"]

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
I only have one action available here, which is to roll the dice. In Catan, rolling the dice is how you begin your turn and determine resource production for all players. This is a mandatory first step in your turn (unless you have development cards you want to play before rolling).

Since there's only one possible action (Action 0: Roll the dice), there's no strategic decision to make at this moment.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
