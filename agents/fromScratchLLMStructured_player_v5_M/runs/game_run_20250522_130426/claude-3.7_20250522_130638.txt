Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
["Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)"]

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
Looking at your available actions, there's actually only one option:

Action 0: End your turn (BLUE player)

Since this is the only action available to you, there's no strategic decision to make in this particular moment. When only the END_TURN action is available, it means you've either:
1. Already completed all possible builds/trades for this turn
2. Don't have the resources to do anything else
3. Just rolled the dice and didn't get resources to use

Without seeing your current resources, board position, or other players' positions, I can only recommend taking the only available action. In future turns, you'll likely have more options to consider.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
