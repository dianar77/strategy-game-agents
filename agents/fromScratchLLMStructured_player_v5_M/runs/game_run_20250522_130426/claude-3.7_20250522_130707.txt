Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
["Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)"]

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
I see that you're playing Catan and need to make a decision, but there's only one option available to you:

Action 0: End your turn (as the BLUE player)

Since this is the only action available, there's nothing to compare or analyze strategically. You have no other legal moves at this moment in the game, which means you've likely already completed all possible actions for your turn (like trading, building, playing development cards, etc.).

When only END_TURN is available, it means the game is waiting for you to conclude your turn so the next player can take theirs.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
