Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
["Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.END_TURN: 'END_TURN'>, value=None)"]

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
I notice that you only have one available action in this game of Catan:

Action 0: End your turn (BLUE player)

Since this is the only available action, there's no strategic decision to make at this moment. You must end your turn and allow the next player to proceed.

In Catan, when you only have the END_TURN option available, it typically means you've already completed all possible actions for your turn, such as:
- Building settlements, cities, or roads
- Purchasing development cards
- Playing development cards
- Trading resources with other players or through ports

At this point, the strategic part of your turn is complete, and the only thing left is to formally end your turn.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
