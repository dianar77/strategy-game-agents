Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
["Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(30, 31))", "Action 1: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_ROAD: 'BUILD_ROAD'>, value=(29, 30))"]

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
I'll analyze each road building option to determine the best strategic choice for you in Catan.

**Action 0: Build Road between intersections 30 and 31**
This would extend your road network from intersection 30 to 31. Without seeing the full board state, I need to consider what this might achieve:
- Could create a path toward a new settlement location
- Might block an opponent's expansion route
- Could help you work toward the Longest Road achievement

**Action 1: Build Road between intersections 29 and 30**
This would extend your road network from intersection 29 to 30, or connect these intersections if you already have presence at both points.

Without seeing the complete board visualization, I'm making educated guesses about the strategic value of each road placement. In general, when deciding between road placements, you want to prioritize:
1. Roads that lead to valuable future settlement locations
2. Roads that block opponents' expansion
3. Roads that contribute to claiming Longest Road

Since both roads connect to intersection 30, this seems to be an important junction point. Without more context, the choice between extending to 31 or connecting back to 29 depends on where the better resource hexes are located and where you plan to build your next settlement.

Given the limited information, I'll recommend Action 0 as it appears to be extending your network to new territory (31) rather than potentially creating a loop back to 29.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
