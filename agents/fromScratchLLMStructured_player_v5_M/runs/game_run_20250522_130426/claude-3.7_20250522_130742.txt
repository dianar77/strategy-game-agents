Prompt:

You are an AI assistant helping a player make strategic decisions in a game of Catan.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
["Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)"]

Which action should I choose? Analyze each option and recommend the best action by returning the action index (e.g., "Action 2").
Provide your final recommendation at the end in the format: "RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action X"


========================================

Response:
Based on the information provided, you only have one available action:

"Action 0: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.ROLL: 'ROLL'>, value=None)"

This action means you (playing as BLUE) need to roll the dice. In Catan, rolling the dice is a mandatory action at the beginning of your turn to determine which resource-producing hexes will generate resources for players with settlements or cities adjacent to them.

Since this is your only option, there's no strategic decision to make at this point. After rolling, you'll likely have more choices like building roads/settlements, trading, playing development cards, etc.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Action 0
