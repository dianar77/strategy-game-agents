================================ Human Message =================================

You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN. That means 10 victory points.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>
6. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively
7. Think about the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Objective**: As this is the first settlement placement, it is critical to:
   - Maximize production by selecting nodes with high-resource-roll frequencies.
   - Diversify resource production by aiming for different resource types.
   - Position near valuable ports for future trades or resource-efficient strategies.

2. **Key Stats**:
   - The dice roll numbers (2-12) determine the probability of gaining resources. Numbers 6 and 8 are most frequent, followed by 5 and 9.
   - We want to focus on resources that are most vital for early-game development: 🌲WOOD, 🧱BRICK, and 🌾WHEAT. These allow quick establishment of roads and settlements.
   - Controlled access to ports could enable better trading in the mid and late game.

3. **Top Resource Nodes**:
   - Nodes connected to **8**, **6**, **5**, **9**, and **10** tiles should be prioritized.
   - Anchoring near diverse resources boosts adaptability. A good strategy is to include at least 🌲WOOD, 🧱BRICK, and a third complementary resource like 🌾WHEAT or 🐑SHEEP.

4. **Proximity to Ports**:
   - General-purpose (3:1) ports are flexible for any resource trade.
   - Specialized ports like 🌾WHEAT Port or 🧱BRICK Port help focus on exchanging surplus efficiently.

5. **Available Settlement and Resources**:
   - Since we can only build one settlement, selecting a starting location that balances resources and strategic positioning is key.
