- MEDIUM LEVEL GOAL: Improve the strategic decision-making of the `foo_player.py` to increase the average victory points and achieve at least one win within the next 5 iterations.
- LOW LEVEL GOAL: Implement the recommended strategy that prioritizes building settlements and upgrading them to cities to increase the average victory points in the next iteration.
- CHOSEN AGENT: CODER
- AGENT OBJECTIVE: Implement the following strategy in `foo_player.py`:

```python
def decide(self, game, playable_actions):
