I need to create a test for each api call, or class in the back end. put it in a separate folder call backendtest.

Generate Complete Test Files for the Backend
Objective:
Generate unit and integration test files to ensure full coverage of backend functionality, maintaining structural alignment with the main program.
Requirements:
- Identify all backend functions and generate corresponding test cases.
- Implement pytest tests for API endpoints, database interactions, and business logic.
- Ensure coverage of edge cases, error handling, and security aspects.
- Use mocks for database queries and external dependencies.
Restrictions:
- Do not modify the original backend source files.
- All generated test files must follow the functional order of the main backend program, both in terms of files and functions.
- Place all test files in the Backend_test/ directory.
Expected result:

A complete set of Python test files, stored in Backend_test/, fully aligned with the program structure.
