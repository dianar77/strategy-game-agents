Generate Frontend Test Files
Objective:
Create frontend test files to ensure coverage of UI components without modifying the application code. Test files should be stored in the Frontend_test/ directory.
Requirements:
- Use the Jest and React testing libraries (or tools from the corresponding framework).
- Write unit tests for React components, hooks, and utility functions.
- Generate integration tests for UI flows and API interactions.
- Ensure mock API requests and proper state handling.
Restrictions:
- Do not modify existing frontend source files.
- Place all generated test files in the Frontend_test/ directory.
Expected Result:

A complete set of frontend test files stored in Frontend_test/ that cover untested components.
