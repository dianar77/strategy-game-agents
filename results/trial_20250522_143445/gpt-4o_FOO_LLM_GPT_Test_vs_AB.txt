LLM Response: I'll analyze the available actions to find the optimal first settlement placement in this initial setup phase.

Action: Action(color=<Color.BLUE: 'BLUE'>, action_type=<ActionType.BUILD_SETTLEMENT: 'BUILD_SETTLEMENT'>, value=14)

Justification: I'm selecting settlement location 14 because it has the highest heuristic score of 8.305555555555555 among all available options. This is a critical decision since this is the first settlement placement in the game. Location 14 likely offers the best combination of access to diverse resources based on the heuristic evaluation. In the early game, positioning settlements strategically is crucial as they determine which resources you'll collect throughout the game. Since we have no resources yet and this appears to be the initial placement phase, selecting the highest-scored location will give us the strongest foundation for resource generation, which will fuel all future expansions. The higher score suggests this location may have better number probabilities and/or resource diversity than other options, which aligns perfectly with our primary goal of building settlements early to expand resource collection capabilities.
