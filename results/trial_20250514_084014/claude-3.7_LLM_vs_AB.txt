Updated plan: Save the Year of Plenty card for when I can complete a city build. After rolling, if I get at least 1 more wheat, I'll use Year of Plenty to get 2 ore and build my first city at node 22. If I don't get wheat but get ore, I'll save for a city. If I get other resources, I'll consider trading at ports or buying another development card. Long-term focus remains on upgrading settlements to cities and accumulating hidden victory points.

Updated plan: Continue accumulating resources for development cards. With my strong ore production, I should hold my current ore and wait until next turn when I'll likely have even more ore plus additional resources from my cities. Once I have wheat and sheep (either through production or more efficient trades), I'll purchase development cards that could give me victory points or knights. Long-term, I should look to build a road and settlement toward the sheep port to improve my sheep situation.

Updated plan: Continue with development card strategy. Save my current resources (2 Brick, 4 Ore) until next turn when I might draw more resources. With 4 Ore, I'm close to buying a development card (costs 1 Ore, 1 Wheat, 1 Sheep), and will focus on that when I get the wheat and sheep. My roads with 2 Brick will be built strategically toward the 2:1 sheep port to improve trading efficiency. Path to victory: 2 cities (4 VP) + 1 hidden VP + largest army (2 VP) + 3 more VP from development cards or settlements.

Updated plan: Move robber to RED's sheep 8 hex to block their strongest production, which affects both their city and settlement. Continue focusing on development cards to secure Largest Army. Save my knight card for when I need to protect my own production. With my next resources (1 ore and 2 brick), I'll aim to build roads toward the ore port at nodes 48-49 for settlement expansion, which will give me access to more ore.

Updated plan: I should roll the dice to gather more resources. My primary focus is getting enough resources for a settlement (need brick, wood, wheat + already have sheep). With two cities, I should be generating resources quickly. I'll save my knight card for when the robber blocks one of my high-value hexes or when I have resources to protect. I need to identify a good location for my next settlement and build roads toward it. My path to 10 VP is: 2 cities (4 VP) + Largest Army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards + 1 more settlement (1 VP) = 9 VP, then either one more settlement or a city upgrade.

Updated plan: Move robber to the Sheep-8 hex (1, -1, 0) and steal from RED. This unblocks my brick production while disrupting RED's strong sheep production. Then, I'll work toward either building a settlement (if I get wood/brick) or upgrading to a city (if I get ore/wheat). With 8 total VP (including hidden ones), I need just 2 more to win.

Updated plan: I'll build roads at edge (11, 12) and edge (22, 23). This expands from both of my current cities, giving me the most flexibility for future settlements. My next priority is gathering resources to build settlements at nodes 12 and 23, which would give me the 2 VP I need to win. Each of these positions offers good resource diversity and production potential.

Updated plan: Continue with building a road at edge (23, 52) to connect to the 3:1 port. Next, acquire a sheep (hopefully by stealing it now) to build a settlement at node 52. This would give me access to the port and reach 10 VP (8 current + 2 from the settlement).

Updated plan: Move robber to RED's WHEAT5 hex (2, -1, -1) to block their production and potentially steal WHEAT. I need 2 WHEAT and already have 3 ORE to build my final city for 10 VP. On future turns, I'll use the 2:1 WHEAT port if needed to convert excess resources. If I get WHEAT from this steal, I'll be much closer to my city build and victory.

Updated plan: Play my Knight card to move the robber onto RED's wheat production at (1,0,-1) or (2,-1,-1) to potentially steal wheat. This reduces my hand size below 7 cards, protects against losing resources on a 7 roll, and potentially gives me the wheat I desperately need. After rolling, I'll evaluate purchasing a development card if I get wheat, or trading at ports to get wheat.

Trading away my ORE at a 4:1 rate is too inefficient and wouldn't allow me to build anything this turn anyway. Save resources for more efficient use next turn.

Updated plan: Place the robber on SHEEP 8 hex (1, -1, 0) to disrupt RED's production across 3 settlements, and hopefully steal a useful resource. Continue accumulating resources, prioritizing WHEAT which I need for both development cards and settlements. Watch RED carefully as they are 1 VP from winning. My goal is to either build a settlement (2 more VP needed) or get another development card that might give me a victory point.

Updated plan: Play the knight card to move the robber off my ore hex and place it on RED's wood hex (6). This will free up my ore production while limiting RED's access to wood which they need for expansion. Continue focusing on collecting ore and wheat for development cards and city upgrades. Next expansion target remains node 9 for better resource diversity.

Updated plan: Move the robber to RED's wood hex (6). This disrupts both of RED's settlements by blocking their most productive resource. Next, focus on buying a development card with my sheep and ore, then start saving for a city upgrade on my ore-producing settlement at node 7. Continue targeting node 9 for my next settlement to diversify resources.

Updated plan: Play the knight card to move the robber away from the wood hex to a hex that produces resources for Red (ideally their ore or wheat hex). Steal a resource from Red, hoping for wood, wheat or ore. With my brick and sheep reserves, I'll aim to build a road and settlement toward node 9 once I acquire wood. Then focus on upgrading settlements to cities when I get ore and wheat. Continue working toward largest army by playing knights strategically.

Updated plan: Continue expanding toward wheat port (nodes 35, 36). Focus on developing cities at node 2 to maximize ore/wheat production. Use wheat port to efficiently convert excess wheat. Target development cards for hidden victory points and largest army. Balance city upgrades with minimal settlement expansion. Prioritize blocking Red's high-value wood production to slow their expansion.
