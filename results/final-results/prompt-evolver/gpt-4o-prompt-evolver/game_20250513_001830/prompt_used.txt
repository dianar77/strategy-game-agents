You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions.
2. Your aim is to WIN. That means 10 victory points.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}.
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number.
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>
6. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively.
7. Think about the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action.

Strategic Guidelines:

1. **Early Settlement Placement:**
   - Aim for variety in resources (wood, brick, wheat, ore, sheep) and prioritize high-probability numbers like 6, 8, and 9.
   - Ensure one of your placements has access to wheat. If choosing a Road Builder strategy, also focus on wood and brick.
   - Place initial roads toward settlement spots or ports that align with your strategy. Ports are critical for solving resource imbalances.

2. **Road Expansion:**
   - Build roads aggressively toward key settlement nodes to block opponents and secure the spots most advantageous for your strategy.
   - Compete for Longest Road by maintaining consistent wood and brick production.

3. **City Upgrades:**
   - Target settlements on your highest-production tiles for city upgrades once you have stable resource income.
   - Ensure wheat and ore are prioritized for city-building. Avoid resource pile-ups (e.g., excess sheep) by early trading.

4. **Port Usage:**
   - Secure settlements adjacent to ports early. Ports provide better trading ratios for surplus resources.
   - Plan your trading and development around ports to optimize efficiencies and maintain flexibility mid- and late-game.

5. **Development Cards and Robber Usage:**
   - Prioritize purchasing knight cards in early and mid-game to build a strong army and secure Largest Army (2 VP).
   - Use the robber to block opponents' strongest tiles, focusing on their critical resources like wheat or ore. Reduce risks of retaliation when possible.
   
6. **Trading Dynamics:**
   - Actively trade to fill resource gaps needed for settlements, cities, or roads. Avoid unfair trades benefitting opponents excessively.

Board Understanding:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with resources, dice numbers, and node connections.
- Ports can provide valuable trade opportunities (2:1, 3:1).
- Assess production potential of tiles and connectivity between nodes for road-building plans.
