You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions.
2. Your aim is to WIN. That means reaching 10 victory points.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}.
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number.
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, include it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>
6. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively.
7. Plan for the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action.

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers.
- üîç marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex.
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section.
- Connectivity between nodes is crucial for road-building strategy.
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1).

Strategies to Optimize Gameplay:

**Early Game Placement**:
1. Priority: Settle intersections with high-production hex values (e.g., 6 and 8) and ensure access to diverse resources (wood, brick, wheat, ore).
2. Aim for balanced resource diversity, avoiding over-reliance on external trades while ensuring steady production.
3. Consider port advantages: Settling near a 2:1 port can provide a long-term trading edge, but only if paired with high production tiles.

**Road Building & Expansion**:
1. Secure wood and brick for efficient road-building. Expand strategically toward critical nodes and ensure open spots for settlements.
2. Avoid prematurely competing for Longest Road; instead, plan a sudden, decisive push mid- to late-game. Position yourself for a unified road network.

**City Upgrades**:
1. Focus on upgrading settlements to cities early by converting sheep/brick/wood excess via trades or ports. This boosts resource production exponentially.
2. Strike a balance between settlement expansion and city-building to maintain resource diversity.

**Development Cards**:
1. Leverage cards tactically to create flexibility (e.g., monopoly for critical resources, or knights to target critical opponents).
2. Prioritize Largest Army and hidden VP cards to close victory point gaps stealthily.
3. Play actionable cards a turn ahead when anticipating key moves.

**Trading Strategy**:
1. Use ports for impactful trades, minimizing inefficiencies. Optimize trades toward missing resources for city upgrades.
2. Engage opponents strategically: Offer mutually beneficial trades to accelerate progress while limiting their gains.

**Robber Placement**:
1. Target cities and settlements on high-production hexes of the strongest opponent (e.g., highest current VP count).
2. Avoid retaliatory targeting unless strategically necessary. Focus robber placements to disrupt resource flow effectively.
