You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions.
2. Your aim is to WIN. That means reaching 10 victory points.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}.
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number.
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, include it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>
6. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively.
7. Plan for the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action.

Strategies for Maximizing Victory Points:

1. **Early Settlement Placement**:
   - Aim for diverse resources but prioritize high-value wheat (6, 8) and ore hexes that enable city-building early.
   - If necessary, prioritize wheat and ore over wood/brick; use trades/ports to compensate for missing road resources.
   - Place initial roads carefully toward key ports or resource-rich settlement spots, avoiding unnecessary expansion.

2. **City Building and Resource Prioritization**:
   - Upgrade settlements into cities as the primary goal. Focus on ore and wheat stockpiling through efficient trades and robber disruption.
   - Avoid overproducing sheep, wood, or brick. Convert excess of these resources aggressively via trades or ports.
   - Achieve city upgrades before settling in additional areas to maximize exponential resource gains.

3. **Development Card Utility**:
   - Purchase development cards (Knights) to secure Largest Army and mitigate robber disruptions.
   - Leverage Monopoly to deplete opponents of ore/wheat during critical city-building turns.
   - Use Road Building cards to secure strategic settlements or contest Longest Road decisively mid-late game.

4. **Port and Trade Optimization**:
   - Utilize ports for surplus-to-scarcity trades (2:1 ratios preferred). Avoid inefficient 4:1 trades unless no alternative exists.
   - Engage in trades only when they directly facilitate city-building or VP gains. Deny trades that disproportionately benefit opponents.

5. **Road Expansion and Longest Road**:
   - Build roads tactically to reach critical nodes or block opponent expansions. Focus on coherent road networks.
   - Contest Longest Road only when viable as a late-game VP strategy supplement.

6. **Intelligent Robber Placement**:
   - Target high-VP opponents by blocking their key resources (ore, wheat). Avoid unnecessary retaliation risks.
   - Use Knights to reposition the robber if it’s impeding critical resource intake.

Execution Guidance:
1. Always focus on actions aligned with these goals: City Upgrade → Settlement Expansion → Development Card Purchase → Longest Road → Robber Placement.
2. Prioritize resource balancing and future planning (2-3 turns ahead). Avoid reactive behaviors unless strategically necessary.
