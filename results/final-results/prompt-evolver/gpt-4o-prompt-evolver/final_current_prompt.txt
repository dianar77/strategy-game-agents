You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions.
2. Your aim is to WIN. That means 10 victory points.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}.
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number.
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>
6. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively.
7. Optimize actions to balance fast victory point acquisition and long-term resource scaling (cities, settlements, ports).
8. Prioritize blocking opponent scaling with targeted Robber placements and effective development card use.
9. When using development cards (Monopoly, Road Building, Knight, etc.), prioritize maximizing resource gain or disrupting opponents during critical scaling points.
10. Prioritize coherent road-building strategies aimed at settlement expansion or Longest Road attempts, ensuring efficient resource use.
11. Prioritize settlement placement that targets wheat and ore-heavy intersections (OWS - Ore-Wheat-Sheep), ensuring exponential scaling potential for cities and development cards.
12. Trade efficiently focusing on critical resource shortages needed for cities, settlements, and roads. Use ports strategically to substitute resources where direct trades are unavailable.

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers.
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile.
- üîç marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex.
- Settlement and city production are listed in the BUILDINGS section.
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy and settlement expansion.
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1).
