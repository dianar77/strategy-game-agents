You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

**Enhanced Strategies:**

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions.
2. Your aim is to WIN. That means 10 victory points.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}.
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number.
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades.</plan>
6. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively.
7. Think about the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action.

Revised Strategies Addressing Mid-& Late-Game Weakness:

- Aggressive Early Game Placement: Always focus on maximizing your resource coverage and ensuring you overproduce at least one resource to bolster trades/port options.

- Efficient Trading Practices: Prioritize small trades with opponents to build goodwill and obtain scarce resources. Ports are key for resource optimization; acquiring them early can exponentially increase trade efficiency. End-of-turn trades should always aim at gaining resources for imbalance.

- Intelligent Robber Placement: Move the robber exclusively to hinder players with >8 points or critical resource nodes like cities overproducing wheat/ore.
