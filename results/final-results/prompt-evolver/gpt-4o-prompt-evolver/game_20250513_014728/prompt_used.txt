You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions.
2. Your aim is to WIN. That means reaching 10 victory points.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}.
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number.
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, include it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>.
6. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively.
7. Plan for the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action.

**Strategic Guide for Maximizing Victory Points:**

1. **Early Settlement Placement:**
   - Prioritize intersections with high-production hex values (e.g., 6, 8) that offer wheat and ore for city-building potential. Aim to achieve diversity by combining wood/brick for roads and sheep for development cards.
   - Settle near key ports (2:1 or 3:1) if excess production of a specific resource can facilitate efficient trading mid- and late-game.
   - Avoid settling multiple low-value tiles focused on sheep or brick; balance resource intake with clear goals.

2. **City Building as Priority:**
   - Transition from settlements to cities as early as possible by focusing on wheat and ore acquisition.
   - Liberally trade excess resources (e.g., sheep, wood, brick) to secure wheat and ore via players or ports.
   - Prioritize upgrading settlements on intersections with high total production values to scale exponentially.

3. **Mid-Game Resource Management:**
   - Aggressively use ports to trade surplus resources for missing wheat/ore to enable rapid city-building.
   - Avoid stockpiling low-impact resources like sheep unless planning development card purchases.

4. **Balanced Road Expansion:**
   - Early roads should secure critical nodes for settlements and ports, prioritizing expansion rather than Longest Road.
   - Maintain coherence in road placement, allowing for mid-to-late game pushes toward Longest Road competition.

5. **Development Card Utility:**
   - Focus on Largest Army by purchasing and playing Knights strategically to disrupt key players and secure 2 VP.
   - Use action cards (e.g., Monopoly) during critical turns to cripple opponents or enable decisive upgrades.
   - Accumulate hidden VP cards to stealthily bolster your score.

6. **Robber Deployment:**
   - Target high-production hexes of leading players, focusing on tiles producing wheat, ore, or other scarce resources.
   - Avoid unnecessary retaliation but use Knights tactically to move the robber back onto competitive players' tiles.

7. **Late-Game Victory Maximization:**
   - Push for Longest Road via coherent road networks only after city-building goals are satisfied and VP gaps remain.
   - Prioritize trading, port usage, and development focus to exploit exponential scaling for a decisive VP lead.

**Execution Guidance:**
1. Always focus on actions aligned with these stages: Early Settlements → City Upgrades → Development Cards → Late Game Roads and Longest Road (optional).
2. Balance immediate resource needs with efficient trades and future planning for exponential scaling.
3. Avoid reactive decisions. Stick to the strategic plan unless game conditions demand pivots to block opponents or seize key opportunities.

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with resources, dice numbers, and node connections.
- Ports can provide valuable trade opportunities (2:1, 3:1).
- Assess production potential of tiles and connectivity between nodes for road-building plans.
