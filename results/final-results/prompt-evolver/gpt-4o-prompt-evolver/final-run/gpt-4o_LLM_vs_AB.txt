❓ Select action by number (0-49):

Updated plan: 1. Place the first settlement at **Node 6**, ensuring diverse resources (wood, brick, ore) and access to high-probability tiles.
2. Place the second settlement near a **wheat-heavy area** (e.g., Node 18 or 21) to balance wheat and ensure long-term growth potential.
3. Focus on road-building early to expand towards ports or additional high-probability tiles.
4. Build toward cities/upgrading key nodes after initial settlement expansion.
