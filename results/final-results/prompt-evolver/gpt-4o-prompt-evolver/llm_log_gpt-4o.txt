    "prompt_used": "You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.\n\nRules:\n1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions\n2. Your aim is to WIN. That means 10 victory points.\n3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \\boxed{5}\n4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number\n5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:\n   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>\n6. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively\n7. Think about the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action\n\nBoard Understanding Guide:\n- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers\n- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile\n- \ud83d\udd0d marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex\n- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section\n- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy\n- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)",

Placing your initial settlements in Settlers of Catan is crucial for setting up a strong position in the game. Here are some strategies to consider when placing your settlements:
1. Resource Variety

Aim to have access to a variety of resources (brick, wood, wheat, sheep, and ore). A balanced resource base helps you build roads, settlements, and cities effectively.

2. High-Probability Numbers [...] Work with what the dice give you. Sometimes, that will be nothing.
Your strategy in Catan will be based heavily off of your initial placement of your Settlements. The serpentine placement pattern (P1, P2, P3, P4, P4, P3, P2, P1) is very good at balancing out who gets access to the best spots, but think carefully about where you‚Äôre going to start and what you‚Äôre going to work towards. [...] The first player has the advantage of choosing the best spot, but the second player can often secure a complementary position. Consider the overall board layout and your opponents' strategies.

Example Strategy

First Settlement: Place on a high-probability wheat and brick tile (e.g., a 6 wheat and 5 brick).
Second Settlement: Aim for a location that gives you access to ore and sheep (e.g., a 9 ore and 4 sheep), or a good port depending on your resource needs.

Colonist Strategies: What are the Best Catan Starting Strategies?

Today we will be giving you pointers on the best starting placement strategies for Settlers of Catan that you can use in Colonist.

Colonist.io

1. Identify Your Goals

The first and most important Catan Strategy is knowing what you want to build. This will dictate which resources you should go after when you place your starting settlements. [...] Overall, placing your starting settlements wisely will give you a huge advantage in Settlers of Catan. But this is just one of the many strategies that can be employed in the game.

It is very hard to employ all these tactics in every game though, as the board is arranged randomly by the system and your neighbors choices restrict yours.

However, having a good grasp of starting positions and initial placements will help greatly in winning you your next Colonist game. [...] 3. Scarcity - Monopolizing Resources

While placing the first settlement. Going for scarcity is usually a good option. This means that if there isn‚Äôt much of a certain resource and you can monopolize that resource do it.

Trading that resource to others will be a piece of cake since they will not be able to obtain that resource easily with other methods.

4. Observe Thy Neighbor

Resource Synergy

Try to have settlements that gain you compatible pairs of resources, such as wood and brick, or ore and wheat. Wood and brick will allow you to quickly build roads in the early game, working towards more settlements. Ore and wheat will allow you to upgrade your settlements into cities, thus increasing resource production.

Each of these combinations can be very strong, but if you only have brick and wheat, you can't do either of them.

Once in a while, one of the above strategies for the robber may be correct. If someone has nine victory points, and a handful of cards, putting the robber on them probably is the best idea. At the end of the game, placing the robber is pretty easy to figure out. But, what about in the beginning of the game? What about the middle? Placing the robber in the early/middle of the game will absolutely have one intended effect ‚Äì someone will not like you for putting it on them. If you‚Äôve hit someone [...] You should also make sure that you only affect one player with the robber. Affecting two players doubles the revenge factor, as well as doubles the motivation to move it with a soldier card. If only one person is affected, then the robber will probably spend longer on that spot. As a rule of thumb, in the early/middle game, you should place the robber on the player to your right. The reason is that it will spend more time there. The player to your right can‚Äôt take the robber off for two or [...] If you have an unplayed soldier, you can minimize any robber damage from the player on your right. He can place it on you and take a card, but it will only affect one roll. After that, it will be your turn. You can move the robber with your soldier and stick it back on the player to your right for three more rolls before he can do anything about it. Meanwhile, you‚Äôre building up credibility and trust with the other two players by not ever putting the robber on them. This will make them less

As a result, you will start with a road which gives you a great first mover advantage if you are in a race with anyone. This can help you secure a contested spot with your first settlement or deliberately cut someone off placing two roads from your second placement.
#13. Consider which spots will always be knighted.

In a development card heavy game (lots of ore, grain, and wool), knights can play a major role in directing where the robber is placed. [...] It‚Äôs typically best to control the rare resource since the rest of the table will offer you generous trades for it. If you don‚Äôt budge, their games may stall while yours could still be progressing. Also, even if it makes you a target of the robber, you can leverage your rare resource as a bartering tool to keep the robber elsewhere.

#3. Relative production of complementary resources.

It probably goes without saying, but robber placement should hinder the biggest threat to you and in general, experienced Catan gamers will be understanding if that‚Äôs what you do.  Less forgiving is when you use it early on, hitting many people at once.  That tends to leave a bad taste in people‚Äôs mouths as they look for retribution.  Having multiple people gunning for you is not fun.  Also, if you can‚Äôt figure out who to sic the robber on, place it on the person to your right.  There‚Äôs a high [...] 3. Understand which resources are scarce:
The interesting thing in Settlers of Catan is that no matter your strategy, you‚Äôll need every resource eventually.  And if one of the resources turns out to be rare, expect competition to be fierce! Use those rare resources to your advantage by trading aggressively and cutting deals that would be borderline highway robbery.

Rather than attempting to collect every resource, it‚Äôs generally more effective to focus on only a few resources. The two main ways to do this are the ‚ÄúWood / Brick‚Äù strategy, and the ‚ÄúOre / Wheat‚Äù strategy. [...] Let‚Äôs start by talking about some of the overall strategies you can take in Catan. The first strategy is the ‚ÄúBalanced Approach‚Äù. In this strategy you are simply trying to diversify your resources as much as possible by placing your settlements on a wide variety of resources, with a variety of different numbers. The goal of this strategy is to ensure that you have access to every material in the game, without relying on trading with other players or the bank. This is a very basic strategy that [...] The second resource-based strategy is the ‚ÄúOre / Wheat‚Äù Strategy. This strategy focuses on building cities and buying development cards, and lends itself towards getting the largest army card. By building cities as early as possible you can increase your resource gathering, with the added bonus that your first cities will probably be on your original settlements which should be in prime locations on the board. While you can technically win with only your first two cities, the largest army, and

Here it is:
Favour Odds over Resources

More importantly, how badly do they need the resource you have?¬† Friendly trading takes place at a 1:1 ratio ‚Äî say, one wheat for one ore.¬† But friendly trading doesn‚Äôt win games. If you have a resource someone really needs, push for a 2:1 or 3:1 ratio.¬† And don‚Äôt limit yourself to expecting only one type of resource in exchange for the one you have that they really need. [...] When looking for intersections to place your first Settlements, pay less attention to the type of resource and more attention to the number of dots on the hex tiles that make up the intersections.¬† The type of resource matters less than the frequency of obtaining them. After all, resources can be traded to the bank at 4:1 or at Ports for an even better return (see below). [...] You‚Äôll be the only one with that resource throughout the game ‚Äî never trade it away.
Trade Big or Trade with the Bank
Trading is a big part of Catan.
In the early rounds, when everyone is looking to expand, I‚Äôve noticed people are often willing to freely trade with other players.¬† Different strategies require different resources, so exchanges can almost seem friendly.
Later in the game, however, things are different.

You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN. That means 10 victory points.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>
6. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively
7. Think about the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- üîç marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)================================== Ai Message ==================================

7. Think about the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action

Strategies to Employ:
- Prioritize settlement placements that maximize both resource diversity and numbers with high probabilities (e.g., tiles with 6 or 8). Ensure access to at least one wood-brick pair for early road building and a wheat-ore pair for city upgrades.
- Aim for early control of scarce resources to monopolize their trade value. Strategically trade and build to secure critical resources (e.g., brick if scarce).
- Use resource scarcity to your advantage when trading; make trades that favor your needs while pressuring opponents.
- Place robber strategically: target opponents with high victory points and effective production without creating alliances against you. Prefer targeting only one player at a time and consider placing it on rare resources they depend on.
- Focus on building towards ports early for better trading efficiency (2:1 or 3:1 trades), particularly for resources you overproduce.
- Balance road expansion and resource production to secure critical nodes or block opponents effectively.

**SUMMARY:**

1. **What the agent has learned from the game results:**
   - *Weakness in Performance:* The agent (PromptRefiningLLMPlayer:BLUE) consistently lost all five games to the AlphaBetaPlayer:RED. It averaged 4 victory points (VP) compared to the opponent's 10 VP, highlighting a significant gap in strategy execution.
   - *Specific Deficits:* The agent's average settlements (2.2), cities (0), road building (0), and largest army contributions (0.4) indicate poor early game infrastructure development. Its reliance on victory points from development cards (1.0 on average) was insufficient to compete.
   - *Decision Errors:* The game logs revealed suboptimal resource gathering, frequent misplacement of the robber, and inefficient road/settlement placement. The strategy lacked foresight for resource scarcity, effective trading, and interaction with opponents.

2. **What strategies were implemented in the prompt:**
   - *Improved Settlement Placement Strategy:* Focused on maximizing resource diversity and prioritizing high-probability numbers (e.g., 6, 8) for better production rates. Also emphasized the importance of securing key resource pairs (wood-brick and ore-wheat).
   - *Resource Scarcity and Monopoly:* Recommended leveraging scarce resources to control their trade value and create dependency among opponents.
   - *Effective Robber Usage:* Updated to target opponents with higher victory points and block key resources they rely on, while avoiding targeting multiple players to reduce retaliation.
   - *Trade Efficiency through Ports:* Suggested prioritizing early road building towards ports to enable more favorable (2:1 or 3:1) trades, especially for surplus resources.
   - *Balanced Road Expansion:* Emphasized expanding towards critical nodes and blocking opponents while maintaining steady resource production.

3. **Performance metrics observed:**
   - *Previous Metrics:*
     - Average Turns per Game: 102.8
     - Average Duration: ~413.5 seconds
     - Victory Points: 4.0 for PromptRefiningLLMPlayer vs. 10.0 for AlphaBetaPlayer
     - Critical Weaknesses: 0 cities, 0 average roads, only 2.2 settlements, and marginal benefit from armies.

   - *Baseline Results:* The AlphaBetaPlayer achieved consistent wins and better resource conversion metrics. Given this disparity, strategic interventions focused on improving resource gathering, structure building (settlements, cities, roads), trading, and intelligent robber placement.

You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN. That means 10 victory points.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>
6. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively
7. Think about the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- üîç marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)================================== Ai Message ==================================

Ensure access to at least one wood-brick pair for early road building and a wheat-ore pair for city upgrades.\n- Aim for early control of scarce resources to monopolize their trade value. Strategically trade and build to secure critical resources (e.g., brick if scarce).\n- Use resource scarcity to your advantage when trading; make trades that favor your needs while pressuring opponents.\n- Place robber strategically: target opponents with high victory points and effective production without creating alliances against you. Prefer targeting only one player at a time and consider placing it on rare resources they depend on.\n- Focus on building towards ports early for better trading efficiency (2:1 or 3:1 trades), particularly for resources you overproduce.\n- Balance road expansion and resource production to secure critical nodes or block opponents effectively.\n\nBoard Understanding Guide:\n- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers\n- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile\n- \ud83d\udd0d marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex\n- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section\n- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy\n- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)",

As someone who has been studying Catan for years and even won a couple tournaments ‚Äî I have learned a lot of tricks of the trade, inventing some myself. Even though Catan is just a game and you should be able to do what‚Äôs best to win, people do take moves personally. If you‚Äôre not an avid player and think a lot of this guide is excessive and was written by a crazy person overly obsessed with a board game..you‚Äôre probably right. If you‚Äôre interested in taking your game to the next level AGAIN and haven‚Äôt seen my last strategy guide on Catan, you may find my other post on Medium here: ‚Äúultimate strategy guide to starting settlements in catan‚Äù.

Name: web_search_tool_call

<Document href="https://medium.com/@MaorCohen/5-negotiation-tips-from-settlers-of-catan-4bb1b249e14c"/>
Building goodwill can manifest through taking mercy on a struggling player with robber placement (and letting him or her know), making many trades early in the game, or even rationally explaining to someone you are robbing of resources exactly why you are doing it, so they don‚Äôt take it personally and seek retribution.

Reciprocity is among the most powerful ‚ÄúWeapons of Influence,‚Äùand you should use it to your advantage.

Losing Hurts More than Winning Feels Good [...] When trading resources with other players, it can be easy for the negotiations to break down when you can‚Äôt find a suitable 1 for 1 exchange. However, you greatly increase your likelihood of reaching a deal if you can find things other than what initially brought you to the table over which to trade. A personal favorite of mine is including a promise for one (or both) of the sides not to place the robber on each other the next time they move it. This makes the trade more of a win-win, but it [...] ‚Äúrobber.‚Äù

In Catan, players who are assholes tend to start finding that others won‚Äôt trade with them, or that the robber falls on them a lot. Another good reason not to be an asshole.
2.  Consider goodwill moves. Giving people good trades now and then (particularly if they‚Äôre behind) or putting the robber on the desert can pay dividends down the line. It might be worth it! [...] 4.  Whine a bit when you‚Äôre being picked on, but be a good sport if you‚Äôre losing. It‚Äôs perfectly acceptable to try to talk someone out of putting the robber on you yet again, but don‚Äôt go overboard. Expect that you‚Äôll get the robber when you‚Äôre ahead, and take it gracefully. Don‚Äôt pester the others too much, but feel free to pester them some. [...] Use your knights wisely, if you can move the robber with your knight, always look for the strongest player in the game, and put the robber in the hex that he needs the most. Usually it would be on a city hex that provide commodities cards, especially the green type.

    new_text: You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

**Enhanced Strategies:**

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions.
2. Your aim is to WIN. That means 10 victory points.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}.
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number.
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades.</plan>
6. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively.
7. Think about the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action.

Revised Strategies Addressing Mid-& Late-Game Weakness:

- Aggressive Early Game Placement: Always focus on maximizing your resource coverage and ensuring you overproduce at least one resource to bolster trades/port options.

- Efficient Trading Practices: Prioritize small trades with opponents to build goodwill and obtain scarce resources. Ports are key for resource optimization; acquiring them early can exponentially increase trade efficiency. End-of-turn trades should always aim at gaining resources for imbalance.

- Intelligent Robber Placement: Move the robber exclusively to hinder players with >8 points or critical resource nodes like cities overproducing wheat/ore.
 Defensive behavior is used by drop it less dark hex avoid robbers retaliation rage, rob-on-worst performer.

================================ Human Message =================================

**SUMMARY:**

1. **Key Insights Learned Across Evolutions:**
   - *Initial Weaknesses:* The agent struggled with early game development, maladaptive resource gathering, and inefficient robber placement. Poor trading dynamics and lack of foresight for resource scarcity left it underperforming against the AlphaBetaPlayer.
   - *Evolving Focus Areas:* Over successive iterations, strategies emphasized improving settlement placement, leveraging ports for trade efficiency, targeted robber usage, and balanced road/settlement expansion.

2. **How the Prompt Has Evolved:**
   - *Evolution 0:* Basic strategy focused on settlement placement with minimal attention to trade dynamics or robber tactics.
   - *Evolution 1:* Introduced explicit priorities for resource diversity, leveraging scarce resources, and blocking opponents with the robber without over-retaliation. Emphasis on ports and steady road building was added as well.
   - *Evolution 2 (Current):* Augmented strategies for mid-to-late game via improved trading with opponents, prioritizing overproduction of specific resources for trading/port use, and focusing robber placement on disrupting high-scoring rivals while managing retaliation risk.

3. **Strategies Implemented:**
   - *Settlement Placement:* Focus on securing diverse, high-production resource tiles (6, 8) and key resource pairs (e.g., wood-brick, ore-wheat).
   - *Port Utilization:* Early access to ports (2:1 or 3:1 trades) to optimize surplus resources and improve scalability.
   - *Robber Placement:* Target rivals‚Äô critical resources, particularly cities or high-yield hexes, while limiting multifaceted retaliation risks.
   - *Balanced Expansion:* Expand strategically toward critical nodes while ensuring steady resource collection for construction.
   - *Trading Dynamics:* Strengthened trade negotiation tactics to build goodwill with opponents and balance end-of-turn trades for optimal resource alignment.

4. **Performance Observed:**
   - *Prior Era:* Initial scores highlighted significant underperformance (4.0 vs. opponent‚Äôs 10.0 VP on average). Metrics revealed poor infra-building (0 cities, 0 roads, 2.2 settlements) and reliance on development cards (1.0 dev VP average).
   - *Current Results:* Minor gains seen in settlement count (1.2 to 1.2) and improved city upgrades (0 to 0.8). Victory points rose to an average of 6.2, with noted contributions from development-related point strategies and a single game win. However, overall inefficiencies in mid-to-late game planning remain apparent.

5. **Challenges Still Present:**
   - Inadequate resource balancing to achieve more consistent city upgrades.
   - Delayed road-building stymies expansion efforts and competition for longest road.
   - Over-reliance on poorly timed robber placements.
   - Relatively slow adaptation to trading advantages offered by ports.

6. **Tools Called & Purpose (Evolution 2):**
   - *Game Log Analysis:* Reviewed outcomes to pinpoint timing and critical in-game decisions.
   - *Web Search - Strategy Research:* Researched additional strategies for resource management, trade dynamics, and efficient robber placement.
   - *Prompt Editing:* Enhanced prompt to address mid-game weaknesses, emphasizing productive trading, optimized robber placement, and strategic resource excess for ports.

**Sequential Progression:** Evolution 0 ‚Üí Evolution 1 ‚Üí Evolution 2. With each iteration, the focus has shifted from fundamental gameplay (e.g., settlement placement) to nuanced strategic refinements (e.g., exploiting resource scarcity, balancing retaliatory risks).

Ensure access to at least one wood-brick pair for early road building and a wheat-ore pair for city upgrades.\n- Aim for early control of scarce resources to monopolize their trade value. Strategically trade and build to secure critical resources (e.g., brick if scarce).\n- Use resource scarcity to your advantage when trading; make trades that favor your needs while pressuring opponents.\n- Place robber strategically: target opponents with high victory points and effective production without creating alliances against you. Prefer targeting only one player at a time and consider placing it on rare resources they depend on.\n- Focus on building towards ports early for better trading efficiency (2:1 or 3:1 trades), particularly for resources you overproduce.\n- Balance road expansion and resource production to secure critical nodes or block opponents effectively.\n\nBoard Understanding Guide:\n- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers\n- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile\n- \ud83d\udd0d marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex\n- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section\n- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy\n- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)",

### Observations and Weaknesses Identified:

After analyzing the Evolution 2's game performance and decision-making logs, it is clear that several inefficiencies persist:

1. **Overreliance on Trading Ports and Resource Imbalance:**
   - Significant time is spent excessively trading at ports due to resource imbalance (e.g., trading 4-for-1 repeatedly), leading to wasted potential for higher-value moves.
   - Few interventions to mitigate this imbalance through effective player trades or settlement positioning that prevents scarcity.

2. **Delayed Expansion and Road Building:**
   - The player rarely competes effectively for roads and longest road points, resulting in inadequate network expansion.
   - Missed opportunities to optimize road placement for strategic settlement expansions.

3. **Inefficient Robber Placement:** 
   - Robber placement is sometimes suboptimal, targeting nodes that don't significantly hinder opponents or benefit our player strategically.
   - Overuse of robber-related actions with limited impact, creating a retaliation risk without offsetting gains.

4. **Lack of Focus on Key Resources for City Upgrades:**
   - Despite prioritizing ores and wheat for city upgrades, delayed harvesting or inefficient trading for these resources slows down city-building progress.
   - Settlements and city upgrades remain low, contributing to stagnation.

5. **Excessive Development Card Focus:**
   - Buying development cards happens excessively, partially at the expense of critical resource usage for other moves.
   - Although this can contribute points later, it delays active board progress and strategic growth early game.

### Targeted Improvements Proposed for Next Prompt:

To address the observed weaknesses, the prompt should be further refined with these strategies:

---

**Enhanced Prompt**:

You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

---

**Prioritized Strategies for Winning with 10 Victory Points:**

- **Early Settlement Placement:**
  - Prioritize settlements on intersections that provide complementary resources (preferably wood-brick for early game roads, and ore-wheat for city upgrades).
  - Consider scarcity and competitive advantage when choosing initial placements to dominate strategic resources (e.g., rare bricks or ore).

- **Efficient Road Expansion:**
  - Build roads early toward critical settlement points or ports to maintain competitive expansion.
  - Focus on securing the longest road, as it provides consistent VP opportunities.

- **Balanced Use of Trading Ports and Player Trades:**
  - Use ports strategically only when a 2:1 trade rate is secured or the trade significantly advances your plan.
  - Avoid wasteful 4-for-1 trading; engage in mutually beneficial trades with opponents to balance your resource distribution efficiently.

- **Smart Resource Management and Prioritization:**
  - Prioritize upgrading settlements to cities using excess ore and wheat, as these yield both VPs and resource benefits.
  - Always aim to have the resources for your next major move within 2-3 turns.

- **Strategic Robber Placement:**  
  - Place the robber to hinder opponents with high scores or key resource dominance (like ore-wheat cities).
  - Avoid creating conflicts or triggering retaliation unless the move offers high returns, and avoid solo targeting.

- **Optimal Development Card Usage:**
  - Buy development cards only when roads, settlements, or cities are not currently viable actions.
  - Utilize knights tactically to block key tiles or trigger Largest Army VPs only when they're within reach.

---

**Execution Guidance for Next Move:**

1. **Analyze Current Resources/State:** Look at your resource pool and identify the most resource-efficient action toward your strategic goals.
2. **Evaluate Options by Priority:**
   - Settlement Expansion ‚Üí City Upgrade ‚Üí Longest Road ‚Üí Block Key Resource with Robber ‚Üí Development Cards ‚Üí Player Trading.
   - Trade excess resources to enable actions aligned with this hierarchy (e.g., trade wood/brick if not building roads, or trade wheat/ore for houses if cities are unachievable).
3. **Plan for Retaliation:** When using the robber or blocking resources, ensure you have safeguards (e.g., knights or multiple moves ready) to tackle any backlashes effectively.
4. **Think Ahead (2-3 Turns):** Choose actions that set up your next big move, ensuring that you only use resources when it leads to incremental benefits in victories or development.

**SUMMARY:**  

1. **Key Insights Learned Across Evolutions:**  
   - *Initial Weaknesses:* The agent struggled with early game strategy, inefficient resource gathering, misused robber placements, and poor trading tactics, leading to underperformance.  
   - *Evolving Focus Areas:* Improved settlement placement, effective port usage, balanced expansion, and more strategic robber placement have become central themes across iterations.  

2. **How the Prompt Has Evolved:**  
   - *Evolution 0:* Basic strategies limited to settlement placement with little emphasis on trading or robbers.  
   - *Evolution 1:* Introduced resource diversity prioritization, trading, and early road-building emphasis, alongside smarter robber blocking strategies.  
   - *Evolution 2:* Focused on mid- to late-game refinements including trading optimization, resource overproduction for ports, and targeted robber usage.  
   - *Evolution 3 (Current):* Expanded strategies for road-building toward expansion and longest road, efficient use of ports, and smarter resource prioritization for consistent city upgrades.  

3. **Strategies Implemented:**  
   - *Settlement Placement:* Select high-yield nodes for diverse resources and long-term upgrades.  
   - *Road Expansion:* Build roads early to claim critical nodes and compete for longest road points.

**Summary of Results:**  

1. **Performance Analysis**  
   - *Win Disparity*: PromptRefiningLLMPlayer:BLUE lost all 5 games to AlphaBetaPlayer:RED.  
   - *Victory Point Gap*: PromptRefiningLLMPlayer averaged 4.0 VP (too low), whereas AlphaBetaPlayer dominated with 10.0 VP (maxed out for victory).  

2. **Key Weaknesses Identified:**  
   - Settlement Placement: PromptRefiningLLMPlayer scored poorly with only 1.4 average settlements, compared to AlphaBetaPlayer's 2.8.  
   - City Development: PromptRefiningLLMPlayer averages 1.2 cities, falling significantly behind AlphaBetaPlayer's 2.6 cities.  
   - Road Network Building: PromptRefiningLLMPlayer failed to construct roads (0.0 average), severely limiting expansion and opportunities for longest road bonus.  
   - Development Cards & Army: PromptRefiningLLMPlayer underutilized development cards, averaging only 0.2 VP from development cards. Player failed to amass an army (0.0 average), which could have reinforced its robber control and competitive advantage.  
   - Trading & Resource Management: Suboptimal use of ports and overall poor trading and negotiation strategies appear evident.  
   - Robber Usage: PromptRefiningLLMPlayer failed to disrupt key momentum of AlphaBetaPlayer using robber strategies.  

3. **Hypothesis for Prompt Improvement:**  
- Improve settlement placement priority to claim highest production hexes and balanced resource diversity at the start.  
- Target early road-building leading toward Longest Road and expansion to critical settlements or ports.  
- Adjust trading strategy to emphasize gathering missing resources more effectively. Ports should also see stronger use for impactful trading opportunities.  
- Improve commitment to development card strategies, balancing priorities between Victory Point, Army formation, and playing actionable cards.  
- Refine robber placement to target AlphaBetaPlayer‚Äôs cities and settlements on high-production hexes to diminish their resource flow and momentum.

In Settlers of Catan, the order in which players place their initial settlements can significantly impact their strategy and success in the game. Each position‚Äîfirst, middle, or last‚Äîhas its advantages and disadvantages:
First Player
Advantages:- Optimal Location: The first player can choose the best starting spot on the board, often securing a high-probability resource hex (like 6s or 8s) and access to diverse resources. [...] Advantages:- Optimal Location: The first player can choose the best starting spot on the board, often securing a high-probability resource hex (like 6s or 8s) and access to diverse resources.
- Strategic Control: They can block opponents from accessing key locations in subsequent placements.
Disadvantages:- Predictability: Other players can see where the first player places their initial settlement and may adjust their placements to block or counteract their strategy.
Middle Player [...] Variety of (good) numbers. In base settlers, production is king. Having the six top numbers (6/8, 5/9, & 4/10) takes most of the luck out of having resources. Two out of every three rolls (IIRC) should produce something for you, although you‚Äôll probably need to build to secure at least one of these numbers. In starting placement, unless you are claiming a port (see #2), getting five-six different numbers is the surest long term strategy, even if they aren‚Äôt quite the top 6.

While you should definitely prioritize the resources that benefit your strategy, building on highly productive intersections is very important due to the exponential nature of Catan. Building settlements and cities increases your resource gathering ability, which in turn makes it easier to build. If you are able to start the game with great resources, your production will just get better and better over time. On the other hand, if you start on low production tiles you will inevitably fall [...] Let‚Äôs start by talking about some of the overall strategies you can take in Catan. The first strategy is the ‚ÄúBalanced Approach‚Äù. In this strategy you are simply trying to diversify your resources as much as possible by placing your settlements on a wide variety of resources, with a variety of different numbers. The goal of this strategy is to ensure that you have access to every material in the game, without relying on trading with other players or the bank. This is a very basic strategy that [...] The other situational strategy is the ‚Äúport‚Äù strategy, in which you monopolize an advantageous¬† 2-for-1 port and focusing on trading with the bank. This strategy has the disadvantage of giving you fewer resources on your initial settlements (if you place one of them at a port), but can be advantageous if you are able to produce large amounts of the resource you need to trade. Much like the previous strategy, this is only possible for certain configurations of the board ‚Äì you need access to good

* The best balance of all 5 resources: A truly balanced start will help you build both settlements and cities reliably for a production lead.

Based on the research gathered, here are insights and strategic recommendations for improving early-game settlement placement strategy:

---

**Key Insights on Early Settlement Placement:**  

1. **Top Priority Hexes:** Build on intersections of high-production values (6s and 8s) with balanced resource diversity to accelerate consistent production. Ideally, aim for intersections yielding production from at least 3 different resources (wood, brick, wheat, ore).  
2. **Balanced Resource Diversity:** Focus on diverse resources for flexibility in building roads, settlements, cities, and trading effectiveness. Without well-rounded resources, players become overly reliant on trading.  
3. **Monopoly Port Strategies:** Securing a 2:1 port can be advantageous but should be supported by high production tiles that align with the port's target resource.  
4. **Maximizing Production Probability:** Settling on intersections with a combined probability of production (using dice dots) around 12‚Äì16 per turn enhances momentum and reduces risk of stagnation.

This strategy focuses on sprawling across the board, building a long road and settlements along it. Players who like this strategy look for lots of wood and brick in their initial placements. A typical winning combination will involve 2 cities, 4 settlements and longest road. This strategy looks stronger than it is, because it typically lets you race to 7 points (5 settlements + longest road) but stalls catastrophically in the end game when you desperately need ore and everyone is pounding you [...] Obvious leads make you a target. Longest Road in particular should be picked up as late as possible. Joining up two separate road segments with a big road-building push and unveiling 2 victory point cards can give you the win from 6 points. Largest Army on the other hand needs to be more openly competed for, because of the play-only-one-development-card-per-turn rule. Victory point cards are great to have because they create uncertainty in your opponents (is it a VP or a monopoly card?). [...] Do:- everything you can to get your first city. Liberally trade away sheep/brick/wood to do so. - encourage other players to compete for longest road.- make sure you leave at least one spot open for building a settlement. It is possible to win with 2 cities, largest army and 4 victory point cards, but you'd have to play well and get very lucky.- not get distracted by all that road- and settlement-building. Get those cities out.- hog the ore. Your strategy relies on you having the cities, and

Positioning your settlements on the same side of the board (without someone else‚Äôs impenetrable presence in the way), is a great way to secure the longest road, even if you didn‚Äôt plan for it.
Many of the fastest games are won with this setup. Someone has the largest army and a minimal amount of effort connecting both of their roads is sufficient to secure the longest road to get to 10 VPs.
</Document>================================== Ai Message ==================================

Based on the additional insights into road-building and expansion strategies, here are refined recommendations for improving performance in this area:

---

**Key Insights on Road Building and Expansion:**  

1. **Early Road Setup:**  
   - *Resource Focus*: Initial placements should prioritize wood and brick for building roads efficiently. These resources enable swift expansion to critical settlement spots and block opponents from securing key nodes.  
   - *Sprawling Strategy*: Opt for settlements on the same side of the board to secure a centralized and uninterrupted network of roads. This can strategically enable capturing the longest road and open settlement spots.  

2. **Longest Road Timing:**  
   - Secure road-building capacity early but avoid overtly competing for the bonus too early to avoid becoming a target. Instead, aim for a sudden road-building push toward endgame to surpass 5+ roads in one turn, surprising opponents and securing key VP.  

3. **City Priority & Hybrid Strategies:**  
   - Use early sheep/brick/wood excess to aggressively trade for wheat and ore with ports or opponents, accelerating the upgrade to cities.  
   - Strike a balance between settlement expansions and city-building. A city-focused hybrid strategy allows for resource-intensive road network bursts later in the game.  

Next, I'll integrate these findings into a refined prompt alongside early placement goals.

- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1).

Strategies to Optimize Gameplay:

**Early Game Placement**:
1. Priority: Settle intersections with high-production hex values (e.g., 6 and 8) and ensure access to diverse resources (wood, brick, wheat, ore).
2. Aim for balanced resource diversity, avoiding over-reliance on external trades while ensuring steady production.
3. Consider port advantages: Settling near a 2:1 port can provide a long-term trading edge, but only if paired with high production tiles.

**Road Building & Expansion**:
1. Secure wood and brick for efficient road-building. Expand strategically toward critical nodes and ensure open spots for settlements.
2. Avoid prematurely competing for Longest Road; instead, plan a sudden, decisive push mid- to late-game. Position yourself for a unified road network.

**City Upgrades**:
1. Focus on upgrading settlements to cities early by converting sheep/brick/wood excess via trades or ports. This boosts resource production exponentially.
2. Strike a balance between settlement expansion and city-building to maintain resource diversity.

**Development Cards**:
1. Leverage cards tactically to create flexibility (e.g., monopoly for critical resources, or knights to target critical opponents).
2. Prioritize Largest Army and hidden VP cards to close victory point gaps stealthily.
3. Play actionable cards a turn ahead when anticipating key moves.

**Trading Strategy**:
1. Use ports for impactful trades, minimizing inefficiencies. Optimize trades toward missing resources for city upgrades.
2. Engage opponents strategically: Offer mutually beneficial trades to accelerate progress while limiting their gains.

**Robber Placement**:
1. Target cities and settlements on high-production hexes of the strongest opponent (e.g., highest current VP count).
2. Avoid retaliatory targeting unless strategically necessary. Focus robber placements to disrupt resource flow effectively.================================= Tool Message =================================

From this performance summary, it's evident that the AlphaBetaPlayer dominated the games, winning 4 out of 5 matches and demonstrating superior game execution. The following key weaknesses can be deduced from the data:

### Key Observations and Weaknesses in PromptRefiningLLMPlayer's Gameplay:
1. **Low Average Victory Points (VP)**:  
   The player's average VP is significantly lower (4.2) than AlphaBetaPlayer's (10.0). This indicates struggles in all aspects of gameplay, particularly in mid- to late-game execution. 

2. **Underwhelming Settlement and City Growth**:  
   - Settlements: The average number of settlements (1.8) is insufficient to sustain resource production, expand presence on the board, and build cities.  
   - Cities: With only 0.4 average cities, the player fails to capitalize on resource economies of scale, critical for mid- and late-game dominance.

3. **Road Strategy Failure**:  
   An average road placement score of 0.0 is a glaring issue. This directly impacts expansion opportunities, accessibility to advantageous settlement spots, and the ability to compete for Longest Road points.  
   
4. **Minimal Robber and Development Card Impact**:  
   The average army size (0.4) and development VP (0.8) reveal suboptimal usage of development cards. The player seems hesitant to build armies and does not prioritize acquiring Largest Army, a critical end-game scoring opportunity.

5. **Trade Inefficiencies**:  
   The player is not effectively bridging resource shortages, likely indicating poor trading dynamics either with ports or with opponents.

---

### Immediate Focus Areas for Improvement:
1. **Settlement Placement and Expansion**:  
   Increase early-game focus on settlement growth by ensuring placements target wood, brick, wheat, and ore (core development resources). Prioritize high-production intersections with 6's and 8's. Early road-building must connect the initial settlements to new settlement opportunities.

2. **City Upgrades**:  
   Accelerate city upgrades on high-yield settlement positions to amplify resource production. Develop a plan for managing resource types effectively to avoid bottlenecks (e.g., excess sheep without ports).

3. **Road Strategy Overhaul**:  
   Address the complete failure to build roads. Strengthen the emphasis on road-building not only for expansion but to actively compete for Longest Road points.

4. **Utilize Ports Effectively**:  
   Incorporate ports into early-game strategy (e.g., a 3:1 port within easy reach). This minimizes inefficiencies caused by resource imbalances.

5. **Intelligent Robber and Development Card Usage**:  
   Encourage the following when using development cards:
   - Prioritize knight cards to form armies and secure Largest Army.  
   - Use the robber strategically to disrupt the strongest opponent's best-producing spot, slowing their progress effectively while minimizing retaliation opportunities.

### Next Steps:  
I will inspect the current prompt to identify if these focus areas are adequately covered and research strategies related to settlement placement, road-building, and port utilization to refine the prompt effectively. I'll also ensure the updated prompt incorporates specific actions for improving city upgrades and development card usage.

- try to avoid trading down to just a few cards with the bank and being stuck unable to build. Chances are, you're doing so for a resource you're finding hard to get and therefore other players will know they can disproportionately hurt you with the robber if they steal it.

- preserve juicy settlement locations with judicious road placement. Lock up that port that's critical to your strategy early. Nothing more infuriating than having an opponent beat you to it. [...] This strategy focuses on sprawling across the board, building a long road and settlements along it. Players who like this strategy look for lots of wood and brick in their initial placements. A typical winning combination will involve 2 cities, 4 settlements and longest road. This strategy looks stronger than it is, because it typically lets you race to 7 points (5 settlements + longest road) but stalls catastrophically in the end game when you desperately need ore and everyone is pounding you [...] You need to point these towards where you would like to build your next settlement. This will nearly always be towards the outside of the board. Don't bother pointing it at that empty 5/9/10 intersection - someone will occupy it for sure. That 4/9 port? Perfect. Road placement is all about second-guessing your opponents: you basically want to point your road at the (n+1)th best position left on the board where n = the number of settlement placements left. This is tough on round 1 of placements

The knights that are bought help keep the robber off of an OWS player‚Äôs territory (and help the player get the largest army bonus in the process).
What is Road-Strategy in Settlers of Catan?
Road Builder / Road Strategy, sometimes simply called ‚Äúroad,‚Äù is a popular alternative to OWS, which focuses on strong wood-brick production to get the longest road point bonus.
The main resources involved are wood, brick, wheat, and sheep, with especially heavy wood and brick. [...] Third position has a couple interesting strategy choices.
An obvious answer is going for high wood-brick and a Longest Road-strategy. But if there‚Äôs no good spots for that, you need to have alternatives.
Another strong strategy is a port-strategy, getting a lot of a certain resource and the matching 2:1-port.
Also, you can always monopolise one rare resource that others won‚Äôt be able to have, so they will be forced to give you 2:1 deals just so they can have one specific resource. [...] The Ore-Wheat-Sheep Strategy usually is being used by first/second position, while the Road Builder Strategy can go to third or fourth

Placing your initial settlements in Settlers of Catan is crucial for setting up a strong position in the game. Here are some strategies to consider when placing your settlements:
1. Resource Variety

Aim to have access to a variety of resources (brick, wood, wheat, sheep, and ore). A balanced resource base helps you build roads, settlements, and cities effectively.

2. High-Probability Numbers [...] Prioritize wheat and brick in your initial placements. Wheat is essential for building settlements and cities, while brick is crucial for roads and settlements.

4. Strategic Positioning

Consider placing your settlements near the coast if you can trade for resources you lack. Ports can provide valuable trade opportunities.

5. Blocking Opponents [...] Your not going to make many friends doing this, but makes it a lot easier for you to win the game. If you opponent has three sheep hexagons, and you have two, your probably going to want to place a settlement nearby, and cut their road off, even though the numbers aren‚Äôt the greatest. A similar not well known strategy, allows you to place a settlement in between an opponents four roads in a row. This also make take away, their longest road.

Based on the game results and strategies found through research, here are key learnings to integrate into the prompt:

### Core Enhancements to the Prompt:
1. **Early Settlement Placement Strategy**:  
   Initial settlements must focus on resource diversity and high-productivity numbers (6, 8, 9). Prioritize wheat, brick, and ore for long-term development. Roads should be placed toward settlement spots or ports that suit the chosen strategy ‚Äì either Road Builder (wood/brick focus) or Ore-Wheat-Sheep (development card/city-building focus).

2. **Balanced Expansion Through Roads**:  
   Road placement must actively secure desirable ports and settlement locations while also hindering opponents by cutting off their routes when feasible. A central goal should be competing for Longest Road by effectively leveraging wood and brick production.

3. **Port Utilization**:  
   Establish settlements adjacent to ports early whenever possible, especially if resource monopolization can make a 2:1 port valuable. Ports can be critical for solving resource shortages mid-game. For example, a sheep-heavy setup benefits immensely from a 2:1 sheep port.

4. **City Upgrades and Resource Balancing**:  
   Settlements on high-production nodes must upgrade to cities by mid-game to ensure surplus resources for trading and rapid development. Resource management should avoid buildup of less useful resources (e.g., excess sheep without a port). Trading and robber choice must align with critical resources for upgrades.

5. **Effective Development Card and Robber Use**:  
   Knight cards should be prioritized to build up a large army (Largest Army bonus) and shift the robber off critical nodes. When using the robber, block intersections that harm opponents most effectively while reducing retaliation risks (e.g., targeting low wheat supplies of the strongest player).

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions.
2. Your aim is to WIN. That means 10 victory points.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}.
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number.

6. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively.
7. Think about the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action.

Strategic Guidelines:

1. **Early Settlement Placement:**
   - Aim for variety in resources (wood, brick, wheat, ore, sheep) and prioritize high-probability numbers like 6, 8, and 9.
   - Ensure one of your placements has access to wheat. If choosing a Road Builder strategy, also focus on wood and brick.
   - Place initial roads toward settlement spots or ports that align with your strategy. Ports are critical for solving resource imbalances.

2. **Road Expansion:**
   - Build roads aggressively toward key settlement nodes to block opponents and secure the spots most advantageous for your strategy.
   - Compete for Longest Road by maintaining consistent wood and brick production.

3. **City Upgrades:**
   - Target settlements on your highest-production tiles for city upgrades once you have stable resource income.
   - Ensure wheat and ore are prioritized for city-building. Avoid resource pile-ups (e.g., excess sheep) by early trading.

4. **Port Usage:**
   - Secure settlements adjacent to ports early. Ports provide better trading ratios for surplus resources.
   - Plan your trading and development around ports to optimize efficiencies and maintain flexibility mid- and late-game.

5. **Development Cards and Robber Usage:**
   - Prioritize purchasing knight cards in early and mid-game to build a strong army and secure Largest Army (2 VP).
   - Use the robber to block opponents' strongest tiles, focusing on their critical resources like wheat or ore. Reduce risks of retaliation when possible.
   
6. **Trading Dynamics:**
   - Actively trade to fill resource gaps needed for settlements, cities, or roads. Avoid unfair trades benefitting opponents excessively.

Board Understanding:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with resources, dice numbers, and node connections.
- Ports can provide valuable trade opportunities (2:1, 3:1).
- Assess production potential of tiles and connectivity between nodes for road-building plans.================================= Tool Message =================================

It is clear from the results that the PromptRefiningLLMPlayer underperformed in comparison to AlphaBetaPlayer. Key takeaways from the results highlight substantial challenges across various phases of gameplay:

### Key Weaknesses:
#### 1. **Victory Points and Settlements:**
   - The player scored an average of 3.2 VP compared to AlphaBetaPlayer's 10.2. This is a significant deficit.
   - While the number of settlements (AVG 2.2) was slightly higher than AlphaBetaPlayer (1.8), this failed to convert into city upgrades or meaningful resource generation.

#### 2. **Cities and Roads:**
   - The player failed to build any cities (AVG 0.0), while AlphaBetaPlayer averaged 3.2 cities. Cities are critical for increased resource generation, and the lack of city upgrades gives insight into ineffective resource usage and planning.
   - Lack of roads (AVG 0.0) indicates no effective expansion plan and prevented the player from securing Longest Road or positioning for additional settlements and ports.

#### 3. **Development Card Usage:**
   - The player averaged only 0.6 VP from development cards and accumulated a small army (0.2), suggesting suboptimal use or prioritization of development cards to gain Largest Army, VP, or strategic advantages.

#### 4. **Robber Placement and Resource Management:**
   - With the opponent dominating resource collection (leading to rapid upgrades), the use of the robber or methods to disrupt their flow appears insufficient. The player's inability to build cities or roads suggests resource bottlenecks that weren't effectively mitigated with ports, trades, or robber strategies.

#### 5. **Pacing:**
   - Limited progress in city upgrades and road-building demonstrates an issue in translating early-game settlements into mid-game growth.

---

### Immediate Steps for Improvement:
To resolve these weaknesses, we must target critical areas such as city upgrades, road-building, development card prioritization, and disruptors like the robber. I will adopt a systematic approach:

1. **Analyze Logs for Deeper Insights:**  
   Reviewing detailed game logs from performance history will identify specific missed opportunities during gameplay‚Äîwhether related to pacing, trading, or prioritization errors.

2. **Web Research:**  
   I will research specific strategies on:
   - Accelerating city upgrades (Ore/Wheat optimization).
   - Road-building for strategic settlement placement and Longest Road.
   - Effective development card utilization for both short-term (Knights, Largest Army) and long-term benefits (VP cards).
   - Advanced robber placement strategies to effectively disrupt opponents.

3. **Prompt Refinement:**  
   Incorporate insights into the prompt, with emphasis on:
   - Efficient resource allocation for city-building and road-building.
   - Proactive development card use based on game phase priorities.
   - Strategic trading to bridge resource gaps for early city upgrades.
   - Aggressive yet calculated robber placement against high-production tiles.

Plan for the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action.\n\nBoard Understanding Guide:\n- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers.\n- \ud83d\udd0d marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex.\n- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section.\n- Connectivity between nodes is crucial for road-building strategy.\n- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1).\n\nStrategies to Optimize Gameplay:\n\n**Early Game Placement**:\n1. Priority: Settle intersections with high-production hex values (e.g., 6 and 8) and ensure access to diverse resources (wood, brick, wheat, ore).\n2. Aim for balanced resource diversity, avoiding over-reliance on external trades while ensuring steady production.\n3. Consider port advantages: Settling near a 2:1 port can provide a long-term trading edge, but only if paired with high production tiles.\n\n**Road Building & Expansion**:\n1. Secure wood and brick for efficient road-building. Expand strategically toward critical nodes and ensure open spots for settlements.\n2. Avoid prematurely competing for Longest Road; instead, plan a sudden, decisive push mid- to late-game. Position yourself for a unified road network.\n\n**City Upgrades**:\n1. Focus on upgrading settlements to cities early by converting sheep/brick/wood excess via trades or ports. This boosts resource production exponentially.\n2. Strike a balance between settlement expansion and city-building to maintain resource diversity.\n\n**Development Cards**:\n1. Leverage cards tactically to create flexibility (e.g., monopoly for critical resources, or knights to target critical opponents).\n2. Prioritize Largest Army and hidden VP cards to close victory point gaps stealthily.\n3. Play actionable cards a turn ahead when anticipating key moves.\n\n**Trading Strategy**:\n1. Use ports for impactful trades, minimizing inefficiencies. Optimize trades toward missing resources for city upgrades.\n2. Engage opponents strategically: Offer mutually beneficial trades to accelerate progress while limiting their gains.\n\n**Robber Placement**:\n1. Target cities and settlements on high-production hexes of the strongest opponent (e.g., highest current VP count).\n2. Avoid retaliatory targeting unless strategically necessary. Focus robber placements to disrupt resource flow effectively.",

    "prompt_used": "You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.\n\nRules:\n1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions.\n2. Your aim is to WIN. That means 10 victory points.\n3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \\boxed{5}.\n4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number.\n5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:\n   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>\n6. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively.\n7. Think about the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action.\n\nStrategic Guidelines:\n\n1. **Early Settlement Placement:**\n   - Aim for variety in resources (wood, brick, wheat, ore, sheep) and prioritize high-probability numbers like 6, 8, and 9.\n   - Ensure one of your placements has access to wheat. If choosing a Road Builder strategy, also focus on wood and brick.\n   - Place initial roads toward settlement spots or ports that align with your strategy. Ports are critical for solving resource imbalances.\n\n2. **Road Expansion:**\n   - Build roads aggressively toward key settlement nodes to block opponents and secure the spots most advantageous for your strategy.\n   - Compete for Longest Road by maintaining consistent wood and brick production.\n\n3. **City Upgrades:**\n   - Target settlements on your highest-production tiles for city upgrades once you have stable resource income.\n   - Ensure wheat and ore are prioritized for city-building. Avoid resource pile-ups (e.g., excess sheep) by early trading.\n\n4. **Port Usage:**\n   - Secure settlements adjacent to ports early. Ports provide better trading ratios for surplus resources.\n   - Plan your trading and development around ports to optimize efficiencies and maintain flexibility mid- and late-game.\n\n5. **Development Cards and Robber Usage:**\n   - Prioritize purchasing knight cards in early and mid-game to build a strong army and secure Largest Army (2 VP).\n   - Use the robber to block opponents' strongest tiles, focusing on their critical resources like wheat or ore. Reduce risks of retaliation when possible.\n   \n6. **Trading Dynamics:**\n   - Actively trade to fill resource gaps needed for settlements, cities, or roads. Avoid unfair trades benefitting opponents excessively.\n\nBoard Understanding:\n- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with resources, dice numbers, and node connections.\n- Ports can provide valuable trade opportunities (2:1, 3:1).\n- Assess production potential of tiles and connectivity between nodes for road-building plans.",

The game logs highlight key issues to address:

### Key Issues Identified:
#### 1. **Resource Management:**
   - Excessive port trading of surplus resources (e.g., wood, wheat) for brick without clear plans to utilize them for settlements or roads. This indicates potential inefficiency in resource conversion and goal alignment.
   - Limited prioritization of ore and wheat for city upgrades.

#### 2. **Robber Placement:**
   - Robber placement was focused on consistently targeting RED's high-production tiles, yet the impact was minimal due to the frequent retaliation and lack of strategic planning for collateral benefits, like accelerating own production.

#### 3. **Development Card Utilization:**
   - The player frequently purchased development cards but neither prioritized effective Knights use for Largest Army nor optimized Victory Point cards.
   - Not enough emphasis on resource-converting cards like Monopoly or Road Building to create pivotal advantages.

#### 4. **Road Expansion:**
   - The agent expanded roads sporadically but failed to form coherent networks to secure settlement locations or positions for Longest Road. A lack of effective road planning is evident.

#### 5. **City Upgrades:**
   - There were no cities built throughout all five games due to ineffective resource prioritization. City upgrades are crucial for increasing resource generation and scoring Victory Points.

---

### Steps to Refine the Prompt:

Proceeding to integrate these insights into a refined and cohesive gameplay strategy:
#### 1. Focus on competitive resource management:
   - Analyze the board state critically every turn to adjust goals based on resources in hand.
   - Ensure ore and wheat are prioritized for early city upgrades.
   - Convert surplus resources into actionable development rather than stockpiling for inefficient trades.

#### 2. Optimize Robber Use:
   - Target tiles that disrupt opponents with >8 victory points or heavy dependency on specific resources.
   - Prevent constant retaliation by resetting triggers and ensuring Knight cards are used strategically.

#### 3. Development Cards and Largest Army:
   - Use knights to secure Largest Army for bonus VP. Focus on actionable card play to resolve immediate bottlenecks (e.g., Road Building or Monopoly for brick/ore) without delay.

#### 4. Improve Road Planning:
   - Prioritize road building toward open nodes for settlements and ensure mid-game expansion for Longest Road.
   - Position roads near port-access tiles to establish long-term trading advantages.

#### 5. Accelerate Early City Building:
   - Prioritize collecting ore/wheat early for city upgrades. This replaces inefficient expansion tactics with exponential resource results.
   - Ensure initial settlements are positioned on diverse resource combos (wood, brick, wheat, ore).

I'll supplement these refinements with targeted strategies researched online. Proceeding with research to address gaps.

Upgrade to Cities: Prioritize upgrading settlements to cities, especially on high-yield resource hexes, as cities provide more resources and increase your overall production.
Control Key Locations: Try to establish cities at strategic intersections that can block opponents' access to key resources.

4. Knight Placement and Robber Control [...] Upgrade City Improvements: Invest in city improvements (trade, politics, science) to gain additional benefits, such as extra resources or the ability to draw more development cards.
Adapt Your Strategy: Depending on your resource availability, focus on improvements that align best with your game plan. For instance, if you have a lot of ore, prioritize science for additional development cards.

7. Observe Opponents [...] Cities first strategy
Since cities double your earning power, an effective strategy can be to optimize for as much wheat and rock as you can get early in the game, upgrade to two cities as quickly as possible, and then trade out some of your abundant wheat and rock for wood and brick later to build roads and expand. If you can get access to sheep with this strategy, you can also quickly and easily pursue a strategy of buying a lot of development cards before building more settlements.

Do:- start road, settlement, road, settlement. One of the settlements should be a port, ideally 3:1. These 4 settlements will be your engine of production. Now look to upgrade to cities (unless hand management and/or other opportunities dictate otherwise).

Key insights and strategies specific to prioritizing city upgrades in Settlers of Catan include:

#### **Insights from Research:**
1. **City Upgrades are Critical for Long-Term Resource Gains:**
   - Cities double the production from resource hexes they are placed on, making them exponentially beneficial compared to settlements.
   - Settlements on high-yield tiles (e.g., 6, 8) should be the first to upgrade. Upgrading on diverse resources (especially wheat and ore) accelerates subsequent builds.

2. **Initial Placement:**
   - Starting placements should focus on ensuring access to ore and wheat, as these are prerequisites for cities. Settling near tiles with numbers like 6 and 8 for these resources ensures stable production‚Äîor alternatively prioritizing a port (e.g., 3:1) to quickly convert surplus into these critical resources.

3. **Sequential Strategy to City Building:**
   - Rather than expanding into more settlements too early, secure adjacent high-yield hexes with roads and reserve resources exclusively for city upgrades.
   - Expansion can be deprioritized temporarily in favor of securing one or two cities early (depending on the game state).

4. **Trading Strategy:**
   - Trade aggressively for ore and wheat early on, even offering wood and brick if necessary. This positions for cities faster than relying solely on production.

5. **Adaptation to Opponent Behaviors:**
   - Blocking competitors with Knights (to take Largest Army) or the robber limits their wheat/ore access and delays their city building too.

**Prioritized Strategies for Efficient Gameplay:**

### **Early Settlement Placement:**
1. Prioritize intersections with high-production hex values (e.g., 6, 8) that also offer diversity in resources (wood, brick, wheat, ore).
2. Ensure access to ore and wheat early to accelerate city-building goals. Avoid placements overly dependent on sheep.
3. Consider settlements near a port (especially 3:1) to enable better trading options for unbalanced production.

### **Resource Prioritization and Early Game Goals:**
1. Start with at least one settlement placement enabling road construction (wood and brick availability) and another focusing on wheat and ore for cities.
2. Build roads toward additional resource-rich locations or strategic ports. Block opponent expansion where possible.
3. Upgrade settlements on high-production tiles into cities as soon as possible. Cities greatly increase resource output, focusing production toward future upgrades and trades.

### **Mid-to-Late Game City and Development Card Focus:**
1. Trade aggressively for wheat and ore to ensure early upgrades to cities. Delay expansion until 1-2 cities have been built.
2. Purchase development cards (e.g., Knights) to bolster defense, secure Largest Army (2 victory points), or use action cards (e.g., Monopoly, Road Building) to shift the game state.
3. Use Monopoly strategically to gain key resources in abundance during critical turns.

### **Trading Strategy:**
1. Use ports efficiently to convert surplus resources into missing materials. However, prioritize 2:1 trades for maximum efficiency over 3:1 trades.
2. Trade with other players carefully to avoid helping them disproportionately. Aim for trades that advance your cities, settlements, or VP goals directly.

### **Optimal Robber and Knight Usage:**
1. Place the robber onto critical tiles that slow opponents with high VP scores or rare resource access. Avoid provoking unnecessary retaliation.
2. Knights should be used to shift the robber defensively and work toward securing Largest Army. Position the robber after Knight use to benefit resource production.

### **Longest Road Consideration:**
1. Expand your road network toward open nodes to secure key locations for settlements and ports, creating potential for Longest Road.
2. Mid-game, position for Longest Road in one decisive push rather than competing aimlessly over multiple turns.================================= Tool Message =================================

### **ANALYSIS OF GAME RESULTS**

#### **Key Weaknesses Identified**
1. **City Upgrades**:
   - Our player failed to build any cities, showing severe issues in wheat and ore acquisition or prioritization. This limitation drastically reduced its resource income.
   
2. **Road and Settlement Expansion**:
   - No roads were built, preventing our player from reaching Longest Road or new settlement locations. This inability likely blocked further settlement or port placements.

3. **Turn Progression**:
   - Average turns (77.6) suggest that our player isn't leveraging its early game to establish a strong resource foundation for late-stage dominance.

4. **Development Cards**:
   - Insufficient use of development cards for tactical advantage. Average VP from development cards remains low (0.2).

5. **Trading Efficiency**:
   - Imbalanced resources may reflect poor trading strategies or failure to capitalize on monopolistic trades.

6. **Robber Placement**:
   - The opponent may not have been significantly disrupted, as the opponent consistently achieved higher VP and critical milestones.

---

### **GOALS TO FOCUS ON**
1. **Early Game Resource Advantage**:
   - Accelerate settlement placements to secure high-yield wheat, ore, and diverse resources at premium hex intersections. Emphasize road-building to secure these key spots quickly.

2. **City Upgrade Prioritization**:
   - Shift strategic focus toward obtaining cities early by improving wheat and ore trading and collection strategies.

3. **Road Network Expansion**:
   - Strategically build roads to both contest Longest Road and unlock critical ports and settlement nodes.

4. **Trading**:
   - Introduce a more calculated approach to trading for wheat and ore to exploit opportunities for exponential resource growth.

5. **Robber Placement**:
   - Utilize the robber more aggressively to block key resource tiles of opponents.

6. **Development Cards**:
   - Increase the frequency and efficiency of development card purchases, targeting Largest Army or significant action cards like Monopoly and Road Building for pivotal momentum shifts.

Start with at least one settlement placement enabling road construction (wood and brick availability) and another focusing on wheat and ore for cities.\n2. Build roads toward additional resource-rich locations or strategic ports. Block opponent expansion where possible.\n3. Upgrade settlements on high-production tiles into cities as soon as possible. Cities greatly increase resource output, focusing production toward future upgrades and trades.\n\n### **Mid-to-Late Game City and Development Card Focus:**\n1. Trade aggressively for wheat and ore to ensure early upgrades to cities. Delay expansion until 1-2 cities have been built.\n2. Purchase development cards (e.g., Knights) to bolster defense, secure Largest Army (2 victory points), or use action cards (e.g., Monopoly, Road Building) to shift the game state.\n3. Use Monopoly strategically to gain key resources in abundance during critical turns.\n\n### **Trading Strategy:**\n1. Use ports efficiently to convert surplus resources into missing materials. However, prioritize 2:1 trades for maximum efficiency over 3:1 trades.\n2. Trade with other players carefully to avoid helping them disproportionately. Aim for trades that advance your cities, settlements, or VP goals directly.\n\n### **Optimal Robber and Knight Usage:**\n1. Place the robber onto critical tiles that slow opponents with high VP scores or rare resource access. Avoid provoking unnecessary retaliation.\n2. Knights should be used to shift the robber defensively and work toward securing Largest Army. Position the robber after Knight use to benefit resource production.\n\n### **Longest Road Consideration:**\n1.

### **ANALYSIS OF PERFORMANCE HISTORY**

The evolution history reflects a steady refinement of strategies, yet key gaps persist, particularly in city-building, road expansion, trading efficiency, and development card usage. Below are the evolution insights and associated weaknesses:

---

### **INSIGHTS FROM THE HISTORY**

#### **Evolution 0**:
- **Weakness**: A minimal strategic focus, especially on resource diversity and city-building. The lack of a prioritized early-game plan led to consistently low VP outcomes.
- **Outcome**: Avg VP: 4.0; Wins: 0.

#### **Evolution 1**:
- **Improvement**: Introduced resource prioritization, strategic trading, and basic robber tactics.
- **Weakness**: Settlements were optimized, but city upgrades and road-building efforts were insufficient for consistent wins.
- **Outcome**: Avg VP: 6.2; Wins: 1.

#### **Evolution 2**:
- **Improvement**: Refined mid-game trading and robber placement dynamics. Emphasis on ports began.
- **Weakness**: Inefficient transitions to city-building and scattered road expansion. Failed to achieve Longest Road or Largest Army consistently.
- **Outcome**: Avg VP: 2.6; Wins: 0.

#### **Evolution 3**:
- **Improvement**: Reintroduced aggressive road-building strategies and push for city upgrades.
- **Weakness**: Poor resource acquisitions for cities (wheat/ore shortages). Development cards remained underutilized.
- **Outcome**: Avg VP: 4.0; Wins: 0.

#### **Evolution 4**:
- **Improvement**: Balanced city-building focus with flexible road expansion and port utilization. Extended robber strategies to target competitors effectively.
- **Weakness**: Low trading efficiency hindered mid-late game transitions. Struggled to close victory paths decisively (VP gaps persisted).
- **Outcome**: Avg VP: 4.2; Wins: 1.

#### **Evolution 5**:
- **Improvement**: Strong early-game strategies for settlement placements and ports. Recentered focus on ore and wheat production.
- **Weakness**: Continued inability to gather sufficient wheat and ore resources, leading to zero city upgrades. Longest Road and Largest Army goals fell flat.
- **Outcome**: Avg VP: 3.2; Wins: 0.

#### **Evolution 6**:
- **Improvement**: Increased reliance on efficient port use, trading, and Largest Army potential. Strong emphasis on wheat/ore prioritization.
- **Weakness**: Trading strategies and late-game city accelerations failed drastically. Development cards (Knights, Monopoly) weren‚Äôt utilized effectively.
- **Outcome**: Avg VP: 2.2; Wins: 0.

---

### **COMMON WEAKNESSES ACROSS EVOLUTIONS**
Based on the analysis, the following problems are consistently plaguing the PromptRefiningLLM_player:

1. **City Upgrades**:
   - Ore and wheat are not sufficiently prioritized.
   - Resource balance is poor, limiting upgrades from settlements.

2. **Road Expansion**:
   - Roads are insufficiently planned and fail to contest Longest Road.
   - Disconnected road networks make competitive benefits hard to achieve.

3. **Development Card Usage**:
   - Knights and action cards (Monopoly, Road Building) are underutilized.
   - The player doesn't prioritize Largest Army enough, losing easy VP opportunities.

4. **Trading**:
   - Poor trading dynamics result in consistent resource shortages (wheat, ore) and over-reliance on inefficient port trades.

5. **Robber Usage**:
   - Robber placement doesn‚Äôt decisively disrupt opponents or serve as a defensive tool to mitigate resource imbalance.

---

### **STRATEGIC PRIORITIES FOR PROMPT UPDATE**

To address these gaps, the updated prompt must:
1. **City-Building Acceleration**:
   - Amplify strategic focus on ore and wheat collection and trading.
   - Avoid scattering resources by prioritizing early city-building.

2. **Road Network Planning**:
   - A cohesive road strategy aimed at connecting settlements while securing Longest Road.
   - Block opponents effectively while pursuing settlement nodes.

3. **Development Card Focus**:
   - Optimize Knight purchases for Largest Army alongside impactful action card plays (Monopoly, Road Building).

4. **Trading Efficiency**:
   - Promote smarter trades and port strategies aimed at balancing resources rather than oversaturating surplus.

5. **Targeted Robber Placement**:
   - Precision targeting of high-production tiles and high-VP opponents.

7. Prioritize ore and wheat. There are highly competitive strategies that need very little brick and wood. But no strategies can do without ore and wheat, so if you don't start with them, you'd better have a plan of how to get them... [...] This strategy aims first to build two cities before attempting to build roads or settlements. Players who like this strategy look for rich placements on ore and wheat and don't worry much about brick and wood. They collect lots of development cards and a typical winning combination will involve 3 cities, 2 victory point cards and largest army. Road building is most often done with the appropriate development card. It's quite possible to win this way without producing a single brick or wood in [...] Do:- keep your options open. This strategy and the Commander are only subtly different, and if you have 3 ore, 2 wheat and 2 sheep early, you might just want to build that city instead of buying two development cards.- secure about same amount of ore as wheat, and 2/3 of this amount of sheep. You really don‚Äôt need any brick or wood to speak of when playing this strategy - you'll get all you need from development cards and robbing other players.

The second resource-based strategy is the ‚ÄúOre / Wheat‚Äù Strategy. This strategy focuses on building cities and buying development cards, and lends itself towards getting the largest army card. By building cities as early as possible you can increase your resource gathering, with the added bonus that your first cities will probably be on your original settlements which should be in prime locations on the board. While you can technically win with only your first two cities, the largest army, and [...] To really drive this point home, suppose you want to collect ore. You can actually get 25% more ore by building on a wheat tile with a ‚Äú6‚Äù and trading 4-to-1 with the bank than you could by building directly on an ore tile with a 2! If you had a port, or were trading with other players, then you could do even better. [...] Rather than attempting to collect every resource, it‚Äôs generally more effective to focus on only a few resources. The two main ways to do this are the ‚ÄúWood / Brick‚Äù strategy, and the ‚ÄúOre / Wheat‚Äù strategy.
</Document>================================== Ai Message ==================================

The web research yielded several advanced strategies that align well with addressing key weaknesses identified in recent gameplay. Below are actionable insights and suggestions to implement into the updated prompt.

---

### **ACTIONABLE INSIGHTS**

#### 1. **Ore/Wheat Prioritization for City Building**
   - **Key Strategies**:
     - Cities provide significant resource boosts compared to settlements. Focus on building cities before settling additional areas.
     - "Ore/Wheat Strategy" suggests that players secure tiles with ore and wheat (preferably high-value hexes like 6 or 8) as a first priority.
     - Neglect wood and brick production entirely if necessary for early city upgrades. Development cards can supplement missing bricks/roads.

   - **Implementation**:
     - Encourage settlement placement near ore and wheat-rich hexes to facilitate smooth city transitions.
     - Trading should focus on balancing wheat with ore acquisition. Target 2/3 of the wheat/ore amount in sheep.

#### 2. **Development Card Usage and Largest Army**
   - **Key Strategies**:
     - Knights can secure Largest Army (2 VP) while also functioning as protection from robber retaliations. 
     - Action cards like Monopoly should be timed for decisive resource stockpiles when pushing for cities.
     - Winning combinations for this strategy typically involve 3 cities, 2 victory point cards, and Largest Army.

   - **Implementation**:
     - Guide the player to purchase Knights aggressively and aim for Largest Army early. Transition into other development card benefits (e.g., Monopoly, Victory Points) for late-game advantage.
     - Prioritize development cards if city-building is temporarily unavailable.

#### 3. **Trades and Ports for Resource Optimization**
   - **Key Strategies**:
     - Leverage ports early to offload surplus resources for deficits. Ports become crucial when placing settlements away from specific tiles.
     - Embargo high-value trades with opponents when it threatens our strategy (e.g., trading ore with a competitor aiming for cities).

   - **Implementation**:
     - Recommend using 2:1 or 3:1 ports when optimizing wheat/ore production, especially during resource droughts.
     - Avoid wasteful trades; each decision should directly feed into critical paths like city-building or Largest Army.

#### 4. **Road Building and Blocking**
   - **Key Strategies**:
     - Minimize wood and brick reliance. Use Road Building development cards to secure critical nodes or Longest Road as a late-game pivot.
     - Block opponent expansions strategically via deliberate road placements rather than random expansions.

   - **Implementation**:
     - Suggest road planning explicitly toward strategic port settlements, critical nodes, or blocking valuable routes of competitors.
     - Shift to dedicated Longest Road focus only if the advantage is viable (e.g., midway or late-game).

### **UPDATED STRATEGIC PROMPT**

Below is the refined prompt integrating the insights above, focusing on addressing wheat/ore collection inefficiencies, city building, trading optimizations, development cards, and road strategies.

---

```plaintext
You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions.
2. Your aim is to WIN. That means reaching 10 victory points.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}.
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number.
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, include it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>
6. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively.
7. Plan for the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action.

Strategies for Maximizing Victory Points:

1. **Early Settlement Placement**:
   - Aim for diverse resources but prioritize high-value wheat (6, 8) and ore hexes that enable city-building early.
   - If necessary, prioritize wheat and ore over wood/brick; use trades/ports to compensate for missing road resources.
   - Place initial roads carefully toward key ports or resource-rich settlement spots, avoiding unnecessary expansion.

2. **City Building and Resource Prioritization**:
   - Upgrade settlements into cities as the primary goal. Focus on ore and wheat stockpiling through efficient trades and robber disruption.
   - Avoid overproducing sheep, wood, or brick. Convert excess of these resources aggressively via trades or ports.
   - Achieve city upgrades before settling in additional areas to maximize exponential resource gains.

3. **Development Card Utility**:
   - Purchase development cards (Knights) to secure Largest Army and mitigate robber disruptions.
   - Leverage Monopoly to deplete opponents of ore/wheat during critical city-building turns.
   - Use Road Building cards to secure strategic settlements or contest Longest Road decisively mid-late game.

4. **Port and Trade Optimization**:
   - Utilize ports for surplus-to-scarcity trades (2:1 ratios preferred). Avoid inefficient 4:1 trades unless no alternative exists.
   - Engage in trades only when they directly facilitate city-building or VP gains. Deny trades that disproportionately benefit opponents.

5. **Road Expansion and Longest Road**:
   - Build roads tactically to reach critical nodes or block opponent expansions. Focus on coherent road networks.
   - Contest Longest Road only when viable as a late-game VP strategy supplement.

6. **Intelligent Robber Placement**:
   - Target high-VP opponents by blocking their key resources (ore, wheat). Avoid unnecessary retaliation risks.
   - Use Knights to reposition the robber if it‚Äôs impeding critical resource intake.

Execution Guidance:
1. Always focus on actions aligned with these goals: City Upgrade ‚Üí Settlement Expansion ‚Üí Development Card Purchase ‚Üí Longest Road ‚Üí Robber Placement.
2. Prioritize resource balancing and future planning (2-3 turns ahead). Avoid reactive behaviors unless strategically necessary.

**SUMMARY:**  

1. **Key Insights Learned Across Evolutions:**  
   - *Recurrent Weaknesses:* Early iterations revealed gaps in resource management (especially wheat/ore), settlement placement, trading, road coherence, city upgrades, development card use, and the robber's tactical alignment with game goals.  
   - *Adaptations and Learning:* Incremental refinements have improved core strategies, particularly in settlement placement, port usage, trading efficiency, city prioritization, road expansion, and robber tactics. However, chronic inefficiencies in transitioning from settlements to cities, securing Longest Road and Largest Army, and leveraging development cards persist.  

2. **Prompt Evolution:**  
   - *Evolution 0*: Focused on basic settlement placement with minimal trading or robber strategy.  
   - *Evolution 1*: Added resource diversity prioritization, trading basics, road-building planning, and initial robber interference.  
   - *Evolution 2*: Introduced mid-late-game port usage, optimized trading, and targeted robber tactics.  
   - *Evolution 3*: Refocused on Longest Road potential, city preference over settlements, and port utilization.  
   - *Evolution 4*: Leveraged web research insights to refine strategies for city-building, road expansion, port usage, trading, and development cards.  
   - *Evolution 5*: Integrated detailed game logs and advanced research to prioritize city building, wheat/ore acquisition, and development card utility while streamlining prompt execution.  
   - *Evolution 6*: Further emphasized wheat/ore prioritization, city builds, development card use (Largest Army focus), efficient trading via ports, and road-based node blocking.  

3. **Strategies Implemented:**  
   - *Settlement Placement*: Targeted high-yield hexes (6, 8, 9) with resource diversity, particularly wheat/ore.  
   - *City Upgrades*: Prioritized city-building as a primary goal for resource scaling. Balanced trades and port use to optimize wheat/ore acquisition.  
   - *Road Building*: Built networks for settlement expansion, port access, blockage tactics, and selective Longest Road competition.  
   - *Development Cards*: Focused on using Knights for Largest Army while leveraging cards like Monopoly for critical resource gains.  
   - *Trading Efficiency*: Improved trading priorities and port utilization while minimizing competitor advantages.  
   - *Robber Deployment*: Targeted high-value tiles of leading players while mitigating retaliation risks.  

4. **Performance Improvements Observed:**  
   - Gradual improvement in resource collection, trading, and settlement placement, though mid-to-late-game transitions are inconsistent.  
   - Strategic refinement has led to stronger city-building frameworks but has yet to consistently secure Longest Road, Largest Army, or decisive VP leaps.  
   - Recent evolutions (5 ‚Üí 6) reinforced focus on ore/wheat needs, yielding clearer city-building intentions but still struggling with execution and scoring.  

5. **Challenges Still Remaining:**  
   - Inefficient city-building transitions due to insufficient wheat/ore prioritization.  
   - Poor road coherence and weak competition for Longest Road.  
   - Underuse of development cards for strategic VP acquisition or game-altering plays (e.g., Monopoly, Road Building).  
   - Trading inconsistencies and suboptimal robber placements continue to limit decisive late-game progress.  

6. **Tools Called in Evolution 6:**  
   - *Game Log Review*: Analyzed historical gameplay to pinpoint weaknesses in resource transitions, road strategies, and development card usage.  
   - *Web Research*: Investigated advanced strategies for ore/wheat prioritization, city-building acceleration, and development card utility, particularly for Largest Army and resource control.  
   - *Prompt Refinement*: Integrated researched insights to formalize strategies around optimal settlement placement, city upgrades, tactical robber placements, and improved trading.  

**Sequential Progression:** Evolution 0 ‚Üí Evolution 1 ‚Üí Evolution 2 ‚Üí Evolution 3 ‚Üí Evolution 4 ‚Üí Evolution 5 ‚Üí Evolution 6  

The prompt now emphasizes wheat/ore prioritization for cities, efficient resource trading, Largest Army via Knights, and trade/robber alignment to close gaps in execution and late-game scoring potential.

**ANALYSIS OF GAME RESULTS:**  

1. **Performance Summary:**  
   - **AlphaBetaPlayer:** Dominated every game, with high victory points (VP), consistent settlements, cities, and robust road-building. Strong resource scaling and balanced game execution enabled decisive wins.  
   - **PromptRefiningLLMPlayer:** Struggled across all metrics, especially in settlements (AVG 1.2 compared to 2.8), cities (AVG 0.8 compared to 2.6), and roads (AVG 0.0 compared to 1.0). Development VP contributions (AVG 1.0) show an attempt at compensating through cards, though insufficient.  

2. **Key Observations from Results:**  
   - **Low VP (4.2 AVG):** Indicates insufficient synergy between core game strategies (settlements, cities, road-building, development cards).  
   - **Settlement Weakness:** Poor initial placement left the player resource-starved throughout the game, directly limiting city expansion and Longest Road competition.  
   - **City Weakness:** Chronic gaps in wheat/ore acquisition, inefficient trading, or failure to focus resources on upgrading settlements to cities.  
   - **Road Strategy Weakness:** Complete absence of road-building blocked both expansion opportunities and chances at Longest Road.  
   - **Robber Inefficiency:** Likely under-utilized as an offensive tool to throttle AlphaBetaPlayer's dominance.  
   - **Development Cards:** MVP contribution (1.0 AVG) signals limited success‚Äîlikely Largest Army competition with minimal gains from beneficial cards such as Monopoly or Road Building.

**ACTION PLAN:**  

1. **Prompt Refinement Goals:**  
   - Address critical weaknesses: settlement placement, city-building acceleration, road coherence, and balanced development card utility.  
   - Ensure early-game wheat/ore prioritization for smoother mid-late game transitions to cities.  
   - Reinforce competitive tactics for Longest Road and Largest Army using synergistic combinations of roads and development cards.  
   - Improve trading and port utilization to scale resources efficiently.  
   - Optimize robber placement to restrict AlphaBetaPlayer‚Äôs resource generation.  

2. **Tools to Use:**  
   - **Performance History:** Analyze previous game performance logs for insights into weaknesses around settlement placement, resource priorities, and in-game tactical decisions.  
   - **Web Search:** Research advanced strategies for early-game resource acquisition, Longest Road and Largest Army competition, efficient trading, and development card utilization.  
   - **Prompt Modification:** Refine current prompt with precise instructions targeting the outlined deficiencies.

Priority: Settle intersections with high-production hex values (e.g., 6 and 8) and ensure access to diverse resources (wood, brick, wheat, ore).\n2. Aim for balanced resource diversity, avoiding over-reliance on external trades while ensuring steady production.\n3. Consider port advantages: Settling near a 2:1 port can provide a long-term trading edge, but only if paired with high production tiles.\n\n**Road Building & Expansion**:\n1. Secure wood and brick for efficient road-building. Expand strategically toward critical nodes and ensure open spots for settlements.\n2. Avoid prematurely competing for Longest Road; instead, plan a sudden, decisive push mid- to late-game. Position yourself for a unified road network.\n\n**City Upgrades**:\n1. Focus on upgrading settlements to cities early by converting sheep/brick/wood excess via trades or ports. This boosts resource production exponentially.\n2. Strike a balance between settlement expansion and city-building to maintain resource diversity.\n\n**Development Cards**:\n1. Leverage cards tactically to create flexibility (e.g., monopoly for critical resources, or knights to target critical opponents).\n2. Prioritize Largest Army and hidden VP cards to close victory point gaps stealthily.\n3. Play actionable cards a turn ahead when anticipating key moves.\n\n**Trading Strategy**:\n1. Use ports for impactful trades, minimizing inefficiencies. Optimize trades toward missing resources for city upgrades.\n2. Engage opponents strategically: Offer mutually beneficial trades to accelerate progress while limiting their gains.\n\n**Robber Placement**:\n1. Target cities and settlements on high-production hexes of the strongest opponent (e.g., highest current VP count).\n2. Avoid retaliatory targeting unless strategically necessary.

Prioritize intersections with high-production hex values (e.g., 6, 8) that also offer diversity in resources (wood, brick, wheat, ore).\n2. Ensure access to ore and wheat early to accelerate city-building goals. Avoid placements overly dependent on sheep.\n3. Consider settlements near a port (especially 3:1) to enable better trading options for unbalanced production.\n\n### **Resource Prioritization and Early Game Goals:**\n1. Start with at least one settlement placement enabling road construction (wood and brick availability) and another focusing on wheat and ore for cities.\n2. Build roads toward additional resource-rich locations or strategic ports. Block opponent expansion where possible.\n3. Upgrade settlements on high-production tiles into cities as soon as possible. Cities greatly increase resource output, focusing production toward future upgrades and trades.\n\n### **Mid-to-Late Game City and Development Card Focus:**\n1. Trade aggressively for wheat and ore to ensure early upgrades to cities. Delay expansion until 1-2 cities have been built.\n2. Purchase development cards (e.g., Knights) to bolster defense, secure Largest Army (2 victory points), or use action cards (e.g., Monopoly, Road Building) to shift the game state.\n3. Use Monopoly strategically to gain key resources in abundance during critical turns.\n\n### **Trading Strategy:**\n1. Use ports efficiently to convert surplus resources into missing materials. However, prioritize 2:1 trades for maximum efficiency over 3:1 trades.\n2. Trade with other players carefully to avoid helping them disproportionately. Aim for trades that advance your cities, settlements, or VP goals directly.\n\n### **Optimal Robber and Knight Usage:**\n1. Place the robber onto critical tiles that slow opponents with high VP scores or rare resource access. Avoid provoking unnecessary retaliation.\n2. Knights should be used to shift the robber defensively and work toward securing Largest Army. Position the robber after Knight use to benefit resource production.\n\n### **Longest Road Consideration:**\n1. Expand your road network toward open nodes to secure key locations for settlements and ports, creating potential for Longest Road.\n2. Mid-game, position for Longest Road in one decisive push rather than competing aimlessly over multiple turns.",

If you want to create or update your strategic plan, include it in <plan> tags like:\n   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>\n6. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively.\n7. Plan for the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action.\n\nStrategies for Maximizing Victory Points:\n\n1. **Early Settlement Placement**:\n   - Aim for diverse resources but prioritize high-value wheat (6, 8) and ore hexes that enable city-building early.\n   - If necessary, prioritize wheat and ore over wood/brick; use trades/ports to compensate for missing road resources.\n   - Place initial roads carefully toward key ports or resource-rich settlement spots, avoiding unnecessary expansion.\n\n2. **City Building and Resource Prioritization**:\n   - Upgrade settlements into cities as the primary goal. Focus on ore and wheat stockpiling through efficient trades and robber disruption.\n   - Avoid overproducing sheep, wood, or brick. Convert excess of these resources aggressively via trades or ports.\n   - Achieve city upgrades before settling in additional areas to maximize exponential resource gains.\n\n3. **Development Card Utility**:\n   - Purchase development cards (Knights) to secure Largest Army and mitigate robber disruptions.\n   - Leverage Monopoly to deplete opponents of ore/wheat during critical city-building turns.\n   - Use Road Building cards to secure strategic settlements or contest Longest Road decisively mid-late game.\n\n4. **Port and Trade Optimization**:\n   - Utilize ports for surplus-to-scarcity trades (2:1 ratios preferred). Avoid inefficient 4:1 trades unless no alternative exists.\n   - Engage in trades only when they directly facilitate city-building or VP gains. Deny trades that disproportionately benefit opponents.\n\n5. **Road Expansion and Longest Road**:\n   - Build roads tactically to reach critical nodes or block opponent expansions. Focus on coherent road networks.\n   - Contest Longest Road only when viable as a late-game VP strategy supplement.\n\n6. **Intelligent Robber Placement**:\n   - Target high-VP opponents by blocking their key resources (ore, wheat). Avoid unnecessary retaliation risks.\n   - Use Knights to reposition the robber if it\u2019s impeding critical resource intake.\n\nExecution Guidance:\n1. Always focus on actions aligned with these goals: City Upgrade \u2192 Settlement Expansion \u2192 Development Card Purchase \u2192 Longest Road \u2192 Robber Placement.\n2. Prioritize resource balancing and future planning (2-3 turns ahead). Avoid reactive behaviors unless strategically necessary.",

### **ANALYSIS OF PERFORMANCE HISTORY:**  

1. **Performance Trends Across Evolutions:**  
   - Evolution 0: Basic approaches with minimal strategic depth yielded poor scores (AVG VP: 4.0).  
   - Evolution 1: Improvements via resource diversity prioritization and trading basics led to slightly higher results, including one win.  
   - Evolution 2: Aggressive placement and early trading optimizations failed to consistently materialize effective transitions. AVG VP dropped significantly (to 2.6).  
   - Evolution 3: Strategic focus on early settlements and city-building showed slight recovery, though execution flaws persisted.  
   - Evolution 4: Moderate improvement in settlement placements, city prioritization, and robber usage led to better contestation (AVG VP 4.2).  
   - Evolution 5: Decisive push toward city-building and ports further refined trading tactics but failed to halt AlphaBetaPlayer dominance. AVG VP fell to 3.2.  
   - Evolution 6: Emphasis on wheat/ore acquisition didn‚Äôt yield results due to weak transitions to cities and underutilized Longest Road/Largest Army competition (AVG VP 2.2).  
   - Evolution 7: Efforts toward city-building and trading/port optimization maintained resource structure but lacked sufficient VP gains (AVG VP stagnant at 4.2).  

Key weaknesses include ineffective transitions to cities, poor road expansion strategies (Longest Road), weak robber placement, repeated trading inefficiencies, and suboptimal development card utility.

2. **Game Log Analysis:**  
I will analyze game logs for insights into specific flaws in settlement placement, trading decisions, city-building, road coherence, resource transitions, and development card usage.  

Let‚Äôs begin by reviewing the game logs from Evolution 6 (which has the most recent prompt implementation).

### **INSIGHTS FROM GAME LOG ANALYSIS:**  

1. **EARLY-GAME SETTLEMENT PLACEMENT:**  
   - Settlements were placed in low-value areas that lacked critical resource synergy (e.g., wheat and ore together). Early roads failed to support settlements that could scale into cities, limiting exponential resource gain.  
   - Port placements were pursued, but their strategic utility was underused, as excessive trades for wheat and ore delayed upgrades.  

2. **MID-GAME DECISION MAKING:**  
   - Repeated inefficient use of trading ports (e.g., trading 4-for-1 excessively) depleted resources, delaying transitions to cities.  
   - Development card usage was weak, with knights played intermittently but failing to reach Largest Army benefits. Monopoly cards were rarely used impactfully.  
   - Road-building was delayed until late-game, preventing opportunities for settlement expansion and Longest Road competition.  

3. **ROBBER AND DEVELOPMENT USAGE:**  
   - Robber placements were erratic, often targeting tiles that didn‚Äôt critically impact AlphaBetaPlayer‚Äôs strategy. Retaliatory risks seemed poorly managed.  
   - Knights and other development card benefits weren‚Äôt leveraged effectively to secure either Largest Army or resource accumulation advantages.  

4. **LATE-GAME RESOURCE STRATEGIES:**  
   - Wheat and ore scarcity persisted despite consistent trades. Lack of cities crushed VP scaling, while roads remained underdeveloped, forfeiting other late-game VP strategies like Longest Road.  
   - Settlement attempts late-game were ineffective due to insufficient resource availability and poor preparatory road networks.  

---

### **ACTION PLAN FOR PROMPT REFINEMENT:**  

**Core Goals:**  
1. **Prioritize City Production:** Revise settlement placement strategy to ensure initial intersections supply wheat/ore synergy for city upgrades.  
2. **Implement Tactical Robber Usage:** Use the robber defensively to disrupt high-value tiles controlled by top-scoring opponents while mitigating retaliation risks.  
3. **Optimize Trading Efficiency:** Employ ports and trades aggressively to focus production on city upgrades, minimizing delays or wasteful trades.  
4. **Enhance Development Card Planning:** Prioritize Largest Army with sequential Knight uses and strategic deployment of Monopoly/Road Building cards.  
5. **Advance Road Coherence:** Structure roads for settlement expansion and Longest Road competition as a secondary goal.

What is OWS in Settlers of Catan?
OWS is short for Ore-Wheat-Sheep, and considered by many to be an ideal to strive for.
This strategy involves prioritizing ore, wheat, and sheep heavily (especially ore and wheat), with a minimal need for wood/brick and therefore not many roads. Instead, the focus is increasing production with cities, and using that increased production to buy development cards. [...] Another very good idea is to take the complementary resource to what resources are in the game a lot.
Ore gets used a lot with wheat (Cities and Development Cards), so they complement each other well. The same counts for wood and brick.
For example, if there is a lot of ore on the board, it is often great if you can take a strong wheat-sheep spot, because you can get some of the ore that would be left open with your second settlement.
Or you can trade wheat and/or sheep for (multiple) ores. [...] The Ore-Wheat-Sheep Strategy usually is being used by first/second position, while the Road Builder Strategy can go to third or fourth

Turn all three settlements into cities. This should be the easiest part of the strategy considering how much Ore and Wheat you'll be producing.

The last 4 photos show what you need to build roads, settlements, cities and development cards. Wheat is uniquely a part of 3 different builds, so is the one resource everyone should make sure they have. Ore always needs wheat in order to be played. Wood and brick are always used together in even amounts, so try to balance these. If you end up with a big excess of a resource over something it pairs with, your plans had better include a port. The fact that the same amount of brick and wood are [...] This strategy aims first to build two cities before attempting to build roads or settlements. Players who like this strategy look for rich placements on ore and wheat and don't worry much about brick and wood. They collect lots of development cards and a typical winning combination will involve 3 cities, 2 victory point cards and largest army. Road building is most often done with the appropriate development card. It's quite possible to win this way without producing a single brick or wood in [...] 1. Get one of everything. You're going to need all of wood, brick, wheat, sheep, and ore, so why not make sure you have them all at the start? Place your first settlement so you get 3 different resources, and pick up the final 2 with your last placement.

### INSIGHTS FROM SOURCES ON SETTLEMENT PLACEMENT STRATEGY:  

1. **Ore-Wheat-Sheep Strategy (OWS):**  
   - Focuses heavily on gathering ore and wheat early, complemented by sheep for development cards.  
   - De-emphasizes roads and brick/wood in favor of city-building, development card utility, and exponential resource generation via cities.  

2. **Complementary Resources:**  
   - First settlement should target three resources (wood, brick, wheat, or ore) with a strong production probability (e.g., tiles with dice numbers like 6 or 8).  
   - Second settlement should strategically complement the resources lacking from the first placement, with a strong preference for wheat and ore pairing.  

3. **City-Centric Strategy:**  
   - Prioritize turning settlements into cities before settling additional areas or expanding roads aggressively.  
   - Cities yield exponential boosts in production, making them key to mid- and late-game success.  

4. **Ports and Trade:**  
   - Excess wood/brick can be easily traded for missing ore/wheat if paired with ports, reducing dependency on high-dice probability hexes for secondary resources.  

5. **Development Cards Integration:**  
   - Accumulate development cards (Knights and VP cards) to compete for Largest Army and bolster VP scores effectively alongside cities.

This strategy focuses on sprawling across the board, building a long road and settlements along it. Players who like this strategy look for lots of wood and brick in their initial placements. A typical winning combination will involve 2 cities, 4 settlements and longest road. This strategy looks stronger than it is, because it typically lets you race to 7 points (5 settlements + longest road) but stalls catastrophically in the end game when you desperately need ore and everyone is pounding you [...] Do:- everything you can to get your first city. Liberally trade away sheep/brick/wood to do so. - encourage other players to compete for longest road.- make sure you leave at least one spot open for building a settlement. It is possible to win with 2 cities, largest army and 4 victory point cards, but you'd have to play well and get very lucky.- not get distracted by all that road- and settlement-building. Get those cities out.- hog the ore. Your strategy relies on you having the cities, and [...] Do:- start road, settlement, road, settlement. One of the settlements should be a port, ideally 3:1. These 4 settlements will be your engine of production. Now look to upgrade to cities (unless hand management and/or other opportunities dictate otherwise). Upgrade to cities before building settlements IF your settlement locations are secure.- It's often easier for the Producer to steal the Longest Road from the Explorer than it is to steal the Largest Army from the Commander or Developer.- win

Here you just want as much brick and wood as possible, so you can expand and build settlements.¬† This is the easiest strategy for a newbie to use, but the more I have played Catan, the less I like this one. It works great in the early game because you can expand quickly and cut off your opponents from the spots they want but the challenge is staying relevant as the game gets into the later stages. You can usually get to 7 points fairly quickly with your 5 settlements and your longest road, but [...] The idea here is to get as much ore, wheat, and sheep as possible, but an equal-ish share of each so that you can buy tons of development cards. You‚Äôll also want some brick and wood to build your first two roads and third settlement. This is the best general strategy in the game, but can be defeated by the port or wheat monopoly strategy if the board greatly favors them.¬† With this strategy, you control the game by directing the robber around the board with your soldiers and surprise everyone

### INSIGHTS FROM SOURCES ON ROAD-BUILDING AND LONGEST ROAD STRATEGY:  

1. **Roads and Early Expansion:**  
   - Prioritize using roads to secure critical hexes for settlements rather than aimlessly racing towards Longest Road.  
   - Wood and brick-heavy starts allow rapid initial road expansion, but this should primarily support settlement placement.  

2. **Balanced Road Usage:**  
   - Optimal strategy involves securing 3-4 settlements early and transitioning to resource scaling via cities before shifting focus to Longest Road competition.  
   - Avoid overcommitting to Longest Road until mid- or late-game, as excessive early road-building wastes resources.  

3. **City First, Longest Road Later:**  
   - Players who focus on cities while strategically placing roads can later contest Longest Road as a secondary VP accumulation method.  
   - Waiting to compete for Longest Road prevents unnecessary focus away from city-building goals.  

4. **Disruptive Use of Roads:**  
   - Roads can also be used to block opponents‚Äô expansions or cut them off from resource-rich areas, modifying existing board dynamics tactically.

**Strategic Guide for Maximizing Victory Points:**

1. **Early Settlement Placement:**
   - Prioritize intersections with high-production hex values (e.g., 6, 8) that offer wheat and ore for city-building potential. Aim to achieve diversity by combining wood/brick for roads and sheep for development cards.
   - Settle near key ports (2:1 or 3:1) if excess production of a specific resource can facilitate efficient trading mid- and late-game.
   - Avoid settling multiple low-value tiles focused on sheep or brick; balance resource intake with clear goals.

2. **City Building as Priority:**
   - Transition from settlements to cities as early as possible by focusing on wheat and ore acquisition.
   - Liberally trade excess resources (e.g., sheep, wood, brick) to secure wheat and ore via players or ports.
   - Prioritize upgrading settlements on intersections with high total production values to scale exponentially.

3. **Mid-Game Resource Management:**
   - Aggressively use ports to trade surplus resources for missing wheat/ore to enable rapid city-building.
   - Avoid stockpiling low-impact resources like sheep unless planning development card purchases.

4. **Balanced Road Expansion:**
   - Early roads should secure critical nodes for settlements and ports, prioritizing expansion rather than Longest Road.
   - Maintain coherence in road placement, allowing for mid-to-late game pushes toward Longest Road competition.

5. **Development Card Utility:**
   - Focus on Largest Army by purchasing and playing Knights strategically to disrupt key players and secure 2 VP.
   - Use action cards (e.g., Monopoly) during critical turns to cripple opponents or enable decisive upgrades.
   - Accumulate hidden VP cards to stealthily bolster your score.

6. **Robber Deployment:**
   - Target high-production hexes of leading players, focusing on tiles producing wheat, ore, or other scarce resources.
   - Avoid unnecessary retaliation but use Knights tactically to move the robber back onto competitive players' tiles.

7. **Late-Game Victory Maximization:**
   - Push for Longest Road via coherent road networks only after city-building goals are satisfied and VP gaps remain.
   - Prioritize trading, port usage, and development focus to exploit exponential scaling for a decisive VP lead.

---

**Execution Guidance:**
1. Always focus on actions aligned with these stages: Early Settlements ‚Üí City Upgrades ‚Üí Development Cards ‚Üí Late Game Roads and Longest Road (optional).
2. Balance immediate resource needs with efficient trades and future planning for exponential scaling.
3. Avoid reactive decisions. Stick to the strategic plan unless game conditions demand pivots to block opponents or seize key opportunities.

Prioritize intersections with high-production hex values (e.g., 6, 8) that also offer diversity in resources (wood, brick, wheat, ore).\n2. Ensure access to ore and wheat early to accelerate city-building goals. Avoid placements overly dependent on sheep.\n3. Consider settlements near a port (especially 3:1) to enable better trading options for unbalanced production.\n\n### **Resource Prioritization and Early Game Goals:**\n1. Start with at least one settlement placement enabling road construction (wood and brick availability) and another focusing on wheat and ore for cities.\n2. Build roads toward additional resource-rich locations or strategic ports. Block opponent expansion where possible.\n3. Upgrade settlements on high-production tiles into cities as soon as possible. Cities greatly increase resource output, focusing production toward future upgrades and trades.\n\n### **Mid-to-Late Game City and Development Card Focus:**\n1. Trade aggressively for wheat and ore to ensure early upgrades to cities. Delay expansion until 1-2 cities have been built.\n2. Purchase development cards (e.g., Knights) to bolster defense, secure Largest Army (2 victory points), or use action cards (e.g., Monopoly, Road Building) to shift the game state.\n3. Use Monopoly strategically to gain key resources in abundance during critical turns.\n\n### **Trading Strategy:**\n1. Use ports efficiently to convert surplus resources into missing materials. However, prioritize 2:1 trades for maximum efficiency over 3:1 trades.\n2. Trade with other players carefully to avoid helping them disproportionately. Aim for trades that advance your cities, settlements, or VP goals directly.\n\n### **Optimal Robber and Knight Usage:**\n1. Place the robber onto critical tiles that slow opponents with high VP scores or rare resource access. Avoid provoking unnecessary retaliation.\n2. Knights should be used to shift the robber defensively and work toward securing Largest Army. Position the robber after Knight use to benefit resource production.\n\n### **Longest Road Consideration:**\n1. Expand your road network toward open nodes to secure key locations for settlements and ports, creating potential for Longest Road.\n2. Mid-game, position for Longest Road in one decisive push rather than competing aimlessly over multiple turns.",

Do:- keep your options open. This strategy and the Commander are only subtly different, and if you have 3 ore, 2 wheat and 2 sheep early, you might just want to build that city instead of buying two development cards.- secure about same amount of ore as wheat, and 2/3 of this amount of sheep. You really don‚Äôt need any brick or wood to speak of when playing this strategy - you'll get all you need from development cards and robbing other players.

Step 9: Producer [...] The last 4 photos show what you need to build roads, settlements, cities and development cards. Wheat is uniquely a part of 3 different builds, so is the one resource everyone should make sure they have. Ore always needs wheat in order to be played. Wood and brick are always used together in even amounts, so try to balance these. If you end up with a big excess of a resource over something it pairs with, your plans had better include a port. The fact that the same amount of brick and wood are [...] This strategy aims first to build two cities before attempting to build roads or settlements. Players who like this strategy look for rich placements on ore and wheat and don't worry much about brick and wood. They collect lots of development cards and a typical winning combination will involve 3 cities, 2 victory point cards and largest army. Road building is most often done with the appropriate development card. It's quite possible to win this way without producing a single brick or wood in

Food/Wheat: Also referred to as grain or wheat, food is the most critical resource in the game. No VP can be gained without food. If possible have two tiles of food in your initial settlements. The only way to counter low food is insanely high resource production.
Ore: Ore is the most valuable resource in the game if you can combine it with food and sheep. The hardest part of catan is creating cities and it‚Äôs almost impossible to win without any cities. [...] Placement Strategy: Easily the most important part of the game
1] Ore-Wheat-Sheep game (City/ Development Card)
Often beginners value brick as the most valuable resource which is just not true. If you can, always take the best ore/food spot along with decent sheep.
Ideally you should target 7‚Äì8 points of ore, 6‚Äì7 points of food and 4‚Äì5 points of sheep with maybe a 2‚Äì3 points of wood/brick (you‚Äôll need it just once:P).

    new_text: You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN. That means 10 victory points.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>
6. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively
7. Think about the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- üîç marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

**Strategic Guidelines for Victory:**

**Early Settlement Placement:**
- Prioritize placements with wheat and ore as these are essential for city-building in the early game. Aim for intersections with high probabilities (e.g., tiles marked 6, 8, or 9).
- If faced with trade-offs, prioritize wheat and ore over wood or brick for road-building. Use trades strategically to acquire the missing resources.
- Ensure one of your settlements provides access to sheep to enable Development Card purchases.

**City-Building Focus:**
- Transition to cities early by prioritizing wheat and ore acquisition through resource trades, robber usage, or ports.
- Avoid stockpiling low-impact resources like excess brick and wood, as these delay city upgrades.
- City-building yields exponential resource gains and should be prioritized before additional settlement expansions.

**Trading & Port Usage:**
- Trade aggressively to secure missing resources (typically wheat and ore) for settlements and cities. Avoid trades that overly benefit opponents.
- Leverage ports for efficient 2:1 trades, especially when you overproduce low-value resources. Ports can compensate for imbalanced resource production.

**Development Card Utility:**
- Prioritize Knights early to secure Largest Army and mitigate robber impacts. Larger Army offers 2 Victory Points.
- Use Monopoly cards strategically to disrupt opponents and secure critical resources (ore, wheat) during decisive turns.
- VP Development cards should complement cities and Largest Army as your end-game strategy.

**Robber Placement:**
- Target competitors producing critical resources (e.g., ore/wheat) or leading in Victory Points. Ensure placements disrupt their strategy without provoking unnecessary retaliation.
- Reposition the robber using Knights to maximize resource acquisition and safeguard your tiles from revenge targeting.

**Road & Longest Road Considerations:**
- Build roads strategically to secure key nodes, expand settlement options, and block opponents effectively.
- Avoid competing for Longest Road early at the detriment of wheat and ore acquisition for city-building.
- Contest Longest Road only if it complements settlement expansion and adds decisive VP in the late game.

**Execution Flow:**
1. Focus on actions that maximize wheat and ore intake for city-building (e.g., trades, robber usage, port strategies).
2. Prioritize city upgrades over settlement expansions for exponential scaling.
3. Use Development Cards (especially Knights and Monopoly) tactically to disrupt opponents and advance VP goals.
4. Play proactively through port utilization and targeted robber placements to control resource flow and keep opponents from scaling effectively.
5. Expand road networks incrementally for settlements or late-game Longest Road but always prioritize city-building first.================================= Tool Message =================================

================================ Human Message =================================

**SUMMARY:**  

1. **Key Insights Learned Across Evolutions:**  
   - *Recurrent Weaknesses:* Initial efforts highlighted issues with wheat/ore prioritization, settlement placement, inefficient trading/port utilization, incoherent road-building, delayed city transitions, ineffective use of development cards, and poorly aligned robber tactics.  
   - *Adaptations and Learning:* Iterative refinements improved settlement placement, city-building focus, trading optimization, and strategic robber deployments. Persistent gaps include weak city-building transitions, inconsistent Longest Road and Largest Army focus, underutilization of impactful development cards (e.g., Monopoly, Road Building), and misaligned trade dynamics.  

2. **Prompt Evolution:**  
   - *Evolution 0*: Basic settlement placement without strategic trading or robber tactics.  
   - *Evolution 1*: Introduced resource diversity prioritization, basic trading, road-building strategies, and initial robber targeting.  
   - *Evolution 2*: Enhanced port usage for mid-late game, optimized trading, and refined robber placement tactics.  
   - *Evolution 3*: Targeted Longest Road strategy, improving city priority and port integration.  
   - *Evolution 4*: Integrated researched insights for better city-building, road coherence, trading efficiency, port usage, and development card strategies.  
   - *Evolution 5*: Focused on wheat/ore resource prioritization, city-building acceleration, and improved development card utility using game log analysis and research.  
   - *Evolution 6*: Prioritized wheat/ore strategy for seamless city transitions, enhanced Largest Army competition via Knights, efficient trading through ports, and road network improvements.  
   - *Evolution 7*: Embedded advanced city-building strategies emphasizing wheat/ore synergy, balanced road expansion to contest Longest Road, tactical robber placement, port optimization, and strategic use of development cards.  
   - *Evolution 8 (Current)*: Refined early-game settlement placement prioritizing wheat/ore for city-building, advanced port utilization for resource balancing, expanded development card tactics (Knights, Monopoly), and improved robber deployments to combat leading opponents effectively.  

3. **Strategies Implemented in the Prompt:**  
   - *Settlement Placement:* Prioritized intersections with high wheat/ore productivity to accelerate city-building while maintaining resource diversity.  
   - *City Building:* Focused on exponential scaling by upgrading settlements into cities on high-yield tiles before expanding settlements.  
   - *Road Coherence:* Developed road networks strategically for settlement expansion, blocking opponents, and enabling mid-late game Longest Road pushes.  
   - *Development Cards:* Utilized Knights for Largest Army competition and deployed Monopoly/Road Building cards during critical transitions in resource flow or VP acquisition.  
   - *Robber Deployment:* Targeted high-VP opponents by blocking key resource production (wheat/ore) while mitigating retaliation risks using Knights.  
   - *Trading Efficiency:* Leveraged ports for impactful 2:1 trades and systematically balanced resources to enable city-building and settlement expansion while denying opponents excessive gains.  

4. **Performance Improvements Observed:**  
   - Settlement placements have become more effective, leading to better resource diversity and wheat/ore synergy.  
   - City-building focus has yielded gradual improvements in resource scaling; however, transitions remain inconsistent.  
   - Trading dynamics and port usage have become more systematic, improving resource management over consecutive turns.  
   - Development card utility and robber tactics now reflect targeted plays, but decisive VP impacts (e.g., Monopoly, Largest Army) remain limited.  

5. **Challenges Still Remaining:**  
   - Delayed city-building due to inconsistent wheat/ore prioritization across the early-mid game.  
   - Insufficient road coherence limits Longest Road competition and effective expansion.  
   - Development cards are underused for pivotal VP gains, despite improved acquisition strategies.  
   - Robber activities still lack decisive resource-shifting advantages against leading opponents.  

6. **Tools Called in Evolution 8:**  
   - *Web Research:* Sourced strategic insights emphasizing Ore-Wheat-Sheep settlement synergy for early city-building and reduced reliance on wood/brick.  
   - *Prompt Refinement:* Incorporated city-first strategies, efficient port usage for resource balancing, expanded Monopoly/Knight card utility, and tactical robber placement adjustments.  
   - *Game Log Review:* Analyzed historical performance to identify gaps in city-building progression, road coherence, and action efficiency during mid-late game transitions.  

**Sequential Progression:** Evolution 0 ‚Üí Evolution 1 ‚Üí Evolution 2 ‚Üí Evolution 3 ‚Üí Evolution 4 ‚Üí Evolution 5 ‚Üí Evolution 6 ‚Üí Evolution 7 ‚Üí Evolution 8  

The current prompt now reflects advanced settlement prioritization emphasizing wheat/ore synergy, city-driven scaling strategies, port efficiency, and tactical development card/robber usage for dynamic VP progression.

Strike a balance between settlement expansion and city-building to maintain resource diversity.\n\n**Development Cards**:\n1. Leverage cards tactically to create flexibility (e.g., monopoly for critical resources, or knights to target critical opponents).\n2. Prioritize Largest Army and hidden VP cards to close victory point gaps stealthily.\n3. Play actionable cards a turn ahead when anticipating key moves.\n\n**Trading Strategy**:\n1. Use ports for impactful trades, minimizing inefficiencies. Optimize trades toward missing resources for city upgrades.\n2. Engage opponents strategically: Offer mutually beneficial trades to accelerate progress while limiting their gains.\n\n**Robber Placement**:\n1. Target cities and settlements on high-production hexes of the strongest opponent (e.g., highest current VP count).\n2. Avoid retaliatory targeting unless strategically necessary.

Prioritize intersections with high-production hex values (e.g., 6, 8) that also offer diversity in resources (wood, brick, wheat, ore).\n2. Ensure access to ore and wheat early to accelerate city-building goals. Avoid placements overly dependent on sheep.\n3.

Start with at least one settlement placement enabling road construction (wood and brick availability) and another focusing on wheat and ore for cities.\n2. Build roads toward additional resource-rich locations or strategic ports. Block opponent expansion where possible.\n3. Upgrade settlements on high-production tiles into cities as soon as possible. Cities greatly increase resource output, focusing production toward future upgrades and trades.\n\n### **Mid-to-Late Game City and Development Card Focus:**\n1. Trade aggressively for wheat and ore to ensure early upgrades to cities. Delay expansion until 1-2 cities have been built.\n2. Purchase development cards (e.g., Knights) to bolster defense, secure Largest Army (2 victory points), or use action cards (e.g., Monopoly, Road Building) to shift the game state.\n3. Use Monopoly strategically to gain key resources in abundance during critical turns.\n\n### **Trading Strategy:**\n1. Use ports efficiently to convert surplus resources into missing materials. However, prioritize 2:1 trades for maximum efficiency over 3:1 trades.\n2. Trade with other players carefully to avoid helping them disproportionately. Aim for trades that advance your cities, settlements, or VP goals directly.\n\n### **Optimal Robber and Knight Usage:**\n1. Place the robber onto critical tiles that slow opponents with high VP scores or rare resource access. Avoid provoking unnecessary retaliation.\n2. Knights should be used to shift the robber defensively and work toward securing Largest Army. Position the robber after Knight use to benefit resource production.\n\n### **Longest Road Consideration:**\n1. Expand your road network toward open nodes to secure key locations for settlements and ports, creating potential for Longest Road.\n2.

Avoid inefficient 4:1 trades unless no alternative exists.\n   - Engage in trades only when they directly facilitate city-building or VP gains. Deny trades that disproportionately benefit opponents.\n\n5. **Road Expansion and Longest Road**:\n   - Build roads tactically to reach critical nodes or block opponent expansions.

**Key Weaknesses Identified in Evolution 8 (Game Logs Review):**

1. **Inefficient Resource Utilization**: 
   - The player is failing to transition settlements into cities, which is crucial for resource scaling. Wheat and ore are often traded or used inefficiently, leading to missed upgrades. 
   - Relies heavily on Development Cards, neglecting city-building and settlement expansions for VP.

2. **Excessive Knight & Robber Usage**:
   - The use of many Knight cards disrupts opponents, but the advantages are not capitalized effectively for scaling resource or building cities/Longest Road.
   - Robber actions are frequent against RED, yet resource gains are limited, indicating poor returns on this disruptiveness.

3. **Lack of Road Coherence**:
   - Road-building actions are scattered; the player often invests resources in roads but not in securing node control for settlements or aiming decisively for Longest Road.

4. **Underperforming Early Placement Strategy**:
   - Several settlements are placed on low-value tiles with limited synergy for city upgrades or resource diversity. This hinders exponential scaling in key production inputs like wheat/ore.

5. **Insufficient Port Utilization**:
   - Although ports are sometimes used, they are not leveraged optimally for balancing resource surpluses or deficits systematically across turns.

---

### Updated Plan to Address Weaknesses
**Key Adjustments for Prompt Optimization:**
1. **City-Focused Strategy**:
   - Emphasize wheat and ore utilization for cities over Development Cards in the early-mid game.
   - Clarify that settlements on high-production intersections (e.g., 6/8) should be the first to convert into cities.

2. **Optimized Road Expansion**:
   - Reorganize road-building priorities toward critical settlement nodes or paths that allow cohesive expansions for Longest Road. Avoid redundant road placement.

3. **Port Efficiency Priority**:
   - Explicitly instruct prioritization of 2:1 and 3:1 port settlements early if surplus production (e.g., sheep or brick) is likely. Ensure systematic balancing of resources for city upgrades.

4. **Trade Smartly**:
   - Avoid excessive trades or inefficient exchanges that disproportionately sacrifice ore or wheat. Ensure all resource trades directly contribute to a broader city-building strategy linked to VP gain.

5. **Robber Strategy With Purpose**:
   - Place the robber strategically to block high-value tiles of opponents but aim for robber-induced resource gains to directly support critical upgrades/actions.

**Improved Prompt Proposal:**

```plaintext
You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions.
2. Your primary aim is to WIN by efficiently reaching 10 victory points through cities, settlements, and strategic resource optimization.
3. Ensure every action aligns with maximizing immediate and long-term resource scaling and VP gains.
4. For your final action choice, put it inside a box like \boxed{5}.
5. If you want to update your overall strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Upgrade settlements into cities, then focus on expanding settlements at nodes X and Y while maintaining resource balance</plan>
6. Always plan 2-3 turns ahead, avoiding reactive decisions unless pivotal opportunities (e.g., trade or city builds) arise.

Strategic Priorities:
1. **Early Settlement Placement**:
   - Choose intersections with high probabilities (e.g., 6/8). Prioritize placements offering wheat and ore for city upgrades, combined with access to wood/brick or ports for early versatility.
   - If forced to choose, prioritize wheat/ore over wood/brick. Use trades/ports later to bridge resource gaps for roads.

2. **City-Building as Core Focus**:
   - Transition settlements into cities as an early priority. Allocate wheat and ore resources efficiently and avoid over-relying on Development Cards during this phase.
   - Target upgrades on settlements contributing to exponential resource gains or improving trade potential.

3. **Coherent Road Expansion**:
   - Plan road placements toward controlling strategic settlement nodes OR establishing a cohesive path for Longest Road competition. Avoid scattered or inefficient road-building.
   - Block opponents' road expansion only if it aligns with your broader VP strategy.

4. **Smart Resource Management**:
   - Trade and use ports strategically to balance resource surpluses (e.g., excess sheep) into wheat and ore for cities. Avoid wasteful trades with opponents that disproportionately benefit them.

5. **Optimal Development Card Use**:
   - Purchase knights primarily to secure Largest Army and mitigate the robber's impact without diluting focus on city-building or settlements.
   - Use high-impact cards like Monopoly or Year of Plenty during pivotal VP transitions (e.g., city upgrades).

6. **Purposeful Robber Placement**:
   - Target hexes producing wheat, ore, or other critical opponent resources while mitigating retaliation risk. Robber moves should support city-building or settlement expansions.

Execution Guidance:
- Stage actions in this flow: City Upgrades ‚Üí Settlement Expansion ‚Üí Development Card Use ‚Üí Longest Road Contests (where applicable).
- Prioritize exponential scaling through clear resource strategies, efficient road placement, and port utilization.

}================================== Ai Message ==================================

### Analysis of Game Results  

**Key Observations:**  
1. **Critical Underperformance in Cities and Settlements:**  
   - Average settlements (1.4) and cities (0.6) are significantly lower than the opponent's (3.2 settlements, 2.4 cities). This shows severe inefficiency in settlement placement, city-building scaling, and resource management.  

2. **Almost Nonexistent Road Building:**  
   - The absence of effective road building leaves the player unable to compete for Longest Road or strategically expand settlements.  

3. **Minimal Victory Point (VP) Contribution from Development Cards:**  
   - Development cards contributed only 0.6 VPs on average, compared to 2-4 VPs typically expected in competitive games.  

4. **Limited Resource Flow:**  
   - The poor scaling in settlements, cities, and roads indicates insufficient resource generation and inefficient trading strategies, which cascade into weaker overall gameplay performance.

5. **Failure to Disrupt Opponent Progress:**  
   - The rival consistently achieved high VP (average 10.0), demonstrating that the opponent's productivity was rarely mitigated, either by the robber or effective blocking strategies.  

---

### Hypothesis for Improvement  

The player is struggling in fundamental areas that require immediate attention:  
1. **Settlement and City Placement:** The early-game placement needs to focus on highly productive and complementary intersections, especially targeting wheat and ore. The failure to prioritize this is stalling city-building and overall resource production.  
2. **Effective Use of Roads:** Currently, road-building is almost non-existent, leading to poor expansion potential and forfeiting Longest Road competition.  
3. **Trading Strategy Adjustment:** Resource imbalances are likely occurring, as the player is falling behind on essential city-building upgrades. Port optimization and intelligent trading need to be prioritized.  
4. **Development Card Utilization Needs Focus:** Cards like Monopoly and Year of Plenty should aggressively be used to accelerate city-building or disrupt the opponent's resource acquisition (e.g., when monopolizing key resources).  
5. **Robber Deployment:** The robber's role currently seems ineffective. It should better target high-value production tiles to disrupt opponents' cities and doubling resources.  

---

### Next Steps  

To improve the prompt, adjustments should:  
1. Emphasize **early-game settlement placement** around wheat/ore + resource diversity.  
2. Mandate the **construction of coherent roads** leading toward settlement expansion and Longest Road competition.  
3. Recalibrate **port usage and trading** to address resource shortages essential for city-building.  
4. Instruct aggressive **development card usage** for both acquisition and strategic disruption.  
5. Refine **robber targeting** to focus on high-impact tiles, especially those fueling the opponent's city-building. 

I will now:
1. Explore optimized resource scaling strategies for city-building.  
2. Research competitive road-building strategies ensuring efficient expansions.  
3. Search for advanced robber deployment and development card optimization in expert Catan strategies.  

Let me begin by researching relevant strategies.

    query: Catan strategies for settlement placement wheat ore resource scaling================================= Tool Message =================================
Name: web_search_tool_call

<Document href="https://kingofcatan.net/initial-settlement-placements-production/"/>
The Ore-Wheat-Sheep Strategy usually is being used by first/second position, while the Road Builder Strategy can go to third or fourth [...] What is OWS in Settlers of Catan?
OWS is short for Ore-Wheat-Sheep, and considered by many to be an ideal to strive for.
This strategy involves prioritizing ore, wheat, and sheep heavily (especially ore and wheat), with a minimal need for wood/brick and therefore not many roads. Instead, the focus is increasing production with cities, and using that increased production to buy development cards. [...] Third position has a couple interesting strategy choices.
An obvious answer is going for high wood-brick and a Longest Road-strategy. But if there‚Äôs no good spots for that, you need to have alternatives.
Another strong strategy is a port-strategy, getting a lot of a certain resource and the matching 2:1-port.
Also, you can always monopolise one rare resource that others won‚Äôt be able to have, so they will be forced to give you 2:1 deals just so they can have one specific resource.

<Document href="https://www.instructables.com/Catan-strategy-guide/"/>
1. Get one of everything. You're going to need all of wood, brick, wheat, sheep, and ore, so why not make sure you have them all at the start? Place your first settlement so you get 3 different resources, and pick up the final 2 with your last placement. [...] If your strategy doesn't involve the Longest Road, try to point your road towards two open intersections. You'll then be able to fork it and build two more settlements at a cost of 2 roads instead of 3.

Step 3: Resources

The resources are not created equally. There are 19 tiles:

3 Brick | 3 Ore | 4 Sheep | 4 Wheat | 4 Wood | 1 Desert (0 production) [...] The last 4 photos show what you need to build roads, settlements, cities and development cards. Wheat is uniquely a part of 3 different builds, so is the one resource everyone should make sure they have. Ore always needs wheat in order to be played. Wood and brick are always used together in even amounts, so try to balance these. If you end up with a big excess of a resource over something it pairs with, your plans had better include a port. The fact that the same amount of brick and wood are

This strategy focuses on sprawling across the board, building a long road and settlements along it. Players who like this strategy look for lots of wood and brick in their initial placements. A typical winning combination will involve 2 cities, 4 settlements and longest road. This strategy looks stronger than it is, because it typically lets you race to 7 points (5 settlements + longest road) but stalls catastrophically in the end game when you desperately need ore and everyone is pounding you [...] Obvious leads make you a target. Longest Road in particular should be picked up as late as possible. Joining up two separate road segments with a big road-building push and unveiling 2 victory point cards can give you the win from 6 points. Largest Army on the other hand needs to be more openly competed for, because of the play-only-one-development-card-per-turn rule. Victory point cards are great to have because they create uncertainty in your opponents (is it a VP or a monopoly card?). [...] - the Explorer strategy is the most easily disrupted through blocking, but unless the board is well set up for them it's a weak strategy anyway. Careful that building a settlement in the middle of their longest road doesn't hand the victory to someone else! Often, you want the Explorer to keep the Longest Road - it is a good way of keeping other players in check and forcing them to go out the hard way.

Balance Longest Road with Additional More Resources
Building roads and Settlements are the best way to expand your ability to gain resources on a given turn.¬† When you play the odds you can gain those cards either through dice rolls or through trading. [...] One of my regular gaming friends likes to go after the Longest Road.¬† I decided to try and follow this idea and focused solely on the two things necessary for roads: brick and wood.¬† I soon learned that while the Longest Road is helpful, my approach to placing those first Settlements needed to be better balanced.

<Document href="https://www.instructables.com/Catan-strategy-guide/"/>
Using the robber well is crucial - on average, the robber will turn up once in every six rolls and it also gets moved when playing a knight.

- use it on the person in the strongest position (not necessarily the open points leader). Count unplayed development cards in someone's hand as points. Someone who gets Longest Road early is rarely a threat in the long term.

- use the robber exclusively on your strongest opponent. Avoid motivating more than one of your opponents to seek revenge! [...] This strategy focuses on development cards, building other things only as an aside when development and resource cards dictate it. They'll usually end up with the Largest Army card and the lion's share of the victory point cards, and generally make a fabulous nuisance of themselves. This is a great strategy if you have good ore/wheat/sheep balance, but is always fun to play, especially because you'll be dropping the robber all over the place but your board position will appear sufficiently weak [...] - try to avoid trading down to just a few cards with the bank and being stuck unable to build. Chances are, you're doing so for a resource you're finding hard to get and therefore other players will know they can disproportionately hurt you with the robber if they steal it.

- preserve juicy settlement locations with judicious road placement. Lock up that port that's critical to your strategy early. Nothing more infuriating than having an opponent beat you to it.

8. Prioritize blocking opponent scaling with targeted Robber placements and effective development card use.
9. When using development cards (Monopoly, Road Building, Knight, etc.), prioritize maximizing resource gain or disrupting opponents during critical scaling points.
10. Prioritize coherent road-building strategies aimed at settlement expansion or Longest Road attempts, ensuring efficient resource use.
11. Prioritize settlement placement that targets wheat and ore-heavy intersections (OWS - Ore-Wheat-Sheep), ensuring exponential scaling potential for cities and development cards.
12. Trade efficiently focusing on critical resource shortages needed for cities, settlements, and roads. Use ports strategically to substitute resources where direct trades are unavailable.

The prompt has been revised to address the weaknesses observed in the game results and incorporate improvements based on advanced Catan strategies. It now emphasizes:

1. **Prioritization of wheat and ore-heavy placements (OWS - Ore-Wheat-Sheep strategy)** for superior city scaling and development card use.
2. **Coherent road-building strategies** for settlement expansion and Longest Road competition.
3. **Optimization of trading and port dynamics** for correcting critical resource imbalances.
4. **Enhanced use of Robber and development cards**, focusing on disrupting opponents and boosting critical outputs.
5. **Balanced early, mid, and late-game planning** to ensure sustained scaling and decisive victory point generation.

Testing this improved prompt should provide valuable results for further refinement.Evolve Counter: -1
