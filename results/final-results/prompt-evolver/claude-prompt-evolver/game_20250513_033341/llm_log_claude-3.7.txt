PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL SETTLEMENT PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Place settlements on high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Target at least one spot with good ore and wheat production for city development
- Try to secure at least one high-probability spot (5, 6, 8, 9) for each critical resource
- Place your second settlement to complement your first (fill resource gaps)
- Aim for access to all five resources or position near useful ports if resource diversity isn't possible
- Always consider which settlements opponents are likely to place and avoid areas that will become contested
- Place roads pointing toward valuable future expansion spots, not toward the center
- Consider the long-term impact: settlements that can't expand are less valuable

MID-GAME RESOURCE PRIORITIES:
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each possible build (cities: 1VP for 5 resources is most efficient)
- Early phase: Secure at least one good source of brick and wood for minimal expansion
- Growth phase: Prioritize ore and wheat production for city upgrades (3VP for 5 resources is optimal)
- Late phase: Focus on the fastest path to victory points, whether through buildings or development cards
- Avoid trading resources that opponents need for immediate victory point gains
- Use 4:1 trades only when necessary; prioritize port usage when possible

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and limited expansion options
- If you get an early knight, save it for defense or until you can start building toward largest army
- Time monopoly card usage for when opponents likely have accumulated specific resources
- Save year of plenty cards for completing crucial builds when you're short 1-2 specific resources
- Development cards are most valuable when:
  * You need hidden victory points to surprise opponents
  * You need knights to break up longest road or secure largest army
  * You're lacking wood/brick for expansion but have plenty of sheep/wheat/ore

EXPANSION STRATEGY:
- Build roads only with clear settlement locations in mind
- Target settlements that give you access to ports or new resources
- Block opponents' expansion paths when it gives you a strategic advantage
- Consider the timing of expansion vs. city upgrades based on your resource production
- Calculate whether longest road is achievable and worth the resource investment
- When deciding between a new settlement and a city upgrade, compare immediate vs. long-term returns

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-probability hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Save knight cards for breaking up opponent strategies or securing largest army
- Use knights defensively if you're producing valuable resources on high-probability hexes

TRADING TACTICS:
- Avoid trading resources that directly help opponents score points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades
- Trade excess resources before rolling 7 if you have more than 7 cards
- Consider bank/port trades when they enable an immediate build that advances your strategy
- When trading with players, try to receive resources that complete a build

ENDGAME STRATEGY:
- In the late game, hide your victory point potential (keep development cards hidden)
- Calculate the fastest path to 10 VP and focus exclusively on that path
- Be aware of the exact number of remaining development cards and their probabilities
- Track opponents' potential victory points, including hidden development cards
- If you're close to winning, prioritize actions that can be completed in a single turn

Before finalizing your action, check:
1. Is there a more efficient path to victory points?
2. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
3. Does this move help or hinder opponents?
4. Is there a defensive move needed to prevent an opponent from winning?
5. Are you properly diversified against dice probability?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Initial Settlement Placement Analysis

I need to analyze the board carefully to find the optimal placement for my first settlement.

## Resource and Number Assessment

Looking at the available hexes:
- ⛏️8: Ore with an 8 is excellent (high probability, critical resource)
- 🌾5: Wheat with a 5 is good (above average probability)
- 🌾10: Wheat with a 10 is decent (slightly above average)
- 🌲4: Wood with a 4 is decent (slightly above average)
- 🐑9: Sheep with a 9 is good (above average probability)
- 🧱3: Brick with a 3 is poor (low probability)
- 🏜️- (1, 0, -1): Desert with robber

## Node Analysis

Let me check the most promising nodes:
- Node 3 is already occupied by RED (⛏️8 + 🌾5 + 🌲4)
- Node 2 connects to ⛏️8 + 🌾5 + 🧱3
- Node 0 connects to ⛏️8 + 🌾10 + 🏜️-
- Node 4 connects to ⛏️8 + 🌲4 + 🐑9
- Node 5 connects to ⛏️8 + 🌾10 + 🐑9

Since RED already has the strongest node (3), I need to find the next best location that gives me good production and resource diversity.

## Strategic Considerations

1. Need high-probability numbers (5-9)
2. Need diverse resources, especially ore and wheat for city development
3. Need to position for future expansion
4. Node 2 gives me access to ore (crucial for cities)
5. Node 4 or 5 gives access to sheep production

<plan>
Place first settlement at Node 2 (⛏️8 + 🌾5 + 🧱3) for strong ore, wheat, and brick production.
For second settlement, target sheep and wood access to diversify resources.
Plan early city development with ore/wheat focus and road expansion with brick/wood.
</plan>

Node 2 is the optimal choice because:
- It gives me access to the valuable ore (8) hex
- Provides wheat (5) which is critical for development
- Includes brick (3) which helps with early expansion
- Sets me up for a city-focused strategy with ore/wheat
- Positions me well relative to RED's settlement

Therefore, my optimal first settlement placement is:

# Initial Settlement Road Placement Analysis

I need to place my first road to extend from my settlement at node 1. This is a crucial decision that will influence my future expansion options. Let me analyze each option:

## Option [0]: Build road at edge (0, 1)
- This would connect my settlement at node 1 toward node 0
- Node 0 connects to: ⛏️8, 🌾10, and 🏜️- (desert with robber)
- Building here would allow me to potentially build a future settlement at node 0
- Pros: Access to wheat (which I currently lack)
- Cons: One of the connecting hexes is the desert with robber, reducing the resource potential

## Option [1]: Build road at edge (1, 6)
- This connects toward node 6
- Node 6 connects to: 🧱3 and 🏜️- (desert with robber)
- Pros: Could expand toward brick production
- Cons: Limited resource diversity (only brick), and one hex is the desert with robber

## Option [2]: Build road at edge (1, 2)
- This connects toward node 2
- Node 2 connects to: ⛏️8, 🌾5, and 🧱3
- Pros: 
  * Node 2 has excellent resource diversity with ore, wheat, and brick
  * High probability numbers (8 is very strong, 5 is good)
  * Complements my current settlement which has ore and brick
  * Would add wheat, which I currently lack
- Cons: None significant - this is a strong expansion direction

<plan>
1. Build my first road toward node 2, which offers excellent ore (8), wheat (5), and brick (3) production
2. For my second settlement, look for a location with good wood and sheep access to complete my resource diversity
3. Early game: build at least one more road to secure node 2 for my second settlement
4. Mid game: focus on city upgrades with the strong ore production
5. Late game: expansion based on resource availability and opponent positions
</plan>

Option [2] is clearly superior as it leads toward node 2, which has the best combination of resources and production numbers. This aligns with the optimal settlement placement strategy of prioritizing high-probability numbers and resource diversity. Building toward node 2 will give me access to wheat (which I currently lack) while reinforcing my ore and brick production.

# Analysis of Initial Settlement Placement Options

I need to place my second initial settlement. This is a crucial decision that will determine my resource production for the entire game.

Let me analyze the available nodes to find the optimal placement:

## Node-by-Node Analysis:

### Current Resources
My first settlement is at node 1, producing:
- ⛏️ Ore on 8 (excellent probability)
- 🧱 Brick on 3 (poor probability)

I currently lack:
- 🌲 Wood
- 🌾 Wheat
- 🐑 Sheep

### Available Options
I'll analyze each option based on:
1. Resource diversity
2. Production probability
3. Expansion potential

**Node 5**: 
- Resources: ⛏️8, 🌾10, 🐑9
- Probability values: 8 (⭐⭐⭐), 10 (⭐), 9 (⭐⭐)
- Good ore, wheat, and sheep, but ore duplicates my first settlement
- Good expansion potential

**Nodes 7 & 8**: 
- On 🧱3 hex only
- Low production value and duplicates my brick resource

**Nodes 9, 10, & 11**:
- Combinations of 🧱3 and 🌾5
- Decent wheat but duplicates brick

**Nodes 13, 14, & 15**:
- Combinations of 🌲4 and 🐑9
- Would give me wood (needed) and sheep (needed)
- Node 15 has both 🌲4 and 🐑9 (good diversity)

**Node 16**:
- Resources: 🐑9, 🌾10
- Provides two needed resources but probabilities are not ideal

**Nodes 17 & 18**:
- Only on 🐑9
- Limited production potential

**Nodes 19, 20, & 21**:
- Only on 🌾10
- Poor probability for a single resource

**Nodes 22 & 23**:
- On desert hex
- No resource production

## Decision Making
Looking at the options, I need to prioritize:
1. Getting access to my missing resources (wood, wheat, sheep)
2. Good probability numbers
3. Future expansion potential

Node 15 stands out as it gives me both wood and sheep on decent numbers (4 and 9). This complements my first settlement's ore and brick production.

<plan>
1. Place second settlement at node 15 for wood and sheep access
2. Early game: Build roads toward wheat-producing areas
3. Mid game: Focus on city upgrades with my strong ore production at node 1
4. Late game: Target development cards and strategic expansion
</plan>

Node 15 gives me access to 🌲Wood (4) and 🐑Sheep (9), completing my resource diversity when combined with my first settlement's ⛏️Ore (8) and 🧱Brick (3). I'll still need 🌾Wheat, but I now have 4 of 5 resources with decent probability distribution.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL SETTLEMENT PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Place settlements on high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Target at least one spot with good ore and wheat production for city development
- Try to secure at least one high-probability spot (5, 6, 8, 9) for each critical resource
- Place your second settlement to complement your first (fill resource gaps)
- Aim for access to all five resources or position near useful ports if resource diversity isn't possible
- Always consider which settlements opponents are likely to place and avoid areas that will become contested
- Place roads pointing toward valuable future expansion spots, not toward the center
- Consider the long-term impact: settlements that can't expand are less valuable

MID-GAME RESOURCE PRIORITIES:
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each possible build (cities: 1VP for 5 resources is most efficient)
- Early phase: Secure at least one good source of brick and wood for minimal expansion
- Growth phase: Prioritize ore and wheat production for city upgrades (3VP for 5 resources is optimal)
- Late phase: Focus on the fastest path to victory points, whether through buildings or development cards
- Avoid trading resources that opponents need for immediate victory point gains
- Use 4:1 trades only when necessary; prioritize port usage when possible

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and limited expansion options
- If you get an early knight, save it for defense or until you can start building toward largest army
- Time monopoly card usage for when opponents likely have accumulated specific resources
- Save year of plenty cards for completing crucial builds when you're short 1-2 specific resources
- Development cards are most valuable when:
  * You need hidden victory points to surprise opponents
  * You need knights to break up longest road or secure largest army
  * You're lacking wood/brick for expansion but have plenty of sheep/wheat/ore

EXPANSION STRATEGY:
- Build roads only with clear settlement locations in mind
- Target settlements that give you access to ports or new resources
- Block opponents' expansion paths when it gives you a strategic advantage
- Consider the timing of expansion vs. city upgrades based on your resource production
- Calculate whether longest road is achievable and worth the resource investment
- When deciding between a new settlement and a city upgrade, compare immediate vs. long-term returns

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-probability hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Save knight cards for breaking up opponent strategies or securing largest army
- Use knights defensively if you're producing valuable resources on high-probability hexes

TRADING TACTICS:
- Avoid trading resources that directly help opponents score points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades
- Trade excess resources before rolling 7 if you have more than 7 cards
- Consider bank/port trades when they enable an immediate build that advances your strategy
- When trading with players, try to receive resources that complete a build

ENDGAME STRATEGY:
- In the late game, hide your victory point potential (keep development cards hidden)
- Calculate the fastest path to 10 VP and focus exclusively on that path
- Be aware of the exact number of remaining development cards and their probabilities
- Track opponents' potential victory points, including hidden development cards
- If you're close to winning, prioritize actions that can be completed in a single turn

Before finalizing your action, check:
1. Is there a more efficient path to victory points?
2. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
3. Does this move help or hinder opponents?
4. Is there a defensive move needed to prevent an opponent from winning?
5. Are you properly diversified against dice probability?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Analyzing Initial Road Placement for Second Settlement

Let me analyze my options for the initial road placement from my second settlement at node 15.

I need to consider:
1. Future expansion possibilities
2. Resource access
3. Blocking opponent potential
4. Alignment with my overall strategy

## Option Analysis:

**[0] Build road at edge (15, 17):**
- This road leads toward node 17, which connects to:
  * 🐑9 (sheep) hex that I'm already connected to
  * Possibly toward the edge of the board or a port
- Limited information on what's beyond node 17

**[1] Build road at edge (4, 15):**
- This connects nodes 4 and 15
- Node 4 connects to:
  * 🌲4 (wood) hex I'm already accessing
  * 🐑9 (sheep) hex I'm already accessing
  * ⛏️8 (ore) hex - this is significant as I already have good ore at my first settlement
- This would create redundant resource access

**[2] Build road at edge (14, 15):**
- This connects nodes 14 and 15
- Node 14 connects to:
  * 🌲4 (wood) hex I already have
  * Potentially leads toward unexplored areas on the board

## Strategic Decision:

Looking at my options, I should prioritize:
1. Access to resources I don't yet have (wheat and brick)
2. Avoiding redundant connections
3. Setting up for future expansion

The board has limited visibility, but option [0] (road at edge 15, 17) appears to be the best direction for expansion. It leads away from my current resources toward unexplored territory, potentially giving me access to wheat or brick which I'm currently missing.

<plan>
1. Build initial road toward node 17 to explore new territory
2. Look for opportunities to access wheat and brick resources
3. Mid-game: Leverage strong ore production at node 1 for city upgrades
4. Late game: Target development cards and strategic expansion

# Analyzing Move Robber Options

I need to decide where to place the robber to maximize my strategic advantage. Let's analyze each option:

## Initial Assessment
- I need to disrupt RED player's resource production since they have 4 cards and comparable victory points
- I should protect my own resource production
- I should target high-probability numbers and critical resources

## Option Analysis

**[0] Move robber to (0, 0, 0) and steal from RED**
- This is the ore hex with number 8 (high probability)
- RED has settlements at nodes 3 and 5, both producing from this hex
- Blocking this would significantly reduce RED's ore production
- This would also block my own settlement at node 1, hurting my ore production

**[1] Move robber to (0, -1, 1) and steal from RED**
- This is the wheat hex with number 5 (medium-high probability)
- RED has a settlement at node 3 producing from this hex
- Blocking wheat could slow RED's development card and city production

**[2] Move robber to (-1, 0, 1) and steal from RED**
- This is the wood hex with number 4 (medium probability)
- RED has a settlement at node 3 producing from this hex
- I have a settlement at node 15 also producing from this hex
- Blocking this would hurt both RED and myself

**[3] Move robber to (-1, 1, 0) and steal from RED**
- This is the sheep hex with number 9 (medium-high probability)
- RED has a settlement at node 5 producing from this hex
- I also have a settlement at node 15 producing from this hex
- Blocking this would hurt both RED and myself

**[4] Move robber to (0, 1, -1) and steal from RED**
- This is the wheat hex with number 10 (low-medium probability)
- RED has a settlement at node 5 producing from this hex
- Blocking this would have minimal impact on RED's production

**[5] Move robber to (1, 0, -1)**
- This is a desert hex with no production value
- This would be a wasted move since it blocks no production

## Strategic Decision
RED's strongest production is from the ore hex (8), which they can collect from two settlements. Blocking this would significantly hamper their ability to build cities or purchase development cards. Although this also affects my production at node 1, the impact on RED is greater since they have two settlements benefiting from this resource.

While blocking my own resource is suboptimal, the strategic advantage of limiting RED's ore production outweighs this drawback. Additionally, I get to steal a resource from RED.

<plan>
1. Block RED's strongest resource production (ore)
2. Continue building toward node 17 to access new territories
3. Look for opportunities to gain wheat access through strategic settlement placement
4. Use my ore production advantage once the robber is moved away from the ore hex

You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL SETTLEMENT PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Place settlements on high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Target at least one spot with good ore and wheat production for city development
- Try to secure at least one high-probability spot (5, 6, 8, 9) for each critical resource
- Place your second settlement to complement your first (fill resource gaps)
- Aim for access to all five resources or position near useful ports if resource diversity isn't possible
- Always consider which settlements opponents are likely to place and avoid areas that will become contested
- Place roads pointing toward valuable future expansion spots, not toward the center
- Consider the long-term impact: settlements that can't expand are less valuable

MID-GAME RESOURCE PRIORITIES:
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each possible build (cities: 1VP for 5 resources is most efficient)
- Early phase: Secure at least one good source of brick and wood for minimal expansion
- Growth phase: Prioritize ore and wheat production for city upgrades (3VP for 5 resources is optimal)
- Late phase: Focus on the fastest path to victory points, whether through buildings or development cards
- Avoid trading resources that opponents need for immediate victory point gains
- Use 4:1 trades only when necessary; prioritize port usage when possible

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and limited expansion options
- If you get an early knight, save it for defense or until you can start building toward largest army
- Time monopoly card usage for when opponents likely have accumulated specific resources
- Save year of plenty cards for completing crucial builds when you're short 1-2 specific resources
- Development cards are most valuable when:
  * You need hidden victory points to surprise opponents
  * You need knights to break up longest road or secure largest army
  * You're lacking wood/brick for expansion but have plenty of sheep/wheat/ore

EXPANSION STRATEGY:
- Build roads only with clear settlement locations in mind
- Target settlements that give you access to ports or new resources
- Block opponents' expansion paths when it gives you a strategic advantage
- Consider the timing of expansion vs. city upgrades based on your resource production
- Calculate whether longest road is achievable and worth the resource investment
- When deciding between a new settlement and a city upgrade, compare immediate vs. long-term returns

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-probability hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Save knight cards for breaking up opponent strategies or securing largest army
- Use knights defensively if you're producing valuable resources on high-probability hexes

TRADING TACTICS:
- Avoid trading resources that directly help opponents score points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades
- Trade excess resources before rolling 7 if you have more than 7 cards
- Consider bank/port trades when they enable an immediate build that advances your strategy
- When trading with players, try to receive resources that complete a build

ENDGAME STRATEGY:
- In the late game, hide your victory point potential (keep development cards hidden)
- Calculate the fastest path to 10 VP and focus exclusively on that path
- Be aware of the exact number of remaining development cards and their probabilities
- Track opponents' potential victory points, including hidden development cards
- If you're close to winning, prioritize actions that can be completed in a single turn

Before finalizing your action, check:
1. Is there a more efficient path to victory points?
2. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
3. Does this move help or hinder opponents?
4. Is there a defensive move needed to prevent an opponent from winning?
5. Are you properly diversified against dice probability?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 17 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Block RED's strongest resource production (ore)
2. Continue building toward node 17 to access new territories
3. Look for opportunities to gain wheat access through strategic settlement placement
4. Use my ore production advantage once the robber is moved away from the ore hex
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.

# Game State Analysis

Let me analyze my current position and options:

## Resource Analysis
I have:
- 3 🌲 WOOD
- 1 🧱 BRICK
- 2 🐑 SHEEP
- 1 🌾 WHEAT
- 0 ⛏️ ORE

My production capabilities:
- Settlement at node 1: ⛏️8 (high probability) and 🧱3 (low probability)
- Settlement at node 15: 🌲4 (low probability) and 🐑9 (medium probability)

## Strategic Position Analysis
- The robber is currently on the ⛏️8 hex, blocking my ore production from my best hex
- I can build one road with my current resources (wood+brick)
- I have no immediate ability to build settlements due to lack of wheat and sheep
- RED has settlements at nodes 3 and 5, both producing from the valuable ore hex

## Road Building Options
Let me evaluate each road option:
1. Edge (0, 1): Extends toward the desert (🏜️) - low strategic value
2. Edge (4, 15): Connects backward to my existing settlement - no expansion opportunity
3. Edge (2, 9): Extends toward wheat hex - good for resource diversification
4. Edge (1, 6): Extends toward desert and brick - moderate value
5. Edge (17, 18): Extends toward sheep hex - I already produce sheep, less valuable
6. Edge (14, 15): Connects backward to my settlement - no expansion opportunity

I need to think about where my next settlement should be and build roads toward that goal.

## Strategic Considerations
- I need better wheat production
- I should continue expanding toward new resource possibilities
- The current robber on the ore hex is hurting both RED and me

<plan>
1. Build a road toward the wheat hex (edge 2,9) to set up for a future settlement with wheat access
2. On future turns, try to move the robber off the ore hex when possible
3. Continue expansion toward wheat production
4. Save resources for a settlement once I have the needed wheat and sheep
</plan>

Looking at the options, road option [3] at edge (2, 9) gives me the best path toward the wheat hex, which I desperately need for my resource portfolio. This aligns with my plan to diversify resources and enables future settlement building.

# Game Analysis for Robber Movement

I need to decide where to place the robber to maximize my strategic advantage while minimizing my opponent's production.

## Analyzing Each Option:

[0] Move robber to (1, -1, 0) - Brick hex with number 3
- This would block a low-probability brick hex (3)
- Only RED has a settlement here (node 1)
- Impact: Minimal as 3 is low probability
- No stealing opportunity

[1] Move robber to (0, -1, 1) - Wheat hex with number 5
- This would block a moderately productive wheat hex (5)
- RED has a settlement here (node 3)
- Impact: Reduces RED's wheat production (important for cities/dev cards)
- Can steal from RED

[2] Move robber to (-1, 0, 1) - Wood hex with number 4
- This would block a wood hex with number 4
- Both RED and BLUE have settlements here (nodes 3 and 15)
- Impact: Hurts both players (including myself)
- Can steal from RED

[3] Move robber to (-1, 1, 0) - Sheep hex with number 9
- This would block a high-probability sheep hex (9)
- Both RED and BLUE have settlements here (nodes 5 and 15)
- Impact: Significant reduction in sheep production for both players
- Can steal from RED

[4] Move robber to (0, 1, -1) - Wheat hex with number 10
- This would block a wheat hex with number 10 (low-moderate probability)
- RED has a settlement here (node 5)
- Impact: Minor reduction in RED's wheat production
- Can steal from RED

[5] Move robber to (1, 0, -1) - Desert hex
- This would place the robber on the desert
- No production impact (desert doesn't produce resources)
- No stealing opportunity
- Completely ineffective move

## Strategic Considerations:

1. Currently, RED is getting high-value ore production from the 8 hex where the robber is now located - I should definitely move it elsewhere
2. RED has two settlements on high-probability hexes (8, 5, 9)
3. I have 1 wheat card and need more wheat for expansion according to my plan
4. RED may be building toward cities with their ore and wheat production

## Optimal Decision:
I should target RED's highest-value production that doesn't impact me. My best option is to target the wheat hex with probability 5, as:
1. It hurts RED's wheat production (vital for cities and development cards)
2. It doesn't hurt my production (I don't have settlements there)
3. I can steal a card from RED
4. Wheat is a resource that I currently need for my expansion plan

<plan>
1. Move the robber to the wheat hex (0,-1,1) to disrupt RED's wheat production
2. Use my wood+brick+wheat to build a road toward good wheat spots
3. Focus on securing a wheat-producing settlement next
4. Save resources for a settlement once I have the needed wheat and sheep

# Game Analysis for Settlers of Catan

Let me carefully analyze the current game state to make the optimal move:

## Current Resource Assessment
- I have: 3 🌲WOOD, 1 🧱BRICK, 2 🐑SHEEP, 1 🌾WHEAT
- My current production: 🌲4[⭐], 🧱3[⭐], ⛏️8[⭐⭐⭐], 🐑9[⭐⭐]
- Missing resources: I lack good wheat production and have no ore production

## Victory Point Assessment
- Currently at 2/10 VPs (2 settlements)
- RED is also at 2/10 VPs
- We're in early-to-mid game stage

## Available Actions Analysis
1. I can build a road (costs 1 🌲WOOD, 1 🧱BRICK)
2. I can build a settlement at node 9 (costs 1 🌲WOOD, 1 🧱BRICK, 1 🐑SHEEP, 1 🌾WHEAT)

The settlement at node 9 would connect to:
- 🧱3 (1, -1, 0) [⭐]
- 🌾5 (0, -1, 1) [⭐⭐] - currently has the robber
- ⛏️8 (0, 0, 0) [⭐⭐⭐]

This is extremely valuable as it would give me access to:
- High-probability ore (8) which I currently completely lack
- Additional wheat production (5) which I'm currently lacking
- Brick (3) which I already have some access to

Looking at the board, I've already built roads to make this settlement possible (based on the road at (2, 9) and (9, 2)).

## Decision Logic
Building the settlement at node 9 is clearly the optimal choice because:
1. It gives me access to critical resources I'm missing (ore and wheat)
2. It provides high-probability ore (8) which is essential for city upgrades
3. It immediately gives me an additional VP
4. It positions me well for future expansion
5. I have exactly the resources needed to build it

<plan>
1. Build settlement at node 9 to gain access to ore (8) and wheat (5)
2. Use future resources to upgrade settlements to cities, focusing on the high-probability nodes
3. Continue expanding toward good wheat locations when possible
4. Consider buying development cards when ore/wheat production improves
</plan>

The settlement at node 9 is clearly the most efficient path to victory, as it addresses my resource gaps and gives an immediate VP.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL SETTLEMENT PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Place settlements on high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Target at least one spot with good ore and wheat production for city development
- Try to secure at least one high-probability spot (5, 6, 8, 9) for each critical resource
- Place your second settlement to complement your first (fill resource gaps)
- Aim for access to all five resources or position near useful ports if resource diversity isn't possible
- Always consider which settlements opponents are likely to place and avoid areas that will become contested
- Place roads pointing toward valuable future expansion spots, not toward the center
- Consider the long-term impact: settlements that can't expand are less valuable

MID-GAME RESOURCE PRIORITIES:
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each possible build (cities: 1VP for 5 resources is most efficient)
- Early phase: Secure at least one good source of brick and wood for minimal expansion
- Growth phase: Prioritize ore and wheat production for city upgrades (3VP for 5 resources is optimal)
- Late phase: Focus on the fastest path to victory points, whether through buildings or development cards
- Avoid trading resources that opponents need for immediate victory point gains
- Use 4:1 trades only when necessary; prioritize port usage when possible

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and limited expansion options
- If you get an early knight, save it for defense or until you can start building toward largest army
- Time monopoly card usage for when opponents likely have accumulated specific resources
- Save year of plenty cards for completing crucial builds when you're short 1-2 specific resources
- Development cards are most valuable when:
  * You need hidden victory points to surprise opponents
  * You need knights to break up longest road or secure largest army
  * You're lacking wood/brick for expansion but have plenty of sheep/wheat/ore

EXPANSION STRATEGY:
- Build roads only with clear settlement locations in mind
- Target settlements that give you access to ports or new resources
- Block opponents' expansion paths when it gives you a strategic advantage
- Consider the timing of expansion vs. city upgrades based on your resource production
- Calculate whether longest road is achievable and worth the resource investment
- When deciding between a new settlement and a city upgrade, compare immediate vs. long-term returns

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-probability hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Save knight cards for breaking up opponent strategies or securing largest army
- Use knights defensively if you're producing valuable resources on high-probability hexes

TRADING TACTICS:
- Avoid trading resources that directly help opponents score points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades
- Trade excess resources before rolling 7 if you have more than 7 cards
- Consider bank/port trades when they enable an immediate build that advances your strategy
- When trading with players, try to receive resources that complete a build

ENDGAME STRATEGY:
- In the late game, hide your victory point potential (keep development cards hidden)
- Calculate the fastest path to 10 VP and focus exclusively on that path
- Be aware of the exact number of remaining development cards and their probabilities
- Track opponents' potential victory points, including hidden development cards
- If you're close to winning, prioritize actions that can be completed in a single turn

Before finalizing your action, check:
1. Is there a more efficient path to victory points?
2. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
3. Does this move help or hinder opponents?
4. Is there a defensive move needed to prevent an opponent from winning?
5. Are you properly diversified against dice probability?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 23 | Player: BLUE | Action: MOVE_ROBBER

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Build settlement at node 9 to gain access to ore (8) and wheat (5)
2. Use future resources to upgrade settlements to cities, focusing on the high-probability nodes
3. Continue expanding toward good wheat locations when possible
4. Consider buying development cards when ore/wheat production improves
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.

# Analyzing Robber Placement Options

I need to decide where to place the robber to maximize my strategic advantage. Let me analyze each option:

**Option [0]**: Move robber to (0, 0, 0) and steal from RED
- This is the ore hex with number 8 (highest probability)
- Currently produces for both RED (two settlements) and myself (one settlement)
- Blocking this would hurt RED significantly but also hurt my own ore production
- I would steal a card from RED (who has 5 cards)

**Option [1]**: Move robber to (1, -1, 0)
- This is the brick hex with number 3 (low probability)
- Produces for RED and myself
- Not blocking much production value
- No card stealing opportunity

**Option [2]**: Move robber to (-1, 0, 1) and steal from RED
- This is the wood hex with number 4 (medium-low probability)
- Produces for RED and myself
- Would hurt both of us moderately
- I would steal a card from RED

**Option [3]**: Move robber to (-1, 1, 0) and steal from RED
- This is the sheep hex with number 9 (good probability)
- Produces for RED and myself
- Would hurt both of us
- I would steal a card from RED

**Option [4]**: Move robber to (0, 1, -1) and steal from RED
- This is the wheat hex with number 10 (medium probability)
- Produces for RED but not for me
- Would only hurt RED, not me
- I would steal a card from RED

**Option [5]**: Move robber to (1, 0, -1)
- This is a desert hex
- No production value to block
- No card stealing opportunity
- Completely wasted move

## Strategic Considerations:
- RED currently has 2 VP and 5 resources (hidden)
- I have 3 VP and 2 wood, 1 sheep, 1 ore
- I need ore and wheat for city development per my plan
- RED has strong ore production from two settlements on the 8 hex

<plan>
1. Block RED's most valuable production (ore on 8 hex)
2. Continue building toward expansions at valuable wheat/ore locations
3. Focus on city upgrades once I have sufficient resources
4. Consider development cards when I have extra sheep/wheat/ore
</plan>

## Decision:
Looking at all options, option [0] gives me the best strategic advantage. While it hurts my own ore production, it hurts RED much more since they have two settlements on that hex. Since RED has 5 cards, there's a good chance I'll steal something useful. This is particularly important because ore is a key resource for city development.

# Game Analysis for Blue Player

Let me analyze the game state and available options systematically:

## Current Position Assessment
- I have 3 VP from 3 settlements
- I have 3 wood, 2 brick, 3 sheep, 1 ore resources
- RED has 2 VP (2 settlements) and 6 hidden cards
- We both don't have longest road or largest army yet

## Resource Production Assessment
My production:
- Wood (4): From node 15
- Brick (3): From nodes 1 and 9
- Sheep (9): From node 15
- Wheat (5): From node 9
- Ore (8): From node 1

I have decent production across all resources except wheat is a bit limited.

## Available Actions
I can only build roads right now (using 1 wood + 1 brick). I need to consider which road helps my expansion strategy most effectively.

## Road Building Options Analysis
1. Road at edge (0, 1): Moves toward the desert, less valuable
2. Road at edge (9, 10): Extends toward wheat production 
3. Road at edge (4, 15): Extends from my settlement toward ore/wheat
4. Road at edge (8, 9): Extends from my settlement in another direction
5. Road at edge (1, 6): Extends toward desert/possibly ports
6. Road at edge (17, 18): Extends from my sheep settlement
7. Road at edge (14, 15): Another extension from my sheep settlement

## Strategic Planning
Looking at the map, I need to:
1. Work toward getting longest road (I already have 3 connected roads)
2. Position for future settlements on good production spots
3. Aim to improve my wheat and ore production for city upgrades

<plan>
1. Build roads strategically to work toward longest road
2. Target expansion toward better wheat production (currently limited)
3. Secure ore/wheat locations for future city development
4. Build toward longest road to gain 2 VP while expanding
</plan>

The best options seem to be:
- Option 2 (edge 9, 10): Extends toward wheat production
- Option 3 (edge 4, 15): Connects toward what appears to be ore/wheat areas

Building at edge (9, 10) looks most promising as it extends from my settlement at node 9 toward potential wheat production. This would be my 4th connected road, moving me toward longest road while positioning for valuable resources.

   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL SETTLEMENT PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Place settlements on high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Target at least one spot with good ore and wheat production for city development
- Try to secure at least one high-probability spot (5, 6, 8, 9) for each critical resource
- Place your second settlement to complement your first (fill resource gaps)
- Aim for access to all five resources or position near useful ports if resource diversity isn't possible
- Always consider which settlements opponents are likely to place and avoid areas that will become contested
- Place roads pointing toward valuable future expansion spots, not toward the center
- Consider the long-term impact: settlements that can't expand are less valuable

MID-GAME RESOURCE PRIORITIES:
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each possible build (cities: 1VP for 5 resources is most efficient)
- Early phase: Secure at least one good source of brick and wood for minimal expansion
- Growth phase: Prioritize ore and wheat production for city upgrades (3VP for 5 resources is optimal)
- Late phase: Focus on the fastest path to victory points, whether through buildings or development cards
- Avoid trading resources that opponents need for immediate victory point gains
- Use 4:1 trades only when necessary; prioritize port usage when possible

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and limited expansion options
- If you get an early knight, save it for defense or until you can start building toward largest army
- Time monopoly card usage for when opponents likely have accumulated specific resources
- Save year of plenty cards for completing crucial builds when you're short 1-2 specific resources
- Development cards are most valuable when:
  * You need hidden victory points to surprise opponents
  * You need knights to break up longest road or secure largest army
  * You're lacking wood/brick for expansion but have plenty of sheep/wheat/ore

EXPANSION STRATEGY:
- Build roads only with clear settlement locations in mind
- Target settlements that give you access to ports or new resources
- Block opponents' expansion paths when it gives you a strategic advantage
- Consider the timing of expansion vs. city upgrades based on your resource production
- Calculate whether longest road is achievable and worth the resource investment
- When deciding between a new settlement and a city upgrade, compare immediate vs. long-term returns

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-probability hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Save knight cards for breaking up opponent strategies or securing largest army
- Use knights defensively if you're producing valuable resources on high-probability hexes

TRADING TACTICS:
- Avoid trading resources that directly help opponents score points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades
- Trade excess resources before rolling 7 if you have more than 7 cards
- Consider bank/port trades when they enable an immediate build that advances your strategy
- When trading with players, try to receive resources that complete a build

ENDGAME STRATEGY:
- In the late game, hide your victory point potential (keep development cards hidden)
- Calculate the fastest path to 10 VP and focus exclusively on that path
- Be aware of the exact number of remaining development cards and their probabilities
- Track opponents' potential victory points, including hidden development cards
- If you're close to winning, prioritize actions that can be completed in a single turn

Before finalizing your action, check:
1. Is there a more efficient path to victory points?
2. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
3. Does this move help or hinder opponents?
4. Is there a defensive move needed to prevent an opponent from winning?
5. Are you properly diversified against dice probability?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 29 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Build roads strategically to work toward longest road
2. Target expansion toward better wheat production (currently limited)
3. Secure ore/wheat locations for future city development
4. Build toward longest road to gain 2 VP while expanding

# Settlers of Catan Game Analysis

I need to analyze the current game state and determine the best action to take as the BLUE player.

## Current Situation Assessment:
- I have 3 VP (3 settlements)
- Resources: 2 🌲WOOD, 1 🧱BRICK, 3 🐑SHEEP, 1 ⛏️ORE
- I have 4 roads with longest continuous segment of 3
- RED has 2 VP (2 settlements) and 6 hidden cards

## Resource Evaluation:
- I have enough resources (1 wood, 1 brick) to build exactly one road
- I have good sheep production but limited wheat production
- My ore production is moderate (8 is excellent but has the robber)
- I need to improve wheat production for city upgrades

## Road Building Options Analysis:
Let me evaluate each road building option:

1. Edge (0, 1): Would extend toward the desert - not a strategic priority
2. Edge (10, 11): Extends toward wheat hex (5) - potential for future settlement
3. Edge (4, 15): Connects to my settlement at node 15 - could help with longest road
4. Edge (8, 9): Connects to my settlement at node 9 - extends toward brick resource
5. Edge (1, 6): Extends from my settlement at node 1 toward the desert - low value
6. Edge (17, 18): Extends from roads at node 17 - could help with longest road network
7. Edge (14, 15): Connects to my settlement at node 15 - extends my road network

## Strategic Priority:
My current plan focuses on building toward longest road while improving wheat production. Options 2 and 4 seem most aligned with extending toward wheat and building a cohesive road network.

Option 2 (edge 10, 11) would extend my road network from settlement at node 9 toward hex with wheat (5), which addresses my need for wheat production.

Option 4 (edge 8, 9) connects to my settlement at node 9 but extends toward brick, which is less valuable for my city development strategy.

## Longest Road Consideration:
Building strategically could potentially earn me the longest road (2 VP) in future turns, which would put me at 5 VP total.

<plan>
1. Build roads to connect my settlements and work toward longest road (8 roads needed)
2. Aim for a settlement that improves wheat production
3. Once I have better wheat/ore production, focus on city upgrades
4. Continue expanding roads to secure longest road (2 VP)
</plan>

Looking at the optimal move, I should build a road that extends my network toward wheat resources while contributing to my longest road strategy. Option 2 (edge 10, 11) accomplishes this best by extending toward wheat production and keeping my road network cohesive.

# Analyzing Game State and Robber Placement Options

Let me analyze the current game state and each robber placement option:

## Game Assessment
- I have 3 VP from 3 settlements
- RED has 2 VP from 2 settlements
- I need to block high-value resources for RED while potentially gaining useful resources
- I currently have 1 wood and 4 sheep, lacking brick, ore, and wheat for building

## Production Analysis
RED's production:
- Ore (8): ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (high production from both settlements)
- Wheat (5): ⭐⭐ + Wheat (10): ⭐ = ⭐⭐⭐ (decent production)
- Sheep (9): ⭐⭐ (moderate production)
- Wood (4): ⭐ (low production)

My production:
- Ore (8): ⭐⭐⭐ (good production)
- Wheat (5): ⭐⭐ (moderate production)
- Sheep (9): ⭐⭐ (moderate production)
- Brick (3): ⭐⭐ (moderate production) - currently blocked
- Wood (4): ⭐⭐ (moderate production)

## Robber Placement Options Analysis:

[0] Move robber to (0, 0, 0) [Ore-8] and steal from RED
- Blocks RED's strongest resource (⭐⭐⭐ ore)
- Also blocks my own ore production (⭐⭐⭐)
- Could steal ore from RED, which I need
- However, hurts my own production equally

[1] Move robber to (0, -1, 1) [Wheat-5] and steal from RED
- Blocks RED's wheat (⭐⭐)
- Also blocks my wheat at node 9 (⭐⭐)
- Could steal wheat from RED
- Hurts my own production equally

[2] Move robber to (-1, 0, 1) [Wood-4] and steal from RED
- Blocks RED's wood (⭐)
- Also blocks my wood at node 15 (⭐)
- Could steal wood from RED
- Hurts my own production equally

[3] Move robber to (-1, 1, 0) [Sheep-9] and steal from RED
- Blocks RED's sheep (⭐⭐)
- Also blocks my sheep at node 15 (⭐⭐)
- Could steal sheep from RED (I already have 4)
- Hurts my own production equally

[4] Move robber to (0, 1, -1) [Wheat-10] and steal from RED
- Blocks RED's wheat (⭐) on the 10-value hex
- Doesn't block any of my production
- Could steal wheat from RED
- Best option for harming RED while not affecting me

[5] Move robber to (1, 0, -1) [Desert]
- Desert produces nothing
- Robber would be wasted
- Can't steal from anyone
- No strategic value

## Decision Making

The robber is currently on brick (3), which is only blocking my own brick production, helping RED.

Option [4] is clearly the best as it:
1. Blocks RED's wheat production without affecting my production
2. Allows me to steal a resource from RED
3. Removes the robber from the brick hex, restoring my brick production

Unblocking my brick hex will allow me to resume road and settlement building. This aligns with my plan to build roads toward longest road.

<plan>
1. Move robber to wheat-10 hex to block RED's production and potentially steal a useful resource
2. Continue building roads toward longest road (need 8 roads total)
3. Build a settlement to improve resource production (particularly ore/wheat)
4. Later focus on city upgrades once resource production improves
</plan>

# Game Analysis for Turn 33

Let me analyze my current situation and available actions:

## Current Resources
- 1 WOOD
- 4 SHEEP
- 1 ORE
- 0 BRICK
- 0 WHEAT

## Victory Point Status
- I have 3/10 VPs from my 3 settlements
- RED has 2/10 VPs from 2 settlements
- I have a lead, but not by much

## Current Production
I have settlements at:
- Node 1: ORE(8★★★), BRICK(3★)
- Node 15: WOOD(4★), SHEEP(9★★)
- Node 9: BRICK(3★), WHEAT(5★★)

## Available Actions Analysis
I can either end my turn or trade 4 SHEEP for another resource using the 4:1 port trade.

With my current resources, I cannot:
- Build a settlement (need WOOD+BRICK+SHEEP+WHEAT)
- Build a city (need 2 WHEAT + 3 ORE)
- Build a road (need WOOD+BRICK)
- Buy a development card (need ORE+WHEAT+SHEEP)

Let me evaluate the trade options:
1. Trade 4 SHEEP for 1 WOOD: Would give me 2 WOOD, still lacking BRICK and WHEAT for a settlement
2. Trade 4 SHEEP for 1 BRICK: Would give me 1 BRICK, still lacking WHEAT for a settlement
3. Trade 4 SHEEP for 1 ORE: Would give me 2 ORE, still lacking 2 WHEAT for a city
4. Trade 4 SHEEP for 1 WHEAT: Would give me 1 WHEAT, still lacking BRICK for a settlement

None of these trades would enable an immediate build. Trading 4:1 is inefficient, and since I can't complete any build this turn regardless of which trade I make, it's better to save my resources for next turn when I might have more options.

<plan>
1. End my turn now and conserve resources
2. On my next turn, hope to get BRICK and/or WHEAT from dice rolls
3. Focus on building roads toward settlement locations (aiming for longest road)
4. Target settlement locations that improve my WHEAT and ORE production
5. Long-term goal: upgrade to cities once I have steady ORE and WHEAT
</plan>

Since I can't make any meaningful progress this turn with the available trade options, I'll end my turn and wait for better opportunities.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL SETTLEMENT PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Place settlements on high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Target at least one spot with good ore and wheat production for city development
- Try to secure at least one high-probability spot (5, 6, 8, 9) for each critical resource
- Place your second settlement to complement your first (fill resource gaps)
- Aim for access to all five resources or position near useful ports if resource diversity isn't possible
- Always consider which settlements opponents are likely to place and avoid areas that will become contested
- Place roads pointing toward valuable future expansion spots, not toward the center
- Consider the long-term impact: settlements that can't expand are less valuable

MID-GAME RESOURCE PRIORITIES:
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each possible build (cities: 1VP for 5 resources is most efficient)
- Early phase: Secure at least one good source of brick and wood for minimal expansion
- Growth phase: Prioritize ore and wheat production for city upgrades (3VP for 5 resources is optimal)
- Late phase: Focus on the fastest path to victory points, whether through buildings or development cards
- Avoid trading resources that opponents need for immediate victory point gains
- Use 4:1 trades only when necessary; prioritize port usage when possible

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and limited expansion options
- If you get an early knight, save it for defense or until you can start building toward largest army
- Time monopoly card usage for when opponents likely have accumulated specific resources
- Save year of plenty cards for completing crucial builds when you're short 1-2 specific resources
- Development cards are most valuable when:
  * You need hidden victory points to surprise opponents
  * You need knights to break up longest road or secure largest army
  * You're lacking wood/brick for expansion but have plenty of sheep/wheat/ore

EXPANSION STRATEGY:
- Build roads only with clear settlement locations in mind
- Target settlements that give you access to ports or new resources
- Block opponents' expansion paths when it gives you a strategic advantage
- Consider the timing of expansion vs. city upgrades based on your resource production
- Calculate whether longest road is achievable and worth the resource investment
- When deciding between a new settlement and a city upgrade, compare immediate vs. long-term returns

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-probability hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Save knight cards for breaking up opponent strategies or securing largest army
- Use knights defensively if you're producing valuable resources on high-probability hexes

TRADING TACTICS:
- Avoid trading resources that directly help opponents score points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades
- Trade excess resources before rolling 7 if you have more than 7 cards
- Consider bank/port trades when they enable an immediate build that advances your strategy
- When trading with players, try to receive resources that complete a build

ENDGAME STRATEGY:
- In the late game, hide your victory point potential (keep development cards hidden)
- Calculate the fastest path to 10 VP and focus exclusively on that path
- Be aware of the exact number of remaining development cards and their probabilities
- Track opponents' potential victory points, including hidden development cards
- If you're close to winning, prioritize actions that can be completed in a single turn

Before finalizing your action, check:
1. Is there a more efficient path to victory points?
2. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
3. Does this move help or hinder opponents?
4. Is there a defensive move needed to prevent an opponent from winning?
5. Are you properly diversified against dice probability?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game Analysis - Moving the Robber

I need to decide where to place the robber to optimize my position in the game. Let me analyze each option carefully.

## Current Game State Analysis
- I have 3 settlements (3 VP) and no cities
- Resources: 1 Wood, 4 Sheep (limited build options)
- RED has 2 settlements (2 VP)
- I need diverse resources, especially Brick, Ore and Wheat for expansion and upgrades

## Robber Placement Options

**Option 0: Move robber to (0, 0, 0) - Ore (8)**
- This blocks an 8-value Ore hex
- RED has two settlements here, so this significantly impacts their Ore production
- Ore is critical for city upgrades and development cards
- This is RED's best production hex (3 stars)

**Option 1: Move robber to (0, -1, 1) - Wheat (5)**
- This blocks a 5-value Wheat hex
- RED has one settlement here, and I have one settlement here
- I'd be blocking my own Wheat production as well
- Not optimal since it hurts me too

**Option 2: Move robber to (-1, 0, 1) - Wood (4)**
- This blocks a 4-value Wood hex
- RED has one settlement here, and I have one settlement here
- Would block my own Wood production
- Not optimal since it hurts me too and Wood isn't RED's strongest resource

**Option 3: Move robber to (-1, 1, 0) - Sheep (9)**
- This blocks a 9-value Sheep hex
- RED has one settlement here, and I have one settlement here
- Would block my own Sheep production
- Not optimal since I already have 4 Sheep and would be hurting myself

**Option 4: Move robber to (0, 1, -1) - Wheat (10)**
- This blocks a 10-value Wheat hex
- RED has one settlement here
- 10 is a less frequent roll than 8

**Option 5: Move robber to (1, 0, -1) - Desert**
- This places the robber on the desert
- No production impact on anyone
- Wastes the robber move completely

## Strategic Decision

The most effective robber placement would disrupt my opponent's key resource production without affecting my own. Looking at RED's settlements, they have strong production on the Ore hex with an 8 (highest probability along with 6). By placing the robber there, I can significantly hamper RED's ability to build cities or buy development cards, while also getting to steal a card from them.

<plan>
1. Block RED's Ore production to slow their development
2. Focus on acquiring Brick and Wheat through trades or production
3. Continue building roads toward good settlement locations
4. Target Ore and Wheat production for city upgrades
5. Consider buying development cards if excess Sheep continues
</plan>

Option 0 is clearly the strongest strategic move as it blocks RED's best resource (Ore on an 8) without disrupting any of my own production.

# Game Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state and available actions:

## Current Position
- We have 3 VP from 3 settlements
- We have 1 🌲WOOD, 4 🐑SHEEP, 1 ⛏️ORE
- RED has 2 settlements (2 VP)
- We have no cities and no development cards
- Our production is spread across all resources except wheat

## Resource Analysis
- We lack wheat completely, which is essential for both settlements and cities
- We have excess sheep (4)
- We need brick for expansion (roads and settlements)
- We have some wood and ore, but not enough for significant building

## Available Actions
0. End turn
1-4. Trade 4 sheep for another resource (wood, brick, ore, or wheat)

## Strategic Considerations
Since we have 4 sheep, we can make one 4:1 trade with the bank. The question is which resource to acquire.

Looking at potential builds:
- Road (1 wood + 1 brick) - We have 1 wood but no brick
- Settlement (1 wood + 1 brick + 1 sheep + 1 wheat) - We have wood and sheep but no brick or wheat
- City (2 wheat + 3 ore) - We have 1 ore but no wheat
- Development card (1 sheep + 1 wheat + 1 ore) - We have sheep and ore but no wheat

We're limited by multiple resources, but given our excess sheep, we should trade for what will help us most in the near term.

Looking at our production:
- We have producers for sheep (9), wood (4), brick (3), and ore (8)
- We're completely missing wheat production

The robber is currently on the ore hex, blocking our ore production. However, since RED also produces from this hex, it may be moved soon.

<plan>
1. Trade for wheat since we don't produce it at all
2. Try to build towards a wheat hex or port
3. Focus next on getting resources for a settlement to diversify production
4. Consider development cards as an alternate path to VPs
</plan>

Given these considerations, I'll trade my sheep for wheat, as it's a resource we completely lack production for and it's essential for both settlements and development cards.

- Place roads pointing toward valuable future expansion spots, not toward the center
- Consider the long-term impact: settlements that can't expand are less valuable

MID-GAME RESOURCE PRIORITIES:
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each possible build (cities: 1VP for 5 resources is most efficient)
- Early phase: Secure at least one good source of brick and wood for minimal expansion
- Growth phase: Prioritize ore and wheat production for city upgrades (3VP for 5 resources is optimal)
- Late phase: Focus on the fastest path to victory points, whether through buildings or development cards
- Avoid trading resources that opponents need for immediate victory point gains
- Use 4:1 trades only when necessary; prioritize port usage when possible

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and limited expansion options
- If you get an early knight, save it for defense or until you can start building toward largest army
- Time monopoly card usage for when opponents likely have accumulated specific resources
- Save year of plenty cards for completing crucial builds when you're short 1-2 specific resources
- Development cards are most valuable when:
  * You need hidden victory points to surprise opponents
  * You need knights to break up longest road or secure largest army
  * You're lacking wood/brick for expansion but have plenty of sheep/wheat/ore

EXPANSION STRATEGY:
- Build roads only with clear settlement locations in mind
- Target settlements that give you access to ports or new resources
- Block opponents' expansion paths when it gives you a strategic advantage
- Consider the timing of expansion vs. city upgrades based on your resource production
- Calculate whether longest road is achievable and worth the resource investment
- When deciding between a new settlement and a city upgrade, compare immediate vs. long-term returns

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-probability hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Save knight cards for breaking up opponent strategies or securing largest army
- Use knights defensively if you're producing valuable resources on high-probability hexes

TRADING TACTICS:
- Avoid trading resources that directly help opponents score points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades
- Trade excess resources before rolling 7 if you have more than 7 cards
- Consider bank/port trades when they enable an immediate build that advances your strategy
- When trading with players, try to receive resources that complete a build

ENDGAME STRATEGY:
- In the late game, hide your victory point potential (keep development cards hidden)
- Calculate the fastest path to 10 VP and focus exclusively on that path
- Be aware of the exact number of remaining development cards and their probabilities
- Track opponents' potential victory points, including hidden development cards
- If you're close to winning, prioritize actions that can be completed in a single turn

Before finalizing your action, check:
1. Is there a more efficient path to victory points?
2. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
3. Does this move help or hinder opponents?
4. Is there a defensive move needed to prevent an opponent from winning?
5. Are you properly diversified against dice probability?

# Game Analysis for Turn 39 as Blue Player

Let me analyze the current game state and available options:

## Current Resources
- 2 Wood, 1 Sheep, 2 Wheat, 1 Ore
- No development cards

## Victory Point Status
- Blue: 3/10 points (3 settlements)
- Red: 2/10 points (2 settlements)

## Production Assessment
I'm producing:
- Ore: 8 (⭐⭐⭐) at node 1
- Brick: 3 (⭐) at nodes 1 and 9
- Wood: 4 (⭐) at node 15
- Sheep: 9 (⭐⭐) at node 15
- Wheat: 5 (⭐⭐) at node 9

So I have access to all resources, but wheat production is limited to one hex.

## Available Actions
1. Buy a development card (1 Sheep, 1 Wheat, 1 Ore)
2. End my turn

## Decision Analysis

Buying a development card would cost my 1 Sheep, 1 Wheat, and 1 Ore. This would leave me with just 2 Wood and 1 Wheat.

Benefits of buying a dev card:
- 25% chance of a Victory Point card (immediate hidden progress)
- Knight cards help toward Largest Army (2 VP)
- Monopoly/Year of Plenty/Road Building can provide tactical advantages

I currently have a 4-segment road network, getting closer to Longest Road (2 VP). However, I don't have the brick and wood needed to extend it this turn.

Looking at my current plan, I was aiming to trade for wheat since that seemed to be a limitation, but I actually have 2 wheat now. This gives me the opportunity to invest in a development card, which could potentially give me a direct VP or help toward Largest Army.

<plan>
1. Buy a development card this turn to potentially gain direct VP or knight
2. Next turn, focus on extending roads toward good settlement locations
3. Build another settlement when possible to further diversify production
4. Work toward city upgrades or largest army depending on dev card results
</plan>

With the updated plan in mind, buying a development card is the optimal move. It advances me toward victory while using resources I currently have available.

# Game State Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state for Blue Player:

**Resources:**
- 2 Wood
- 2 Wheat
- No Brick, Sheep or Ore

**Development Cards:**
- 1 Road Building card

**Victory Points:** 3/10

**Current Production:**
- Node 1: Ore (8★★★), Brick (3★)
- Node 15: Wood (4★), Sheep (9★★)
- Node 9: Brick (3★), Wheat (5★★)

## Option 0: Play Road Building Card
If I play the Road Building card, I can build two free roads without needing brick and wood. This would extend my road network and potentially set up future settlements. With 5 roads already built (longest is 4), I could strengthen my position for longest road.

## Option 1: Roll the Dice
If I roll the dice, I might get additional resources that could enable building a development card or other structures. However:
- I currently lack Ore and Sheep for development cards
- I lack Brick to build roads without the development card
- I can't build settlements without expanding my road network first
- I don't have enough resources for a city (3 Ore + 2 Wheat)

## Strategic Considerations

1. **Road Building Value:** The Road Building card is most valuable when I need roads but lack brick/wood resources. This is exactly my current situation.

2. **Position for Expansion:** Looking at my current settlements and road network, building two roads would significantly advance my expansion capability.

3. **Longest Road Potential:** With 5 roads currently and the ability to add 2 more, I could have 7 roads total, potentially setting up for longest road (2 VP) in the future.

4. **Resource Scarcity:** Brick appears limited on the board (only on a 3 hex), making the Road Building card particularly valuable.

## Decision

The Road Building card will give me immediate strategic advantages that rolling first cannot match. By playing it now, I can position myself for future settlements without needing to collect brick resources, which appear scarce on this board.

<plan>
1. Play Road Building card to extend toward promising settlement locations
2. On future turns, focus on gaining resources for either settlements or development cards
3. Work toward securing longest road (7+ segments) for 2 VP
4. Balance between expansion and upgrading to cities based on resource production

# Game State Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state thoroughly to choose the optimal road building location.

## Current Resources and VP Status
- I have 3 VP from 3 settlements
- I have 2 wood and 2 wheat (insufficient for building settlements or cities)
- I apparently just played a Road Building development card
- I already have 5 roads built with a current longest road of 4 segments
- No player has the Longest Road bonus yet (requires 5+ segments)

## Settlement Locations Analysis
I currently have settlements at:
- Node 1: Produces ore (8), brick (3)
- Node 15: Produces wood (4), sheep (9)
- Node 9: Produces brick (3), wheat (5)

## Strategic Goal Assessment
Looking at my current plan, I want to:
1. Use Road Building to extend toward promising settlement locations
2. Work toward securing longest road (7+ segments) for 2 VP
3. Balance expansion and city upgrades

## Road Building Options Analysis
I need to evaluate which road locations will:
- Help me secure Longest Road (increase my road length to 5+)
- Open up valuable settlement spots
- Block opponent expansion

Let me examine each option carefully:

[0] Edge (0, 1): Extends toward the desert tile, limited expansion value
[1] Edge (11, 12): Connects toward wheat (5) tile
[2] Edge (4, 15): Connects from my settlement at node 15
[3] Edge (8, 9): Connects to my settlement at node 9
[4] Edge (1, 6): Extends from my settlement at node 1
[5] Edge (17, 18): Extends around the sheep (9) tile
[6] Edge (14, 15): Connects to my settlement at node 15

I need to determine which options continue my existing road network to create a longer continuous path that also leads to viable settlement locations.

Since I've already played the Road Building card, I can place TWO roads this turn. The best strategy would be to place roads that both extend my current longest road and open up new settlement locations.

Without seeing the complete road map, I infer that options [2] and [6] both connect to my settlement at node 15, which would allow me to extend in that direction. This could potentially increase my longest road to 5+ segments, securing the Longest Road bonus for 2 VP.

<plan>
1. Use Road Building to place two roads that extend my longest connected path to 6 segments
2. Aim to secure Longest Road bonus (2 VP) on this turn
3. Focus on gaining resources for settlements at newly accessible nodes
4. Eventually upgrade settlements to cities, prioritizing those with high-probability numbers
</plan>

Based on the options available and my goal to secure Longest Road, I believe the best choice is:

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL SETTLEMENT PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Place settlements on high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Target at least one spot with good ore and wheat production for city development
- Try to secure at least one high-probability spot (5, 6, 8, 9) for each critical resource
- Place your second settlement to complement your first (fill resource gaps)
- Aim for access to all five resources or position near useful ports if resource diversity isn't possible
- Always consider which settlements opponents are likely to place and avoid areas that will become contested
- Place roads pointing toward valuable future expansion spots, not toward the center
- Consider the long-term impact: settlements that can't expand are less valuable

MID-GAME RESOURCE PRIORITIES:
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each possible build (cities: 1VP for 5 resources is most efficient)
- Early phase: Secure at least one good source of brick and wood for minimal expansion
- Growth phase: Prioritize ore and wheat production for city upgrades (3VP for 5 resources is optimal)
- Late phase: Focus on the fastest path to victory points, whether through buildings or development cards
- Avoid trading resources that opponents need for immediate victory point gains
- Use 4:1 trades only when necessary; prioritize port usage when possible

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and limited expansion options
- If you get an early knight, save it for defense or until you can start building toward largest army
- Time monopoly card usage for when opponents likely have accumulated specific resources
- Save year of plenty cards for completing crucial builds when you're short 1-2 specific resources
- Development cards are most valuable when:
  * You need hidden victory points to surprise opponents
  * You need knights to break up longest road or secure largest army
  * You're lacking wood/brick for expansion but have plenty of sheep/wheat/ore

EXPANSION STRATEGY:
- Build roads only with clear settlement locations in mind
- Target settlements that give you access to ports or new resources
- Block opponents' expansion paths when it gives you a strategic advantage
- Consider the timing of expansion vs. city upgrades based on your resource production
- Calculate whether longest road is achievable and worth the resource investment
- When deciding between a new settlement and a city upgrade, compare immediate vs. long-term returns

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-probability hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Save knight cards for breaking up opponent strategies or securing largest army
- Use knights defensively if you're producing valuable resources on high-probability hexes

TRADING TACTICS:
- Avoid trading resources that directly help opponents score points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades
- Trade excess resources before rolling 7 if you have more than 7 cards
- Consider bank/port trades when they enable an immediate build that advances your strategy
- When trading with players, try to receive resources that complete a build

ENDGAME STRATEGY:
- In the late game, hide your victory point potential (keep development cards hidden)
- Calculate the fastest path to 10 VP and focus exclusively on that path
- Be aware of the exact number of remaining development cards and their probabilities
- Track opponents' potential victory points, including hidden development cards
- If you're close to winning, prioritize actions that can be completed in a single turn

Before finalizing your action, check:
1. Is there a more efficient path to victory points?
2. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
3. Does this move help or hinder opponents?
4. Is there a defensive move needed to prevent an opponent from winning?
5. Are you properly diversified against dice probability?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game Analysis: BLUE Player Turn

Let me analyze the current game state and available options to make the optimal decision.

## Current Situation Assessment
- I have 3 settlements (3 VPs) and 6 roads built (longest connected path is 4)
- I have 2 wood and 2 wheat in my hand
- I just played a Road Building card, allowing me to place 2 free roads
- RED has 2 VPs and 3 roads with longest path of 2
- No one has Longest Road bonus yet (need 5+ connected roads)

## My Resources
- Current: 2 wood, 2 wheat
- Production: wood (node 15), wheat (node 9), ore (node 1), brick (nodes 1 and 9), sheep (node 15)
- Missing resources for immediate builds: I need brick for roads

## Road Building Strategic Analysis
I need to select 2 edges to build my free roads. My objective is to extend my longest connected path to 6+ segments to secure Longest Road (2 VPs).

Looking at the available options:
- [0] Build at edge (0, 1) - This doesn't extend my longest path
- [1] Build at edge (3, 4) - This may extend my network but not my longest path
- [2] Build at edge (11, 12) - This connects to node 12, may extend longest path
- [3] Build at edge (4, 5) - This may extend my longest path if connected
- [4] Build at edge (8, 9) - This connects to my settlement at node 9
- [5] Build at edge (1, 6) - This connects to my settlement at node 1
- [6] Build at edge (17, 18) - This doesn't seem to extend my longest path
- [7] Build at edge (14, 15) - This connects to my settlement at node 15

Without seeing a complete map of all my road connections, I need to carefully consider which two road placements would maximize my connected path length.

Given my current plan to secure Longest Road bonus, and since I have a settlement at node 15, building at edge (14, 15) [option 7] would likely extend my path from that settlement. Additionally, building at edge (11, 12) [option 2] might connect my network through node 12.

<plan>
1. Use Road Building to place two roads at edges (14, 15) and (11, 12) to extend my longest connected path to 6 segments
2. Secure Longest Road bonus (2 VP) to reach 5 total VPs
3. Continue gathering resources for settlements at newly accessible nodes
4. Eventually upgrade high-production settlements to cities
</plan>

Based on the available information and my goal of extending my longest road, I'll select option [7] to build at edge (14, 15), which connects to my settlement at node 15.

RESPONSE:
I'll analyze the current game state and determine the best robber placement to maximize my chances of winning.

First, let me assess the situation:
- I'm playing as BLUE with 3 VP (need 7 more to win)
- RED has 2 VP and 7 cards in hand (this is significant - they likely have resources for building)
- The robber is currently on the ⛏️8 hex (0,0,0), which is a high-probability hex
- I have 2 wood and 2 wheat resources
- My current plan involves using Road Building to extend my longest road

Let me analyze each robber placement option:

[0] Move robber to (1, -1, 0) - This is a brick hex with number 3
- This blocks RED's settlement at node 3 from producing brick
- But it's a low probability (3) hex and I can't steal from anyone

[1] Move robber to (0, -1, 1) and steal from RED - This is a wheat hex with number 5
- This blocks wheat production for both RED (node 3) and myself (node 9)
- Medium probability (5) hex
- I would steal from RED, but I already have wheat

[2] Move robber to (-1, 0, 1) and steal from RED - This is a wood hex with number 4
- This blocks wood production for both RED (node 3) and myself (node 15)
- Low-medium probability (4) hex
- I would steal from RED, and I might need more wood for my road strategy

[3] Move robber to (-1, 1, 0) and steal from RED - This is a sheep hex with number 9
- This blocks sheep production for RED (node 5) and myself (node 15)
- Medium probability (9) hex
- I would steal from RED, and sheep could be useful for development cards

[4] Move robber to (0, 1, -1) and steal from RED - This is a wheat hex with number 10
- This blocks wheat production for RED (node 5) only
- Low probability (10) hex
- I would steal from RED, and I already have wheat

[5] Move robber to (1, 0, -1) - This is a desert hex
- This is pointless as the desert produces nothing
- I can't steal from anyone

Strategic considerations:
1. RED has 7 cards, which is dangerous for me - they likely can build something significant
2. I should prioritize stealing from RED to disrupt their plans
3. I should target high-probability hexes that affect RED more than me
4. Since I'm focused on roads, I should avoid blocking my own wood production if possible

Looking at RED's settlements, they have strong ore production from the 8 hex, which I'm already blocking with the robber. Their other key production is wheat from the 5 hex and sheep from the 9 hex.

Option [3] (move to sheep 9 hex) has several advantages:
- It blocks a good production hex for RED (medium probability)
- It allows me to steal from RED, potentially disrupting their plans
- Sheep are valuable for development cards, which RED might be saving for
- While it affects my settlement at node 15, I can still get wood from that settlement which is crucial for my road strategy

<plan>
1. Move robber to the sheep hex (-1, 1, 0) and steal from RED to disrupt their plans
2. Use Road Building to place two roads at edges (14, 15) and (11, 12) to extend longest road
3. Secure Longest Road bonus (2 VP) to reach 5 total VPs
4. Continue gathering resources for settlements at newly accessible nodes
5. Eventually upgrade high-production settlements to cities

- Block opponents' expansion paths when it gives you a strategic advantage
- Consider the timing of expansion vs. city upgrades based on your resource production
- Calculate whether longest road is achievable and worth the resource investment
- When deciding between a new settlement and a city upgrade, compare immediate vs. long-term returns

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-probability hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Save knight cards for breaking up opponent strategies or securing largest army
- Use knights defensively if you're producing valuable resources on high-probability hexes

TRADING TACTICS:
- Avoid trading resources that directly help opponents score points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades
- Trade excess resources before rolling 7 if you have more than 7 cards
- Consider bank/port trades when they enable an immediate build that advances your strategy
- When trading with players, try to receive resources that complete a build

ENDGAME STRATEGY:
- In the late game, hide your victory point potential (keep development cards hidden)
- Calculate the fastest path to 10 VP and focus exclusively on that path
- Be aware of the exact number of remaining development cards and their probabilities
- Track opponents' potential victory points, including hidden development cards
- If you're close to winning, prioritize actions that can be completed in a single turn

Before finalizing your action, check:
1. Is there a more efficient path to victory points?
2. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
3. Does this move help or hinder opponents?
4. Is there a defensive move needed to prevent an opponent from winning?
5. Are you properly diversified against dice probability?

# Game Analysis for Settlers of Catan

I need to analyze my current position and available actions to determine the optimal move.

## Current Game State Assessment
- I have 3 VP from my 3 settlements
- Resources: 1 wood, 4 wheat, 2 ore
- I've already played a Road Building card this turn
- Robber is on brick hex (1,-1,0), limiting Red's and my brick production
- Red has 9 hidden cards - a significant hand that could lead to major development
- Red has 3 VP (1 settlement, 1 city)
- Neither player has Longest Road or Largest Army

## Available Actions
- [0] End turn
- [1-4] Trade 4 wheat for various resources (wood, brick, ore, or sheep)

## Strategic Considerations

First, I need to consider my current plan:
1. I've already played Road Building this turn
2. The plan mentioned moving the robber to the sheep hex, but that's not listed in my available actions
3. I likely already built roads this turn with the Road Building card

Since the robber move isn't listed as an available option, I must have already done that part of my plan. The available actions suggest I'm at the end of my turn with the option to make maritime trades.

Looking at my resources (1 wood, 4 wheat, 2 ore), I should consider:
- What do I need for my next strategic build?
- Should I convert excess wheat now or save it?

For my next build:
- Settlement = 1 wood + 1 brick + 1 wheat + 1 sheep
- City = 2 wheat + 3 ore
- Road = 1 wood + 1 brick

Based on my current resources (1 wood, 4 wheat, 2 ore), I'm closest to building a city (need 1 more ore). I can't build a settlement without brick and sheep, and can't build a road without brick.

I could trade 4 wheat for 1 brick [2] to potentially build a road next turn (since I already have 1 wood). However, this leaves me with no wheat for other builds.

Given that Red has 9 cards, they might be poised for significant development. Rather than making an inefficient 4:1 trade, it would be wiser to save my resources and end my turn [0]. This keeps my options open for next turn when I might roll better resources or have more efficient trades available.

<plan>
1. End turn to avoid inefficient trades
2. On next turn, focus on disrupting Red who has accumulated 9 cards
3. Continue gathering resources for either:
   a) City upgrade (need 1 more ore) or
   b) Settlement placement (need brick and sheep)
4. Maintain focus on extending roads to secure Longest Road
</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL SETTLEMENT PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Place settlements on high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Target at least one spot with good ore and wheat production for city development
- Try to secure at least one high-probability spot (5, 6, 8, 9) for each critical resource
- Place your second settlement to complement your first (fill resource gaps)
- Aim for access to all five resources or position near useful ports if resource diversity isn't possible
- Always consider which settlements opponents are likely to place and avoid areas that will become contested
- Place roads pointing toward valuable future expansion spots, not toward the center
- Consider the long-term impact: settlements that can't expand are less valuable

MID-GAME RESOURCE PRIORITIES:
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each possible build (cities: 1VP for 5 resources is most efficient)
- Early phase: Secure at least one good source of brick and wood for minimal expansion
- Growth phase: Prioritize ore and wheat production for city upgrades (3VP for 5 resources is optimal)
- Late phase: Focus on the fastest path to victory points, whether through buildings or development cards
- Avoid trading resources that opponents need for immediate victory point gains
- Use 4:1 trades only when necessary; prioritize port usage when possible

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and limited expansion options
- If you get an early knight, save it for defense or until you can start building toward largest army
- Time monopoly card usage for when opponents likely have accumulated specific resources
- Save year of plenty cards for completing crucial builds when you're short 1-2 specific resources
- Development cards are most valuable when:
  * You need hidden victory points to surprise opponents
  * You need knights to break up longest road or secure largest army
  * You're lacking wood/brick for expansion but have plenty of sheep/wheat/ore

EXPANSION STRATEGY:
- Build roads only with clear settlement locations in mind
- Target settlements that give you access to ports or new resources
- Block opponents' expansion paths when it gives you a strategic advantage
- Consider the timing of expansion vs. city upgrades based on your resource production
- Calculate whether longest road is achievable and worth the resource investment
- When deciding between a new settlement and a city upgrade, compare immediate vs. long-term returns

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-probability hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Save knight cards for breaking up opponent strategies or securing largest army
- Use knights defensively if you're producing valuable resources on high-probability hexes

TRADING TACTICS:
- Avoid trading resources that directly help opponents score points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades
- Trade excess resources before rolling 7 if you have more than 7 cards
- Consider bank/port trades when they enable an immediate build that advances your strategy
- When trading with players, try to receive resources that complete a build

ENDGAME STRATEGY:
- In the late game, hide your victory point potential (keep development cards hidden)
- Calculate the fastest path to 10 VP and focus exclusively on that path

# Game Analysis for Turn 51

I'll analyze the current game state and available options to determine the best action.

## Current Position Assessment
- I have 3 VP from 3 settlements (no cities yet)
- My resources: 1 wood, 2 sheep, 4 wheat, 2 ore
- Red has 4 VP (2 cities) and 7 hidden cards
- The robber is on the brick hex (1,-1,0), blocking brick production
- I have the longest continuous road at 4 segments, but not enough for Longest Road bonus

## Resource Analysis
- I need 3 ore + 2 wheat to upgrade a settlement to a city (+1 VP)
- I need 1 brick + 1 wood + 1 sheep + 1 wheat for a new settlement (+1 VP)
- I need 1 wood + 1 brick for a new road

## Available Actions Evaluation:

0. **End Turn**:
   - Pro: Save resources for next turn when I might have better options
   - Con: No immediate progress toward victory

1. **Buy Development Card** (1 sheep, 1 wheat, 1 ore):
   - Pro: Could get a VP card, Knight (for defense/Largest Army), or utility card
   - Pro: Hidden VP and strategic flexibility
   - Pro: Uses my excess wheat efficiently
   - Con: Random outcome

2-5. **Trade port** (Give 4 wheat for various resources):
   - Very inefficient 4:1 trade with only a single resource gained
   - I would be left with 0 wheat which is needed for most builds
   - Even after trading, I wouldn't have enough resources for any build

## Strategic Decision:
Looking at my position, I need to evaluate my immediate options vs. long-term strategy:

1. I'm short on ore for a city upgrade (need 1 more)
2. I'm missing brick for road building and settlement expansion
3. Red has 7 cards, suggesting they're building toward something significant

The development card option is interesting because:
- It could give me a hidden VP (25% chance)
- A knight would let me move the robber off the brick hex
- Road building/monopoly/year of plenty could help my expansion

Given my current resources and the game state, buying a development card is the most efficient use of my resources. It gets me closer to potential VP while still keeping me flexible.

<plan>
1. Buy a development card to potentially gain VP or useful action
2. Next turn, focus on acquiring brick to continue expansion
3. Position for Longest Road bonus (I already have 4 segments)
4. Watch Red closely as they may be close to another build with 7 cards
</plan>

## Current Position
- I have 3 VP from my 3 settlements + 1 hidden Victory Point card = 4 VP total
- Resources: 1 wood, 1 sheep, 3 wheat, 1 ore
- No longest road or largest army bonus yet
- I have 4 road segments for potential longest road (need 5 segments minimum)
- Red has 4 VP (2 cities) and 7 hidden cards

## Available Actions
1. [1] Buy a development card (costs 1 sheep, 1 wheat, 1 ore)
2. [0] End turn

## Analysis of Action 1: Buy Development Card
- Benefits:
  - Potential for Victory Point card (immediate +1 VP)
  - Knight card (defense + works toward largest army)
  - Monopoly or Year of Plenty can help with resource collection
  - Reduces hand size to avoid robber loss
- Costs: 1 sheep, 1 wheat, 1 ore
- What remains: 1 wood, 2 wheat (not enough for any other builds)

## Analysis of Action 0: End Turn
- I keep all my resources for next turn
- But there's no clear benefit to saving these specific resources
- Red might place the robber on my hexes if they roll a 7 next turn

## Strategic Considerations
1. I need 6 more VP to win
2. Red has 7 cards and may be planning a significant build
3. I have no brick to expand my road network toward the longest road
4. Development cards offer hidden VP potential and strategic options

<plan>
1. Buy a development card to potentially gain VP or knight
2. On next turn, focus on acquiring brick to continue expansion for longest road
3. If I get a knight, save it to protect high-value hexes or work toward largest army
4. Continue watching Red closely as they have many resources
</plan>

Given the analysis, buying a development card is the optimal move. It provides multiple potential benefits including possible victory points, reduces vulnerability to the robber, and maintains strategic flexibility while I work toward other resources.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL SETTLEMENT PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Place settlements on high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Target at least one spot with good ore and wheat production for city development
- Try to secure at least one high-probability spot (5, 6, 8, 9) for each critical resource
- Place your second settlement to complement your first (fill resource gaps)
- Aim for access to all five resources or position near useful ports if resource diversity isn't possible
- Always consider which settlements opponents are likely to place and avoid areas that will become contested
- Place roads pointing toward valuable future expansion spots, not toward the center
- Consider the long-term impact: settlements that can't expand are less valuable

MID-GAME RESOURCE PRIORITIES:
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each possible build (cities: 1VP for 5 resources is most efficient)
- Early phase: Secure at least one good source of brick and wood for minimal expansion
- Growth phase: Prioritize ore and wheat production for city upgrades (3VP for 5 resources is optimal)
- Late phase: Focus on the fastest path to victory points, whether through buildings or development cards
- Avoid trading resources that opponents need for immediate victory point gains
- Use 4:1 trades only when necessary; prioritize port usage when possible

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and limited expansion options
- If you get an early knight, save it for defense or until you can start building toward largest army
- Time monopoly card usage for when opponents likely have accumulated specific resources
- Save year of plenty cards for completing crucial builds when you're short 1-2 specific resources
- Development cards are most valuable when:
  * You need hidden victory points to surprise opponents
  * You need knights to break up longest road or secure largest army
  * You're lacking wood/brick for expansion but have plenty of sheep/wheat/ore

EXPANSION STRATEGY:
- Build roads only with clear settlement locations in mind
- Target settlements that give you access to ports or new resources
- Block opponents' expansion paths when it gives you a strategic advantage
- Consider the timing of expansion vs. city upgrades based on your resource production
- Calculate whether longest road is achievable and worth the resource investment
- When deciding between a new settlement and a city upgrade, compare immediate vs. long-term returns

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-probability hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Save knight cards for breaking up opponent strategies or securing largest army
- Use knights defensively if you're producing valuable resources on high-probability hexes

TRADING TACTICS:
- Avoid trading resources that directly help opponents score points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades
- Trade excess resources before rolling 7 if you have more than 7 cards
- Consider bank/port trades when they enable an immediate build that advances your strategy
- When trading with players, try to receive resources that complete a build

ENDGAME STRATEGY:
- In the late game, hide your victory point potential (keep development cards hidden)
- Calculate the fastest path to 10 VP and focus exclusively on that path
- Be aware of the exact number of remaining development cards and their probabilities
- Track opponents' potential victory points, including hidden development cards
- If you're close to winning, prioritize actions that can be completed in a single turn

Before finalizing your action, check:
1. Is there a more efficient path to victory points?
2. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
3. Does this move help or hinder opponents?
4. Is there a defensive move needed to prevent an opponent from winning?
5. Are you properly diversified against dice probability?

- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game State Analysis

**Victory Points**:
- I have 3/10 VP (3 settlements + 1 hidden victory point card = 4 actual VP)
- Red has 4/10 VP (2 cities = 4 VP)
- Red is ahead but only by 1 visible victory point

**Resources**: 
- I have 1 wood and 2 wheat
- With these resources, I cannot build anything yet (settlement needs brick+wood+wheat+sheep, city needs 3 ore+2 wheat, development card needs ore+wheat+sheep)

**Development Cards**:
- I have 1 Knight card and 1 Victory Point card
- I previously played a Road Building card

**Special Achievements**:
- No one has Longest Road (my longest is 4 segments, need 5 for the bonus)
- No one has Largest Army (need 3 knights)

**Board Position**:
- The robber is on brick (1,-1,0) with a roll of 3 (low probability)
- My settlements are positioned on brick, wheat, wood, sheep, and ore
- Red has strong ore and wheat production via two cities

# Strategic Options

**Option 0: Play Knight Card**
- Benefits:
  - Move the robber from the brick hex (currently blocking a low-probability 3)
  - Could place it on Red's high-value ore hex (rolled on 8)
  - Steal one of Red's 4 resources
  - Get 1/3 knight cards toward Largest Army (2 VP)
- Drawbacks:
  - Reveals my knight, eliminating surprise factor
  - Uses a defensive tool I might need later

**Option 1: Roll the Dice**
- Benefits:
  - Could get resources I need for building
  - Keeps my knight card hidden for future tactical use
  - Maintains strategic flexibility
- Drawbacks:
  - Risk of rolling a 7 (losing resources if Red has >7 cards)
  - The robber stays on brick (though it's only blocking a 3)

# Decision Making

The robber is currently on a brick hex with a low probability (3). Moving it would have minimal impact on increasing my resource production. 

Playing the knight now would let me target Red's ore hex (8) which is their highest production, and get 1/3 of the way toward largest army. However, I don't yet have enough knights to make meaningful progress toward largest army.

My current resources (1 wood, 2 wheat) aren't close to any build, so I need more resources from rolling. If I roll well, I can potentially build something this turn or be closer to a build.

Given that:
1. I'm not in immediate danger of losing
2. I need more resources regardless of my next build
3. The robber is on a low-probability hex anyway
4. It's better to save the knight for when I'm closer to largest army or when a high-value hex of mine is blocked

<plan>
1. Roll the dice to gather more resources
2. Save the knight card for when it can be more strategically impactful
3. Focus on either getting brick to build roads toward longest road (need 5 roads total), or getting ore/sheep to buy a development card
4. Continue working toward largest road bonus (2 VP) which would put me ahead of Red
</plan>

I'll choose to roll the dice.

# Game Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state to determine the optimal action:

## Current Game State
- I (BLUE) have 3 victory points, RED has 4 VP
- I have 1 hidden VP from a development card, so effectively I have 4 VP
- I have 1 wood, 2 wheat, and 1 knight card
- I have 7 roads built with a longest road of 4 segments
- The robber is currently on the brick hex, which is one of my resource producers

## Resource Production Analysis
I produce from:
- Node 1: Ore (8) and Brick (3)
- Node 15: Wood (4) and Sheep (9)
- Node 9: Brick (3) and Wheat (5)

The robber is currently on my Brick hex, limiting my brick production.

## Path to Victory
To reach 10 VP, I need 6 more points (considering my hidden VP). Options:
- Longest road bonus (2 VP): I have 4 connected roads, need 5 for the bonus
- Largest army (2 VP): I have 1 knight, need 2 more for the bonus
- Build 2 settlements (2 VP)
- Upgrade 3 settlements to cities (6 VP)
- Get more VP development cards

## Decision Analysis

Action 0: Play Knight card
- Pros:
  * Move robber off my brick hex, allowing me to produce brick again
  * Steal a resource from RED, who has 6 cards
  * Make progress toward largest army (currently 0/3 knights played)
- Cons:
  * Using the knight now leaves me defenseless if the robber gets placed back on my hexes

Action 1: End my turn
- Pros:
  * Save knight for potentially more strategic moment
  * Next turn I'll roll and might get resources to build something
- Cons:
  * Robber stays on my brick hex, limiting my production
  * No immediate progress toward victory points
  * RED gets to play their turn without disruption

<plan>
1. Play knight card to move robber off my brick hex and onto RED's high-producing ore hex
2. Next turn focus on building roads toward longest road (need 1 more connected road)
3. Work toward city upgrades (need ore/wheat) or additional settlements
4. Consider buying more development cards if I get ore/wheat/sheep
</plan>

Given the current situation, playing the knight card is most valuable now because:
1. Moving the robber off my brick hex is crucial for production
2. RED has many resources to steal from
3. Beginning my path toward largest army
4. RED is ahead in points, so disrupting their production is strategic

# Game Analysis: Move Robber Decision

I need to decide where to place the robber to maximize my chances of winning. Let me analyze each option carefully.

## Current Game State
- I (BLUE) have 3 VP: 3 settlements (3 VP) + 1 hidden VP card = 4 VP total
- RED has 4 VP with 2 cities
- I have 1 wood and 2 wheat, which isn't enough for any immediate builds
- The robber is currently on RED's brick hex (1, -1, 0) with a roll value of 3

## Robber Options Analysis

**Option 0: Move to (0, 0, 0) - Ore with value 8**
- This is RED's highest production hex with a value of 8
- RED has two cities on this hex (nodes 3 and 5), so it's extremely productive for them
- I have one settlement on this hex (node 1), so this would block my own production
- Verdict: Very strong against RED but hurts me too

**Option 1: Move to (0, -1, 1) - Wheat with value 5**
- This targets RED's city at node 3 (moderate production)
- Also blocks my settlement at node 9
- Verdict: Hurts both RED and me

**Option 2: Move to (-1, 0, 1) - Wood with value 4**
- This targets RED's city at node 3 and my settlement at node 15
- Low production value (4)
- Verdict: Minimal impact overall

**Option 3: Move to (-1, 1, 0) - Sheep with value 9**
- This targets RED's city at node 5 (good production)
- Also blocks my settlement at node 15
- Verdict: Good against RED but hurts me too

**Option 4: Move to (0, 1, -1) - Wheat with value 10**
- This targets RED's city at node 5
- Lower probability (10 has fewer rolls than 8 or 9)
- Doesn't impact any of my settlements
- Verdict: Decent option against RED without harming me

**Option 5: Move to (1, 0, -1) - Desert**
- This is already non-productive, so placing robber here is wasted
- Verdict: Ineffective move

## Strategic Considerations
- RED is ahead by 1 point and has high production on the 8-value ore hex
- Blocking RED's most productive hex (ore) would significantly slow their progress
- I need to consider that I also get ore from the same hex, but RED gets 3x as much (2 cities vs my 1 settlement)
- I need to steal a card from RED to potentially help with my next build

## Decision
Since RED is ahead and has dominant ore production, I should target their ore production. Although this will also block my own ore production, the impact is much greater on RED than on me (blocking 2 city-level production vs my 1 settlement-level). Additionally, stealing a card from RED could give me a needed resource.

<plan>
1. Move robber to ore hex (0, 0, 0) to block RED's highest production and steal a card
2. Focus on building roads toward longest road (need 3 more connected roads)
3. If I get brick/wood, expand my road network; if I get ore/wheat, save for city upgrade
4. Consider more development cards if I get ore/wheat/sheep combination
</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL SETTLEMENT PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Place settlements on high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Target at least one spot with good ore and wheat production for city development
- Try to secure at least one high-probability spot (5, 6, 8, 9) for each critical resource
- Place your second settlement to complement your first (fill resource gaps)
- Aim for access to all five resources or position near useful ports if resource diversity isn't possible
- Always consider which settlements opponents are likely to place and avoid areas that will become contested
- Place roads pointing toward valuable future expansion spots, not toward the center
- Consider the long-term impact: settlements that can't expand are less valuable

MID-GAME RESOURCE PRIORITIES:
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each possible build (cities: 1VP for 5 resources is most efficient)
- Early phase: Secure at least one good source of brick and wood for minimal expansion
- Growth phase: Prioritize ore and wheat production for city upgrades (3VP for 5 resources is optimal)
- Late phase: Focus on the fastest path to victory points, whether through buildings or development cards
- Avoid trading resources that opponents need for immediate victory point gains
- Use 4:1 trades only when necessary; prioritize port usage when possible

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and limited expansion options
- If you get an early knight, save it for defense or until you can start building toward largest army
- Time monopoly card usage for when opponents likely have accumulated specific resources
- Save year of plenty cards for completing crucial builds when you're short 1-2 specific resources
- Development cards are most valuable when:
  * You need hidden victory points to surprise opponents
  * You need knights to break up longest road or secure largest army
  * You're lacking wood/brick for expansion but have plenty of sheep/wheat/ore

EXPANSION STRATEGY:
- Build roads only with clear settlement locations in mind
- Target settlements that give you access to ports or new resources
- Block opponents' expansion paths when it gives you a strategic advantage
- Consider the timing of expansion vs. city upgrades based on your resource production
- Calculate whether longest road is achievable and worth the resource investment
- When deciding between a new settlement and a city upgrade, compare immediate vs. long-term returns

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-probability hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Save knight cards for breaking up opponent strategies or securing largest army
- Use knights defensively if you're producing valuable resources on high-probability hexes

TRADING TACTICS:
- Avoid trading resources that directly help opponents score points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades
- Trade excess resources before rolling 7 if you have more than 7 cards
- Consider bank/port trades when they enable an immediate build that advances your strategy
- When trading with players, try to receive resources that complete a build

ENDGAME STRATEGY:
- In the late game, hide your victory point potential (keep development cards hidden)
- Calculate the fastest path to 10 VP and focus exclusively on that path
- Be aware of the exact number of remaining development cards and their probabilities
- Track opponents' potential victory points, including hidden development cards
- If you're close to winning, prioritize actions that can be completed in a single turn

Before finalizing your action, check:
1. Is there a more efficient path to victory points?
2. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
3. Does this move help or hinder opponents?
4. Is there a defensive move needed to prevent an opponent from winning?
5. Are you properly diversified against dice probability?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game Analysis for Settlers of Catan

I'll analyze the current game state and determine the optimal move for maximizing my chances of winning.

## Current Game State Summary
- I'm BLUE with 3 VP (3 settlements + 1 hidden VP card = 4 VP total)
- RED has 4 VP (2 cities)
- I have resources: 1 🌲WOOD, 2 🧱BRICK, 3 🌾WHEAT
- The robber is on hex (0, 0, 0), which is an ore hex with a value of 8
- I have 7 roads built with my longest continuous road being 4 segments

## Victory Point Path Analysis
To win, I need 10 VP. Currently at 4 VP (including my hidden VP card), I need 6 more:
- I could upgrade my 3 settlements to cities (+3 VP)
- Build 2 more settlements (+2 VP)
- Secure longest road with 5 continuous roads (+2 VP)
- Buy more development cards for knights/VP cards

## Road Building Strategy
Since I have 1 wood and 2 brick, I can build one road. Looking at my options:
1. I should prioritize extending my longest road to potentially get the longest road bonus (+2 VP)
2. I need to position myself for future settlement locations

Let me analyze each road option to see which best extends my longest road:

From the available options, I should choose the road that either:
1. Directly extends my current longest road path
2. Sets me up for future settlements in valuable locations
3. Blocks RED from expanding to crucial spots

Based on my resources, I can build exactly one road now. My "Longest: 4" indicates I already have 4 connected roads and need to reach at least 5 for longest road bonus.

<plan>
1. Build a road that extends my longest connected path toward valuable future settlement locations
2. Next, focus on getting ore and wheat for city upgrades (highest VP efficiency)
3. Continue building toward longest road (+2 VP) when I have brick and wood
4. Consider buying development cards if I get sheep+wheat+ore combinations
</plan>

Without knowing the exact topology of all my roads, I need to choose the option that most likely extends my longest road network. Based on the node numbers and current settlements, road option [3] at edge (3, 4) seems strategic as it connects near node 3 where RED has a city but I likely have road access, and it moves toward node 4 which connects to the sheep and ore hexes.

This road would help me work toward longest road while positioning me for potential settlement expansion in a resource-rich area.

# Game Analysis: Robber Placement Decision

I need to evaluate where to place the robber to maximize my strategic advantage. Let me analyze each option carefully.

## Current Game State
- I have 3 VP (3 settlements + 1 hidden VP card)
- RED has 4 VP (2 cities)
- RED holds 5 hidden resource cards
- I have 1 brick and 3 wheat resources

## Robber Placement Options Analysis

**[0] Move robber to (1, -1, 0) - Brick hex (3)**
- This blocks a brick hex (3) that produces at low probability
- Blocks my own settlement at node 9
- Blocks RED's city at node 3
- No stealing opportunity
- IMPACT: Hurts both of us, but hurts me significantly as brick is critical for expansion

**[1] Move robber to (0, -1, 1) - Wheat hex (5)**
- This blocks a wheat hex with medium probability (5)
- Blocks my settlement at node 9
- Blocks RED's city at node 3
- I can steal from RED
- IMPACT: Hurts both of us equally, but I'd block my own wheat production

**[2] Move robber to (-1, 0, 1) - Wood hex (4)**
- This blocks a wood hex with low probability (4)
- Blocks RED's city at node 3
- Blocks my settlement at node 15
- I can steal from RED
- IMPACT: Hurts my wood production which I need for expansion

**[3] Move robber to (-1, 1, 0) - Sheep hex (9)**
- This blocks a sheep hex with medium probability (9)
- Blocks RED's city at node 5
- Blocks my settlement at node 15
- I can steal from RED
- IMPACT: Blocks sheep which I might need for development cards, affects both of us

**[4] Move robber to (0, 1, -1) - Wheat hex (10)**
- This blocks a wheat hex with low probability (10)
- Blocks RED's city at node 5
- I can steal from RED
- IMPACT: Minimally affects me, moderately affects RED

**[5] Move robber to (1, 0, -1) - Desert**
- This is the desert hex which produces nothing
- No stealing opportunity
- IMPACT: No effect on either player, wastes the robber move

## Strategic Considerations
1. RED is ahead by 1 point and has 5 hidden resource cards - they are the threat
2. Blocking RED's highest production is a priority
3. I should avoid blocking my own important resources
4. I need wood and brick for road building
5. I should aim to steal a potentially useful resource

Looking at all options, option [4] seems optimal as it:
- Blocks a RED city's wheat production (though low probability)
- Doesn't block any of my production
- Allows me to steal from RED who has 5 cards
- Wheat is less critical for me right now than wood or brick for expansion

<plan>
1. Continue building roads toward valuable settlement locations using brick and wood
2. Work toward longest road for 2 VP
3. Consider city upgrades when I accumulate ore and wheat
4. Use development cards strategically, saving my VP card until the end

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL SETTLEMENT PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Place settlements on high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Target at least one spot with good ore and wheat production for city development
- Try to secure at least one high-probability spot (5, 6, 8, 9) for each critical resource
- Place your second settlement to complement your first (fill resource gaps)
- Aim for access to all five resources or position near useful ports if resource diversity isn't possible
- Always consider which settlements opponents are likely to place and avoid areas that will become contested
- Place roads pointing toward valuable future expansion spots, not toward the center
- Consider the long-term impact: settlements that can't expand are less valuable

MID-GAME RESOURCE PRIORITIES:
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each possible build (cities: 1VP for 5 resources is most efficient)
- Early phase: Secure at least one good source of brick and wood for minimal expansion
- Growth phase: Prioritize ore and wheat production for city upgrades (3VP for 5 resources is optimal)
- Late phase: Focus on the fastest path to victory points, whether through buildings or development cards
- Avoid trading resources that opponents need for immediate victory point gains
- Use 4:1 trades only when necessary; prioritize port usage when possible

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and limited expansion options
- If you get an early knight, save it for defense or until you can start building toward largest army
- Time monopoly card usage for when opponents likely have accumulated specific resources
- Save year of plenty cards for completing crucial builds when you're short 1-2 specific resources
- Development cards are most valuable when:
  * You need hidden victory points to surprise opponents
  * You need knights to break up longest road or secure largest army
  * You're lacking wood/brick for expansion but have plenty of sheep/wheat/ore

EXPANSION STRATEGY:
- Build roads only with clear settlement locations in mind
- Target settlements that give you access to ports or new resources
- Block opponents' expansion paths when it gives you a strategic advantage
- Consider the timing of expansion vs. city upgrades based on your resource production
- Calculate whether longest road is achievable and worth the resource investment
- When deciding between a new settlement and a city upgrade, compare immediate vs. long-term returns

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-probability hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Save knight cards for breaking up opponent strategies or securing largest army
- Use knights defensively if you're producing valuable resources on high-probability hexes

TRADING TACTICS:
- Avoid trading resources that directly help opponents score points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades
- Trade excess resources before rolling 7 if you have more than 7 cards
- Consider bank/port trades when they enable an immediate build that advances your strategy
- When trading with players, try to receive resources that complete a build

ENDGAME STRATEGY:
- In the late game, hide your victory point potential (keep development cards hidden)
- Calculate the fastest path to 10 VP and focus exclusively on that path
- Be aware of the exact number of remaining development cards and their probabilities
- Track opponents' potential victory points, including hidden development cards
- If you're close to winning, prioritize actions that can be completed in a single turn

Before finalizing your action, check:
1. Is there a more efficient path to victory points?
2. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
3. Does this move help or hinder opponents?
4. Is there a defensive move needed to prevent an opponent from winning?
5. Are you properly diversified against dice probability?

# Game Analysis - Turn 59

Let me analyze the current game state and determine the optimal action.

## Current Game Status
- I'm BLUE with 3/10 victory points
- Resources: 1 🧱BRICK, 1 🐑SHEEP, 4 🌾WHEAT, 1 ⛏️ORE
- I have 1 VICTORY_POINT development card (hidden)
- I've played 1 KNIGHT and 1 ROAD_BUILDING
- I have 3 settlements (no cities) and 8 roads (longest is 4)
- RED has 4/10 victory points with 2 cities and 4 roads

## Victory Point Analysis
- Current visible VPs: 3 (from 3 settlements)
- Hidden VPs: 1 (from development card)
- My actual total: 4/10

## Options Analysis:

1. **Buy Development Card** [1]
   - Costs: 1 🐑SHEEP, 1 🌾WHEAT, 1 ⛏️ORE
   - Benefits: Could be VP, Knight (for largest army), Road Building, Year of Plenty, or Monopoly
   - Would use up all my sheep and ore resources

2. **Maritime Trade** [2-5]
   - Trading 4 🌾WHEAT for other resources is inefficient
   - I still wouldn't have enough resources for a settlement or city after the trade
   - I'd only have 1 wheat left, which isn't enough to build with

3. **End Turn** [0]
   - Saves resources for next turn
   - Waiting for more efficient use of my resources

## Strategic Considerations:
- I need 6 more VPs to win (actually 5 with my hidden VP card)
- I need to upgrade settlements to cities (2 ore + 3 wheat each) for efficient VP gain
- I'm short on ore for city upgrades
- Development cards could offer hidden victory points or knights
- RED has 8 hidden resources which is concerning

<plan>
1. Focus on city upgrades to maximize VP efficiency
2. Buy development cards when I have excess ore/wheat/sheep 
3. Work toward longest road only when I have excess brick/wood
4. Only make trades when they enable immediate strategic builds
5. Save my VP development card until near the end
</plan>

## Decision:
Given my current resources, buying a development card is the most strategic option. I can't build any settlements or cities with my current resources, and trading 4:1 is very inefficient. A development card could provide an immediate victory point, a knight toward largest army, or useful cards like Year of Plenty or Monopoly that could accelerate my progress.

# Game Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state and my options carefully:

## Current Position
- I have 3/10 victory points from my 3 settlements
- I also have 2 hidden VP development cards, giving me actually 5/10 VP
- Resources: 1 Brick, 4 Wheat, 1 Ore
- The robber is on a Wheat hex (10), but not affecting my production significantly
- RED has 5 victory points (2 cities = 4 VP + 1 settlement = 1 VP)

## Option Analysis

My available actions are:
- [0] End Turn
- [1-4] Trade 4 Wheat for another resource

With my current resources (1 brick, 4 wheat, 1 ore), I can't build anything directly:
- Settlement requires: 1 brick, 1 wood, 1 wheat, 1 sheep (missing wood and sheep)
- City requires: 2 wheat, 3 ore (missing 2 ore)
- Development card requires: 1 wheat, 1 ore, 1 sheep (missing sheep)
- Road requires: 1 brick, 1 wood (missing wood)

Looking at my trading options:
1. Trade 4 wheat for 1 wood - This would give me brick+wood for a road, but doesn't advance me toward VP
2. Trade 4 wheat for 1 brick - This gives me 2 brick, which isn't immediately useful
3. Trade 4 wheat for 1 ore - This gives me 2 ore, still 1 short for a city upgrade
4. Trade 4 wheat for 1 sheep - This would give me sheep, which combined with wheat+ore would allow for a development card

## Strategic Decision

My current plan emphasizes city upgrades and development cards. However, I cannot build a city with my current resources even after a trade. 

The most strategic option appears to be trading for a sheep to buy a development card. This could give me:
- Another victory point (bringing me to 6/10)
- A knight (helping toward largest army)
- A road building or year of plenty card (providing utility)

<plan>
1. Focus on city upgrades when I have sufficient ore
2. Continue buying development cards to accumulate VP and knights
3. Work toward longest road as I have 8 roads placed
4. Only trade when necessary for immediate strategic builds
5. Keep VP cards hidden until I'm ready to win
</plan>

Since I can make a productive move this turn by trading for sheep to potentially buy a development card, I'll choose option 4.

# Game Analysis for Settlers of Catan

Let me analyze the current game state and options carefully:

## Current Status
- I (BLUE) have 3 VP from settlements
- I have 2 hidden VP cards = 2 additional VP
- Total VP = 5/10
- Resources: 1 Wood, 1 Brick, 1 Ore
- 8 roads built with longest road of 4 segments

## Opponent Status
- RED has 5 VP (2 cities + 1 settlement)
- RED has 7 hidden resource cards

## Available Options
I can either end my turn or build a road. With 1 wood and 1 brick, I can build exactly one road.

## Road Building Analysis
Looking at the possible road locations:
- Options 1-7 all cost the same (1 wood, 1 brick)
- Building a road could potentially help me work toward longest road (need 5+ segments)
- I should choose the road that best positions me for future expansion

Let me examine each road option strategically:
1. Edge (0, 1): Connects toward the desert hex
2. Edge (13, 14): Extends my network near my settlement at node 15
3. Edge (11, 12): Extends network near wheat hex
4. Edge (4, 5): Could connect toward my settlement at node 5
5. Edge (8, 9): Connects toward my settlement at node 9
6. Edge (1, 6): Extends from my settlement at node 1
7. Edge (17, 18): Extends network near the sheep hex

I need to determine which road gives me the best strategic advantage for:
1. Working toward longest road (currently at 4, need 5+ to claim it)
2. Enabling future settlement placements
3. Blocking opponent expansion

Since I already have 8 roads placed but my longest continuous road is only 4 segments, building a road that extends my longest path is most beneficial. However, without seeing the full road network on the map, I need to make my best judgment based on the information provided.

<plan>
1. Build a strategic road to work toward longest road (aiming for 5+ segments)
2. Continue accumulating resources for city upgrades (particularly ore and wheat)
3. Keep VP cards hidden until I can secure victory in a single turn
4. Consider buying more development cards if I accumulate sheep/wheat/ore
5. Target 10 VP through a combination of buildings (3 settlements = 3VP, cities = 2VP each), development cards (2VP), and potentially longest road (2VP)
</plan>

Without seeing the complete road network visualization, I'll select what appears to be the most promising option for extending my network. Based on the settlement locations, building a road at (13, 14) near my settlement at node 15 seems strategically valuable.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL SETTLEMENT PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Place settlements on high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Target at least one spot with good ore and wheat production for city development
- Try to secure at least one high-probability spot (5, 6, 8, 9) for each critical resource
- Place your second settlement to complement your first (fill resource gaps)
- Aim for access to all five resources or position near useful ports if resource diversity isn't possible
- Always consider which settlements opponents are likely to place and avoid areas that will become contested
- Place roads pointing toward valuable future expansion spots, not toward the center
- Consider the long-term impact: settlements that can't expand are less valuable

MID-GAME RESOURCE PRIORITIES:
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each possible build (cities: 1VP for 5 resources is most efficient)
- Early phase: Secure at least one good source of brick and wood for minimal expansion
- Growth phase: Prioritize ore and wheat production for city upgrades (3VP for 5 resources is optimal)
- Late phase: Focus on the fastest path to victory points, whether through buildings or development cards
- Avoid trading resources that opponents need for immediate victory point gains
- Use 4:1 trades only when necessary; prioritize port usage when possible

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and limited expansion options
- If you get an early knight, save it for defense or until you can start building toward largest army
- Time monopoly card usage for when opponents likely have accumulated specific resources
- Save year of plenty cards for completing crucial builds when you're short 1-2 specific resources
- Development cards are most valuable when:
  * You need hidden victory points to surprise opponents
  * You need knights to break up longest road or secure largest army
  * You're lacking wood/brick for expansion but have plenty of sheep/wheat/ore

EXPANSION STRATEGY:
- Build roads only with clear settlement locations in mind
- Target settlements that give you access to ports or new resources
- Block opponents' expansion paths when it gives you a strategic advantage
- Consider the timing of expansion vs. city upgrades based on your resource production
- Calculate whether longest road is achievable and worth the resource investment
- When deciding between a new settlement and a city upgrade, compare immediate vs. long-term returns

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-probability hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Save knight cards for breaking up opponent strategies or securing largest army
- Use knights defensively if you're producing valuable resources on high-probability hexes

TRADING TACTICS:
- Avoid trading resources that directly help opponents score points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades
- Trade excess resources before rolling 7 if you have more than 7 cards
- Consider bank/port trades when they enable an immediate build that advances your strategy
- When trading with players, try to receive resources that complete a build

ENDGAME STRATEGY:
- In the late game, hide your victory point potential (keep development cards hidden)
- Calculate the fastest path to 10 VP and focus exclusively on that path
- Be aware of the exact number of remaining development cards and their probabilities
- Track opponents' potential victory points, including hidden development cards
- If you're close to winning, prioritize actions that can be completed in a single turn

Before finalizing your action, check:
1. Is there a more efficient path to victory points?
2. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
3. Does this move help or hinder opponents?
4. Is there a defensive move needed to prevent an opponent from winning?
5. Are you properly diversified against dice probability?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game Analysis

First, let me assess my current position and available options:

## Current Status
- I have 3 VP from my 3 settlements
- I have 2 hidden victory point cards
- This gives me 5 VP total (half way to victory)
- Resources: 1 wood, 4 sheep, 3 ore
- No wheat or brick currently

## Opponent's Status
- RED has 6 VP and 9 hidden resource cards
- RED has 3 cities, so they're focusing on city upgrades
- RED does not have longest road or largest army yet

## Strategic Analysis
Looking at my available actions, I only have options to:
1. End my turn
2-5. Trade sheep at unfavorable 4:1 rates

I'm resource-poor with no immediate build options. I need wheat to upgrade settlements to cities or to buy development cards. I need brick and wood for roads and settlements.

With 4 sheep, I could trade for a needed resource, but at a 4:1 rate, this is inefficient. However, if a trade enables a critical build next turn, it might be worth considering.

## What can I build next turn?
- To build a road: need 1 wood + 1 brick (have 1 wood, need 1 brick)
- To build a settlement: need 1 wood + 1 brick + 1 sheep + 1 wheat (have 1 wood and plenty of sheep)
- To build a city: need 2 wheat + 3 ore (have 3 ore, need 2 wheat)
- To buy a development card: need 1 ore + 1 wheat + 1 sheep (have 3 ore and plenty of sheep)

The most efficient build would be a city (1 VP for 5 resources) or a development card (potential VP or knight for largest army).

## Decision Making
Trading 4 sheep for 1 wheat would enable me to buy a development card next turn (assuming I roll resources I need or maintain what I have). This could give me another VP or a knight to work toward largest army.

Trading 4 sheep for 1 brick would allow me to build a road next turn if I keep my wood, helping toward longest road.

However, both trades are inefficient, and there's no guarantee I'll get the complementary resources needed next turn.

<plan>
1. Continue accumulating resources for city upgrades (ore and wheat)
2. Build toward longest road when brick/wood are available
3. Buy development cards when I have the right resource combination
4. Keep VP cards hidden until I can secure victory in a single turn
5. Target 10 VP through: 3 settlements (3VP), city upgrades (2+ VP), development cards (2VP hidden + potential more), and potentially longest road (2VP)
</plan>

Given my current position, there's no compelling reason to make an inefficient 4:1 trade. I'm better off ending my turn and hoping for better dice rolls next round.

# Game Analysis for Turn 77

I'll analyze my position and available actions to determine the optimal next move.

## Current Game State Assessment
- I have 3 VP from settlements (3 settlements × 1 VP)
- I have 2 hidden VP development cards
- Total: 5 VP (with 2 hidden)
- Resources: 1 🌲WOOD, 4 🐑SHEEP, 3 ⛏️ORE
- No 🧱BRICK or 🌾WHEAT currently
- RED has 6 VP and is ahead

## Options Analysis

I need to evaluate my available actions:
1. End Turn
2. Trade 4 sheep for wood
3. Trade 4 sheep for brick
4. Trade 4 sheep for ore
5. Trade 4 sheep for wheat

Looking at my current resources and needs:
- I need cities (requires 3 ore + 2 wheat each)
- I have 3 ore but no wheat
- For new settlements, I need brick + wood

## Path to Victory
My clearest path to 10 VP would be:
- Current: 3 VP from settlements + 2 hidden VP cards = 5 VP
- Upgrade 2 settlements to cities: +2 VP (requires 6 ore, 4 wheat)
- Build roads to achieve longest road: +2 VP (requires brick and wood)
- Third option: buy development card hoping for VP (requires 1 ore, 1 sheep, 1 wheat)

## Decision Logic
Given my current resources, I need wheat urgently to upgrade my settlements to cities. I already have 3 ore, but no wheat. Trading 4 sheep for 1 wheat would allow me to accumulate resources toward a city upgrade.

<plan>
1. Trade for wheat to work toward city upgrades
2. After getting wheat, seek brick and wood for roads
3. Focus on upgrading settlements to cities as primary VP strategy
4. Use development cards strategically and reveal VP cards only when reaching 10 VP
5. Monitor RED player closely as they already have 6 VP
</plan>

Since I have 4 sheep and no wheat, and wheat is critical for city upgrades (my most efficient path to victory), I should trade 4 sheep for 1 wheat.

PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL SETTLEMENT PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Place settlements on high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Target at least one spot with good ore and wheat production for city development
- Try to secure at least one high-probability spot (5, 6, 8, 9) for each critical resource
- Place your second settlement to complement your first (fill resource gaps)
- Aim for access to all five resources or position near useful ports if resource diversity isn't possible
- Always consider which settlements opponents are likely to place and avoid areas that will become contested
- Place roads pointing toward valuable future expansion spots, not toward the center
- Consider the long-term impact: settlements that can't expand are less valuable

MID-GAME RESOURCE PRIORITIES:
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each possible build (cities: 1VP for 5 resources is most efficient)
- Early phase: Secure at least one good source of brick and wood for minimal expansion
- Growth phase: Prioritize ore and wheat production for city upgrades (3VP for 5 resources is optimal)
- Late phase: Focus on the fastest path to victory points, whether through buildings or development cards
- Avoid trading resources that opponents need for immediate victory point gains
- Use 4:1 trades only when necessary; prioritize port usage when possible

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and limited expansion options
- If you get an early knight, save it for defense or until you can start building toward largest army
- Time monopoly card usage for when opponents likely have accumulated specific resources
- Save year of plenty cards for completing crucial builds when you're short 1-2 specific resources
- Development cards are most valuable when:
  * You need hidden victory points to surprise opponents
  * You need knights to break up longest road or secure largest army
  * You're lacking wood/brick for expansion but have plenty of sheep/wheat/ore

EXPANSION STRATEGY:
- Build roads only with clear settlement locations in mind
- Target settlements that give you access to ports or new resources
- Block opponents' expansion paths when it gives you a strategic advantage
- Consider the timing of expansion vs. city upgrades based on your resource production
- Calculate whether longest road is achievable and worth the resource investment
- When deciding between a new settlement and a city upgrade, compare immediate vs. long-term returns

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-probability hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Save knight cards for breaking up opponent strategies or securing largest army
- Use knights defensively if you're producing valuable resources on high-probability hexes

TRADING TACTICS:
- Avoid trading resources that directly help opponents score points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades
- Trade excess resources before rolling 7 if you have more than 7 cards
- Consider bank/port trades when they enable an immediate build that advances your strategy
- When trading with players, try to receive resources that complete a build

ENDGAME STRATEGY:
- In the late game, hide your victory point potential (keep development cards hidden)
- Calculate the fastest path to 10 VP and focus exclusively on that path
- Be aware of the exact number of remaining development cards and their probabilities
- Track opponents' potential victory points, including hidden development cards
- If you're close to winning, prioritize actions that can be completed in a single turn

Before finalizing your action, check:
1. Is there a more efficient path to victory points?
2. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
3. Does this move help or hinder opponents?
4. Is there a defensive move needed to prevent an opponent from winning?
5. Are you properly diversified against dice probability?

# Game Analysis for Settlers of Catan

Let me analyze the current game state and my options carefully:

## Current Position Assessment
- I have 3 visible VP (3 settlements)
- I have 2 hidden VP from development cards
- So my actual VP count is 5/10, not 3/10
- RED has 6 VP and is ahead of me
- Resources: 2 wood, 1 wheat, 4 ore
- Production: I have moderate production of wood, wheat, ore, brick, and sheep

## Action Options Analysis
- [0] End turn: This wastes my opportunity to use resources effectively
- [1-4] Maritime trades at 4:1 ratio (giving ore): These are inefficient but might be necessary

## Resource Strategy
Looking at my hand, I have 4 ore, which could be used for:
1. A city upgrade (needs 3 ore + 2 wheat) - I'm short 1 wheat
2. A development card (needs 1 ore + 1 wheat + 1 sheep) - I'm short 1 sheep
3. Trade for other resources

## Path to Victory Analysis
I currently have 5 VP (3 visible + 2 hidden). To reach 10 VP, I need 5 more:
- Upgrading my 3 settlements to cities would give +3 VP (8 total)
- I need 2 more VP which could come from additional development cards or a new settlement

## Optimal Action Decision
With 4 ore, I can trade at the 4:1 ratio for 1 wheat. This would give me 3 ore and 2 wheat, exactly what I need for a city upgrade. Converting a settlement to a city would increase my VP from 5 to 6, matching RED.

<plan>
1. Trade 4 ore for 1 wheat now
2. Upgrade one of my settlements to a city this turn
3. Focus on getting more brick and wood for expansion toward new settlement locations
4. Continue to monitor RED closely as we'll be tied at 6 VP each
5. Hold my VP development cards until I can reach 10 VP in a single turn
</plan>

The most efficient move is to trade 4 ore for 1 wheat, allowing me to immediately upgrade to a city.

# Robber Placement Analysis

Let me analyze the best robber placement to maximize my strategic position:

## Current Game State
- I'm BLUE with 3 VP (plus 2 hidden VP development cards = 5 VP)
- RED has 6 VP and is ahead of me
- I have 2 wood, 2 wheat, and no ore
- My plan is to upgrade a settlement to a city

## Analyzing Robber Placement Options

[0] Move robber to (0, 0, 0) and steal from RED
- This blocks the ore hex with dice number 8 (high probability)
- RED has 3 settlements/cities on this hex (3 stars)
- I have 1 settlement on this hex
- This would block my own ore production which I need for upgrading to a city

[1] Move robber to (0, -1, 1) and steal from RED
- This blocks wheat hex with number 5 (medium probability)
- RED has one city on this hex (2 stars)
- I have one settlement on this hex (1 star)
- Blocks wheat production for both of us

[2] Move robber to (-1, 0, 1) and steal from RED
- This blocks wood hex with number 4 (low probability)
- RED has one city on this hex (1 star)
- I have one settlement on this hex (1 star)
- Blocks wood for both of us

[3] Move robber to (-1, 1, 0) and steal from RED
- This blocks sheep hex with number 9 (medium probability)
- RED has one city on this hex (2 stars)
- I have one settlement on this hex (1 star)
- Blocks sheep which isn't critical for my immediate needs

[4] Move robber to (0, 1, -1) and steal from RED
- This blocks wheat hex with number 10 (low probability)
- RED has two settlements/cities on this hex (just one star each)
- I have no settlements on this hex
- Only affects RED's wheat production

[5] Move robber to (1, 0, -1)
- This is the desert tile
- Has no effect on resource production
- Can't steal from anyone

## Strategic Considerations

1. I need ore for upgrading to a city, but don't currently have any
2. RED has 5 hidden resources that I might be able to steal
3. RED has strong ore production that I should disrupt
4. I need to maximize my chance of stealing a useful resource

## Decision

The most strategic move is [0] - blocking the high-probability ore hex (8). This:
1. Significantly impacts RED's strongest production (3 stars)
2. Maximizes chance of stealing valuable resources from RED
3. Disrupts RED's engine for building more cities
4. While it also blocks my ore production, I don't currently have a settlement producing ore efficiently

While it hurts my ability to get ore too, disrupting RED's strong ore production is more important, especially considering they're ahead at 6 VP.

<plan>
1. Move robber to ore hex (0,0,0) to disrupt RED's strongest production
2. Trade for ore using wood/wheat if possible in future turns
3. Continue working toward city upgrades
4. Consider development card purchases if I get sheep
5. Hold my VP development cards until I can reach 10 VP in a single turn
</plan>

# Game Analysis for Optimal Robber Placement

Let me think through all the options for moving the robber strategically:

## Option Analysis

**Option 0: Move robber to (0, 0, 0) - Ore hex with value 8**
- This is currently RED's strongest production hex, with TWO cities connected (nodes 3 and 5)
- This hex has 8 (⭐⭐⭐), meaning it has the highest probability in the game
- Blocking this would significantly reduce RED's ore production, which is critical for building cities
- I would also get to steal a card from RED, who has 5 hidden cards

**Option 1: Move robber to (0, -1, 1) - Wheat hex with value 5**
- This is a wheat hex with value 5 (⭐⭐)
- It connects to RED's city at node 3
- Moderate impact on RED's production

**Option 2: Move robber to (-1, 0, 1) - Wood hex with value 4**
- This is a wood hex with value 4 (⭐)
- It connects to RED's city at node 3
- Low impact on RED's production

**Option 3: Move robber to (-1, 1, 0) - Sheep hex with value 9**
- This is a sheep hex with value 9 (⭐⭐)
- It connects to RED's city at node 5
- Moderate impact on RED's production

**Option 4: Move robber to (0, 1, -1) - Wheat hex with value 10**
- This is a wheat hex with value 10 (⭐)
- It connects to RED's cities at nodes 5 and 21
- Low-moderate impact on RED's production

**Option 5: Move robber to (1, 0, -1) - Desert**
- This is the desert, which produces nothing
- No impact on any player's production
- Would be wasting the robber move

## Strategic Considerations

RED player is at 6 victory points, well ahead of my 3 points (plus 2 hidden VP cards). They have 3 cities already and could be close to winning.

My current plan involves targeting RED's strongest production, and that is clearly the ore hex at (0,0,0). Blocking this hex would:
1. Hurt RED's ore production from TWO cities
2. Target a high-probability hex (8)
3. Slow down RED's ability to build more cities or buy development cards
4. Allow me to steal a card from RED, possibly getting ore that I need

Looking at the board, RED has cities on high-value ore hexes while I only have a settlement. Disrupting their ore advantage is the most strategic move.

<plan>
1. Move robber to ore hex (0,0,0) to disrupt RED's strongest production
2. Continue looking for opportunities to acquire ore through trades or production
3. Work toward city upgrades when possible
4. Save my VP development cards until I can reach 10 VP in a single turn or near it
5. Consider defensive plays to prevent RED from securing longest road
</plan>

The optimal move is to place the robber on the ore hex with probability 8, which disrupts RED's strongest resource production from two cities.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL SETTLEMENT PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Place settlements on high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Target at least one spot with good ore and wheat production for city development
- Try to secure at least one high-probability spot (5, 6, 8, 9) for each critical resource
- Place your second settlement to complement your first (fill resource gaps)
- Aim for access to all five resources or position near useful ports if resource diversity isn't possible
- Always consider which settlements opponents are likely to place and avoid areas that will become contested
- Place roads pointing toward valuable future expansion spots, not toward the center
- Consider the long-term impact: settlements that can't expand are less valuable

MID-GAME RESOURCE PRIORITIES:
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each possible build (cities: 1VP for 5 resources is most efficient)
- Early phase: Secure at least one good source of brick and wood for minimal expansion
- Growth phase: Prioritize ore and wheat production for city upgrades (3VP for 5 resources is optimal)
- Late phase: Focus on the fastest path to victory points, whether through buildings or development cards
- Avoid trading resources that opponents need for immediate victory point gains
- Use 4:1 trades only when necessary; prioritize port usage when possible

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and limited expansion options
- If you get an early knight, save it for defense or until you can start building toward largest army
- Time monopoly card usage for when opponents likely have accumulated specific resources
- Save year of plenty cards for completing crucial builds when you're short 1-2 specific resources
- Development cards are most valuable when:
  * You need hidden victory points to surprise opponents
  * You need knights to break up longest road or secure largest army
  * You're lacking wood/brick for expansion but have plenty of sheep/wheat/ore

EXPANSION STRATEGY:
- Build roads only with clear settlement locations in mind
- Target settlements that give you access to ports or new resources
- Block opponents' expansion paths when it gives you a strategic advantage
- Consider the timing of expansion vs. city upgrades based on your resource production
- Calculate whether longest road is achievable and worth the resource investment
- When deciding between a new settlement and a city upgrade, compare immediate vs. long-term returns

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-probability hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Save knight cards for breaking up opponent strategies or securing largest army
- Use knights defensively if you're producing valuable resources on high-probability hexes

TRADING TACTICS:
- Avoid trading resources that directly help opponents score points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades
- Trade excess resources before rolling 7 if you have more than 7 cards
- Consider bank/port trades when they enable an immediate build that advances your strategy
- When trading with players, try to receive resources that complete a build

ENDGAME STRATEGY:
- In the late game, hide your victory point potential (keep development cards hidden)
- Calculate the fastest path to 10 VP and focus exclusively on that path
- Be aware of the exact number of remaining development cards and their probabilities
- Track opponents' potential victory points, including hidden development cards
- If you're close to winning, prioritize actions that can be completed in a single turn

Before finalizing your action, check:
1. Is there a more efficient path to victory points?
2. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
3. Does this move help or hinder opponents?
4. Is there a defensive move needed to prevent an opponent from winning?
5. Are you properly diversified against dice probability?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game Analysis for Settlers of Catan

Let me analyze the current game state and my options thoroughly:

## Victory Point Assessment
- RED: 8 VP (3 cities = 6 VP + Longest Road = 2 VP)
- BLUE (me): 3 VP (3 settlements = 3 VP) + 2 hidden VP development cards = 5 VP total

## Resource Analysis
I currently have:
- 4 Wood
- 2 Sheep
- 2 Wheat
- 0 Brick
- 0 Ore

## Production Assessment
My settlements produce:
- Ore (8): Settlement at node 1
- Brick (3): Settlements at nodes 1 and 9
- Wood (4): Settlement at node 15
- Sheep (9): Settlement at node 15
- Wheat (5): Settlement at node 9

## Strategic Options

The immediate challenge is that RED is at 8 VP and will likely win soon. I'm at 5 VP (including my hidden VP cards), so I need 5 more VP to win.

My options are:
1. End my turn (Action 0)
2. Trade 4 wood for various resources (Actions 1-4)

If I trade for a resource, I should consider what immediate build it enables:
- Brick: Could help with road building or a settlement if I had other resources
- Ore: Essential for city upgrades but I would need 3 ore + 2 wheat
- Sheep: I already have 2, so getting 1 more might help for development cards (3 required)
- Wheat: I already have 2, so getting 1 more could help with development cards

Looking at my current position, I don't have enough resources to build anything significant this turn regardless of what I trade for. I would need multiple resources to make meaningful progress.

<plan>
1. End turn now to preserve resources
2. Focus on city upgrades - I need ore badly
3. Prepare for potential development card purchase (sheep+wheat+ore)
4. Watch RED carefully - they are close to winning
5. Continue saving my VP development cards until I can reveal them for a win
</plan>

Since I can't make a meaningful build this turn, and trading 4 wood for 1 of any resource doesn't enable an immediate strategic action, the most resource-efficient move is to end my turn and wait for better opportunities.

# Game State Analysis

Let me analyze the current game situation carefully:

## Victory Point Status
- RED: 8 VP (3 cities = 6 VP + Longest Road = 2 VP)
- BLUE (me): 3 VP (3 settlements = 3 VP) + 2 hidden VP cards = 5 VP total

## Resource Assessment
I currently have:
- 4 WOOD
- 3 SHEEP
- 2 WHEAT
- 0 BRICK
- 0 ORE

## Strategic Considerations

1. RED is dangerously close to winning at 8 VP. They need only 2 more VP, which could come from upgrading a settlement or getting development cards.

2. My production is limited:
   - Only a settlement on node 1 produces ORE (from an 8), but it's currently blocked by the robber
   - I have no reliable BRICK production
   - I'm fairly strong in WOOD, SHEEP, and WHEAT

3. Available actions:
   - End turn (action 0)
   - Various 4:1 trades using WOOD (actions 1-4)

4. My potential next builds:
   - City upgrade (costs: 3 ORE + 2 WHEAT) - I have 0/3 ORE and 2/2 WHEAT
   - Development card (costs: 1 ORE + 1 SHEEP + 1 WHEAT) - I have 0/1 ORE, 3/1 SHEEP, and 2/1 WHEAT
   - Settlement (costs: 1 WOOD + 1 BRICK + 1 SHEEP + 1 WHEAT) - I have 4/1 WOOD, 0/1 BRICK, 3/1 SHEEP, 2/1 WHEAT
   - Road (costs: 1 WOOD + 1 BRICK) - I have 4/1 WOOD, 0/1 BRICK

## Decision Logic

Trading 4 WOOD for 1 ORE (action 2) would let me get closer to either a city upgrade or development card, but I would still be far from completing either build. 

Trading 4 WOOD for 1 BRICK (action 1) would let me build a road, but without a clear settlement location, this isn't immediately valuable.

Trading resources now at a 4:1 ratio is inefficient and would leave me with minimal resources. Since the robber is on my only ORE hex, I won't be producing ORE this turn. My best move is to keep my current resources and wait for better opportunities.

<plan>
1. End turn now to preserve resources
2. Hope the robber moves off my ORE hex (8) so I can begin producing ORE
3. Work toward either a development card or a city upgrade once I get ORE
4. Keep watching RED carefully - they're close to winning
5. Continue saving my VP development cards until I can reveal them for a win
</plan>

Given the current situation and my lack of ability to make immediate progress toward any meaningful build, my best option is to end my turn and keep my resources.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL SETTLEMENT PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Place settlements on high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Target at least one spot with good ore and wheat production for city development
- Try to secure at least one high-probability spot (5, 6, 8, 9) for each critical resource
- Place your second settlement to complement your first (fill resource gaps)
- Aim for access to all five resources or position near useful ports if resource diversity isn't possible
- Always consider which settlements opponents are likely to place and avoid areas that will become contested
- Place roads pointing toward valuable future expansion spots, not toward the center
- Consider the long-term impact: settlements that can't expand are less valuable

MID-GAME RESOURCE PRIORITIES:
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each possible build (cities: 1VP for 5 resources is most efficient)
- Early phase: Secure at least one good source of brick and wood for minimal expansion
- Growth phase: Prioritize ore and wheat production for city upgrades (3VP for 5 resources is optimal)
- Late phase: Focus on the fastest path to victory points, whether through buildings or development cards
- Avoid trading resources that opponents need for immediate victory point gains
- Use 4:1 trades only when necessary; prioritize port usage when possible

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and limited expansion options
- If you get an early knight, save it for defense or until you can start building toward largest army
- Time monopoly card usage for when opponents likely have accumulated specific resources
- Save year of plenty cards for completing crucial builds when you're short 1-2 specific resources
- Development cards are most valuable when:
  * You need hidden victory points to surprise opponents
  * You need knights to break up longest road or secure largest army
  * You're lacking wood/brick for expansion but have plenty of sheep/wheat/ore

EXPANSION STRATEGY:
- Build roads only with clear settlement locations in mind
- Target settlements that give you access to ports or new resources
- Block opponents' expansion paths when it gives you a strategic advantage
- Consider the timing of expansion vs. city upgrades based on your resource production
- Calculate whether longest road is achievable and worth the resource investment
- When deciding between a new settlement and a city upgrade, compare immediate vs. long-term returns

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-probability hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Save knight cards for breaking up opponent strategies or securing largest army
- Use knights defensively if you're producing valuable resources on high-probability hexes

TRADING TACTICS:
- Avoid trading resources that directly help opponents score points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades
- Trade excess resources before rolling 7 if you have more than 7 cards
- Consider bank/port trades when they enable an immediate build that advances your strategy
- When trading with players, try to receive resources that complete a build

ENDGAME STRATEGY:
- In the late game, hide your victory point potential (keep development cards hidden)
- Calculate the fastest path to 10 VP and focus exclusively on that path
- Be aware of the exact number of remaining development cards and their probabilities
- Track opponents' potential victory points, including hidden development cards
- If you're close to winning, prioritize actions that can be completed in a single turn

Before finalizing your action, check:
1. Is there a more efficient path to victory points?
2. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
3. Does this move help or hinder opponents?
4. Is there a defensive move needed to prevent an opponent from winning?
5. Are you properly diversified against dice probability?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 93 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. End turn now to preserve resources
2. Hope the robber moves off my ORE hex (8) so I can begin producing ORE
3. Work toward either a development card or a city upgrade once I get ORE
4. Keep watching RED carefully - they're close to winning
5. Continue saving my VP development cards until I can reveal them for a win
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.
  To adjust your plan, provide a NEW PLAN in your reasoning with <plan>your new plan</plan>

# Game State Analysis

Let me analyze the current situation carefully before deciding on the optimal action.

## Victory Point Status
- RED: 8/10 VP (3 cities = 6 VP + Longest Road = 2 VP)
- BLUE (me): 3/10 VP (3 settlements = 3 VP) + 2 hidden VP from development cards = 5/10 VP

## Resource Status
I have: 4 Wood, 2 Brick, 3 Sheep, 2 Wheat, 0 Ore
- I can build a road (costs 1 Wood, 1 Brick)
- I can build a settlement (costs 1 Wood, 1 Brick, 1 Sheep, 1 Wheat)
- I cannot build a city (need 3 Ore, 2 Wheat)

## Strategic Assessment
1. RED is at 8 VP and close to winning. They need just 2 more VP.
2. I'm at 5 VP (including hidden VP cards), so I need 5 more.
3. The robber is on the Ore hex (8), blocking my ore production from my settlement at node 1.
4. I have enough resources for a settlement, which would give me +1 VP.

## Settlement Options
- Node 11: Connected to Wheat(5) hex - would give additional Wheat production
- Node 13: Connected to Wood(4) hex - would give additional Wood production

## Road Options
None of the road options seem critical for immediate expansion or defensive purposes.

## Maritime Trade Options
Trading 4 Wood for 1 Ore would still leave me short of city requirements.

## Decision Logic
RED is close to winning at 8 VP. I need to advance my position quickly. Building a settlement immediately gives me +1 VP (advancing to 6 VP total with my hidden cards).

Between the two settlement options:
- Node 11 would improve my Wheat production
- Node 13 would improve my Wood production

Since I already have good Wood production and my path to victory will require upgrading settlements to cities (requiring Wheat and Ore), node 11 with Wheat production is preferable.

<plan>
1. Build settlement at node 11 to gain +1 VP and improve Wheat production
2. On future turns, focus on acquiring Ore (when robber moves) to upgrade settlements to cities
3. Save my VP development cards until I can win in a single turn
4. Watch RED closely and try to block their progress when possible
</plan>

Based on this analysis, I should build a settlement at node 11.

# Game Analysis for Settlers of Catan

Let me analyze the current game state thoroughly to determine the optimal action.

## Current Situation Assessment
- I have 4/10 victory points: 4 settlements (4 VP) + 2 hidden VP development cards = 6 VP total
- RED has 8/10 VP: 3 cities (6 VP) + longest road (2 VP)
- RED is very close to winning, needing only 2 more VP
- The robber is on the ore hex, blocking that resource for everyone
- I have 3 wood, 1 brick, 2 sheep, 1 wheat

## Possible Actions Analysis
0. End turn - Not ideal as I have resources to use
1-5. Build a road (costs 1 wood, 1 brick)
6. Build a settlement at node 13 (costs 1 wood, 1 brick, 1 wheat, 1 sheep)

## Victory Path Analysis
Let's assess my potential path to 10 VP:
- Current: 4 VP (settlements) + 2 VP (development cards) = 6 VP
- If I build a settlement now: +1 VP = 7 VP
- To reach 10 VP, I'd still need 3 more:
  - Upgrading settlements to cities (+1 VP each)
  - Getting longest road (+2 VP)
  - Buying more VP development cards

## Option 6: Building Settlement at Node 13
- Immediate +1 VP (bringing total to 7 VP)
- Connects to wood (4) resource, improving my production
- Uses most of my resources efficiently
- Expands my territory for future growth
- Critical for blocking RED's expansion

## Option 1-5: Building a Road
- Uses wood and brick but doesn't gain immediate VP
- Could position me for longest road, but I'd need at least 2 more roads to match RED's 5
- Could position me for another settlement later, but doesn't help immediately

## Strategic Considerations
- RED has 7 hidden resource cards, possibly positioning for their final VP
- I need to maximize my VP gain quickly while blocking RED if possible
- The settlement at node 13 gives me an immediate VP plus better resource production

<plan>
1. Build settlement at node 13 for immediate +1 VP (to reach 7 VP total with hidden cards)
2. Focus on getting ore when the robber moves to build cities (+2 VP) or buy development cards
3. Save VP development cards until I can win in a single turn
4. Consider working toward longest road by extending my road network strategically
</plan>

Given the analysis, building a settlement at node 13 (option 6) is clearly the optimal move. It gives me an immediate VP, improves my production, and uses my resources efficiently in the race against RED.

# Robber Placement Analysis

I need to decide where to place the robber to maximize my strategic position against RED, who is close to winning at 9 VP.

## Current Game State Assessment
- RED has 9 VP (1 away from winning)
- I have 5 VP shown plus 2 hidden VP from development cards, so I'm at 7 VP total
- RED has the longest road bonus (6 roads, worth 2 VP)
- RED has 3 cities (worth 6 VP) and 1 settlement (worth 1 VP)
- I need ore production to build cities or buy development cards

## Robber Options Analysis

[0] Move robber to (1, -1, 0): This is brick with a 3, connected to RED's settlement.
- Low-probability hex (3 is less valuable)
- Would block my own brick production at node 9
- Not optimal as it hurts my production too

[1] Move robber to (0, -1, 1): This is wheat with a 5, connected to RED's city at node 3.
- High-probability hex (5 is valuable)
- Blocks wheat for RED
- But also blocks my wheat production at nodes 9 and 11
- Not ideal as I need wheat for development cards

[2] Move robber to (-1, 0, 1): This is wood with a 4, connected to RED's city at node 3.
- Moderate-probability hex
- Blocks wood for RED
- But also blocks my own wood production at nodes 13 and 15
- Not optimal as I need wood

[3] Move robber to (-1, 1, 0): This is sheep with a 9, connected to RED settlements.
- Good-probability hex
- Blocks sheep for RED at nodes 5 and 18
- Also blocks my sheep at node 15
- Could be effective, but I need sheep for development cards

[4] Move robber to (0, 1, -1): This is wheat with a 10, connected to RED's city at node 21.
- Lower-probability hex
- Blocks wheat for RED
- Doesn't block any of my production
- Allows me to steal from RED

[5] Move robber to (1, 0, -1): This is desert.
- Desert produces nothing
- Waste of a robber move

## Strategic Decision

Looking at RED's buildings and production, their primary strength is ore from the 8 hex, which gives them the ability to build cities. Since RED is at 9 VP, they need just 1 more VP to win. They are most likely to get this through:
1. Building a settlement (needs wood, brick, wheat, sheep)
2. Building a city (needs ore, wheat)
3. Buying a development card that might give them a VP (needs ore, wheat, sheep)

The most impactful move would be to block the ore at the 8 hex, but the robber is already there. 

The next priority is to block a resource RED needs without hurting my own production. Option [4] - moving the robber to (0, 1, -1) with wheat-10 - accomplishes this. It blocks wheat for RED while not affecting my production, and I get to steal from RED.

<plan>
1. Block RED's wheat production and steal a card from them to slow their progress
2. Use my current resources to build toward settlement at another productive spot
3. Continue working toward city upgrades when I get ore
4. Hold my VP development cards until I can win in a single turn
</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL SETTLEMENT PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Place settlements on high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Target at least one spot with good ore and wheat production for city development
- Try to secure at least one high-probability spot (5, 6, 8, 9) for each critical resource
- Place your second settlement to complement your first (fill resource gaps)
- Aim for access to all five resources or position near useful ports if resource diversity isn't possible
- Always consider which settlements opponents are likely to place and avoid areas that will become contested
- Place roads pointing toward valuable future expansion spots, not toward the center
- Consider the long-term impact: settlements that can't expand are less valuable

MID-GAME RESOURCE PRIORITIES:
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each possible build (cities: 1VP for 5 resources is most efficient)
- Early phase: Secure at least one good source of brick and wood for minimal expansion
- Growth phase: Prioritize ore and wheat production for city upgrades (3VP for 5 resources is optimal)
- Late phase: Focus on the fastest path to victory points, whether through buildings or development cards
- Avoid trading resources that opponents need for immediate victory point gains
- Use 4:1 trades only when necessary; prioritize port usage when possible

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and limited expansion options
- If you get an early knight, save it for defense or until you can start building toward largest army
- Time monopoly card usage for when opponents likely have accumulated specific resources
- Save year of plenty cards for completing crucial builds when you're short 1-2 specific resources
- Development cards are most valuable when:
  * You need hidden victory points to surprise opponents
  * You need knights to break up longest road or secure largest army
  * You're lacking wood/brick for expansion but have plenty of sheep/wheat/ore

EXPANSION STRATEGY:
- Build roads only with clear settlement locations in mind
- Target settlements that give you access to ports or new resources
- Block opponents' expansion paths when it gives you a strategic advantage
- Consider the timing of expansion vs. city upgrades based on your resource production
- Calculate whether longest road is achievable and worth the resource investment
- When deciding between a new settlement and a city upgrade, compare immediate vs. long-term returns

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-probability hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Save knight cards for breaking up opponent strategies or securing largest army
- Use knights defensively if you're producing valuable resources on high-probability hexes

TRADING TACTICS:
- Avoid trading resources that directly help opponents score points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades
- Trade excess resources before rolling 7 if you have more than 7 cards
- Consider bank/port trades when they enable an immediate build that advances your strategy
- When trading with players, try to receive resources that complete a build

ENDGAME STRATEGY:
- In the late game, hide your victory point potential (keep development cards hidden)
- Calculate the fastest path to 10 VP and focus exclusively on that path
- Be aware of the exact number of remaining development cards and their probabilities
- Track opponents' potential victory points, including hidden development cards
- If you're close to winning, prioritize actions that can be completed in a single turn

Before finalizing your action, check:
1. Is there a more efficient path to victory points?
2. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
3. Does this move help or hinder opponents?
4. Is there a defensive move needed to prevent an opponent from winning?
5. Are you properly diversified against dice probability?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 103 | Player: BLUE | Action: MOVE_ROBBER

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Block RED's wheat production and steal a card from them to slow their progress
2. Use my current resources to build toward settlement at another productive spot
3. Continue working toward city upgrades when I get ore
4. Hold my VP development cards until I can win in a single turn
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.
  To adjust your plan, provide a NEW PLAN in your reasoning with <plan>your new plan</plan>

# Game Analysis: Settlers of Catan - Robber Move Decision

Let me analyze the current game state and make the optimal robber placement decision.

## Game State Assessment
- RED has 9/10 VPs (3 cities, 1 settlement, longest road bonus)
- BLUE (me) has 5/10 VPs (5 settlements, 2 hidden VP cards)
- RED is one point away from winning, making this a critical defensive move
- I have 2 wood, 2 brick, 2 sheep, 1 ore - enough for a road and almost enough for a settlement

## Robber Move Options Analysis
Let me analyze each robber placement option:

**[0] Move robber to (0, 0, 0) and steal from RED**
- This blocks ore with number 8 (high production ⭐⭐⭐)
- RED has two cities here, severely impacting their ore production
- Critical resource for cities and development cards
- Could significantly slow RED's progress

**[1] Move robber to (1, -1, 0)**
- This blocks brick with number 3 (low production ⭐)
- RED has no settlements/cities here
- This would only hurt my own brick production at node 1 and 9
- Not effective against RED

**[2] Move robber to (0, -1, 1) and steal from RED**
- This blocks wheat with number 5 (medium production ⭐⭐)
- RED has a city here, impacting their wheat production
- Wheat is needed for cities, settlements, and development cards
- Decent option to slow RED's progress

**[3] Move robber to (-1, 0, 1) and steal from RED**
- This blocks wood with number 4 (low production ⭐)
- RED has a city here but wood isn't as critical in late game
- Less impactful than blocking ore or wheat

**[4] Move robber to (-1, 1, 0) and steal from RED**
- This blocks sheep with number 9 (medium production ⭐⭐)
- RED has a city and settlement here
- Sheep is mainly useful for development cards
- Moderate impact on RED

**[5] Move robber to (1, 0, -1)**
- This is a desert tile with no production
- Completely ineffective move

## Strategic Considerations
1. RED is one point away from winning - must maximize disruption
2. Blocking high-probability resources that RED needs is critical
3. Stealing a resource could give me what I need for my next build
4. Need to prioritize blocking resources RED needs for their final VP

## Decision
Option [0] is clearly superior because:
- It blocks the highest production hex (8 - three stars)
- It impacts ore which RED needs for city upgrades or development cards
- RED has two cities on this hex, making it their primary ore source
- This will significantly slow RED's ability to reach 10 points

<plan>
1. Block RED's ore production at the 8-value hex and steal a card
2. Use my current resources (2 wood, 2 brick) to build a road toward a good settlement spot
3. Aim to upgrade my settlements to cities when I collect more ore and wheat
4. Hold my VP development cards until I can win in a single turn
5. Work toward breaking RED's longest road if possible
</plan>

# Game Analysis for Settlers of Catan

I'll analyze the current game state comprehensively and determine the optimal action.

## Victory Point Analysis
- **RED**: 9/10 VP (3 cities = 6 VP, 1 settlement = 1 VP, Longest Road = 2 VP)
- **BLUE (me)**: 5/10 VP (5 settlements = 5 VP) + 2 hidden VP cards = 7/10 VP

RED is only 1 VP away from winning. This is an emergency situation that requires immediate defensive action.

## Resource Analysis
My resources: 2 Wood, 2 Brick, 2 Sheep, 1 Wheat, 1 Ore
I can build a road or buy a development card.

## Strategic Options

### 1. Building a Road
With 2 Wood and 2 Brick, I can build a road. Let me evaluate each road option:
- Edge (0,1): Connects toward a port or potential expansion
- Edge (4,5): Connects near RED's city, limited expansion value
- Edge (8,9): Extends toward the center, potential expansion
- Edge (1,6): Extends toward a potential port
- Edge (17,18): Near RED's settlement, could potentially block expansion

The most strategic road would be one that:
1. Sets up my future expansion
2. Potentially disrupts RED's path to victory

### 2. Buying a Development Card
With 2 Sheep, 1 Wheat, and 1 Ore, I can buy a development card. This could be:
- Knight (most likely): Could move the robber to block RED's ore production
- Victory Point: Would put me at 8 VP
- Road Building: Would allow me to place 2 roads for free
- Monopoly/Year of Plenty: Useful resource manipulation

### Defensive Analysis
RED is at 9 VP. To win, they likely need:
- Resources for another settlement (Wood, Brick, Sheep, Wheat)
- Resources for a city upgrade (3 Ore, 2 Wheat)
- A Victory Point development card

Currently the robber is on the Ore hex with value 8, which is crucial for RED's production. Moving it would be detrimental to me, as it's currently blocking RED's strongest resource (they have cities adjacent to this hex).

## Decision

The most pressing concern is preventing RED from winning. Since RED is at 9 VP, I need to either:
1. Block their resource production 
2. Work toward increasing my own VP count rapidly

Looking at my options, buying a development card gives me the best chance at both defense and accelerating my path to victory. If I get a Knight, I can move the robber to block RED. If I get a Victory Point, I'll be at 8 VP.

<plan>
1. Purchase a development card hoping for a Knight or VP
2. If Knight, use it to block RED's key production
3. Focus on upgrading settlements to cities with future ore/wheat
4. Continue blocking RED while pushing toward 10 VP through city upgrades and development cards
5. Consider breaking RED's longest road if possible
</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL SETTLEMENT PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Place settlements on high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Target at least one spot with good ore and wheat production for city development
- Try to secure at least one high-probability spot (5, 6, 8, 9) for each critical resource
- Place your second settlement to complement your first (fill resource gaps)
- Aim for access to all five resources or position near useful ports if resource diversity isn't possible
- Always consider which settlements opponents are likely to place and avoid areas that will become contested
- Place roads pointing toward valuable future expansion spots, not toward the center
- Consider the long-term impact: settlements that can't expand are less valuable

MID-GAME RESOURCE PRIORITIES:
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each possible build (cities: 1VP for 5 resources is most efficient)
- Early phase: Secure at least one good source of brick and wood for minimal expansion
- Growth phase: Prioritize ore and wheat production for city upgrades (3VP for 5 resources is optimal)
- Late phase: Focus on the fastest path to victory points, whether through buildings or development cards
- Avoid trading resources that opponents need for immediate victory point gains
- Use 4:1 trades only when necessary; prioritize port usage when possible

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and limited expansion options
- If you get an early knight, save it for defense or until you can start building toward largest army
- Time monopoly card usage for when opponents likely have accumulated specific resources
- Save year of plenty cards for completing crucial builds when you're short 1-2 specific resources
- Development cards are most valuable when:
  * You need hidden victory points to surprise opponents
  * You need knights to break up longest road or secure largest army
  * You're lacking wood/brick for expansion but have plenty of sheep/wheat/ore

EXPANSION STRATEGY:
- Build roads only with clear settlement locations in mind
- Target settlements that give you access to ports or new resources
- Block opponents' expansion paths when it gives you a strategic advantage
- Consider the timing of expansion vs. city upgrades based on your resource production
- Calculate whether longest road is achievable and worth the resource investment
- When deciding between a new settlement and a city upgrade, compare immediate vs. long-term returns

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-probability hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Save knight cards for breaking up opponent strategies or securing largest army
- Use knights defensively if you're producing valuable resources on high-probability hexes

TRADING TACTICS:
- Avoid trading resources that directly help opponents score points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades
- Trade excess resources before rolling 7 if you have more than 7 cards
- Consider bank/port trades when they enable an immediate build that advances your strategy
- When trading with players, try to receive resources that complete a build

ENDGAME STRATEGY:
- In the late game, hide your victory point potential (keep development cards hidden)
- Calculate the fastest path to 10 VP and focus exclusively on that path
- Be aware of the exact number of remaining development cards and their probabilities
- Track opponents' potential victory points, including hidden development cards
- If you're close to winning, prioritize actions that can be completed in a single turn

Before finalizing your action, check:
1. Is there a more efficient path to victory points?
2. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
3. Does this move help or hinder opponents?
4. Is there a defensive move needed to prevent an opponent from winning?
5. Are you properly diversified against dice probability?

Board Understanding Guide:

- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game State Analysis

Let me analyze the current situation carefully:

## Victory Points Assessment
- RED: 9/10 VP (3 cities = 6 VP, 1 settlement = 1 VP, longest road = 2 VP)
- BLUE (me): 5/10 VP (5 settlements = 5 VP)
  - Hidden: 2 victory point cards = +2 VP
  - So my actual total is 7/10 VP

## Resources
- I have: 2 wood, 2 brick, 1 sheep
- I have a knight card and 2 VP development cards

## Strategic Situation
RED is one point away from winning. They have the longest road and could potentially win on their next turn. I need to focus on:
1. Preventing RED from winning
2. Making progress toward my own victory

## Action Analysis

**[0] End Turn**
- Not optimal as I have resources to use

**[1-5] Build Road Options**
- Each costs 1 wood, 1 brick - I have enough resources (2 wood, 2 brick)
- Building a road could potentially help me:
  - Work toward breaking RED's longest road
  - Expand to new settlement locations
  - Increase my own longest road

Let me evaluate each road option:

**[1] Road at edge (0, 1)**
- This would likely extend toward node 0, which doesn't appear to be occupied
- This could potentially help with future expansion

**[2] Road at edge (4, 5)**
- This would connect to node 5, which is already occupied by RED city

**[3] Road at edge (8, 9)**
- This connects to node 9, where I already have a settlement

**[4] Road at edge (1, 6)**
- This extends from node 1 (my settlement) toward node 6, potentially allowing future expansion 

**[5] Road at edge (17, 18)**
- This connects to node 18, which is already occupied by RED settlement

## Decision Reasoning

Given that RED is at 9 VP and about to win, I need to focus on either:
1. Blocking their path to victory
2. Racing to my own victory

From the available options, building a road that could eventually lead to breaking RED's longest road would be most strategic. Since RED has longest road with 6 segments, if I can increase my road length to 7, I could potentially take the longest road bonus (2 VP) away from them.

The best option appears to be one that extends my existing road network toward increasing my own road length, while potentially allowing for future settlement placement. Based on the limited information about the full road connectivity, I'll choose option [1] to build a road at edge (0, 1), which seems to offer expansion opportunity.

<plan>
1. Build road at edge (0, 1) to work toward both expansion and potentially increasing road length
2. Continue building roads strategically to reach 7+ segments and break RED's longest road bonus
3. Play my knight card at an opportune moment to disrupt RED's resource production
4. Aim to build additional settlements or upgrade to cities when resources allow
5. Use my VP cards at the right moment to secure victory

# Game Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state carefully to determine the best action.

## Victory Point Situation
- RED: 9/10 VP (3 cities = 6 VP, 1 settlement = 1 VP, Longest Road = 2 VP)
- BLUE (me): 5/10 VP (5 settlements = 5 VP) + 2 hidden VP cards = 7/10 VP

## Resource Assessment
I currently have:
- 1 🌲 WOOD
- 1 🧱 BRICK
- 1 🐑 SHEEP
- 1 KNIGHT card
- 2 VICTORY_POINT cards (worth 2 VP, currently hidden)

## Strategic Considerations
1. RED is at 9 VP and only needs 1 more to win. This is critical - they are very close to winning.
2. I have 7 VP (including my hidden VP cards), so I need 3 more to win.
3. I can build a road now with my wood and brick.
4. I have a knight card that could disrupt RED or protect important hexes.
5. RED has the Longest Road bonus (+2 VP) with 6 road segments. If I can build at least 7 connected road segments, I could steal this bonus.

## Road Analysis
I need to examine my current road network to see if any of the possible builds would:
1. Help me reach 7 connected segments to take Longest Road
2. Block RED's potential expansion
3. Set me up for a future settlement

Since I have 5 connected segments now, and need 7 to take Longest Road from RED, I need to build strategically toward this goal. 

Looking at the available road options, I need to analyze which one contributes best to my connected road network while also blocking RED's potential expansion.

Based on the options and the critical situation with RED at 9 VP, my priority should be to build roads that help me take Longest Road as quickly as possible. This would both give me +2 VP and take away 2 VP from RED - a 4 VP swing that could be decisive.

<plan>
1. Build a road that extends my longest connected path to eventually reach 7+ segments
2. Play my knight card next turn to disrupt RED's resource production
3. Continue building roads to take Longest Road from RED (4 VP swing)
4. Use my VP cards at the optimal moment to secure victory
</plan>

Without more detailed information about which road options specifically extend my longest path, I need to choose the option that most likely does. Based on the node patterns, I will select edge (0, 5) as it appears to connect important intersections that would help extend my road network.

- Save year of plenty cards for completing crucial builds when you're short 1-2 specific resources
- Development cards are most valuable when:
  * You need hidden victory points to surprise opponents
  * You need knights to break up longest road or secure largest army
  * You're lacking wood/brick for expansion but have plenty of sheep/wheat/ore

EXPANSION STRATEGY:
- Build roads only with clear settlement locations in mind
- Target settlements that give you access to ports or new resources
- Block opponents' expansion paths when it gives you a strategic advantage
- Consider the timing of expansion vs. city upgrades based on your resource production
- Calculate whether longest road is achievable and worth the resource investment
- When deciding between a new settlement and a city upgrade, compare immediate vs. long-term returns

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-probability hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Save knight cards for breaking up opponent strategies or securing largest army
- Use knights defensively if you're producing valuable resources on high-probability hexes

TRADING TACTICS:
- Avoid trading resources that directly help opponents score points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades
- Trade excess resources before rolling 7 if you have more than 7 cards
- Consider bank/port trades when they enable an immediate build that advances your strategy
- When trading with players, try to receive resources that complete a build

ENDGAME STRATEGY:
- In the late game, hide your victory point potential (keep development cards hidden)
- Calculate the fastest path to 10 VP and focus exclusively on that path
- Be aware of the exact number of remaining development cards and their probabilities
- Track opponents' potential victory points, including hidden development cards
- If you're close to winning, prioritize actions that can be completed in a single turn

Before finalizing your action, check:
1. Is there a more efficient path to victory points?
2. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
3. Does this move help or hinder opponents?
4. Is there a defensive move needed to prevent an opponent from winning?
5. Are you properly diversified against dice probability?

# Game State Analysis

Let me carefully analyze the current game state to determine the optimal move:

## Victory Point Situation
- RED: 9/10 VP (3 cities = 6 VP, 1 settlement = 1 VP, Longest Road = 2 VP)
- BLUE (me): 5/10 VP (5 settlements = 5 VP)
- I have 2 hidden Victory Point cards in my hand, meaning my actual VP count is 7/10

## Resources and Development Cards
- I have no resources currently
- I have 1 Knight card and 2 Victory Point cards
- RED has 2 unknown resources

## Critical Observations
- RED is at 9 VP, just 1 away from winning
- RED could potentially win on their next turn with just one more settlement or development card
- I cannot build anything this turn as I have no resources
- My ultimate path to victory involves:
  1. Reaching 10 VP through my 5 settlements (5 VP) + 2 VP cards (2 VP) + Longest Road (2 VP) + 1 more VP
  2. Taking Longest Road from RED (which would be a 4-point swing: -2 for RED, +2 for me)

## Action Analysis

### Option 0: Play Knight Card
- Benefits:
  * Moves the robber to disrupt RED's production
  * Lets me steal a resource from RED (they have 2)
  * Contributes toward Largest Army (I'd have 2 knights played)
  * Possibly denies RED a critical resource they need to win
- Drawbacks:
  * I don't get to roll the dice this turn, giving up potential resource production

### Option 1: Roll the Dice
- Benefits:
  * Could gain resources to build with
  * Normal game progression
- Drawbacks:
  * RED is one VP away from winning
  * If I roll and don't build anything defensive, RED may win on their next turn

## Decision Logic

Given that RED is at 9 VP and about to win, I must take defensive action. Playing the Knight card gives me two benefits:
1. Disrupting RED's production by moving the robber to one of their high-value hexes
2. Potentially stealing a critical resource they need for their final VP

If I roll instead, I risk RED winning on their next turn. Even if I get resources, I cannot immediately take Longest Road this turn because my longest path is only 5 segments.

<plan>
1. Play Knight card immediately to disrupt RED and steal a resource
2. On following turns, focus on extending my road network to take Longest Road from RED
3. Use my VP cards at the end to secure victory
4. Target resource hexes that will help me build roads (brick/wood) for longest road
</plan>

The most strategic move is to play the Knight card now as a defensive measure against RED who is on the verge of winning.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL SETTLEMENT PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Place settlements on high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Target at least one spot with good ore and wheat production for city development
- Try to secure at least one high-probability spot (5, 6, 8, 9) for each critical resource
- Place your second settlement to complement your first (fill resource gaps)
- Aim for access to all five resources or position near useful ports if resource diversity isn't possible
- Always consider which settlements opponents are likely to place and avoid areas that will become contested
- Place roads pointing toward valuable future expansion spots, not toward the center
- Consider the long-term impact: settlements that can't expand are less valuable

MID-GAME RESOURCE PRIORITIES:
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each possible build (cities: 1VP for 5 resources is most efficient)
- Early phase: Secure at least one good source of brick and wood for minimal expansion
- Growth phase: Prioritize ore and wheat production for city upgrades (3VP for 5 resources is optimal)
- Late phase: Focus on the fastest path to victory points, whether through buildings or development cards
- Avoid trading resources that opponents need for immediate victory point gains
- Use 4:1 trades only when necessary; prioritize port usage when possible

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and limited expansion options
- If you get an early knight, save it for defense or until you can start building toward largest army
- Time monopoly card usage for when opponents likely have accumulated specific resources
- Save year of plenty cards for completing crucial builds when you're short 1-2 specific resources
- Development cards are most valuable when:
  * You need hidden victory points to surprise opponents
  * You need knights to break up longest road or secure largest army
  * You're lacking wood/brick for expansion but have plenty of sheep/wheat/ore

EXPANSION STRATEGY:
- Build roads only with clear settlement locations in mind
- Target settlements that give you access to ports or new resources
- Block opponents' expansion paths when it gives you a strategic advantage
- Consider the timing of expansion vs. city upgrades based on your resource production
- Calculate whether longest road is achievable and worth the resource investment
- When deciding between a new settlement and a city upgrade, compare immediate vs. long-term returns

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-probability hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Save knight cards for breaking up opponent strategies or securing largest army
- Use knights defensively if you're producing valuable resources on high-probability hexes

TRADING TACTICS:
- Avoid trading resources that directly help opponents score points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades
- Trade excess resources before rolling 7 if you have more than 7 cards
- Consider bank/port trades when they enable an immediate build that advances your strategy
- When trading with players, try to receive resources that complete a build

ENDGAME STRATEGY:
- In the late game, hide your victory point potential (keep development cards hidden)
- Calculate the fastest path to 10 VP and focus exclusively on that path
- Be aware of the exact number of remaining development cards and their probabilities
- Track opponents' potential victory points, including hidden development cards

# Game Analysis for Robber Placement

I need to analyze my options for moving the robber to determine the optimal placement that will disrupt RED's production while potentially gaining a valuable resource.

## Current Game State Assessment
- RED has 9/10 VP (3 cities = 6 VP, 1 settlement = 1 VP, Longest Road = 2 VP)
- I (BLUE) have 5/10 VP (5 settlements = 5 VP) plus 2 hidden VP from development cards, so actually 7/10 VP
- RED is one point away from winning
- I need 3 more points to win (already have 7 with VP cards)
- My current plan involves disrupting RED and working toward taking Longest Road

## Robber Placement Options Analysis:

**Option [0]: Move robber to (0, 0, 0) - ⛏️8 hex**
- This is an extremely high-value hex (⭐⭐⭐)
- RED has two cities producing from this hex (nodes 3 and 5)
- I have one settlement here (node 1)
- By blocking this, I deny RED significant ore production, which is critical for development cards and cities
- I would also block my own ore production, but disrupting RED is more important

**Option [1]: Move robber to (0, -1, 1) - 🌾5 hex**
- This is a medium-value hex (⭐⭐)
- RED has one city producing wheat here (node 3)
- I have two settlements here (nodes 9 and 11)
- Blocking would hurt my wheat production significantly more than RED's

**Option [2]: Move robber to (-1, 0, 1) - 🌲4 hex**
- This is a low-value hex (⭐)
- RED has one city producing wood here (node 3)
- I have two settlements here (nodes 13 and 15)
- Blocking would hurt my wood production more than RED's

**Option [3]: Move robber to (-1, 1, 0) - 🐑9 hex**
- This is a medium-value hex (⭐⭐)
- RED has one city and one settlement producing sheep here (nodes 5 and 18)
- I have one settlement here (node 15)
- Good disruption to RED without hurting me too much

**Option [4]: Move robber to (0, 1, -1) - 🌾10 hex**
- This is a low-value hex (⭐)
- RED has one city producing wheat here (node 21) and another city with partial production (node 5)
- I have no buildings here
- Pure disruption to RED without affecting me

**Option [5]: Move robber to (1, 0, -1) - 🏜️ (desert)**
- This is a non-producing hex
- No disruption to either player
- This would be wasting the robber move

## Strategic Considerations:
1. RED is only 1 VP away from winning
2. I need to maximize disruption to RED's production
3. I want to steal a resource that might help me build roads
4. I'm focusing on taking Longest Road from RED in my plan
5. I need brick and wood for roads

## Decision:
Option [0] is the strongest move because:
- It blocks RED's primary ore production from two cities on the highest value hex
- Ore is essential for development cards and city upgrades which RED might need for their final VP
- Stealing from RED has a good chance of getting a valuable resource
- The minor self-disruption is worth the trade-off given RED is so close to winning

<plan>
1. Play Knight card to move robber to RED's ore hex (0,0,0) and steal a resource
2. Continue building roads to claim Longest Road from RED (+2 VP)
3. Use my 2 VP cards at the end to secure victory
4. If I get brick/wood from stealing, prioritize road building toward key intersection points

# Game Analysis for Robber Movement

I need to decide where to place the robber to maximize my strategic advantage while hindering RED, who is very close to winning with 9 VP.

## Current Game State Analysis
- RED has 9/10 VP (3 cities, 1 settlement, longest road)
- I have 5/10 VP (5 settlements, 2 hidden VP cards)
- RED is just 1 point away from victory
- The robber is currently on RED's ore hex (0,0,0) with number 8 (high probability)

## Production Analysis
RED's key production:
- Ore: Hex (0,0,0) with number 8 [⭐⭐⭐] (currently blocked)
- Wheat: Hex (0,-1,1) with number 5 [⭐⭐] and (0,1,-1) with number 10 [⭐]
- Sheep: Hex (-1,1,0) with number 9 [⭐⭐]
- Wood: Hex (-1,0,1) with number 4 [⭐]

My production:
- Ore: Hex (0,0,0) with number 8 [⭐⭐⭐] (currently blocked)
- Wheat: Hex (0,-1,1) with number 5 [⭐⭐] and 5 [⭐⭐]
- Sheep: Hex (-1,1,0) with number 9 [⭐⭐]
- Wood: Hex (-1,0,1) with number 4 [⭐] and 4 [⭐]
- Brick: Hex (1,-1,0) with number 3 [⭐]

## Robber Placement Strategy
My goal is to:
1. Block RED's best production
2. Steal a valuable resource
3. Minimize impact on my own production

### Option Analysis:
- [0] Brick hex (1,-1,0): Would block RED's brick source but also mine
- [1] Wheat hex (0,-1,1): Blocks RED's wheat (5) but also hurts my wheat production
- [2] Wood hex (-1,0,1): Blocks RED's wood (4) and mine
- [3] Sheep hex (-1,1,0): Blocks RED's sheep (9) and mine
- [4] Wheat hex (0,1,-1): Blocks RED's wheat (10) with minimal impact on me
- [5] Desert hex (1,0,-1): Wastes the robber move as desert produces nothing

Looking at RED's production, their wheat production is critical for development cards and city building. Option [4] targeting their wheat hex with number 10 impacts RED while minimizing impact on my production since I don't have settlements on that hex.

## Plan Update
<plan>
1. Move robber to RED's wheat hex (0,1,-1) and steal a resource
2. Continue building roads to claim Longest Road from RED (+2 VP)
3. Use my 2 VP cards at the end to secure victory
4. If I steal a useful resource, prioritize road building toward key intersection points
</plan>

Given RED is just 1 VP away from victory, blocking RED's wheat production without affecting mine is the optimal move.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL SETTLEMENT PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Place settlements on high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Target at least one spot with good ore and wheat production for city development
- Try to secure at least one high-probability spot (5, 6, 8, 9) for each critical resource
- Place your second settlement to complement your first (fill resource gaps)
- Aim for access to all five resources or position near useful ports if resource diversity isn't possible
- Always consider which settlements opponents are likely to place and avoid areas that will become contested
- Place roads pointing toward valuable future expansion spots, not toward the center
- Consider the long-term impact: settlements that can't expand are less valuable

MID-GAME RESOURCE PRIORITIES:
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each possible build (cities: 1VP for 5 resources is most efficient)
- Early phase: Secure at least one good source of brick and wood for minimal expansion
- Growth phase: Prioritize ore and wheat production for city upgrades (3VP for 5 resources is optimal)
- Late phase: Focus on the fastest path to victory points, whether through buildings or development cards
- Avoid trading resources that opponents need for immediate victory point gains
- Use 4:1 trades only when necessary; prioritize port usage when possible

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and limited expansion options
- If you get an early knight, save it for defense or until you can start building toward largest army
- Time monopoly card usage for when opponents likely have accumulated specific resources
- Save year of plenty cards for completing crucial builds when you're short 1-2 specific resources
- Development cards are most valuable when:
  * You need hidden victory points to surprise opponents
  * You need knights to break up longest road or secure largest army
  * You're lacking wood/brick for expansion but have plenty of sheep/wheat/ore

EXPANSION STRATEGY:
- Build roads only with clear settlement locations in mind
- Target settlements that give you access to ports or new resources
- Block opponents' expansion paths when it gives you a strategic advantage
- Consider the timing of expansion vs. city upgrades based on your resource production
- Calculate whether longest road is achievable and worth the resource investment
- When deciding between a new settlement and a city upgrade, compare immediate vs. long-term returns

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-probability hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Save knight cards for breaking up opponent strategies or securing largest army
- Use knights defensively if you're producing valuable resources on high-probability hexes

TRADING TACTICS:
- Avoid trading resources that directly help opponents score points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades
- Trade excess resources before rolling 7 if you have more than 7 cards
- Consider bank/port trades when they enable an immediate build that advances your strategy
- When trading with players, try to receive resources that complete a build

ENDGAME STRATEGY:
- In the late game, hide your victory point potential (keep development cards hidden)
- Calculate the fastest path to 10 VP and focus exclusively on that path
- Be aware of the exact number of remaining development cards and their probabilities
- Track opponents' potential victory points, including hidden development cards
- If you're close to winning, prioritize actions that can be completed in a single turn

Before finalizing your action, check:
1. Is there a more efficient path to victory points?
2. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
3. Does this move help or hinder opponents?
4. Is there a defensive move needed to prevent an opponent from winning?
5. Are you properly diversified against dice probability?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game Analysis for Turn 111

I need to carefully assess my current position and available actions to make the optimal decision.

## Victory Point Assessment:
- I have 5 VP (5 settlements = 5 VP)
- I have 2 hidden VP cards
- RED has 9 VP total (3 cities = 6 VP, 1 settlement = 1 VP, Longest Road = 2 VP)
- RED is only 1 point away from victory

## Resource Analysis:
I currently have: 2 BRICK, 1 SHEEP, 3 WHEAT, 1 ORE

## Available Actions:
[0] End turn
[1] Buy development card (costs 1 SHEEP, 1 WHEAT, 1 ORE)

## Strategic Considerations:
1. RED is at 9 VP and very close to winning
2. I have 2 hidden VP cards, bringing my actual total to 7 VP
3. I would need 3 more VP to win, which could potentially come from:
   - Building more settlements (+1 VP each)
   - Upgrading to cities (+1 VP per upgrade)
   - Stealing Longest Road from RED (+2 VP)
   - Getting Largest Army (+2 VP)
4. My previous plan involved building roads to take Longest Road from RED

## Decision Process:
If I buy a development card:
- Cost: 1 SHEEP, 1 WHEAT, 1 ORE
- Remaining resources: 2 BRICK, 0 SHEEP, 2 WHEAT, 0 ORE
- Potential benefit: Could get Knight (helping toward Largest Army), Road Building (helping toward Longest Road), or another VP card
- Risk: It might be a card that doesn't help immediately

If I end my turn:
- I keep all my resources for future building
- I can use my 2 BRICK + remaining resources next turn to build roads toward Longest Road

Looking at my prior plan of taking Longest Road, I should continue building roads. RED has a 6-segment longest road, while I have 5 segments. I need to extend my road network by at least 2 segments to take the Longest Road bonus.

Since I have 2 BRICK (crucial for road building) and neither of my available actions allows me to build roads this turn, I should preserve my BRICK resources for the next turn where I can build roads.

Buying a development card consumes my SHEEP, WHEAT, and ORE, but doesn't directly advance my Longest Road strategy. There's also no guarantee of getting a useful card.

<plan>
1. Save resources this turn, especially the BRICK
2. Next turn, use BRICK to build roads toward Longest Road
3. Once I secure Longest Road (+2 VP), I'll be at 9 VP (7 current + 2 from Longest Road)
4. Then I'll need just 1 more VP through either a settlement or city upgrade
</plan>

Given my current plan and resources, the optimal move is to end my turn and preserve resources for road building next turn.

# Initial Settlement Placement Analysis

I need to place my first settlement on the board. This is a crucial decision that will impact my entire game strategy.

Let me analyze the board structure:

## Resource Distribution
- 🌲 WOOD: Located at (1, -1, 0) with number 8 (high probability)
- 🧱 BRICK: Located at (0, 0, 0) with number 3 (low probability)
- 🌾 WHEAT: Located at (-1, 0, 1) with number 4 and at (1, 0, -1) with number 10
- 🐑 SHEEP: Located at (-1, 1, 0) with number 6 (high probability)
- 🏜️ DESERT: Located at (0, -1, 1) with robber 🔍
- ⛏️ ORE: Located at (0, 1, -1) with number 9

## Node Analysis
I need to find nodes that connect to high probability numbers and diverse resources.

Best candidates:
1. Node 1: Connects to WOOD (8), WHEAT (10), and BRICK (3)
2. Node 2: Connects to WOOD (8), BRICK (3), and borders the DESERT
3. Node 4: Connects to WHEAT (4), SHEEP (6), and BRICK (3)
4. Node 6: Connects to WOOD (8) and WHEAT (10)
5. Node 16: Connects to SHEEP (6) and ORE (9)

## Strategic Decision
For my first settlement, I want a high-probability resource spot. Node 1 stands out because:
- It connects to WOOD with number 8 (high probability)
- It provides access to WHEAT with number 10 (decent probability)
- It has BRICK with number 3 (low probability, but brick is crucial early)
- It offers 3 different resources at one node
- It appears to be at a junction of good expansion opportunities

<plan>
1. Place first settlement at node 1 to access WOOD (8), WHEAT (10), and BRICK (3)
2. For second settlement, look for a spot with ORE and SHEEP to complete resource diversity
3. Early game focus on road building to secure expansion spots
4. Mid-game transition to city upgrades (prioritize ORE and WHEAT production)
5. Evaluate development card purchases if expansion options become limited
</plan>

Node 1 gives me the strongest start with a high-probability WOOD (8), which is essential for early expansion. While BRICK (3) has a low probability, having access to it is important for early roads. WHEAT (10) helps set me up for future city upgrades.

PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL SETTLEMENT PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Place settlements on high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Target at least one spot with good ore and wheat production for city development
- Try to secure at least one high-probability spot (5, 6, 8, 9) for each critical resource
- Place your second settlement to complement your first (fill resource gaps)
- Aim for access to all five resources or position near useful ports if resource diversity isn't possible
- Always consider which settlements opponents are likely to place and avoid areas that will become contested
- Place roads pointing toward valuable future expansion spots, not toward the center
- Consider the long-term impact: settlements that can't expand are less valuable

MID-GAME RESOURCE PRIORITIES:
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each possible build (cities: 1VP for 5 resources is most efficient)
- Early phase: Secure at least one good source of brick and wood for minimal expansion
- Growth phase: Prioritize ore and wheat production for city upgrades (3VP for 5 resources is optimal)
- Late phase: Focus on the fastest path to victory points, whether through buildings or development cards
- Avoid trading resources that opponents need for immediate victory point gains
- Use 4:1 trades only when necessary; prioritize port usage when possible

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and limited expansion options
- If you get an early knight, save it for defense or until you can start building toward largest army
- Time monopoly card usage for when opponents likely have accumulated specific resources
- Save year of plenty cards for completing crucial builds when you're short 1-2 specific resources
- Development cards are most valuable when:
  * You need hidden victory points to surprise opponents
  * You need knights to break up longest road or secure largest army
  * You're lacking wood/brick for expansion but have plenty of sheep/wheat/ore

EXPANSION STRATEGY:
- Build roads only with clear settlement locations in mind
- Target settlements that give you access to ports or new resources
- Block opponents' expansion paths when it gives you a strategic advantage
- Consider the timing of expansion vs. city upgrades based on your resource production
- Calculate whether longest road is achievable and worth the resource investment
- When deciding between a new settlement and a city upgrade, compare immediate vs. long-term returns

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-probability hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Save knight cards for breaking up opponent strategies or securing largest army
- Use knights defensively if you're producing valuable resources on high-probability hexes

TRADING TACTICS:
- Avoid trading resources that directly help opponents score points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades
- Trade excess resources before rolling 7 if you have more than 7 cards
- Consider bank/port trades when they enable an immediate build that advances your strategy
- When trading with players, try to receive resources that complete a build

ENDGAME STRATEGY:
- In the late game, hide your victory point potential (keep development cards hidden)
- Calculate the fastest path to 10 VP and focus exclusively on that path
- Be aware of the exact number of remaining development cards and their probabilities
- Track opponents' potential victory points, including hidden development cards
- If you're close to winning, prioritize actions that can be completed in a single turn

Before finalizing your action, check:
1. Is there a more efficient path to victory points?
2. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
3. Does this move help or hinder opponents?
4. Is there a defensive move needed to prevent an opponent from winning?
5. Are you properly diversified against dice probability?

# Initial Road Placement Analysis

I need to carefully analyze my options for placing my first road after establishing my settlement at node 1. This is a critical decision that will influence my future expansion opportunities.

## Current Position Assessment
- My first settlement is at node 1, giving me access to:
  - WOOD (8) - excellent probability
  - WHEAT (10) - decent probability
  - BRICK (3) - poor probability
- I'm missing ORE and SHEEP for complete resource diversity

## Road Options Analysis
Looking at my three options:

**[0] Build a road at edge (0, 1)**
- This edge connects towards the center of the board
- Leads toward ORE (9) and potentially SHEEP resources
- Direction seems promising for future expansion

**[1] Build a road at edge (1, 6)**
- Points toward WOOD (8) and WHEAT (10) tiles
- May allow access to port (not clear from current info)
- Good for reinforcing my strong resource production

**[2] Build a road at edge (1, 2)**
- Points toward DESERT (currently has robber) and WOOD (8)
- Less optimal direction for diversifying resources

## Strategic Considerations
Since I already have WOOD, WHEAT, and BRICK from my settlement, my strategic priority should be to expand toward areas with ORE and SHEEP to complete my resource diversity.

Looking at the board layout, option [0] appears to point toward the ORE (9) hex, which would help diversify my resources and position me for city upgrades later.

<plan>
1. Place first settlement at node 1 (already done)
2. Build initial road toward ORE (9) hex to position for resource diversity
3. Place second settlement at a location with good ORE and SHEEP production
4. Early game: secure one more expansion spot with road building
5. Mid-game: focus on city upgrades (prioritizing WHEAT and ORE)
6. Late game: optimize victory point acquisition through development cards if needed
</plan>

Based on this analysis, I'll choose option [0] to build a road at edge (0, 1), positioning myself to expand toward the ORE hex.

# Initial Settlement Placement Analysis

I need to carefully analyze the best location for my second settlement to complement my first settlement and position myself for success.

## Current Resources and Production
- First settlement at node 1: produces 🧱(3), 🌲(8), and 🌾(10)
- Strong wood production (8 is excellent)
- Decent brick and wheat production
- Missing: ore and sheep

## Node Analysis
Let me evaluate each available node:

### Node 3: 🌾(4), 🧱(3), 🏜️(Desert)
- Adds wheat (4) but doubles up on brick (3)
- No new resources, desert is unproductive
- Poor diversity

### Node 7: 🌲(8)
- Only connects to one hex (wood 8)
- Doubles up on my best resource
- Very poor choice

### Node 8: 🌲(8) 
- Only one resource (wood 8)
- Doubles up on my best resource
- Very poor choice

### Node 9: 🌲(8), 🏜️(Desert)
- Wood (8) but already have strong wood production
- Desert gives no resources
- Poor choice

### Node 10: 🏜️(Desert)
- Only connects to desert
- Extremely poor choice

### Node 11: 🏜️(Desert)
- Only connects to desert
- Extremely poor choice

### Node 12: 🌾(4), 🏜️(Desert)
- Only wheat (4) is productive
- Limited production
- Poor choice

### Node 13: 🌾(4)
- Only produces one resource (wheat)
- Minimal benefit
- Poor choice

### Node 18: 🐑(6)
- Sheep (6) is excellent production value
- Missing resource from my portfolio
- Good choice

### Node 19: ⛏️(9)
- Ore (9) is a good number
- Missing resource from my portfolio
- Good choice

### Node 20: ⛏️(9), 🌾(10)
- Ore (9) and wheat (10)
- Doubles up on wheat but adds ore
- Excellent city-building potential
- Very good choice

### Node 21: ⛏️(9)
- Only produces ore (9)
- Good but limited
- Moderate choice

### Node 22: 🌾(10)
- Only produces wheat (10)
- Doubles up on current production
- Poor choice

### Node 23: 🌾(10)
- Only produces wheat (10)
- Doubles up on current production
- Poor choice

## Strategic Analysis
Looking at best options:
- Node 18: Adds sheep (6), great number
- Node 19: Adds ore (9), good number
- Node 20: Adds ore (9) + wheat (10), supports city strategy

Node 20 gives me the best city-building potential with ore (9) and additional wheat (10). While I'll double up on wheat, having strong wheat and ore production is critical for city upgrades. This aligns with my plan to prioritize city development in the mid-game.

## Updated Plan
<plan>
1. Place second settlement at node 20 for ore (9) and wheat (10) production
2. Early game: Build roads toward node 18 to secure sheep production
3. Mid-game: Focus on city upgrades using my strong ore and wheat production
4. Late game: Optimize victory point acquisition through development cards
</plan>

The optimal choice for my second settlement is node 20, which adds ore production on a good number (9) and strengthens my wheat production further.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL SETTLEMENT PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Place settlements on high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Target at least one spot with good ore and wheat production for city development
- Try to secure at least one high-probability spot (5, 6, 8, 9) for each critical resource
- Place your second settlement to complement your first (fill resource gaps)
- Aim for access to all five resources or position near useful ports if resource diversity isn't possible
- Always consider which settlements opponents are likely to place and avoid areas that will become contested
- Place roads pointing toward valuable future expansion spots, not toward the center
- Consider the long-term impact: settlements that can't expand are less valuable

MID-GAME RESOURCE PRIORITIES:
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each possible build (cities: 1VP for 5 resources is most efficient)
- Early phase: Secure at least one good source of brick and wood for minimal expansion
- Growth phase: Prioritize ore and wheat production for city upgrades (3VP for 5 resources is optimal)
- Late phase: Focus on the fastest path to victory points, whether through buildings or development cards
- Avoid trading resources that opponents need for immediate victory point gains
- Use 4:1 trades only when necessary; prioritize port usage when possible

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and limited expansion options
- If you get an early knight, save it for defense or until you can start building toward largest army
- Time monopoly card usage for when opponents likely have accumulated specific resources
- Save year of plenty cards for completing crucial builds when you're short 1-2 specific resources
- Development cards are most valuable when:
  * You need hidden victory points to surprise opponents
  * You need knights to break up longest road or secure largest army
  * You're lacking wood/brick for expansion but have plenty of sheep/wheat/ore

EXPANSION STRATEGY:
- Build roads only with clear settlement locations in mind
- Target settlements that give you access to ports or new resources
- Block opponents' expansion paths when it gives you a strategic advantage
- Consider the timing of expansion vs. city upgrades based on your resource production
- Calculate whether longest road is achievable and worth the resource investment
- When deciding between a new settlement and a city upgrade, compare immediate vs. long-term returns

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-probability hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Save knight cards for breaking up opponent strategies or securing largest army
- Use knights defensively if you're producing valuable resources on high-probability hexes

TRADING TACTICS:
- Avoid trading resources that directly help opponents score points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades
- Trade excess resources before rolling 7 if you have more than 7 cards
- Consider bank/port trades when they enable an immediate build that advances your strategy
- When trading with players, try to receive resources that complete a build

ENDGAME STRATEGY:
- In the late game, hide your victory point potential (keep development cards hidden)
- Calculate the fastest path to 10 VP and focus exclusively on that path
- Be aware of the exact number of remaining development cards and their probabilities
- Track opponents' potential victory points, including hidden development cards
- If you're close to winning, prioritize actions that can be completed in a single turn

Before finalizing your action, check:
1. Is there a more efficient path to victory points?
2. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
3. Does this move help or hinder opponents?
4. Is there a defensive move needed to prevent an opponent from winning?
5. Are you properly diversified against dice probability?

❓ Select action by number (0-2):


Based on this information, which action number do you choose? Think step by step about your options, then put the final action number in a box like \boxed{1}.
RESPONSE:
I'll analyze my options for building my initial road from my second settlement at node 20.

First, let me understand the three available road options:
- Option [0]: Road at edge (0, 20) - connects toward node 0
- Option [1]: Road at edge (19, 20) - connects toward node 19
- Option [2]: Road at edge (20, 22) - connects toward node 22

Now I need to analyze what these roads mean strategically:

1) Looking at the board, edge (0, 20) would connect toward the center where I already have my first settlement at node 1. This doesn't open new expansion opportunities.

2) Edge (19, 20) would connect toward node 19, which appears to be on the edge of the ⛏️9 hex. This could potentially open expansion toward new resources.

3) Edge (20, 22) would connect toward node 22, which is on the 🌾10 hex. This would provide a path toward what appears to be the eastern side of the board.

My current strategic situation:
- I have good ore (9) and wheat (10) production from my settlement at node 20
- I have brick (3), wood (8) and wheat (10) from my settlement at node 1
- I'm missing good sheep production

According to my plan, I wanted to build roads toward node 18 to secure sheep production. Looking at the board layout, the best path toward future sheep access would be through edge (19, 20), as it seems to head in the direction of the sheep hex (6).

This road would position me well for future expansion while avoiding building toward places I already occupy. It aligns with my plan to secure sheep production while maintaining my strong ore and wheat base for future city upgrades.

<plan>
1. Build road toward node 19 to create path toward sheep production
2. Collect resources to build another road and eventually a settlement near the sheep hex
3. Mid-game: Focus on city upgrades using my strong ore and wheat production
4. Late game: Optimize victory point acquisition through development cards
</plan>

\boxed{1}
========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL SETTLEMENT PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Place settlements on high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Target at least one spot with good ore and wheat production for city development
- Try to secure at least one high-probability spot (5, 6, 8, 9) for each critical resource
- Place your second settlement to complement your first (fill resource gaps)
- Aim for access to all five resources or position near useful ports if resource diversity isn't possible
- Always consider which settlements opponents are likely to place and avoid areas that will become contested
- Place roads pointing toward valuable future expansion spots, not toward the center
- Consider the long-term impact: settlements that can't expand are less valuable

MID-GAME RESOURCE PRIORITIES:
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each possible build (cities: 1VP for 5 resources is most efficient)
- Early phase: Secure at least one good source of brick and wood for minimal expansion
- Growth phase: Prioritize ore and wheat production for city upgrades (3VP for 5 resources is optimal)
- Late phase: Focus on the fastest path to victory points, whether through buildings or development cards
- Avoid trading resources that opponents need for immediate victory point gains
- Use 4:1 trades only when necessary; prioritize port usage when possible

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and limited expansion options
- If you get an early knight, save it for defense or until you can start building toward largest army
- Time monopoly card usage for when opponents likely have accumulated specific resources
- Save year of plenty cards for completing crucial builds when you're short 1-2 specific resources
- Development cards are most valuable when:
  * You need hidden victory points to surprise opponents
  * You need knights to break up longest road or secure largest army
  * You're lacking wood/brick for expansion but have plenty of sheep/wheat/ore

EXPANSION STRATEGY:
- Build roads only with clear settlement locations in mind
- Target settlements that give you access to ports or new resources
- Block opponents' expansion paths when it gives you a strategic advantage
- Consider the timing of expansion vs. city upgrades based on your resource production
- Calculate whether longest road is achievable and worth the resource investment
- When deciding between a new settlement and a city upgrade, compare immediate vs. long-term returns

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-probability hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Save knight cards for breaking up opponent strategies or securing largest army
- Use knights defensively if you're producing valuable resources on high-probability hexes

TRADING TACTICS:
- Avoid trading resources that directly help opponents score points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades
- Trade excess resources before rolling 7 if you have more than 7 cards
- Consider bank/port trades when they enable an immediate build that advances your strategy
- When trading with players, try to receive resources that complete a build

ENDGAME STRATEGY:
- In the late game, hide your victory point potential (keep development cards hidden)
- Calculate the fastest path to 10 VP and focus exclusively on that path
- Be aware of the exact number of remaining development cards and their probabilities
- Track opponents' potential victory points, including hidden development cards
- If you're close to winning, prioritize actions that can be completed in a single turn

Before finalizing your action, check:
1. Is there a more efficient path to victory points?
2. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
3. Does this move help or hinder opponents?
4. Is there a defensive move needed to prevent an opponent from winning?
5. Are you properly diversified against dice probability?

# Move Robber Analysis

I need to determine the optimal robber placement to maximize my advantage while hindering my opponent.

## Resources Analysis
- I have: 2 Brick, 1 Wheat, 2 Ore
- Red has 7 resources (at risk of losing half if a 7 is rolled)
- My current production: Brick(3), Lumber(8), Wheat(10), Ore(9)
- I'm missing sheep production completely

## Robber Move Options:
0. Move to Brick(3) hex (0,0,0) and steal from Red
   - Blocks: Red's Brick production, mild impact on my Brick production
   - Stealing: Good chance for sheep which I need

1. Move to Lumber(8) hex (1,-1,0)
   - Blocks: My strong lumber production (3 stars)
   - No stealing possible (Red not connected)
   - This would hurt me significantly with no direct impact on Red

2. Move to Wheat(4) hex (-1,0,1) and steal from Red
   - Blocks: Red's Wheat production (1 star)
   - Stealing: Could get resources I need

3. Move to Sheep(6) hex (-1,1,0) and steal from Red
   - Blocks: Red's strong Sheep production (3 stars)
   - Stealing: Good opportunity
   - This is Red's most productive hex

4. Move to Ore(9) hex (0,1,-1) and steal from Red
   - Blocks: Red's Ore production (2 stars) and my Ore production (2 stars)
   - Stealing: Could be beneficial but hurts my own production

5. Move to Wheat(10) hex (1,0,-1)
   - Blocks: My Wheat production
   - No stealing possible (Red not connected)
   - Would hurt my limited wheat production

## Strategic Considerations:
- Option 3 (sheep hex) hurts Red the most by blocking their 6-value (3 stars) sheep production
- Red has 7 cards, so they likely have sheep to steal since it's their highest production
- I need sheep which I currently don't produce
- My plan includes expanding toward sheep production, so getting some now helps

<plan>
1. Move robber to sheep hex to block Red's strongest production and potentially steal sheep
2. Continue building road toward node 19 to create path toward sheep production
3. Build a settlement near the sheep hex when possible
4. Mid-game: Focus on city upgrades using my strong ore and wheat production
5. Late game: Optimize victory point acquisition through development cards
</plan>

Option 3 is clearly optimal as it blocks Red's strongest production (sheep on 6), gives me a chance to steal sheep which I need, and doesn't impact my own production.

# Game State Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state to make the optimal decision:

## Current Resources
- 2 Brick, 1 Sheep, 1 Wheat, 2 Ore

## Victory Points Status
- I have 2 VP (from my 2 settlements)
- Red has 2 VP (from their 2 settlements)
- We're tied, early in the game

## Production Analysis
- My production: Brick (3), Ore (9), Wheat (10 - two nodes), Wood (8)
- Red's production: Brick (3), Sheep (6 - two nodes), Ore (9), Wheat (4)
- Robber is currently on the Sheep (6) hex, blocking Red's strongest production

## Available Actions
0. End turn
1. Buy a development card (1 Sheep, 1 Wheat, 1 Ore)

## Action Analysis

**Option 0: End Turn**
- I would keep my current resources (2 Brick, 1 Sheep, 1 Wheat, 2 Ore)
- Next turn, I might be able to build a road (1 Brick, 1 Wood) if I get Wood
- I'm not at risk of losing resources to a 7 roll as I only have 6 cards total

**Option 1: Buy Development Card**
- Cost: 1 Sheep, 1 Wheat, 1 Ore
- Remaining resources after purchase: 2 Brick, 0 Sheep, 0 Wheat, 1 Ore
- Potential benefits:
  - 25% chance of Victory Point card (immediate hidden VP)
  - 52% chance of Knight card (useful for defense, moving robber, potential Largest Army)
  - 12% chance of Road Building (valuable as I need expansion)
  - 8% chance of Year of Plenty (resource flexibility)
  - 4% chance of Monopoly (can be game-changing)
- If I buy, I'll be left with 2 Brick, 1 Ore which isn't enough for any build next turn

## Strategic Considerations

Looking at my current plan, I want to:
1. Continue building roads toward node 19
2. Build a settlement near sheep production
3. Focus on city upgrades mid-game
4. Optimize VP acquisition late-game

With my current resources, I can't build a road this turn (need Wood). I could save for next turn to potentially build a road if I get Wood.

Buying a development card would use my Sheep/Wheat/Ore, leaving me with just Brick. This doesn't advance my immediate expansion goals but could provide long-term benefits or a hidden VP.

<plan>
1. Save resources this turn to build a road next turn toward node 19
2. Continue expansion toward sheep production at node 19
3. Mid-game: Focus on city upgrades using my strong ore and wheat production
4. Late game: Consider development cards for hidden VPs and special abilities
</plan>

Given my current resources and strategic goals focused on expansion, I should save my resources rather than buy a development card. Development cards are more valuable when expansion options are limited or I have excess sheep/wheat/ore, which isn't currently the case.

You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL SETTLEMENT PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Place settlements on high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Target at least one spot with good ore and wheat production for city development
- Try to secure at least one high-probability spot (5, 6, 8, 9) for each critical resource
- Place your second settlement to complement your first (fill resource gaps)
- Aim for access to all five resources or position near useful ports if resource diversity isn't possible
- Always consider which settlements opponents are likely to place and avoid areas that will become contested
- Place roads pointing toward valuable future expansion spots, not toward the center
- Consider the long-term impact: settlements that can't expand are less valuable

MID-GAME RESOURCE PRIORITIES:
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each possible build (cities: 1VP for 5 resources is most efficient)
- Early phase: Secure at least one good source of brick and wood for minimal expansion
- Growth phase: Prioritize ore and wheat production for city upgrades (3VP for 5 resources is optimal)
- Late phase: Focus on the fastest path to victory points, whether through buildings or development cards
- Avoid trading resources that opponents need for immediate victory point gains
- Use 4:1 trades only when necessary; prioritize port usage when possible

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and limited expansion options
- If you get an early knight, save it for defense or until you can start building toward largest army
- Time monopoly card usage for when opponents likely have accumulated specific resources
- Save year of plenty cards for completing crucial builds when you're short 1-2 specific resources
- Development cards are most valuable when:
  * You need hidden victory points to surprise opponents
  * You need knights to break up longest road or secure largest army
  * You're lacking wood/brick for expansion but have plenty of sheep/wheat/ore

EXPANSION STRATEGY:
- Build roads only with clear settlement locations in mind
- Target settlements that give you access to ports or new resources
- Block opponents' expansion paths when it gives you a strategic advantage
- Consider the timing of expansion vs. city upgrades based on your resource production
- Calculate whether longest road is achievable and worth the resource investment
- When deciding between a new settlement and a city upgrade, compare immediate vs. long-term returns

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-probability hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Save knight cards for breaking up opponent strategies or securing largest army
- Use knights defensively if you're producing valuable resources on high-probability hexes

TRADING TACTICS:
- Avoid trading resources that directly help opponents score points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades
- Trade excess resources before rolling 7 if you have more than 7 cards
- Consider bank/port trades when they enable an immediate build that advances your strategy
- When trading with players, try to receive resources that complete a build

ENDGAME STRATEGY:
- In the late game, hide your victory point potential (keep development cards hidden)
- Calculate the fastest path to 10 VP and focus exclusively on that path
- Be aware of the exact number of remaining development cards and their probabilities
- Track opponents' potential victory points, including hidden development cards
- If you're close to winning, prioritize actions that can be completed in a single turn

Before finalizing your action, check:
1. Is there a more efficient path to victory points?
2. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
3. Does this move help or hinder opponents?
4. Is there a defensive move needed to prevent an opponent from winning?
5. Are you properly diversified against dice probability?

Board Understanding Guide:

- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 10 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Save resources this turn to build a road next turn toward node 19
2. Continue expansion toward sheep production at node 19
3. Mid-game: Focus on city upgrades using my strong ore and wheat production
4. Late game: Consider development cards for hidden VPs and special abilities

# Game Analysis - Catan Turn 10

I'll analyze the current game state and available actions to determine the optimal move.

## Current Resources
I have: 2 🧱BRICK, 1 🐑SHEEP, 1 🌾WHEAT, 2 ⛏️ORE

## Available Actions
[0] End turn
[1] Buy development card (costs 1 🐑SHEEP, 1 🌾WHEAT, 1 ⛏️ORE)

## Victory Path Analysis
I currently have 2 VPs from my settlements. I need 8 more to win.
- My opponent also has 2 VPs
- Neither of us has longest road or largest army yet

## Production Analysis
My settlements produce:
- Settlement at node 1: 🧱3, 🌲8, 🌾10
- Settlement at node 20: ⛏️9, 🌾10
- Strong in: wood (8), ore (9), and wheat (10)
- Weak in: sheep (none) 
- The robber is currently on a sheep hex (-1, 1, 0) which doesn't affect me

## Current Plan Evaluation
My current plan involves:
1. Saving resources to build a road next turn toward node 19
2. Expanding toward sheep production at node 19
3. Mid-game focus on city upgrades using ore and wheat
4. Late-game development cards

This plan still makes sense given my resource production pattern, but let me evaluate my immediate options.

## Option Evaluation

Option 0: End Turn
- I'd retain my resources for next turn (2 brick, 1 sheep, 1 wheat, 2 ore)
- If I wait, I could potentially build a road next turn (if I get more brick or wood)
- With good ore/wheat production, I could be close to a city or development card in 1-2 turns

Option 1: Buy Development Card
- Cost: 1 sheep, 1 wheat, 1 ore
- Remaining resources: 2 brick, 0 sheep, 0 wheat, 1 ore
- Benefits:
  * 25% chance of immediate victory point
  * Potential knight for defense or largest army
  * Potential monopoly or year of plenty
- Drawbacks:
  * Uses resources that could help with expansion
  * Doesn't advance my immediate expansion plan toward node 19

## Strategic Considerations
- I'm early in the game (turn 10)
- I have very limited sheep production, making development cards harder to acquire later
- My plan to expand toward sheep production at node 19 is sound
- I can't build a road this turn as I don't have enough wood
- Buying a development card now would leave me with 2 brick and 1 ore, which doesn't enable any immediate builds next turn

## Decision
I should adjust my plan slightly. While expansion toward node 19 for sheep production remains important, development cards offer strategic value, especially with my limited sheep production.

<plan>
1. Buy a development card now to potentially gain a victory point or useful special card
2. Continue saving brick and ore for future expansion toward node 19 for sheep production
3. Mid-game: Focus on city upgrades using my strong ore and wheat production
4. Late game: Use development cards for hidden VPs and special abilities
</plan>

Given my resource limitations and the potential value of a development card (possibility of a victory point, knight, or utility card), buying a development card now makes the most strategic sense, especially since I can't build a road this turn anyway.

RESPONSE:
# Game Analysis for Turn 12

I'll analyze the current game state and determine the optimal action.

## Current Situation Assessment:
- I have 2 VP from my 2 settlements
- Resources: 3 🧱BRICK, 1 ⛏️ORE
- I have 1 KNIGHT development card
- The robber is on the sheep hex (-1, 1, 0) with a 6 value (high probability)
- My opponent (RED) has 7 hidden resource cards

## Analyzing Available Actions:
1. **Option 0: Play Knight card**
   - Benefits:
     - Move the robber from the sheep hex which currently blocks a high-probability 6
     - Potentially steal a useful resource from RED (who has 7 cards)
     - Get 1 knight toward Largest Army (3 VP)
   - Considerations:
     - The sheep hex doesn't directly affect my production
     - But it's affecting RED's production significantly as they have two settlements on it
     - RED has a large hand (7 cards), suggesting they might be preparing for a big move

2. **Option 1: Roll the dice**
   - Benefits:
     - Normal game progression with chance to gain more resources
   - Risks:
     - If I roll a 7, I can move the robber anyway
     - RED has 7 cards which means they'd lose half on a 7 roll

## Strategic Decision Making:
Looking at RED's position, they have two settlements on the blocked sheep hex (6), which is a high-probability number. They're already holding 7 cards despite this blockage. If I roll and the sheep hex produces, they might gain enough resources for significant advancement.

Playing the knight now would:
1. Continue to disrupt RED's resource engine
2. Potentially steal a useful card from their large hand
3. Begin my path toward the Largest Army (3 VP)

However, I should consider where to move the robber. RED's settlements are on:
- 🧱3, 🐑6, ⛏️9
- 🌾4, 🐑6

The most impactful place would be to keep it on the 🐑6 or move it to ⛏️9 to continue disrupting RED's production.

## Plan Adjustment:
<plan>
1. Play knight to disrupt RED's resource production - ideally keep blocking their 6 sheep or move to their 9 ore
2. Continue saving brick and ore for future expansion toward node 19 for sheep production
3. Mid-game: Focus on city upgrades using my strong ore and wheat production
4. Late game: Use development cards for hidden VPs and special abilities
</plan>

## Final Decision:
Given RED's large hand size and production potential, I should play the knight to disrupt their momentum before rolling.

# Analyzing Robber Placement Options

I need to decide where to place the robber to maximize my advantage while disrupting my opponent's resource production. Let me analyze each option:

## Option [0]: Move robber to (0, 0, 0) and steal from RED
- This is the brick hex with number 3 (low probability)
- RED has a settlement here, so I can steal from them
- Brick is valuable early game but less critical mid-game
- This is my only brick source too, so I'd be hurting myself as well

## Option [1]: Move robber to (1, -1, 0)
- This is the wood hex with number 8 (high probability)
- This is my wood source and I'd be hurting my own production significantly
- Cannot steal from anyone
- Bad option for me

## Option [2]: Move robber to (0, -1, 1)
- This is a desert tile - no production to block
- Cannot steal from anyone
- Completely ineffective option

## Option [3]: Move robber to (-1, 0, 1) and steal from RED
- This is a wheat hex with number 4 (low-medium probability)
- RED has a settlement here, so I can steal from them
- Wheat is important for city upgrades and development cards
- Could disrupt RED's development plans

## Option [4]: Move robber to (0, 1, -1) and steal from RED
- This is an ore hex with number 9 (good probability)
- RED has a settlement here, so I can steal from them
- Ore is critical for city upgrades and development cards
- Important resource to block in the mid-game
- This would also disrupt my own ore production at node 20

## Option [5]: Move robber to (1, 0, -1)
- This is a wheat hex with number 10 (low probability)
- This would hurt my own wheat production at both my settlements
- Cannot steal from anyone
- Bad option for me

## Strategic Considerations:
- RED has 7 hidden cards, suggesting they may have accumulated resources
- Blocking RED's high probability resources is a priority
- The robber is currently on RED's sheep (6), which is high probability
- I should consider both blocking production and what I might steal

## Decision:
Looking at RED's settlements, they have good production of sheep (6), ore (9), and some wheat (4) and brick (3). The highest value hex to block would be sheep (6), but it's already blocked. The next best option is ore (9), which is important for city development.

Option [4] allows me to block RED's ore production (good probability 9) and steal a card from them. While this also affects my own ore production, it's more critical to prevent RED from accumulating ore for city upgrades. Given that RED has 7 cards, there's a good chance I might steal something valuable.

<plan>
1. Move robber to the ore hex to disrupt RED's city development
2. Continue saving brick and ore for expansion toward node 19 for sheep production
3. Mid-game: Focus on city upgrades using my strong ore and wheat production
4. Late game: Use development cards for hidden VPs and special abilities
</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL SETTLEMENT PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Place settlements on high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Target at least one spot with good ore and wheat production for city development
- Try to secure at least one high-probability spot (5, 6, 8, 9) for each critical resource
- Place your second settlement to complement your first (fill resource gaps)
- Aim for access to all five resources or position near useful ports if resource diversity isn't possible
- Always consider which settlements opponents are likely to place and avoid areas that will become contested
- Place roads pointing toward valuable future expansion spots, not toward the center
- Consider the long-term impact: settlements that can't expand are less valuable

MID-GAME RESOURCE PRIORITIES:
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each possible build (cities: 1VP for 5 resources is most efficient)
- Early phase: Secure at least one good source of brick and wood for minimal expansion
- Growth phase: Prioritize ore and wheat production for city upgrades (3VP for 5 resources is optimal)
- Late phase: Focus on the fastest path to victory points, whether through buildings or development cards
- Avoid trading resources that opponents need for immediate victory point gains
- Use 4:1 trades only when necessary; prioritize port usage when possible

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and limited expansion options
- If you get an early knight, save it for defense or until you can start building toward largest army
- Time monopoly card usage for when opponents likely have accumulated specific resources
- Save year of plenty cards for completing crucial builds when you're short 1-2 specific resources
- Development cards are most valuable when:
  * You need hidden victory points to surprise opponents
  * You need knights to break up longest road or secure largest army
  * You're lacking wood/brick for expansion but have plenty of sheep/wheat/ore

EXPANSION STRATEGY:
- Build roads only with clear settlement locations in mind
- Target settlements that give you access to ports or new resources
- Block opponents' expansion paths when it gives you a strategic advantage
- Consider the timing of expansion vs. city upgrades based on your resource production
- Calculate whether longest road is achievable and worth the resource investment
- When deciding between a new settlement and a city upgrade, compare immediate vs. long-term returns

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-probability hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Save knight cards for breaking up opponent strategies or securing largest army
- Use knights defensively if you're producing valuable resources on high-probability hexes

TRADING TACTICS:
- Avoid trading resources that directly help opponents score points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades
- Trade excess resources before rolling 7 if you have more than 7 cards
- Consider bank/port trades when they enable an immediate build that advances your strategy
- When trading with players, try to receive resources that complete a build

ENDGAME STRATEGY:
- In the late game, hide your victory point potential (keep development cards hidden)
- Calculate the fastest path to 10 VP and focus exclusively on that path
- Be aware of the exact number of remaining development cards and their probabilities
- Track opponents' potential victory points, including hidden development cards
- If you're close to winning, prioritize actions that can be completed in a single turn

Before finalizing your action, check:
1. Is there a more efficient path to victory points?
2. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
3. Does this move help or hinder opponents?
4. Is there a defensive move needed to prevent an opponent from winning?
5. Are you properly diversified against dice probability?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 12 | Player: BLUE | Action: MOVE_ROBBER

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Move robber to the ore hex to disrupt RED's city development
2. Continue saving brick and ore for expansion toward node 19 for sheep production
3. Mid-game: Focus on city upgrades using my strong ore and wheat production
4. Late game: Use development cards for hidden VPs and special abilities

# Game State Analysis for Robber Placement

I'll carefully analyze the current game state to determine the optimal robber placement move.

## Current Position Assessment
- I have 2 VP from 2 settlements
- RED also has 2 VP from 2 settlements
- RED has 6 hidden cards, which is approaching the 7-card limit
- RED has good production of sheep (6), ore (9), and wheat (4) - all valuable for development cards

## Resource Analysis
- RED's settlements are producing:
  * Sheep (6 - high probability) at both settlements
  * Ore (9 - good probability) at one settlement
  * Wheat (4 - low probability) at one settlement
  * Brick (3 - low probability) at one settlement

- I (BLUE) have:
  * 3 brick, 1 sheep, 1 ore currently
  * Production from wood (8), brick (3), wheat (10), and ore (9)

## Strategic Considerations

1. **Blocking opponent's key resources**: RED has strong sheep production and good ore production. These are crucial for development cards and city upgrades.

2. **Protecting my development path**: My plan includes expansion toward node 19 for sheep production, so I need to continue saving brick and ore.

3. **Stealing potential**: RED has 6 cards, so there's a good chance to steal something valuable.

4. **Production impact**: I should minimize impact on my own production while maximizing disruption to RED.

## Evaluation of Options

[0] Move robber to (0, 0, 0) and steal from RED
- This blocks RED's brick production (3 value)
- But also blocks my own brick production
- Not optimal as brick is less critical for RED's development card strategy
- I need brick for my expansion plan

[1] Move robber to (1, -1, 0)
- This blocks the wood (8) hex
- Would block my good wood production
- No steal opportunity
- Very poor choice

[2] Move robber to (0, -1, 1)
- This blocks the desert
- No production impact
- No steal opportunity
- Completely ineffective move

[3] Move robber to (-1, 0, 1) and steal from RED
- This blocks wheat (4) hex
- Moderate impact on RED's city development path
- Can steal from RED
- Wheat is important for RED's development card strategy

[4] Move robber to (-1, 1, 0) and steal from RED
- This blocks sheep (6) hex - a high probability number
- Major impact on RED's development card strategy
- RED has both settlements on this hex (maximum disruption)
- Can steal from RED
- Sheep is RED's strongest production resource

[5] Move robber to (1, 0, -1)
- This blocks wheat (10) hex
- Would block my own wheat production
- No steal opportunity
- Not optimal

## Decision

Option [4] is clearly optimal because:
1. It blocks RED's strongest production resource (sheep on a 6)
2. It affects both of RED's settlements simultaneously
3. It allows me to steal from RED who has 6 cards
4. It doesn't affect any of my own production
5. Blocking sheep will significantly slow RED's development card acquisition

<plan>
1. Move robber to the sheep hex (-1, 1, 0) to disrupt RED's strong sheep production
2. Continue saving brick and ore for expansion toward node 19 for sheep production
3. Mid-game: Focus on city upgrades using my strong ore and wheat production
4. Late game: Use development cards for hidden VPs and special abilities

# Game Analysis for Turn 12

Let me analyze the current game state and my available actions to determine the optimal move.

## Current Game State Assessment:
- I have 2 VP from my 2 settlements
- My resources: 4 🧱BRICK, 1 🐑SHEEP, 1 ⛏️ORE
- I lack WOOD and WHEAT for building
- The robber is already on the sheep hex (-1, 1, 0), blocking RED's sheep production
- RED player has 5 hidden cards, but cannot immediately win (only 2 VP showing)

## Resource Production Analysis:
- My settlements produce: 
  * Node 1: BRICK(3), WOOD(8), WHEAT(10)
  * Node 20: ORE(9), WHEAT(10)
- I have good production potential on high numbers (8, 9, 10)
- I'm missing reliable SHEEP production

## Available Actions:
- [0] End turn
- [1-4] Maritime trades exchanging BRICK for other resources

## Strategic Evaluation:
I have accumulated 4 BRICK but don't have enough WOOD to build roads for expansion. My existing plan mentioned expanding toward node 19 for sheep production, but I need WOOD to build roads first.

Looking at potential trades:
- Option 2 (Trading for WOOD) would allow me to build 1 road this turn, making progress toward my expansion goal
- Option 3 (Trading for WHEAT) could help move toward a development card, but I still need another SHEEP
- Options 1 and 4 don't align with my immediate needs

The 4:1 maritime trade is inefficient, but I have an excess of BRICK that I can leverage. Getting WOOD would be most aligned with my expansion plan, as it would let me build a road and position myself for future settlement placement.

<plan>
1. Trade BRICK for WOOD to build a road toward node 19
2. Next turn, continue expansion toward node 19 for sheep production
3. Mid-game: Build cities at my existing settlements using ore and wheat production
4. Late game: Purchase development cards for victory points and special abilities
</plan>

Given my resource situation and strategic priorities, the most optimal action is:

\boxed{2}

This trade will give me WOOD, allowing me to build a road this turn and make progress toward my expansion strategy.

- Place roads pointing toward valuable future expansion spots, not toward the center
- Consider the long-term impact: settlements that can't expand are less valuable

MID-GAME RESOURCE PRIORITIES:
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each possible build (cities: 1VP for 5 resources is most efficient)
- Early phase: Secure at least one good source of brick and wood for minimal expansion
- Growth phase: Prioritize ore and wheat production for city upgrades (3VP for 5 resources is optimal)
- Late phase: Focus on the fastest path to victory points, whether through buildings or development cards
- Avoid trading resources that opponents need for immediate victory point gains
- Use 4:1 trades only when necessary; prioritize port usage when possible

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and limited expansion options
- If you get an early knight, save it for defense or until you can start building toward largest army
- Time monopoly card usage for when opponents likely have accumulated specific resources
- Save year of plenty cards for completing crucial builds when you're short 1-2 specific resources
- Development cards are most valuable when:
  * You need hidden victory points to surprise opponents
  * You need knights to break up longest road or secure largest army
  * You're lacking wood/brick for expansion but have plenty of sheep/wheat/ore

EXPANSION STRATEGY:
- Build roads only with clear settlement locations in mind
- Target settlements that give you access to ports or new resources
- Block opponents' expansion paths when it gives you a strategic advantage
- Consider the timing of expansion vs. city upgrades based on your resource production
- Calculate whether longest road is achievable and worth the resource investment
- When deciding between a new settlement and a city upgrade, compare immediate vs. long-term returns

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-probability hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Save knight cards for breaking up opponent strategies or securing largest army
- Use knights defensively if you're producing valuable resources on high-probability hexes

TRADING TACTICS:
- Avoid trading resources that directly help opponents score points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades
- Trade excess resources before rolling 7 if you have more than 7 cards
- Consider bank/port trades when they enable an immediate build that advances your strategy
- When trading with players, try to receive resources that complete a build

ENDGAME STRATEGY:
- In the late game, hide your victory point potential (keep development cards hidden)
- Calculate the fastest path to 10 VP and focus exclusively on that path
- Be aware of the exact number of remaining development cards and their probabilities
- Track opponents' potential victory points, including hidden development cards
- If you're close to winning, prioritize actions that can be completed in a single turn

Before finalizing your action, check:
1. Is there a more efficient path to victory points?
2. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
3. Does this move help or hinder opponents?
4. Is there a defensive move needed to prevent an opponent from winning?
5. Are you properly diversified against dice probability?

# Game Analysis for Turn 14

Let me analyze the current game state and determine the best action to take.

## Current Game State Assessment
- I have 2 settlements producing key resources
- My resources: 1 🌲WOOD, 1 🧱BRICK, 1 🐑SHEEP, 2 ⛏️ORE
- I have exactly enough resources to build a road (1 🌲WOOD, 1 🧱BRICK)
- The robber is on the 🐑6 hex, blocking a strong sheep production tile
- There are 6 possible road placements available

## Road Building Option Analysis

Let me evaluate each road option based on their strategic value:

1. Edge (1, 2): Extends from settlement at node 1 toward the desert hex
2. Edge (0, 20): Connects my two settlements
3. Edge (0, 5): Extends toward opponent's settlement at node 5
4. Edge (20, 22): Extends from my settlement at node 20 toward unexplored territory
5. Edge (1, 6): Extends from settlement at node 1 toward unexplored territory
6. Edge (19, 21): Extends from my existing road network toward unexplored territory

## Strategic Considerations

### Settlement Expansion Potential
- I need to identify which roads lead toward valuable open settlement locations
- By expanding my road network, I can:
  1. Work toward longest road (3 VP)
  2. Reach new settlement spots with good resource production
  3. Block opponent's expansion paths

### Resource Production Balance
My current production:
- 🧱BRICK: From 3 (weak)
- 🌲WOOD: From 8 (strong)
- 🐑SHEEP: None directly
- ⛏️ORE: From 9 (decent)
- 🌾WHEAT: From 10 (weak)

I'm missing reliable sheep production, which will be needed for development cards and settlements.

## Decision Making

Looking at the options:
- Option 5 (road at edge (1, 6)) expands toward node 7, which is connected to the 🌲8 hex - this duplicates a resource I already produce well
- Option 4 (road at edge (20, 22)) moves toward a potential wheat-producing area, which complements my current production
- Option 2 (road at edge (0, 20)) connects my settlements but doesn't expand my territory
- Option 6 (road at edge (19, 21)) expands into an area that could provide access to more nodes
- Options 1 and 3 don't seem to lead toward valuable territory

After analyzing the board, option 4 (edge (20, 22)) seems most promising as it:
1. Expands toward node 23 which connects to the 🌾10 wheat hex
2. Moves toward potential future expansion
3. Helps work toward longest road

<plan>
1. Build a road toward node 22 to prepare for settlement expansion
2. Focus on reaching node 23 for additional wheat production
3. Work toward city upgrades at existing settlements using ore and wheat
4. Purchase development cards once sheep production is secured
5. Position for longest road bonus (if feasible)
</plan>

Based on this analysis, I choose to build a road at edge (20, 22):

# Game Analysis - Robber Placement Decision

I need to carefully analyze the optimal robber placement to maximize my strategic position in this game.

## Resource Control Analysis
Let me examine what each hex produces and who it affects:
- (0, 0, 0): Brick 3 - affects both me and RED at nodes 1 and 5
- (1, -1, 0): Wood 8 - affects only me at node 1 (high-probability resource)
- (0, -1, 1): Desert - no production
- (-1, 0, 1): Wheat 4 - affects RED at node 15
- (-1, 1, 0): Sheep 6 - affects RED at nodes 5 and 15 (high-probability resource)
- (0, 1, -1): Ore 9 - affects both me and RED at nodes 5 and 20
- (1, 0, -1): Wheat 10 - currently blocked by robber, affects me at nodes 1 and 20

## Opponent Status
- RED has 4 hidden resource cards
- RED has settlements at nodes 5 and 15
- RED's key production: Brick (3), Sheep (6), Ore (9), Wheat (4)

## Strategic Priorities
1. Block RED's highest probability resource
2. Target a resource I don't need immediately but RED likely depends on
3. Position for my next moves: road building and settlement at node 22/23

## Robber Placement Options
Looking at the available actions:
- [0] Brick 3 - hurts both me and RED equally (⭐ each)
- [1] Wood 8 - hurts only me significantly (⭐⭐⭐)
- [2] Desert - no effect (waste of robber)
- [3] Wheat 4 - hurts RED (⭐) moderately
- [4] Sheep 6 - hurts RED significantly (⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ between two settlements)
- [5] Ore 9 - hurts both me and RED (⭐⭐ each)

## Decision Analysis
- Option [4] is optimal as it blocks RED's sheep production (6) which appears to be their strongest resource (two settlements on a high-probability number)
- This helps me relatively by reducing RED's production while still letting me build toward my plan
- RED has 4 cards, so there's a good chance of stealing something useful
- Sheep isn't immediately critical for my next build (road toward 22/23), so I'm not blocking myself

<plan>
1. Block RED's sheep production and slow their development
2. Continue building a road toward node 22/23 for wheat expansion
3. Work toward city upgrades using ore and wheat
4. Purchase development cards when possible
5. Position for longest road bonus in future turns
</plan>

Moving the robber to (-1, 1, 0) and stealing from RED is my optimal move as it significantly impacts RED's production while minimizing impact on my strategy.

# Game State Analysis

Let's analyze the current game state and available actions:

## Current Resources
I have: 1 Wood, 1 Brick, 1 Sheep, 2 Ore

## Victory Point Status
- BLUE (me): 2 VP (2 settlements)
- RED: 2 VP (2 settlements)

## Possible Actions
- End turn [0]
- Build a road at various locations [1-6] (Cost: 1 Wood, 1 Brick each)

## Production Analysis
My settlements:
- Node 1: Produces brick(3), wood(8), wheat(10)
- Node 20: Produces ore(9), wheat(10)

This gives me good wheat and ore production for city upgrades, and some wood/brick for expansion.

## Strategic Considerations

1. **Road Building Options**:
   - I currently have exactly enough resources (1 wood, 1 brick) to build one road.
   - This is an opportunity to extend my position before RED's next turn.

2. **Expansion Potential**:
   - I should build a road that leads to a valuable settlement location.
   - Road (22, 23) would continue my expansion toward wheat production.
   - Road (0, 5) might allow me to block RED's expansion path.

3. **Resource Strategy**:
   - I have 2 ore already - continuing to save for a city (needs 3 ore, 2 wheat) is viable.
   - Building a road now uses my brick and wood, which prevents resource waste if a 7 is rolled.

4. **Opponent Considerations**:
   - RED's settlement at node 5 is on brick(3), sheep(6), and ore(9).
   - RED's settlement at node 15 is on wheat(4) and sheep(6).
   - The robber is currently blocking RED's sheep production at (-1, 1, 0).

Looking at the map, I see that option [3] to build a road at edge (22, 23) aligns with my current plan of expanding toward more wheat production. This continues my road network in a promising direction, while using resources I might otherwise lose to a 7 roll.

<plan>
1. Build road toward node 23 for potential wheat settlement
2. Continue saving ore for city upgrades
3. Look for development card opportunities with future sheep/wheat/ore
4. Work toward securing more wheat production for city upgrades
5. Position for possible longest road in the mid-game
</plan>

Given my current resources and strategic position, I'll build the road at edge (22, 23) to continue my expansion path toward more wheat production.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL SETTLEMENT PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Place settlements on high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Target at least one spot with good ore and wheat production for city development
- Try to secure at least one high-probability spot (5, 6, 8, 9) for each critical resource
- Place your second settlement to complement your first (fill resource gaps)
- Aim for access to all five resources or position near useful ports if resource diversity isn't possible
- Always consider which settlements opponents are likely to place and avoid areas that will become contested
- Place roads pointing toward valuable future expansion spots, not toward the center
- Consider the long-term impact: settlements that can't expand are less valuable

MID-GAME RESOURCE PRIORITIES:
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each possible build (cities: 1VP for 5 resources is most efficient)
- Early phase: Secure at least one good source of brick and wood for minimal expansion
- Growth phase: Prioritize ore and wheat production for city upgrades (3VP for 5 resources is optimal)
- Late phase: Focus on the fastest path to victory points, whether through buildings or development cards
- Avoid trading resources that opponents need for immediate victory point gains
- Use 4:1 trades only when necessary; prioritize port usage when possible

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and limited expansion options
- If you get an early knight, save it for defense or until you can start building toward largest army
- Time monopoly card usage for when opponents likely have accumulated specific resources
- Save year of plenty cards for completing crucial builds when you're short 1-2 specific resources
- Development cards are most valuable when:
  * You need hidden victory points to surprise opponents
  * You need knights to break up longest road or secure largest army
  * You're lacking wood/brick for expansion but have plenty of sheep/wheat/ore

EXPANSION STRATEGY:
- Build roads only with clear settlement locations in mind
- Target settlements that give you access to ports or new resources
- Block opponents' expansion paths when it gives you a strategic advantage
- Consider the timing of expansion vs. city upgrades based on your resource production
- Calculate whether longest road is achievable and worth the resource investment
- When deciding between a new settlement and a city upgrade, compare immediate vs. long-term returns

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-probability hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Save knight cards for breaking up opponent strategies or securing largest army
- Use knights defensively if you're producing valuable resources on high-probability hexes

TRADING TACTICS:
- Avoid trading resources that directly help opponents score points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades
- Trade excess resources before rolling 7 if you have more than 7 cards
- Consider bank/port trades when they enable an immediate build that advances your strategy
- When trading with players, try to receive resources that complete a build

ENDGAME STRATEGY:
- In the late game, hide your victory point potential (keep development cards hidden)
- Calculate the fastest path to 10 VP and focus exclusively on that path
- Be aware of the exact number of remaining development cards and their probabilities
- Track opponents' potential victory points, including hidden development cards
- If you're close to winning, prioritize actions that can be completed in a single turn

Before finalizing your action, check:
1. Is there a more efficient path to victory points?
2. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
3. Does this move help or hinder opponents?
4. Is there a defensive move needed to prevent an opponent from winning?
5. Are you properly diversified against dice probability?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 28 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Build road toward node 23 for potential wheat settlement
2. Continue saving ore for city upgrades
3. Look for development card opportunities with future sheep/wheat/ore

5. Position for possible longest road in the mid-game
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.

# Game Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state thoroughly:

## Victory Point Status:
- I have 2 VP (2 settlements)
- Red also has 2 VP (2 settlements)
- We're tied early in the game

## My Resources:
- 1 🌲 Wood
- 1 🐑 Sheep
- 2 🌾 Wheat
- 4 ⛏️ Ore

## Available Actions:
1. Upgrade settlement at node 1 (Cost: 2 🌾Wheat, 3 ⛏️Ore)
2. Upgrade settlement at node 20 (Cost: 2 🌾Wheat, 3 ⛏️Ore)
3. Buy development card (Cost: 1 🐑Sheep, 1 🌾Wheat, 1 ⛏️Ore)
4-7. Various 4:1 trades using ore
0. End turn

## Production Analysis:
- Node 1: Produces brick (3), wood (8), wheat (10) - excellent numbers
- Node 20: Produces ore (9), wheat (10) - good numbers
- I need to improve wheat production for city development

## Decision Process:

1. **City Upgrade Option**: I have 2 wheat and 4 ore. I need 2 wheat and 3 ore for a city. I have the exact resources needed for one city. This would give me +1 VP and double production at one location.

2. **Which Settlement to Upgrade?**:
   - Node 1 produces from 3 hexes (brick-3, wood-8, wheat-10)
   - Node 20 produces from 2 hexes (ore-9, wheat-10)
   - Node 1 has more diverse resources and includes wood (8) which is very good probability

3. **Development Card Option**: Would cost 1 sheep, 1 wheat, 1 ore. Could yield VP, knights, or useful action cards. But would delay immediate point gain.

4. **Trade Options**: Using 4:1 trade is inefficient and none of these trades enable better builds immediately.

5. **Current Plan**: My plan mentions saving ore for city upgrades, which I can execute now.

The efficient play is to upgrade the settlement at node 1 to a city. This gives an immediate VP (bringing me to 3/10) and doubles my production on three important resources (including the high-probability wood-8 hex). 

Upgrading node 1 rather than node 20 is optimal because:
1. Node 1 produces from more resources (3 vs 2)
2. Node 1 includes the valuable 8-wood, which will give me 2 wood per roll
3. Doubling production on a hex with three resources is more valuable than one with two

<plan>
1. Upgrade settlement at node 1 to city for immediate VP and doubled production
2. Next, focus on acquiring brick to expand toward potential wheat production at node 23
3. Continue saving resources for another city or development cards depending on dice rolls
4. Position for possible longest road in the mid-game
5. Monitor RED's resources and strategy to anticipate and counter threats

# Game Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state and my options carefully:

## Current Resources
I have: 1 wood, 1 sheep, 3 wheat, 1 ore

## Victory Points
- Current: 3/10 (1 settlement + 1 city + 1 played knight)
- RED has: 2/10 (2 settlements)

## Available Actions
- [0] End turn
- [1] Buy a development card (costs 1 sheep, 1 wheat, 1 ore)

## Strategy Assessment
Looking at my current plan:
1. I've already completed step 1 (upgrading settlement at node 1 to a city)
2. Step 2 is to acquire brick for expansion toward node 23
3. I currently lack brick to expand

Development Card Analysis:
- Potential benefits:
  - Victory point card (25% chance) - immediate hidden VP
  - Knight card (54% chance) - move toward largest army (need 2 more)
  - Year of Plenty/Monopoly - resource acquisition flexibility

Given that I can't build anything else this turn due to lack of brick, a development card is a strategic investment that could provide:
- Hidden victory points
- Defense against the robber (RED has 7 cards, might get hit by a 7)
- Future resource flexibility through Year of Plenty/Monopoly

<plan>
1. Buy a development card now to potentially accelerate victory point acquisition
2. Continue focus on acquiring brick to expand toward potential wheat production at node 23
3. If I get a knight, save it for breaking up opponent's longest road or securing largest army
4. If I get a victory point, keep it hidden until I can win in a single turn
5. If I get Year of Plenty or Monopoly, use strategically to acquire missing resources
</plan>

The development card provides the highest expected value for my current position, allowing me to potentially get closer to victory while waiting to acquire brick for expansion.

- Early phase: Secure at least one good source of brick and wood for minimal expansion
- Growth phase: Prioritize ore and wheat production for city upgrades (3VP for 5 resources is optimal)
- Late phase: Focus on the fastest path to victory points, whether through buildings or development cards
- Avoid trading resources that opponents need for immediate victory point gains
- Use 4:1 trades only when necessary; prioritize port usage when possible

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and limited expansion options
- If you get an early knight, save it for defense or until you can start building toward largest army
- Time monopoly card usage for when opponents likely have accumulated specific resources
- Save year of plenty cards for completing crucial builds when you're short 1-2 specific resources
- Development cards are most valuable when:
  * You need hidden victory points to surprise opponents
  * You need knights to break up longest road or secure largest army
  * You're lacking wood/brick for expansion but have plenty of sheep/wheat/ore

EXPANSION STRATEGY:
- Build roads only with clear settlement locations in mind
- Target settlements that give you access to ports or new resources
- Block opponents' expansion paths when it gives you a strategic advantage
- Consider the timing of expansion vs. city upgrades based on your resource production
- Calculate whether longest road is achievable and worth the resource investment
- When deciding between a new settlement and a city upgrade, compare immediate vs. long-term returns

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-probability hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Save knight cards for breaking up opponent strategies or securing largest army
- Use knights defensively if you're producing valuable resources on high-probability hexes

TRADING TACTICS:
- Avoid trading resources that directly help opponents score points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades
- Trade excess resources before rolling 7 if you have more than 7 cards
- Consider bank/port trades when they enable an immediate build that advances your strategy
- When trading with players, try to receive resources that complete a build

ENDGAME STRATEGY:
- In the late game, hide your victory point potential (keep development cards hidden)
- Calculate the fastest path to 10 VP and focus exclusively on that path
- Be aware of the exact number of remaining development cards and their probabilities
- Track opponents' potential victory points, including hidden development cards
- If you're close to winning, prioritize actions that can be completed in a single turn

Before finalizing your action, check:
1. Is there a more efficient path to victory points?
2. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
3. Does this move help or hinder opponents?
4. Is there a defensive move needed to prevent an opponent from winning?
5. Are you properly diversified against dice probability?

- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 32 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Buy a development card now to potentially accelerate victory point acquisition
2. Continue focus on acquiring brick to expand toward potential wheat production at node 23
3. If I get a knight, save it for breaking up opponent's longest road or securing largest army
4. If I get a victory point, keep it hidden until I can win in a single turn
5. If I get Year of Plenty or Monopoly, use strategically to acquire missing resources

# Game Analysis for Settler of Catan Turn 32

I'll analyze the current game state and available options to determine the optimal action.

## Current Status Assessment
- I have 3/10 victory points (1 city = 2 VP, 1 settlement = 1 VP)
- I possess 1 wood, 2 wheat, and 1 unplayed knight development card
- I've already played 1 knight card (moving toward largest army)
- Red has 7 hidden resource cards and 2 VP (2 settlements)
- The robber is currently on a 6-value sheep hex, blocking Red's productive resource

## Available Actions
0. Play a knight card - Move the robber and steal a resource
1. Roll the dice

## Strategic Considerations

### Option 0: Play Knight Card
- Benefits:
  * I would have 2 knights played, putting me closer to largest army (3 knights needed)
  * I could strategically move the robber to block Red's production
  * I could steal one of Red's 7 resources (good odds of getting something useful)
  * Playing now prevents losing it if I roll a 7 later
- Drawbacks:
  * The robber is already on Red's productive sheep hex (value 6)
  * I might want to save the knight for a more critical moment

### Option 1: Roll the Dice
- Benefits:
  * Chance to gain more resources before deciding how to use my knight
  * I could get brick which would help my expansion plan
  * I currently don't have enough resources to build anything significant, so resources from a roll would be valuable
- Risks:
  * Rolling a 7 would force Red to discard and I'd lose the benefit of stealing with my knight
  * But Red has 7 cards, so a 7 roll would hurt them significantly

## Decision Logic

Looking at Red's position, they have 7 cards which means they're at risk if a 7 is rolled. The robber is already on Red's sheep production (a 6 value hex), which is effective positioning.

My current resources (1 wood, 2 wheat) aren't enough for any meaningful build. Rolling first gives me a chance to collect more resources - especially if I hit my productive numbers (3, 8, 9, 10).

Since I can't immediately build anything significant with my current resources, and the robber is already well-positioned on Red's productive hex, I should prioritize resource acquisition by rolling first.

<plan>
1. Roll to acquire more resources
2. If I get brick, focus on expanding toward node 23 for more wheat production
3. Save knight card for a more strategic moment (breaking up opponent's road or when I'm closer to largest army)
4. Continue working toward city upgrades and strategic settlements
5. Monitor Red closely as they have 7 cards and might be planning a significant build
</plan>

The optimal action is to roll the dice.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL SETTLEMENT PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Place settlements on high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Target at least one spot with good ore and wheat production for city development
- Try to secure at least one high-probability spot (5, 6, 8, 9) for each critical resource
- Place your second settlement to complement your first (fill resource gaps)
- Aim for access to all five resources or position near useful ports if resource diversity isn't possible
- Always consider which settlements opponents are likely to place and avoid areas that will become contested
- Place roads pointing toward valuable future expansion spots, not toward the center
- Consider the long-term impact: settlements that can't expand are less valuable

MID-GAME RESOURCE PRIORITIES:
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each possible build (cities: 1VP for 5 resources is most efficient)
- Early phase: Secure at least one good source of brick and wood for minimal expansion
- Growth phase: Prioritize ore and wheat production for city upgrades (3VP for 5 resources is optimal)
- Late phase: Focus on the fastest path to victory points, whether through buildings or development cards
- Avoid trading resources that opponents need for immediate victory point gains
- Use 4:1 trades only when necessary; prioritize port usage when possible

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and limited expansion options
- If you get an early knight, save it for defense or until you can start building toward largest army
- Time monopoly card usage for when opponents likely have accumulated specific resources
- Save year of plenty cards for completing crucial builds when you're short 1-2 specific resources
- Development cards are most valuable when:
  * You need hidden victory points to surprise opponents
  * You need knights to break up longest road or secure largest army
  * You're lacking wood/brick for expansion but have plenty of sheep/wheat/ore

EXPANSION STRATEGY:
- Build roads only with clear settlement locations in mind
- Target settlements that give you access to ports or new resources
- Block opponents' expansion paths when it gives you a strategic advantage
- Consider the timing of expansion vs. city upgrades based on your resource production
- Calculate whether longest road is achievable and worth the resource investment
- When deciding between a new settlement and a city upgrade, compare immediate vs. long-term returns

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-probability hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Save knight cards for breaking up opponent strategies or securing largest army
- Use knights defensively if you're producing valuable resources on high-probability hexes

TRADING TACTICS:
- Avoid trading resources that directly help opponents score points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades
- Trade excess resources before rolling 7 if you have more than 7 cards
- Consider bank/port trades when they enable an immediate build that advances your strategy
- When trading with players, try to receive resources that complete a build

ENDGAME STRATEGY:
- In the late game, hide your victory point potential (keep development cards hidden)
- Calculate the fastest path to 10 VP and focus exclusively on that path
- Be aware of the exact number of remaining development cards and their probabilities
- Track opponents' potential victory points, including hidden development cards
- If you're close to winning, prioritize actions that can be completed in a single turn

Before finalizing your action, check:
1. Is there a more efficient path to victory points?
2. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
3. Does this move help or hinder opponents?
4. Is there a defensive move needed to prevent an opponent from winning?
5. Are you properly diversified against dice probability?

# Analyzing Robber Placement Options

I need to make a strategic robber move that maximizes my advantage while disrupting my opponent's progress. Let me analyze each option:

## Option Analysis:

**[0] Move robber to (0, 0, 0) and steal from RED**
- This is the brick (🧱3) hex
- RED has a settlement here (node 5)
- I also have a city here (node 1)
- I would be hurting my own brick production significantly
- Not optimal as I'm blocking my own city's resource

**[1] Move robber to (1, -1, 0)**
- This is the wood (🌲8) hex
- This is a high-probability number (8)
- I have a city at node 1 that produces from this hex
- Placing here would hurt my own production severely
- This is definitely not optimal

**[2] Move robber to (0, -1, 1)**
- This is a desert (🏜️) hex
- Robber on desert doesn't block any production
- Waste of a robber move
- Not optimal

**[3] Move robber to (-1, 0, 1) and steal from RED**
- This is the wheat (🌾4) hex
- RED has a settlement here (node 15)
- I don't have any buildings on this hex
- Blocks RED's wheat production (important for development)
- I can steal a card from RED who has 7 cards

**[4] Move robber to (0, 1, -1) and steal from RED**
- This is the ore (⛏️9) hex
- Both RED and I have settlements on this hex
- RED's settlement is at node 5
- My settlement is at node 20
- This blocks both my and RED's ore production
- Not ideal as I'm hurting my own ore production too

**[5] Move robber to (1, 0, -1)**
- This is the wheat (🌾10) hex
- I have both a city (node 1) and settlement (node 20) producing from this hex
- Placing here would severely hurt my own production
- Definitely not optimal

## Strategic Considerations:

1. RED has 7 hidden cards - could be stockpiling for a big move
2. I need to maintain my own production while disrupting RED
3. The most effective option is to block a resource RED needs but I don't produce
4. RED has settlements on wheat (🌾4), which I don't produce from that hex

<plan>
1. Focus on expanding toward node 23 for more wheat production if I get brick
2. Save knight card for breaking RED's potential roads or when I need to move the robber from my key resources
3. Work toward city upgrades by collecting ore and wheat
4. Continue monitoring RED's resources and potential builds
5. Consider development card purchases as an alternative path to victory
</plan>

Given these considerations, option [3] is clearly the best choice. It disrupts RED's wheat production without affecting my own resources, and gives me a chance to steal one of their 7 cards.

# Game Analysis for Settlers of Catan

I'll analyze the current state of the game and determine the best action.

## Current Game State
- I'm BLUE with 3/10 victory points
- I have 1 wood, 2 wheat, 1 ore, and 1 knight card
- RED has 2/10 victory points with 6 hidden resource cards
- The robber is currently on a wheat hex (-1, 0, 1) with value 4

## Resources Analysis
- My city at node 1 produces: brick (3), wood (8), wheat (10) 
- My settlement at node 20 produces: ore (9), wheat (10)
- Both wheat hexes have low probabilities (4 and 10)
- Wood (8) and ore (9) are good probability numbers

## Available Actions
1. [0] Play Knight card - Move the robber and steal a resource
2. [1] End my turn

## Decision Analysis

Looking at my current resources (1 wood, 2 wheat, 1 ore), I can't build anything this turn:
- Settlement needs 1 brick, 1 wood, 1 wheat, 1 sheep (missing brick and sheep)
- City needs 2 ore, 3 wheat (missing 1 ore, 1 wheat)
- Development card needs 1 ore, 1 wheat, 1 sheep (missing sheep)

If I play the knight card:
- I would move the robber from the wheat hex to a hex that RED is getting resources from
- Best targets would be either the ore (9) or sheep (6) hex since these are high probability
- I could potentially steal a useful resource from RED
- This would also give me 1 knight toward largest army (need 3 total)

If I end my turn:
- I keep my knight card for when it might be more strategically valuable
- RED might use their 6 cards for something significant

Since RED has 6 resources, they likely have enough to make a significant move. Using my knight now could:
1. Disrupt their plans by stealing a key resource
2. Prevent further resource generation from their best hex
3. Start building toward largest army (2 VP)

<plan>
1. Use knight to move robber to RED's sheep hex (6) to disrupt their strong production
2. Continue working toward city upgrades by collecting ore and wheat
3. Monitor RED's resources and builds closely
4. Watch for opportunities to expand toward node 23 for more wheat production
5. Consider development card purchases when possible
</plan>

Playing the knight card now makes strategic sense to potentially disrupt RED's plans with their 6 resources and to move toward largest army.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL SETTLEMENT PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Place settlements on high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Target at least one spot with good ore and wheat production for city development
- Try to secure at least one high-probability spot (5, 6, 8, 9) for each critical resource
- Place your second settlement to complement your first (fill resource gaps)
- Aim for access to all five resources or position near useful ports if resource diversity isn't possible
- Always consider which settlements opponents are likely to place and avoid areas that will become contested
- Place roads pointing toward valuable future expansion spots, not toward the center
- Consider the long-term impact: settlements that can't expand are less valuable

MID-GAME RESOURCE PRIORITIES:
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each possible build (cities: 1VP for 5 resources is most efficient)
- Early phase: Secure at least one good source of brick and wood for minimal expansion
- Growth phase: Prioritize ore and wheat production for city upgrades (3VP for 5 resources is optimal)
- Late phase: Focus on the fastest path to victory points, whether through buildings or development cards
- Avoid trading resources that opponents need for immediate victory point gains
- Use 4:1 trades only when necessary; prioritize port usage when possible

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and limited expansion options
- If you get an early knight, save it for defense or until you can start building toward largest army
- Time monopoly card usage for when opponents likely have accumulated specific resources
- Save year of plenty cards for completing crucial builds when you're short 1-2 specific resources
- Development cards are most valuable when:
  * You need hidden victory points to surprise opponents
  * You need knights to break up longest road or secure largest army
  * You're lacking wood/brick for expansion but have plenty of sheep/wheat/ore

EXPANSION STRATEGY:
- Build roads only with clear settlement locations in mind
- Target settlements that give you access to ports or new resources
- Block opponents' expansion paths when it gives you a strategic advantage
- Consider the timing of expansion vs. city upgrades based on your resource production
- Calculate whether longest road is achievable and worth the resource investment
- When deciding between a new settlement and a city upgrade, compare immediate vs. long-term returns

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-probability hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Save knight cards for breaking up opponent strategies or securing largest army
- Use knights defensively if you're producing valuable resources on high-probability hexes

TRADING TACTICS:
- Avoid trading resources that directly help opponents score points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades
- Trade excess resources before rolling 7 if you have more than 7 cards
- Consider bank/port trades when they enable an immediate build that advances your strategy
- When trading with players, try to receive resources that complete a build

ENDGAME STRATEGY:
- In the late game, hide your victory point potential (keep development cards hidden)
- Calculate the fastest path to 10 VP and focus exclusively on that path
- Be aware of the exact number of remaining development cards and their probabilities
- Track opponents' potential victory points, including hidden development cards
- If you're close to winning, prioritize actions that can be completed in a single turn

Before finalizing your action, check:
1. Is there a more efficient path to victory points?
2. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
3. Does this move help or hinder opponents?
4. Is there a defensive move needed to prevent an opponent from winning?
5. Are you properly diversified against dice probability?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 32 | Player: BLUE | Action: MOVE_ROBBER

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Use knight to move robber to RED's sheep hex (6) to disrupt their strong production
2. Continue working toward city upgrades by collecting ore and wheat
3. Monitor RED's resources and builds closely
4. Watch for opportunities to expand toward node 23 for more wheat production
5. Consider development card purchases when possible
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.

# Game Analysis - Robber Movement Decision

I need to decide where to move the robber as BLUE. Let me analyze each option carefully.

## Current Game State
- I (BLUE) have 3 VP with 1 city and 1 settlement
- RED has 2 VP with 2 settlements
- RED has 6 hidden cards - a significant hand that could enable building
- My resources: 1 🌲WOOD, 2 🌾WHEAT, 1 ⛏️ORE
- The robber is currently on the wheat hex (-1, 0, 1) with value 4

## Robber Options Analysis

[0] Move robber to (0, 0, 0) - brick hex with value 3
- Affects: RED's settlement at node 5 (blocks 🧱3)
- Minimal impact as 3 is a low-probability number
- Can steal from RED

[1] Move robber to (1, -1, 0) - wood hex with value 8
- Affects: MY city at node 1 (blocks 🌲8)
- This would hurt my production significantly 
- Poor strategic choice as it blocks my own high-value production

[2] Move robber to (0, -1, 1) - desert
- No production blocked (already no production)
- Cannot steal a card
- Wastes the robber move

[3] Move robber to (-1, 1, 0) - sheep hex with value 6
- Affects: BOTH of RED's settlements (blocks 🐑6)
- 6 is a high-probability number (3 dots)
- Can steal from RED
- This disrupts RED's strongest resource production

[4] Move robber to (0, 1, -1) - ore hex with value 9
- Affects: RED's settlement at node 5 and MY settlement at node 20 (blocks ⛏️9)
- Would hurt my own ore production
- Not ideal as I need ore for city upgrades

[5] Move robber to (1, 0, -1) - wheat hex with value 10
- Affects: MY settlements at nodes 1 and 20 (blocks 🌾10)
- Would hurt my own wheat production
- Poor choice as I need wheat for development

## Strategic Considerations

The best robber placement should:
1. Target high-probability hexes of opponents
2. Avoid blocking my own production
3. Target resources the opponent likely needs
4. Steal valuable resources

Option [3] is clearly the strongest choice:
- Blocks RED's sheep on a high-probability 6
- This hex serves both RED settlements, maximizing impact
- Doesn't affect my production
- Allows me to steal from RED's hand of 6 cards

<plan>
1. Move robber to RED's sheep hex (6) to disrupt their strong production
2. Continue working toward city upgrades by collecting ore and wheat
3. Monitor RED's resources and builds closely
4. Watch for opportunities to expand toward node 23 for more wheat production
5. Consider development card purchases when possible

# Game Analysis

I'll analyze the current game state and available options:

## Current Resources
- 5 wood, 3 wheat, 1 ore
- No brick or sheep

## Current Status
- 3/10 victory points (1 settlement, 1 city)
- Already played 2 knights this game
- Robber is currently on RED's sheep hex (blocking their 6)

## Strategic Considerations
1. My next build priorities could be:
   - City (3 ore, 2 wheat) - Need 2 more ore
   - Settlement (1 wood, 1 brick, 1 wheat, 1 sheep) - Need brick and sheep
   - Development card (1 ore, 1 wheat, 1 sheep) - Need sheep

2. I have excess wood (5) that could be traded through the 4:1 port

3. RED has 5 hidden resources and is potentially collecting resources for a meaningful build

## Evaluating Available Options
- [0] End turn: Keeps resources but risks losing cards if a 7 is rolled
- [1] Trade 4 wood for 1 brick: Could help toward a settlement build
- [2] Trade 4 wood for 1 ore: Would give me 2 ore, still needing 1 more for a city
- [3] Trade 4 wood for 1 sheep: Could help toward a settlement or development card
- [4] Trade 4 wood for 1 wheat: Would give me 4 wheat, but I already have enough for city/settlement

Looking at my production capabilities:
- Strong wood production from 8 (city)
- Good ore from 9 (settlement)
- Good wheat from 10 (both settlements)
- No sheep or brick production

<plan>
1. Trade for brick to work toward a new settlement
2. Consider placement options that provide sheep production
3. Continue collecting ore for city upgrade
4. Watch RED's resource collection and builds closely
5. If unable to build settlement soon, consider trading for ore instead
</plan>

Based on my analysis:
- Option [1] (trading for brick) aligns best with my immediate needs
- It helps diversify my resources with something I can't produce
- Brick is essential for settlement expansion
- I still have 1 wood remaining after the trade

Since I have excess wood and no way to produce brick, trading wood for brick is the most strategic choice.

TRADING TACTICS:
- Avoid trading resources that directly help opponents score points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades
- Trade excess resources before rolling 7 if you have more than 7 cards
- Consider bank/port trades when they enable an immediate build that advances your strategy
- When trading with players, try to receive resources that complete a build

ENDGAME STRATEGY:
- In the late game, hide your victory point potential (keep development cards hidden)
- Calculate the fastest path to 10 VP and focus exclusively on that path
- Be aware of the exact number of remaining development cards and their probabilities
- Track opponents' potential victory points, including hidden development cards
- If you're close to winning, prioritize actions that can be completed in a single turn

Before finalizing your action, check:
1. Is there a more efficient path to victory points?
2. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
3. Does this move help or hinder opponents?
4. Is there a defensive move needed to prevent an opponent from winning?
5. Are you properly diversified against dice probability?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 34 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Trade for brick to work toward a new settlement
2. Consider placement options that provide sheep production
3. Continue collecting ore for city upgrade
4. Watch RED's resource collection and builds closely
5. If unable to build settlement soon, consider trading for ore instead
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.

# Game Analysis: Settlers of Catan Turn 34

Let me analyze the current game state to make the optimal move:

## Current Position Assessment
- I have 3 VP (1 city, 1 settlement)
- RED has 2 VP (2 settlements)
- I have resources: 1 Wood, 1 Brick, 3 Wheat, 1 Ore
- I already have 2 played Knight cards (potential for Largest Army)
- My existing settlements/cities are on good numbers (8, 9, 10)

## Resource Production Evaluation
- My city at node 1 produces brick(3), wood(8), wheat(10)
- My settlement at node 20 produces ore(9), wheat(10)
- I'm strongest in wheat production, followed by wood and ore
- My sheep production is nonexistent
- The robber is on the sheep(6) hex, but that doesn't affect me

## Available Actions Analysis
I can:
1. End turn
2. Build a road (6 different options)
3. No settlement/city/development card options this turn

## Road Placement Analysis
Let me analyze each road placement:
1. Edge (1,2): Extends toward node 2 which connects to desert, wood(8)
2. Edge (0,20): Connects nodes 0 and 20, but I already have buildings at/near these
3. Edge (6,23): Extends toward potential expansion near wood(8) hex
4. Edge (0,5): Connects toward RED's settlement at node 5
5. Edge (1,6): Extends toward node 6 which connects to wood(8) and wheat(10) - resource duplication
6. Edge (19,21): Extends toward node 21 connecting to ore(9) - resource duplication

## Strategic Considerations
- I need sheep for future builds
- Expanding road networks will help both with settlement options and potential longest road
- Edge (1,2) creates a path toward node 2, which could open sheep access through node 9
- Edge (6,23) provides expansion toward node 7 (connects to wood 8)
- Most other options don't open significantly new resource opportunities

## Plan Update
<plan>
1. Build road toward nodes with sheep access (especially nodes connecting to the 6 value)
2. Continue saving resources for next settlement placement
3. Target ore and wheat for potential city upgrade later
4. Position for longest road as a secondary objective
5. Keep watching RED's moves and resources
</plan>

The road placement at edge (1,2) seems most strategically valuable as it opens potential paths to sheep resources (through node 9) and creates options for future settlement placement while working toward longest road. This aligns with my need to diversify resources.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL SETTLEMENT PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Place settlements on high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Target at least one spot with good ore and wheat production for city development
- Try to secure at least one high-probability spot (5, 6, 8, 9) for each critical resource
- Place your second settlement to complement your first (fill resource gaps)
- Aim for access to all five resources or position near useful ports if resource diversity isn't possible
- Always consider which settlements opponents are likely to place and avoid areas that will become contested
- Place roads pointing toward valuable future expansion spots, not toward the center
- Consider the long-term impact: settlements that can't expand are less valuable

MID-GAME RESOURCE PRIORITIES:
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each possible build (cities: 1VP for 5 resources is most efficient)
- Early phase: Secure at least one good source of brick and wood for minimal expansion
- Growth phase: Prioritize ore and wheat production for city upgrades (3VP for 5 resources is optimal)
- Late phase: Focus on the fastest path to victory points, whether through buildings or development cards
- Avoid trading resources that opponents need for immediate victory point gains
- Use 4:1 trades only when necessary; prioritize port usage when possible

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and limited expansion options
- If you get an early knight, save it for defense or until you can start building toward largest army
- Time monopoly card usage for when opponents likely have accumulated specific resources
- Save year of plenty cards for completing crucial builds when you're short 1-2 specific resources
- Development cards are most valuable when:
  * You need hidden victory points to surprise opponents
  * You need knights to break up longest road or secure largest army
  * You're lacking wood/brick for expansion but have plenty of sheep/wheat/ore

EXPANSION STRATEGY:
- Build roads only with clear settlement locations in mind
- Target settlements that give you access to ports or new resources
- Block opponents' expansion paths when it gives you a strategic advantage
- Consider the timing of expansion vs. city upgrades based on your resource production
- Calculate whether longest road is achievable and worth the resource investment
- When deciding between a new settlement and a city upgrade, compare immediate vs. long-term returns

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-probability hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Save knight cards for breaking up opponent strategies or securing largest army
- Use knights defensively if you're producing valuable resources on high-probability hexes

TRADING TACTICS:
- Avoid trading resources that directly help opponents score points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades
- Trade excess resources before rolling 7 if you have more than 7 cards
- Consider bank/port trades when they enable an immediate build that advances your strategy
- When trading with players, try to receive resources that complete a build

ENDGAME STRATEGY:

# Game Analysis for Robber Placement

I need to strategically place the robber to maximize my chances of winning. Let me analyze each option carefully.

## Current Game State
- I have 3 VP (1 settlement + 1 city)
- RED has 2 VP (2 settlements)
- I have 3 wheat and 2 ore - building toward something valuable
- RED has 6 hidden resources - quite a lot, might be planning something big
- The robber is currently on the sheep 6 hex (-1,1,0)

## Robber Placement Options Analysis

**[0] Move robber to (0, 0, 0) brick 3 hex and steal from RED**
- This blocks RED's brick production (they have a settlement on this hex)
- I also have a city there, so I'd be hurting my own production
- Stealing could be valuable as RED has many resources

**[1] Move robber to (1, -1, 0) wood 8 hex**
- This would block my own VERY valuable 8 wood production from my city
- This wood is critical for my expansion strategy
- This is clearly a bad option

**[2] Move robber to (0, -1, 1) desert**
- This has no effect as desert produces nothing
- This wastes my robber move completely
- This is a terrible option

**[3] Move robber to (-1, 0, 1) wheat 4 hex and steal from RED**
- This blocks RED's wheat 4 production
- I don't have access to this hex, so it doesn't hurt me
- I can steal from RED who has many cards

**[4] Move robber to (0, 1, -1) ore 9 hex and steal from RED**
- This blocks RED's ore 9 production
- Unfortunately, this also blocks my own ore 9 production at node 20
- Since I have ore in hand, this could harm my build strategy

**[5] Move robber to (1, 0, -1) wheat 10 hex**
- This would block both RED's and my wheat 10 production
- I have 3 wheat already, so temporarily blocking my production isn't as harmful
- However, I can't steal from RED with this placement

## Strategic Considerations
1. RED has 6 cards - they're likely planning something significant
2. I should disrupt their production while minimizing impact on my own
3. Stealing a card from RED is valuable to both gain a resource and reduce their options
4. I need to maintain my ore/wheat production for city building or development cards

<plan>
1. Block RED's resource production that I don't need access to
2. Use the wheat and ore I have to build a city or purchase development cards
3. Continue expanding roads toward sheep-producing areas
4. Watch RED carefully as they have many resources
</plan>

Based on this analysis, option [3] is clearly the best choice:
- Blocks RED's wheat production without affecting my own
- Allows me to steal from RED who has many cards
- Doesn't harm my current resource production
- Supports my strategy of slowing RED while I continue my build plan

- I have played 2 knights already
- Only two possible actions: end turn or build a city

## Resource Analysis:
- My current production:
  * City at node 1: Produces brick (3), wood (8), wheat (10)
  * Settlement at node 20: Produces ore (9), wheat (10)
- Building a city at node 20 would double my ore and wheat production at that location

## Victory Point Path:
- Current: 3 VP
- If I build a city: +1 VP = 4 VP
- To reach 10 VP, I'd still need 6 more points, which could come from:
  * 2 more cities (4 VP)
  * 2 more settlements (2 VP)
  * Development cards (up to 5 VP from victory point cards)
  * Largest army (2 VP, I already have 2 knights)

## Decision Analysis:
Building a city at node 20 would:
1. Increase my victory points from 3 to 4
2. Double my production of ore (9) and wheat (10) at that settlement
3. Use all my current ore and wheat resources
4. Strengthen my ore and wheat production which is critical for future city upgrades and development cards

Looking at the board, node 20 seems to be a strong position since:
- It produces on a 9 (ore) and a 10 (wheat), both decent probability numbers
- Improved production here will help me get more ore and wheat for future development

<plan>
1. Upgrade settlement at node 20 to a city to boost my ore and wheat production
2. Continue expanding roads with future brick and wood resources 
3. Focus on getting largest army (I already have 2 knights)
4. Balance between city upgrades and development cards depending on resource availability
5. Watch RED carefully as they have many resources
</plan>

Given the current game state, upgrading my settlement to a city provides immediate VP gain and sets me up for stronger long-term production of critical resources (ore and wheat). The improved production will accelerate my path toward more development cards and additional city upgrades.

PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL SETTLEMENT PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Place settlements on high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Target at least one spot with good ore and wheat production for city development
- Try to secure at least one high-probability spot (5, 6, 8, 9) for each critical resource
- Place your second settlement to complement your first (fill resource gaps)
- Aim for access to all five resources or position near useful ports if resource diversity isn't possible
- Always consider which settlements opponents are likely to place and avoid areas that will become contested
- Place roads pointing toward valuable future expansion spots, not toward the center
- Consider the long-term impact: settlements that can't expand are less valuable

MID-GAME RESOURCE PRIORITIES:
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each possible build (cities: 1VP for 5 resources is most efficient)
- Early phase: Secure at least one good source of brick and wood for minimal expansion
- Growth phase: Prioritize ore and wheat production for city upgrades (3VP for 5 resources is optimal)
- Late phase: Focus on the fastest path to victory points, whether through buildings or development cards
- Avoid trading resources that opponents need for immediate victory point gains
- Use 4:1 trades only when necessary; prioritize port usage when possible

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and limited expansion options
- If you get an early knight, save it for defense or until you can start building toward largest army
- Time monopoly card usage for when opponents likely have accumulated specific resources
- Save year of plenty cards for completing crucial builds when you're short 1-2 specific resources
- Development cards are most valuable when:
  * You need hidden victory points to surprise opponents
  * You need knights to break up longest road or secure largest army
  * You're lacking wood/brick for expansion but have plenty of sheep/wheat/ore

EXPANSION STRATEGY:
- Build roads only with clear settlement locations in mind
- Target settlements that give you access to ports or new resources
- Block opponents' expansion paths when it gives you a strategic advantage
- Consider the timing of expansion vs. city upgrades based on your resource production
- Calculate whether longest road is achievable and worth the resource investment
- When deciding between a new settlement and a city upgrade, compare immediate vs. long-term returns

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-probability hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Save knight cards for breaking up opponent strategies or securing largest army
- Use knights defensively if you're producing valuable resources on high-probability hexes

TRADING TACTICS:
- Avoid trading resources that directly help opponents score points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades
- Trade excess resources before rolling 7 if you have more than 7 cards
- Consider bank/port trades when they enable an immediate build that advances your strategy
- When trading with players, try to receive resources that complete a build

ENDGAME STRATEGY:
- In the late game, hide your victory point potential (keep development cards hidden)
- Calculate the fastest path to 10 VP and focus exclusively on that path
- Be aware of the exact number of remaining development cards and their probabilities
- Track opponents' potential victory points, including hidden development cards
- If you're close to winning, prioritize actions that can be completed in a single turn

Before finalizing your action, check:
1. Is there a more efficient path to victory points?
2. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
3. Does this move help or hinder opponents?
4. Is there a defensive move needed to prevent an opponent from winning?
5. Are you properly diversified against dice probability?

# Game Analysis and Decision

I'll assess the current game state and available actions to determine the optimal move.

## Current Game State
- I have 4 VP (2 cities)
- RED has 2 VP (2 settlements)
- I have 4 ore and no other resources
- RED has 8 hidden resource cards
- The robber is on the wheat hex (1,0,-1) which is one of my productive hexes
- I've played 2 knights, giving me a lead toward largest army (need 1 more for 2 VP)

## Resource Analysis
My only current resource is 4 ore. Without other resources, I can't:
- Build settlements (need brick, wood, sheep, wheat)
- Build cities (need 3 ore + 2 wheat)
- Buy development cards (need ore, wheat, sheep)
- Build roads (need brick and wood)

## Available Actions
My only options are:
- End turn [0]
- Trade 4 ore for 1 of any resource [1-4]

## Strategic Considerations
Looking at my current plan:
1. Upgrading settlements to cities - Can't do this yet (need wheat)
2. Expanding roads - Can't do this yet (need brick and wood)
3. Getting largest army - Need to buy dev cards (need wheat and sheep)

Since I can't make direct progress toward my goals without trading, I need to decide which resource to trade for:

- SHEEP [1]: Helps toward development cards, but I still need wheat
- WHEAT [2]: Critical for both city upgrades and development cards
- WOOD [3]: Needed for road expansion, but I also need brick
- BRICK [4]: Needed for road expansion, but I also need wood

The most strategic choice would be wheat, as it's:
1. Used in both city upgrades and development cards
2. One of my wheat-producing hexes is currently blocked by the robber
3. Wheat would position me to potentially buy a development card next turn if I get ore and sheep

<plan>
1. Trade for wheat to prepare for either development cards or future city upgrades
2. Continue focusing on largest army (I already have 2 knights)
3. Look for opportunities to expand roads when I gain brick and wood
4. Watch RED carefully as they have many resources
</plan>

# Game Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state and available options:

## Victory Point Status:
- BLUE (me): 4/10 VP (from 2 cities)
- RED: 3/10 VP (from 1 city, 1 settlement)
- I lead by 1 VP, but need 6 more to win

## Resource Analysis:
- I have: 2 🧱BRICK, 4 🌾WHEAT
- RED has 8 hidden cards (potentially concerning)
- My production: Strong wood (8), decent ore (9), some brick (3) and wheat (10)

## Strategic Options:
1. End turn and collect more resources on next rolls
2. Trade 4 wheat for another resource (wood, brick, ore, or sheep)

## Decision Logic:
- I cannot build anything this turn with just 2 brick and 4 wheat
- Trading 4:1 is highly inefficient and would leave me with only 2 brick and 1 of another resource
- This is still insufficient for any meaningful build
- RED has many resources (8 cards), which makes them vulnerable to the robber on the next 7 roll
- Saving resources for future turns is risky due to potential 7 rolls
- However, trading 4:1 leaves me with fewer resources and still unable to build

<plan>
1. Conserve resources and end my turn to avoid an inefficient 4:1 trade
2. Continue focusing on largest army (I already have 2 knights)
3. On future turns, target development cards (need 1 ore, 1 wheat, 1 sheep) to potentially get Knights or VPs
4. Position to block RED's expansion if they attempt to build with their large hand
5. Consider using my roads to expand toward better resource diversity when I gain sufficient brick and wood
</plan>

Since I can't make an efficient move with my current resources, and the 4:1 trade leaves me still unable to build, the optimal play is to end my turn and wait for better opportunities.

# Game Analysis for Settlers of Catan

Let me analyze the current game state and make the optimal decision.

## Current Position Assessment
- I have 4 victory points (2 cities = 4 VP)
- I have 4 brick and 3 wheat resources
- I've played 2 knight cards already
- RED has 3 victory points and 7 hidden cards
- The robber is on a wheat hex (1,0,-1) with number 10, which affects both my cities

## Resource Analysis
- I have 4 brick and 3 wheat, but no wood, sheep, or ore
- My cities produce:
  * City at node 1: brick(3), wood(8), wheat(10)
  * City at node 20: ore(9), wheat(10)
- The robber is blocking my wheat production on the 10 hex
- I need ore(1), wheat(1), and sheep(1) for a development card
- I need wood(1) and brick(1) for a road
- I need wheat(2), ore(3) for a city
- I need wood(1), brick(1), wheat(1), sheep(1) for a settlement

## Available Actions Analysis
1. End turn [0]
2. Trade 4 brick for 1 sheep [1]
3. Trade 4 brick for 1 wood [2]
4. Trade 4 brick for 1 wheat [3]
5. Trade 4 brick for 1 ore [4]

Let's evaluate each option:

**Option 0 - End Turn**: 
- I keep my 4 brick and 3 wheat for future turns
- On next roll, I may get more resources to make more efficient moves
- Cost: None, Benefit: Resource conservation

**Options 1-4 - Trade 4:1**:
- These are very inefficient trades
- Trading 4 brick for 1 of another resource is a net loss of 3 resources
- Even with the new resource, I wouldn't have enough to build anything significant

If I trade 4 brick for 1 sheep or 1 ore, I'd have:
- 0 brick, 3 wheat, 1 sheep/ore
- Still wouldn't have enough for a development card (need 1 ore, 1 wheat, 1 sheep)

If I trade 4 brick for 1 wood, I'd have:
- 0 brick, 3 wheat, 1 wood
- Could not build a road (need 1 more brick)
- Could not build a settlement (need more resources)

If I trade 4 brick for 1 wheat, I'd have:
- 0 brick, 4 wheat
- Still can't build anything significant

## Strategic Considerations
1. 4:1 trades are highly inefficient and should be avoided unless absolutely necessary
2. I should conserve resources for future turns when I might have better options
3. The robber is currently on my wheat production, but I still have 3 wheat
4. RED has 7 hidden cards, which means they're likely planning a significant move
5. I should maintain flexibility for my next turn

## Decision
Given the inefficiency of the 4:1 trades and the fact that none of them would enable me to build anything immediately useful, the optimal play is to end my turn and conserve resources.

<plan>
1. End turn to conserve resources (4 brick, 3 wheat)
2. Continue pursuing development cards when I get ore and sheep
3. Move the robber off my wheat hex if possible on my next turn
4. Watch RED's moves closely - with 7 cards they may be planning something significant
5. Consider building roads toward resource diversity when I can get more wood
</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL SETTLEMENT PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Place settlements on high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Target at least one spot with good ore and wheat production for city development
- Try to secure at least one high-probability spot (5, 6, 8, 9) for each critical resource
- Place your second settlement to complement your first (fill resource gaps)
- Aim for access to all five resources or position near useful ports if resource diversity isn't possible
- Always consider which settlements opponents are likely to place and avoid areas that will become contested
- Place roads pointing toward valuable future expansion spots, not toward the center
- Consider the long-term impact: settlements that can't expand are less valuable

MID-GAME RESOURCE PRIORITIES:
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each possible build (cities: 1VP for 5 resources is most efficient)
- Early phase: Secure at least one good source of brick and wood for minimal expansion
- Growth phase: Prioritize ore and wheat production for city upgrades (3VP for 5 resources is optimal)
- Late phase: Focus on the fastest path to victory points, whether through buildings or development cards
- Avoid trading resources that opponents need for immediate victory point gains
- Use 4:1 trades only when necessary; prioritize port usage when possible

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and limited expansion options
- If you get an early knight, save it for defense or until you can start building toward largest army
- Time monopoly card usage for when opponents likely have accumulated specific resources
- Save year of plenty cards for completing crucial builds when you're short 1-2 specific resources
- Development cards are most valuable when:
  * You need hidden victory points to surprise opponents
  * You need knights to break up longest road or secure largest army
  * You're lacking wood/brick for expansion but have plenty of sheep/wheat/ore

EXPANSION STRATEGY:
- Build roads only with clear settlement locations in mind
- Target settlements that give you access to ports or new resources
- Block opponents' expansion paths when it gives you a strategic advantage
- Consider the timing of expansion vs. city upgrades based on your resource production
- Calculate whether longest road is achievable and worth the resource investment
- When deciding between a new settlement and a city upgrade, compare immediate vs. long-term returns

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-probability hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Save knight cards for breaking up opponent strategies or securing largest army
- Use knights defensively if you're producing valuable resources on high-probability hexes

TRADING TACTICS:
- Avoid trading resources that directly help opponents score points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades
- Trade excess resources before rolling 7 if you have more than 7 cards
- Consider bank/port trades when they enable an immediate build that advances your strategy
- When trading with players, try to receive resources that complete a build

ENDGAME STRATEGY:
- In the late game, hide your victory point potential (keep development cards hidden)
- Calculate the fastest path to 10 VP and focus exclusively on that path
- Be aware of the exact number of remaining development cards and their probabilities
- Track opponents' potential victory points, including hidden development cards
- If you're close to winning, prioritize actions that can be completed in a single turn

Before finalizing your action, check:
1. Is there a more efficient path to victory points?
2. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
3. Does this move help or hinder opponents?
4. Is there a defensive move needed to prevent an opponent from winning?
5. Are you properly diversified against dice probability?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game State Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state and available options:

## Victory Point Status
- BLUE (me): 4 VP (2 cities = 4 VP)
- RED: 3 VP (1 settlement + 1 city = 3 VP)

## My Resources
- 3 Brick
- 7 Wheat
- No sheep, wood, or ore

## Available Actions
- End turn [0]
- Trade 4 wheat for various resources [1-4]

## Strategic Analysis

First, let me assess what I can build with my current resources:
- Settlement: Need wood (1), brick (1), sheep (1), wheat (1) - Missing wood and sheep
- City: Need ore (3), wheat (2) - Missing ore
- Development Card: Need ore (1), wheat (1), sheep (1) - Missing ore and sheep
- Road: Need wood (1), brick (1) - Missing wood

I have 7 wheat which is excessive for my current needs and puts me at risk if a 7 is rolled (discard half if over 7 cards).

Reviewing my current plan:
1. I mentioned conserving brick and wheat, but I now have 7 wheat which is risky
2. I want development cards but need ore and sheep
3. Moving the robber requires rolling a 7 or using a knight card
4. RED has 8 hidden cards - they're also at risk from a 7 roll
5. I need wood for road expansion

### Trading Considerations
Since I have 7 wheat, trading some away makes sense to:
1. Reduce hand size below 8 to avoid discards
2. Acquire resources I need for building

What resource would be most valuable?
- Wood: Needed for roads and settlements
- Ore: Needed for cities and development cards
- Sheep: Needed for settlements and development cards
- More brick: Already have 3, don't need more immediately

<plan>
1. Trade 4 wheat for 1 ore (action 3) to reduce hand size and prepare for development card purchase
2. On next turn, aim to get sheep to complete development card purchase
3. Continue watching RED who has 8 cards - they may be planning something significant
4. Consider roads toward resource diversity when I get wood
5. Move the robber off my wheat hex if possible on my next turn
</plan>

Since I have 7 wheat cards (risking loss to a "7" roll) and need ore for my development card strategy, trading 4 wheat for 1 ore makes the most sense. This will bring my wheat count to 3, safely below the discard threshold, while obtaining a critical resource.

# Game Analysis for Turn 52

Let me carefully analyze the current game state and my available options:

## Current Game State
- I have 4 VPs (2 cities = 4 VPs)
- Resources: 3 🧱BRICK, 3 🌾WHEAT, 5 ⛏️ORE
- I have 2 played Knights (need 3 for Largest Army)
- RED has 3 VPs and a concerning 12 cards in hand

## Production Assessment
- My main production: 🧱3[⭐], 🌲8[⭐⭐⭐], 🌾10[⭐], ⛏️9[⭐⭐], 🌾10[⭐]
- Strong in: 🌲WOOD (3 dots) and ⛏️ORE (2 dots)
- Weak in: 🐑SHEEP (0 dots)
- The robber is on my 🌲8 hex, blocking my strongest production

## Available Actions Review
1. End turn
2-5. Various 4:1 trades using my ORE to get other resources

## Strategic Considerations

My current plan mentioned trading wheat for ore, but I actually have plenty of ore (5) and only moderate wheat (3). I need to revise my plan based on my actual resource situation.

Currently, I need:
- SHEEP to buy development cards (which could give me VPs or Knights)
- WOOD to build roads/settlements (blocked by robber)

With my current resources, I can't:
- Build settlements (need wood)
- Build cities (already have the 2 settlements upgraded)
- Build roads (need wood)
- Buy development cards (need sheep)

Looking at my available trades, I could use my excess ORE to get SHEEP, which would enable me to buy a development card on my next turn if I get more wheat and ore from production.

<plan>
1. Trade 4 ore for 1 sheep (action 1) to prepare for development card purchase
2. Focus on getting more sheep and wheat through future production/trades
3. Continue monitoring RED who has 12 cards - they may be planning something significant
4. Aim to move the robber off my wood hex when possible
5. Build toward a new settlement location when wood becomes available
</plan>

Given my excess ore and need for sheep to enable development card purchases, I will:

   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL SETTLEMENT PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Place settlements on high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Target at least one spot with good ore and wheat production for city development
- Try to secure at least one high-probability spot (5, 6, 8, 9) for each critical resource
- Place your second settlement to complement your first (fill resource gaps)
- Aim for access to all five resources or position near useful ports if resource diversity isn't possible
- Always consider which settlements opponents are likely to place and avoid areas that will become contested
- Place roads pointing toward valuable future expansion spots, not toward the center
- Consider the long-term impact: settlements that can't expand are less valuable

MID-GAME RESOURCE PRIORITIES:
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each possible build (cities: 1VP for 5 resources is most efficient)
- Early phase: Secure at least one good source of brick and wood for minimal expansion
- Growth phase: Prioritize ore and wheat production for city upgrades (3VP for 5 resources is optimal)
- Late phase: Focus on the fastest path to victory points, whether through buildings or development cards
- Avoid trading resources that opponents need for immediate victory point gains
- Use 4:1 trades only when necessary; prioritize port usage when possible

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and limited expansion options
- If you get an early knight, save it for defense or until you can start building toward largest army
- Time monopoly card usage for when opponents likely have accumulated specific resources
- Save year of plenty cards for completing crucial builds when you're short 1-2 specific resources
- Development cards are most valuable when:
  * You need hidden victory points to surprise opponents
  * You need knights to break up longest road or secure largest army
  * You're lacking wood/brick for expansion but have plenty of sheep/wheat/ore

EXPANSION STRATEGY:
- Build roads only with clear settlement locations in mind
- Target settlements that give you access to ports or new resources
- Block opponents' expansion paths when it gives you a strategic advantage
- Consider the timing of expansion vs. city upgrades based on your resource production
- Calculate whether longest road is achievable and worth the resource investment
- When deciding between a new settlement and a city upgrade, compare immediate vs. long-term returns

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-probability hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Save knight cards for breaking up opponent strategies or securing largest army
- Use knights defensively if you're producing valuable resources on high-probability hexes

TRADING TACTICS:
- Avoid trading resources that directly help opponents score points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades
- Trade excess resources before rolling 7 if you have more than 7 cards
- Consider bank/port trades when they enable an immediate build that advances your strategy
- When trading with players, try to receive resources that complete a build

ENDGAME STRATEGY:
- In the late game, hide your victory point potential (keep development cards hidden)
- Calculate the fastest path to 10 VP and focus exclusively on that path
- Be aware of the exact number of remaining development cards and their probabilities
- Track opponents' potential victory points, including hidden development cards
- If you're close to winning, prioritize actions that can be completed in a single turn

Before finalizing your action, check:
1. Is there a more efficient path to victory points?
2. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
3. Does this move help or hinder opponents?
4. Is there a defensive move needed to prevent an opponent from winning?
5. Are you properly diversified against dice probability?

# Game Analysis

Let me analyze my current position and available actions carefully:

## Current Game State
- I have 4/10 victory points (2 cities = 4 VP)
- RED has 3/10 victory points (1 settlement + 1 city = 3 VP)
- RED has 12 hidden resources, which is concerning as they could make significant moves
- My resources: 3 brick, 1 sheep, 3 wheat, 1 ore
- Available actions: End turn [0] or Buy development card [1]
- The robber is on one of my wood hexes (8), blocking valuable wood production
- I have 2 knights already played, so I'm on my way to largest army (need 3 total)

## Option Analysis

**Option 0: End Turn**
- Advantages:
  - Save resources for potential builds in future turns
  - Might get better options next turn after production
- Disadvantages:
  - No immediate progress
  - RED gets to make their move with 12 cards

**Option 1: Buy Development Card**
- Advantages:
  - Could get a VP card (immediate hidden progress)
  - Could get a knight (allowing me to move the robber off my wood hex and get closer to largest army)
  - Could get road building (helping expansion)
  - Could get monopoly or year of plenty (valuable utility)
  - Uses up my sheep which I only have 1 of and isn't immediately useful otherwise
- Disadvantages:
  - Uses resources that could go toward another build later
  - No immediate visible progress

## Decision Logic

Looking at my current plan, I wanted to trade 4 ore for 1 sheep to prepare for a development card purchase. However, I notice I already have 1 sheep, along with the wheat and ore needed for a development card. This means I can purchase a development card directly without trading.

Development cards offer several strategic advantages:
1. Potential hidden victory point
2. Potential knight to move the robber off my wood hex
3. Potential road building to expand toward new settlements
4. Largest army is still unclaimed (3 more knights needed)

Given RED has 12 cards and might be planning something significant, making progress toward my victory condition is important. Since I already have 2 knights played, getting a third would give me largest army (2 VP), bringing me to 6 VP total.

<plan>
1. Buy a development card to potentially get a knight or VP card
2. Continue monitoring RED who has 12 cards - they may be planning something significant
3. If I get a knight, use it to move the robber off my wood hex
4. Build toward a new settlement location when wood becomes available
5. Focus on securing largest army bonus (2 VP)
</plan>

Based on this analysis, buying a development card is the optimal move.

Based on this information, which action number do you choose? Think step by step about your options, then put the final action number in a box like \boxed{1}.
RESPONSE:
I'll analyze the current game state and determine the optimal action.

## Game State Analysis

- I have 4 VP (2 cities = 4 VP)
- RED has 3 VP (1 settlement + 1 city = 3 VP)
- I have 3 brick and 1 wheat, plus 1 knight card
- I've already played 2 knights - one more would give me largest army (2 VP)
- The robber is currently on my wheat hex (10), hindering my production
- RED has 7 resource cards, which is significant but not enough to trigger discarding on a 7

## Options Analysis

[0] Play Knight card:
- This would allow me to move the robber off my wheat hex (10), restoring my wheat production
- I would also get to steal from RED who has 7 cards
- Playing this knight would be my 3rd knight, giving me largest army (2 VP)
- This would increase my VP total from 4 to 6
- I'd be positioned better for future production

[1] Roll dice:
- Standard option to generate resources
- Risk of rolling a 7 and not being able to use my knight defensively
- Even with new resources, I may not have enough to build anything substantial

## Decision Making

The knight card offers clear advantages:
1. Immediate 2 VP from largest army
2. Improved resource production by moving robber off my hex
3. Potential to steal a useful resource from RED
4. Defensive move to hinder RED's progress
5. Playing the knight now guarantees these benefits rather than risking a 7 roll

<plan>
1. Play knight to gain largest army (2 VP)
2. Move robber off my wheat hex to restore production
3. Steal a card from RED to potentially help my next build
4. Aim to build a settlement with future resources to reach 7 VP
5. Continue monitoring RED's progress while working toward 10 VP
</plan>

The optimal action is to play the knight card immediately.

# Game Analysis: Robber Placement Decision

I need to decide where to place the robber as BLUE player. Let me analyze the options carefully to maximize my strategic advantage.

## Current Game State
- I have 6/10 VP (2 cities worth 4 VP + largest army bonus of 2 VP)
- RED has 3/10 VP (1 settlement + 1 city)
- I have 3 brick and 1 wheat in my hand
- The robber is currently on my wheat hex at (1, 0, -1)

## Robber Placement Options Analysis

### [0] Move robber to (0, 0, 0) [Brick-3] and steal from RED
- This blocks RED's brick production (3 value) from their city
- Brick is useful, but not the most productive hex
- I already have 3 bricks in hand

### [1] Move robber to (1, -1, 0) [Wood-8]
- This is a highly productive hex (8 value)
- It produces wood which I don't currently have
- However, it doesn't have RED's settlements, so I can't steal

### [2] Move robber to (0, -1, 1) [Desert]
- This is a desert hex that produces nothing
- Placing robber here wastes the opportunity to block resources
- Cannot steal from anyone

### [3] Move robber to (-1, 0, 1) [Wheat-4] and steal from RED
- This blocks RED's wheat production at node 15
- Wheat is critical for development cards and cities
- I can steal from RED

### [4] Move robber to (-1, 1, 0) [Sheep-6] and steal from RED
- This blocks a highly productive (6 value) sheep hex
- RED has both a city and settlement on this hex
- This is RED's most productive hex (⭐⭐⭐ for city, ⭐⭐⭐ for settlement)
- I can steal from RED

### [5] Move robber to (0, 1, -1) [Ore-9] and steal from RED
- This blocks RED's ore production from their city
- Ore is critical for city upgrades
- I can steal from RED

## Strategic Decision

Looking at RED's production:
- Sheep-6 is their most productive hex (connected to both city and settlement)
- They have production on Brick-3, Wheat-4, Sheep-6, and Ore-9

The best strategy is to target RED's highest production while also blocking a critical resource. Option [4] clearly stands out:
- It blocks RED's most productive hex (Sheep-6)
- This hex produces for both RED's city and settlement (double impact)
- I get to steal a card from RED
- Sheep is important for development cards which RED might be pursuing

<plan>
1. Block RED's sheep production to significantly slow their progress
2. Steal a card that might help my next build
3. Continue developing by building roads and a settlement toward good production areas
4. Watch RED's progress while working toward 10 VP with city upgrades and development cards
</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL SETTLEMENT PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Place settlements on high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Target at least one spot with good ore and wheat production for city development
- Try to secure at least one high-probability spot (5, 6, 8, 9) for each critical resource
- Place your second settlement to complement your first (fill resource gaps)
- Aim for access to all five resources or position near useful ports if resource diversity isn't possible
- Always consider which settlements opponents are likely to place and avoid areas that will become contested
- Place roads pointing toward valuable future expansion spots, not toward the center
- Consider the long-term impact: settlements that can't expand are less valuable

MID-GAME RESOURCE PRIORITIES:
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each possible build (cities: 1VP for 5 resources is most efficient)
- Early phase: Secure at least one good source of brick and wood for minimal expansion
- Growth phase: Prioritize ore and wheat production for city upgrades (3VP for 5 resources is optimal)
- Late phase: Focus on the fastest path to victory points, whether through buildings or development cards
- Avoid trading resources that opponents need for immediate victory point gains
- Use 4:1 trades only when necessary; prioritize port usage when possible

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and limited expansion options
- If you get an early knight, save it for defense or until you can start building toward largest army
- Time monopoly card usage for when opponents likely have accumulated specific resources
- Save year of plenty cards for completing crucial builds when you're short 1-2 specific resources
- Development cards are most valuable when:
  * You need hidden victory points to surprise opponents
  * You need knights to break up longest road or secure largest army
  * You're lacking wood/brick for expansion but have plenty of sheep/wheat/ore

EXPANSION STRATEGY:
- Build roads only with clear settlement locations in mind
- Target settlements that give you access to ports or new resources
- Block opponents' expansion paths when it gives you a strategic advantage
- Consider the timing of expansion vs. city upgrades based on your resource production
- Calculate whether longest road is achievable and worth the resource investment
- When deciding between a new settlement and a city upgrade, compare immediate vs. long-term returns

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-probability hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Save knight cards for breaking up opponent strategies or securing largest army
- Use knights defensively if you're producing valuable resources on high-probability hexes

TRADING TACTICS:
- Avoid trading resources that directly help opponents score points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades
- Trade excess resources before rolling 7 if you have more than 7 cards
- Consider bank/port trades when they enable an immediate build that advances your strategy
- When trading with players, try to receive resources that complete a build

ENDGAME STRATEGY:
- In the late game, hide your victory point potential (keep development cards hidden)
- Calculate the fastest path to 10 VP and focus exclusively on that path
- Be aware of the exact number of remaining development cards and their probabilities
- Track opponents' potential victory points, including hidden development cards
- If you're close to winning, prioritize actions that can be completed in a single turn

Before finalizing your action, check:
1. Is there a more efficient path to victory points?
2. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
3. Does this move help or hinder opponents?
4. Is there a defensive move needed to prevent an opponent from winning?
5. Are you properly diversified against dice probability?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 54 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Block RED's sheep production to significantly slow their progress
2. Steal a card that might help my next build
3. Continue developing by building roads and a settlement toward good production areas
4. Watch RED's progress while working toward 10 VP with city upgrades and development cards
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.

# Game Analysis of Settlers of Catan - Turn 54

Let me analyze the current game situation and determine the best course of action.

## Current Game State Assessment

- I (BLUE) have 6 VP: 2 cities (4 VP) + Largest Army (2 VP)
- RED has 3 VP: 1 settlement (1 VP) + 1 city (2 VP)
- I have 3 🧱BRICK and 6 🌾WHEAT resources
- The robber is on RED's productive 🐑6[⭐⭐⭐] hex

## Resource Analysis
I have:
- Sufficient 🧱BRICK (3) for potential building
- Excess 🌾WHEAT (6)
- Missing 🌲WOOD, ⛏️ORE, and 🐑SHEEP for various builds

## Available Actions
- End turn [0]
- Trade options (4:1): WHEAT for WOOD, BRICK, ORE, or SHEEP [1-4]

## Building Requirements (for reference)
- Settlement: 1 BRICK, 1 WOOD, 1 WHEAT, 1 SHEEP
- Road: 1 BRICK, 1 WOOD
- City: 2 WHEAT, 3 ORE
- Development Card: 1 WHEAT, 1 SHEEP, 1 ORE

## Strategic Analysis

My current turn seems to be after rolling dice and before ending the turn. I can't build anything directly because I'm missing key resources. Given I already have 3 BRICK, trading WHEAT for additional BRICK isn't useful.

Let's consider each option:
1. **Trade WHEAT for WOOD [1]**: This would give me WOOD, which combined with my BRICK could build a road. However, I'd need more resources to build a settlement, so a single road doesn't advance my position significantly.

2. **Trade WHEAT for BRICK [2]**: I already have 3 BRICK, and getting a 4th without WOOD doesn't help build anything.

3. **Trade WHEAT for ORE [3]**: Getting ORE could be useful for future city upgrades or development cards, but I'd need multiple ORE and additional resources (SHEEP for development card).

4. **Trade WHEAT for SHEEP [4]**: Combined with WHEAT, SHEEP could help me buy a development card if I also got ORE. Development cards could provide VP, knights for reinforcing Largest Army, or helpful actions.

5. **End Turn [0]**: Preserve resources for future turns when I might roll better combinations.

Since trading at 4:1 is inefficient, and none of the trades would enable an immediate build this turn, preserving resources for future opportunities seems most prudent. Additionally, maintaining 6+ WHEAT cards puts me at risk if someone rolls a 7, so I should consider options carefully.

<plan>
1. End this turn to preserve resources
2. On next turn, focus on using BRICK + rolled resources to expand road network
3. Position for a new settlement that gives access to WOOD or SHEEP
4. Continue leveraging Largest Army advantage while working toward 10 VP
</plan>

After careful consideration, the most strategic move is to end my turn and wait for better opportunities rather than making inefficient trades.

# Game State Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state and available actions:

**My Position:**
- I have 6/10 VP (2 cities = 4 VP, Largest Army = 2 VP)
- Resources: 3 Brick, 6 Wheat, 2 Ore
- No development cards
- I have 5 roads built with a longest road of 3 segments
- I control the Largest Army bonus

**Opponent's Position:**
- RED has 3/10 VP (1 settlement = 1 VP, 1 city = 2 VP)
- RED has 9 hidden resource cards
- RED has 3 roads with a longest road of 2 segments

**Available Actions:**
- End turn
- Various 4:1 maritime trades to get different resources

## Strategic Evaluation

Looking at my resources, I have:
- 3 Brick, 6 Wheat, 2 Ore
- I don't have any Wood or Sheep

What could I potentially build?
- I don't have resources for a settlement (1 Brick, 1 Wood, 1 Wheat, 1 Sheep)
- I don't have resources for a city (2 Wheat, 3 Ore) - need 1 more Ore
- I don't have resources for a development card (1 Sheep, 1 Wheat, 1 Ore)
- I could potentially build roads (1 Brick, 1 Wood each) but I'm missing Wood

The maritime trades available would use 4 Wheat for 1 of any resource. This is very inefficient and would leave me with just 2 Wheat.

Looking at my current plan, it suggests:
1. End this turn to preserve resources
2. Focus on using Brick + rolled resources next turn to expand road network
3. Position for a new settlement that gives access to Wood or Sheep

This plan makes sense given my current position. I have significant Brick that will be useful for road building next turn, and I'm maintaining my VP lead with 6 points versus RED's 3 points.

<plan>
1. End turn to preserve Brick, Wheat and Ore resources
2. Next turn, focus on road expansion using Brick + any newly rolled resources
3. Target a settlement location that gives access to Wood or Sheep
4. Continue maintaining Largest Army advantage while working toward 10 VP
</plan>

Since I can't make any productive builds this turn and the trades are inefficient, ending my turn is the optimal choice.

# Game Analysis for Settlers of Catan

I'll analyze the current game state, possible actions, and determine the optimal move.

## Current Game State Assessment
- I have 6 VP (2 cities = 4 VP, Largest Army = 2 VP)
- RED has 4 VP (2 cities = 4 VP)
- I need 4 more VP to win
- Resources: 2 Wood, 3 Brick, 6 Wheat, 2 Ore (no Sheep)
- I have the Largest Army advantage with 3 knights
- No one has Longest Road currently

## Available Actions Analysis

**End Turn [0]**
- Preserves my resources for next turn
- Risks losing cards if a 7 is rolled (I have 13 resources, over the 7-card limit)
- No immediate progression toward victory

**Build Road Options [1-7]**
- Costs 1 Wood, 1 Brick each
- Would leave me with 1 Wood, 2 Brick
- Each road gets me closer to potential settlement locations
- Could work toward Longest Road bonus (would need at least 5 total for the bonus)

**Maritime Trade Options [8-11]**
- Trading 4 Wheat for other resources
- Not very efficient (4:1 ratio)
- Could get Sheep which I'm missing

## Strategic Considerations

1. **Resource Management:**
   - I'm at risk of losing half my resources if a 7 is rolled (13 cards > 7)
   - Building a road would reduce my hand size to 11 (still risky)

2. **Victory Path Analysis:**
   - I need 4 more points
   - Options:
     * Build 2 settlements (2 VP)
     * Build 1 more city (1 VP) 
     * Get Longest Road (2 VP)
     * Buy development cards hoping for VP cards

3. **Road Building Strategy:**
   - Need to determine which road placement gets me closer to valuable settlement spots
   - Building a road now would reduce my risk of losing cards
   - Road extensions can lead to Longest Road bonus (2 VP)

## Road Option Analysis
- Need to determine which road placement leads to the most valuable expansion opportunities
- Based on the node numbers provided in actions [1-7], I need to identify which leads to:
  a) Access to missing resources (especially Sheep)
  b) Potential settlement locations
  c) Potential Longest Road path

Since the exact node connectivity isn't fully visible in the provided data, I'll make a strategic decision based on available information. Building a road helps reduce my hand size and advances my position.

<plan>
1. Build a road to reduce hand size and further expansion
2. Next turn, try to build another road or settlement if resources allow
3. Work toward Longest Road (2 VP) while maintaining Largest Army
4. Continue city development when possible for the final VP
</plan>

Based on the analysis, I should build a road to reduce my hand size and position myself for future expansion. Without complete node connectivity information, I'll select road option 1, which appears to connect from my city at node 20.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL SETTLEMENT PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Place settlements on high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Target at least one spot with good ore and wheat production for city development
- Try to secure at least one high-probability spot (5, 6, 8, 9) for each critical resource
- Place your second settlement to complement your first (fill resource gaps)
- Aim for access to all five resources or position near useful ports if resource diversity isn't possible
- Always consider which settlements opponents are likely to place and avoid areas that will become contested
- Place roads pointing toward valuable future expansion spots, not toward the center
- Consider the long-term impact: settlements that can't expand are less valuable

MID-GAME RESOURCE PRIORITIES:
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each possible build (cities: 1VP for 5 resources is most efficient)
- Early phase: Secure at least one good source of brick and wood for minimal expansion
- Growth phase: Prioritize ore and wheat production for city upgrades (3VP for 5 resources is optimal)
- Late phase: Focus on the fastest path to victory points, whether through buildings or development cards
- Avoid trading resources that opponents need for immediate victory point gains
- Use 4:1 trades only when necessary; prioritize port usage when possible

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and limited expansion options
- If you get an early knight, save it for defense or until you can start building toward largest army
- Time monopoly card usage for when opponents likely have accumulated specific resources
- Save year of plenty cards for completing crucial builds when you're short 1-2 specific resources
- Development cards are most valuable when:
  * You need hidden victory points to surprise opponents
  * You need knights to break up longest road or secure largest army
  * You're lacking wood/brick for expansion but have plenty of sheep/wheat/ore

EXPANSION STRATEGY:
- Build roads only with clear settlement locations in mind
- Target settlements that give you access to ports or new resources
- Block opponents' expansion paths when it gives you a strategic advantage
- Consider the timing of expansion vs. city upgrades based on your resource production
- Calculate whether longest road is achievable and worth the resource investment
- When deciding between a new settlement and a city upgrade, compare immediate vs. long-term returns

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-probability hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Save knight cards for breaking up opponent strategies or securing largest army
- Use knights defensively if you're producing valuable resources on high-probability hexes

TRADING TACTICS:
- Avoid trading resources that directly help opponents score points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades
- Trade excess resources before rolling 7 if you have more than 7 cards
- Consider bank/port trades when they enable an immediate build that advances your strategy
- When trading with players, try to receive resources that complete a build

ENDGAME STRATEGY:
- In the late game, hide your victory point potential (keep development cards hidden)
- Calculate the fastest path to 10 VP and focus exclusively on that path
- Be aware of the exact number of remaining development cards and their probabilities
- Track opponents' potential victory points, including hidden development cards
- If you're close to winning, prioritize actions that can be completed in a single turn

Before finalizing your action, check:
1. Is there a more efficient path to victory points?
2. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
3. Does this move help or hinder opponents?
4. Is there a defensive move needed to prevent an opponent from winning?
5. Are you properly diversified against dice probability?

# Game Analysis for Settlers of Catan

Let me assess the current game state and available actions to determine the optimal next move.

## Current Game State Assessment
- I have 8/10 victory points (2 cities = 4VP, Longest Road = 2VP, Largest Army = 2VP)
- Resources: 1 Wood, 2 Brick, 6 Wheat, 2 Ore
- Opponent has 4/10 victory points and 4 hidden resource cards
- I have the advantage with Longest Road and Largest Army

## Resource Analysis
- I have enough Wood and Brick (1+2) to build one more road
- I have excess Wheat (6) that could be traded
- I have 11 resource cards total, which puts me at risk if a 7 is rolled (over 7 cards)

## Available Actions Analysis

### Build Road Options (Actions 1-6)
Building a road would:
1. Reduce my hand size below 7 cards (good for 7 rolls)
2. Extend my road network (important to maintain Longest Road)
3. Cost 1 Wood + 1 Brick, using all my Wood and half my Brick

Let me analyze each road location:
- Road (2, 3): Expands toward the desert hex
- Road (2, 9): Extends toward the Wood 8 hex
- Road (6, 23): Extends toward the Wheat 10 hex
- Road (0, 5): Moves toward Red's city at node 5 (not ideal)
- Road (1, 6): Connects toward Wood 8 hex
- Road (19, 21): Extends from the Ore 9 hex

### Trade Options (Actions 7-10)
With 6 Wheat, I could trade for additional resources, but the 4:1 rate is inefficient.

## Strategic Considerations
1. With 11 cards, I should reduce my hand size to avoid losing resources on a 7 roll
2. I need paths to gain the final 2 VP needed to win
3. Maintaining Longest Road is critical (worth 2 VP)
4. I should position myself for future settlement/city builds

## Decision Process
- Building a road is better than trading at a 4:1 rate
- I should build a road that:
  a) Maintains/extends my longest road
  b) Creates opportunity for future settlement placement
  c) Blocks potential opponent expansion

Looking at the available road locations, road (2, 9) or (1, 6) appear most strategic as they extend toward the valuable Wood 8 hex. The road at (6, 23) could also be valuable as it extends toward the Wheat 10 hex.

Since I need to maintain my longest road advantage and the Wood 8 hex is highly productive (⭐⭐⭐), I'll choose to build a road at edge (2, 9).

<plan>
1. Build road at (2, 9) to reduce hand size and extend toward valuable Wood 8 hex
2. Look to acquire more Wood/Brick to continue road network expansion
3. Position for potential settlement at node 9 (near Wood 8)
4. Save Wheat/Ore for potential Development Card purchase or city upgrade later
5. Maintain Longest Road and Largest Army while working toward 10 VP
</plan>

# Game Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state carefully to make the optimal decision:

## Current Situation
- I have 8/10 victory points (2 cities = 4 VP, Longest Road = 2 VP, Largest Army = 2 VP)
- Resources: 1 Brick, 6 Wheat, 2 Ore (9 total cards)
- RED has 4 VP and 4 hidden cards
- The robber is on the Sheep 6 hex, which is only affecting RED

## Building Options
With my current resources, I cannot:
- Build a settlement (need Wood + Brick + Wheat + Sheep)
- Build a city (need 3 Ore + 2 Wheat; I only have 2 Ore)
- Build a road (need Wood + Brick; I only have 1 Brick)
- Buy a development card (need Ore + Wheat + Sheep; missing Sheep)

## Trade Considerations
I have 6 Wheat, which is excessive and could be used for trading. Options include:
- Trade 4 Wheat for 1 Wood
- Trade 4 Wheat for 1 Brick
- With Wood + Brick, I could build a road

## Strategic Assessment
1. I'm at 8 VP and need 2 more to win
2. I hold Longest Road (6 segments) and Largest Army (3 knights)
3. I'm holding 9 cards - risk of losing half if a 7 is rolled
4. Trading for Wood or Brick would allow me to build a road
5. Building a road would reduce my hand size and potentially set up for a future settlement

## Decision Logic
Since I can't make any direct VP progress this turn, my priorities should be:
1. Reduce hand size to mitigate 7 roll risk
2. Position for future expansion
3. Maintain my lead in Longest Road

The most strategic option is to trade for resources that allow me to build a road. Between Wood and Brick, I already have 1 Brick, so trading for Wood would complete the road-building requirements.

<plan>
1. Trade 4 Wheat for 1 Wood
2. Build a road to extend my network and reduce hand size
3. Continue targeting expansion toward node 9 (near Wood 8)
4. Save remaining resources for future development card or city upgrade
5. Maintain Longest Road and Largest Army advantages
</plan>

Therefore, I should choose option 1: Trade port: Give 4 🌾WHEAT for 1 🌲WOOD.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL SETTLEMENT PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Place settlements on high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Target at least one spot with good ore and wheat production for city development
- Try to secure at least one high-probability spot (5, 6, 8, 9) for each critical resource
- Place your second settlement to complement your first (fill resource gaps)
- Aim for access to all five resources or position near useful ports if resource diversity isn't possible
- Always consider which settlements opponents are likely to place and avoid areas that will become contested
- Place roads pointing toward valuable future expansion spots, not toward the center
- Consider the long-term impact: settlements that can't expand are less valuable

MID-GAME RESOURCE PRIORITIES:
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each possible build (cities: 1VP for 5 resources is most efficient)
- Early phase: Secure at least one good source of brick and wood for minimal expansion
- Growth phase: Prioritize ore and wheat production for city upgrades (3VP for 5 resources is optimal)
- Late phase: Focus on the fastest path to victory points, whether through buildings or development cards
- Avoid trading resources that opponents need for immediate victory point gains
- Use 4:1 trades only when necessary; prioritize port usage when possible

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and limited expansion options
- If you get an early knight, save it for defense or until you can start building toward largest army
- Time monopoly card usage for when opponents likely have accumulated specific resources
- Save year of plenty cards for completing crucial builds when you're short 1-2 specific resources
- Development cards are most valuable when:
  * You need hidden victory points to surprise opponents
  * You need knights to break up longest road or secure largest army
  * You're lacking wood/brick for expansion but have plenty of sheep/wheat/ore

EXPANSION STRATEGY:
- Build roads only with clear settlement locations in mind
- Target settlements that give you access to ports or new resources
- Block opponents' expansion paths when it gives you a strategic advantage
- Consider the timing of expansion vs. city upgrades based on your resource production
- Calculate whether longest road is achievable and worth the resource investment
- When deciding between a new settlement and a city upgrade, compare immediate vs. long-term returns

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-probability hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Save knight cards for breaking up opponent strategies or securing largest army
- Use knights defensively if you're producing valuable resources on high-probability hexes

TRADING TACTICS:
- Avoid trading resources that directly help opponents score points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades
- Trade excess resources before rolling 7 if you have more than 7 cards
- Consider bank/port trades when they enable an immediate build that advances your strategy
- When trading with players, try to receive resources that complete a build

ENDGAME STRATEGY:
- In the late game, hide your victory point potential (keep development cards hidden)
- Calculate the fastest path to 10 VP and focus exclusively on that path
- Be aware of the exact number of remaining development cards and their probabilities
- Track opponents' potential victory points, including hidden development cards
- If you're close to winning, prioritize actions that can be completed in a single turn

Before finalizing your action, check:
1. Is there a more efficient path to victory points?
2. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
3. Does this move help or hinder opponents?
4. Is there a defensive move needed to prevent an opponent from winning?
5. Are you properly diversified against dice probability?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game Analysis and Strategic Decision-Making

Let me analyze the current game state and my available options.

## Current Game Status
- **My Victory Points**: 8/10 (need 2 more to win)
- **Opponent**: RED has 4/10 points
- **My Advantages**: I have Longest Road (+2 VP) and Largest Army (+2 VP)
- **Resources**: 1 Wood, 1 Brick, 2 Wheat, 2 Ore
- **Robber**: Currently on Sheep 6, not blocking my production

## Resource Production Assessment
- I have strong Wood (8) and decent Ore (9) and Wheat (10) production
- My cities are positioned well, giving me balanced resource generation

## Available Actions
I only have options to build a road (1-7) or end my turn (0). I don't have enough resources for a settlement, city, or development card.

## Strategic Considerations

1. **Road Building Analysis**:
   - I have 7 roads built with Longest Road of 6
   - Building another road would solidify my Longest Road advantage
   - It would reduce my hand size by 2 resources (Wood and Brick)

2. **Future Turn Planning**:
   - With 2 VP needed to win, I should aim for either:
     - A settlement (1 VP) + 1 VP development card
     - 2 VP from development cards
     - A city upgrade (1 VP)

3. **Road Placement Options**:
   - I should choose a road that extends toward potential settlement locations
   - Option 4 (edge 8,9) seems particularly strategic as it moves toward the Wood 8 hex
   - This aligns with my plan to expand toward node 9 near Wood 8

4. **Resource Management**:
   - Using Wood and Brick now leaves me with 2 Wheat and 2 Ore
   - These remaining resources position me well for development cards on my next turn
   - A VP development card would put me at 9 points

<plan>
1. Build a road at edge (8, 9) to extend toward the valuable Wood 8 hex
2. This road strengthens my Longest Road advantage and positions me for future expansion
3. Save my Wheat and Ore for a development card on my next turn
4. Continue aiming for a settlement near node 9 for additional Wood 8 production
5. Win through either VP development cards or a settlement + city upgrade path
</plan>

After analyzing all options, building a road at edge (8, 9) is optimal as it:
1. Extends toward valuable Wood 8 production
2. Secures my Longest Road bonus
3. Follows my expansion strategy toward node 9
4. Uses my Wood and Brick efficiently
5. Positions me to potentially win within 1-2 turns

# Game Analysis for Turn 68

Let me analyze the current game state and my available actions carefully.

## Current Position Assessment:
- I have 8 VP (2 cities = 4 VP, longest road = 2 VP, largest army = 2 VP)
- I need 2 more VP to win
- Resources: 2 Brick, 2 Wheat, 4 Ore
- Red has 4 VP (2 cities = 4 VP) and 5 hidden cards

## Possible Paths to Victory:
1. Development card (might get a VP card) - Costs 1 Ore, 1 Wheat, 1 Sheep
2. Build another settlement - Costs 1 Brick, 1 Wood, 1 Wheat, 1 Sheep
3. Upgrade a settlement to city - Not applicable as I don't have settlements
4. Maintain longest road and largest army bonuses

## Resource Analysis:
- I have 2 Brick, 2 Wheat, 4 Ore
- I'm missing Wood and Sheep for any immediate builds
- I can trade 4 Ore for another resource using a 4:1 port trade

## Decision Process:
Looking at my available actions, I have 5 options:
- [0] End my turn
- [1-4] Trade 4 Ore for another resource (Sheep, Wheat, Wood, or Brick)

Since I have 4 Ore and need both Wood and Sheep to make progress, I should consider trading. The best trade would be for the resource that advances my strategy the most.

According to my current plan, I want to build a road at edge (8,9) to extend toward the Wood 8 hex. For a road, I need Wood and Brick. I already have 2 Brick but no Wood. Therefore, trading for Wood makes the most sense.

Additionally, I can see that the Wood 8 hex is a high-probability hex (8 is the second most common roll after 6/8), making it strategically valuable for expansion.

<plan>
1. Trade 4 Ore for 1 Wood
2. Build a road using 1 Wood and 1 Brick, extending toward the Wood 8 hex
3. On future turns, aim to build toward node 9 to access the valuable Wood 8 production
4. Continue saving resources for either development cards or settlement expansion
5. Win through VP development cards or settlement construction
</plan>

Since I need Wood to build my road according to my strategy, I should trade 4 Ore for 1 Wood.

- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Save knight cards for breaking up opponent strategies or securing largest army
- Use knights defensively if you're producing valuable resources on high-probability hexes

TRADING TACTICS:
- Avoid trading resources that directly help opponents score points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades
- Trade excess resources before rolling 7 if you have more than 7 cards
- Consider bank/port trades when they enable an immediate build that advances your strategy
- When trading with players, try to receive resources that complete a build

ENDGAME STRATEGY:
- In the late game, hide your victory point potential (keep development cards hidden)
- Calculate the fastest path to 10 VP and focus exclusively on that path
- Be aware of the exact number of remaining development cards and their probabilities
- Track opponents' potential victory points, including hidden development cards
- If you're close to winning, prioritize actions that can be completed in a single turn

Before finalizing your action, check:
1. Is there a more efficient path to victory points?
2. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
3. Does this move help or hinder opponents?
4. Is there a defensive move needed to prevent an opponent from winning?
5. Are you properly diversified against dice probability?

# Game Analysis for Turn 68

I'll analyze the current game state and determine the optimal action.

## Current Game State
- I have 8/10 victory points (2 cities = 4 VP, Longest Road = 2 VP, Largest Army = 2 VP)
- Resources: 1 Wood, 2 Brick, 2 Wheat
- Opponent has 4/10 victory points
- I need 2 more VP to win

## Available Options
I can either end my turn or build a road using my 1 Wood and 1 Brick.

## Strategy Evaluation

Let me analyze the road building options:
1. Road at edge (9, 10) - This extends toward the desert hex
2. Road at edge (2, 3) - This extends toward the Wheat 4 hex
3. Road at edge (6, 23) - This extends toward the Wheat 10 hex
4. Road at edge (0, 5) - This connects near the Ore 9 hex
5. Road at edge (1, 6) - This extends toward the Wood 8 hex (valuable high-probability resource)
6. Road at edge (19, 21) - This extends from the Ore 9 hex
7. Road at edge (7, 8) - This extends toward the Wood 8 hex

I need to consider my victory path options:
1. Building another settlement would give me +1 VP (to 9/10)
2. Upgrading to another city would give me +1 VP (to 9/10)
3. Getting a VP development card would give me +1 VP (to 9/10)

Since I'm at 8 VP, any of these would put me at 9, so I'd still need one more action to win.

My current plan suggests extending toward the Wood 8 hex, which would be either option 5 or 7. This is sensible since:
1. Wood 8 is a high-probability resource I need for further expansion
2. I currently only have 1 Wood source
3. Getting more Wood will enable more road building to reach potential settlement spots

Looking at the node grid, option 5 (edge 1,6) appears to be extending toward the Wood 8 hex in a more direct path that aligns with my current plan.

<plan>
1. Build a road at edge (1, 6) extending toward the Wood 8 hex
2. Continue saving resources to build another road and then a settlement near the Wood 8 hex
3. If I roll well, aim for either another settlement or a city upgrade to reach 10 VP
4. Consider buying development cards if I get excess sheep/wheat/ore from favorable rolls
</plan>

Building this road uses my available Wood and Brick resources effectively, advances me toward valuable Wood production, and follows my current strategic plan.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL SETTLEMENT PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Place settlements on high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Target at least one spot with good ore and wheat production for city development
- Try to secure at least one high-probability spot (5, 6, 8, 9) for each critical resource
- Place your second settlement to complement your first (fill resource gaps)
- Aim for access to all five resources or position near useful ports if resource diversity isn't possible
- Always consider which settlements opponents are likely to place and avoid areas that will become contested
- Place roads pointing toward valuable future expansion spots, not toward the center
- Consider the long-term impact: settlements that can't expand are less valuable

MID-GAME RESOURCE PRIORITIES:
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each possible build (cities: 1VP for 5 resources is most efficient)
- Early phase: Secure at least one good source of brick and wood for minimal expansion
- Growth phase: Prioritize ore and wheat production for city upgrades (3VP for 5 resources is optimal)
- Late phase: Focus on the fastest path to victory points, whether through buildings or development cards
- Avoid trading resources that opponents need for immediate victory point gains
- Use 4:1 trades only when necessary; prioritize port usage when possible

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and limited expansion options
- If you get an early knight, save it for defense or until you can start building toward largest army
- Time monopoly card usage for when opponents likely have accumulated specific resources
- Save year of plenty cards for completing crucial builds when you're short 1-2 specific resources
- Development cards are most valuable when:
  * You need hidden victory points to surprise opponents
  * You need knights to break up longest road or secure largest army
  * You're lacking wood/brick for expansion but have plenty of sheep/wheat/ore

EXPANSION STRATEGY:
- Build roads only with clear settlement locations in mind
- Target settlements that give you access to ports or new resources
- Block opponents' expansion paths when it gives you a strategic advantage
- Consider the timing of expansion vs. city upgrades based on your resource production
- Calculate whether longest road is achievable and worth the resource investment
- When deciding between a new settlement and a city upgrade, compare immediate vs. long-term returns

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-probability hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Save knight cards for breaking up opponent strategies or securing largest army
- Use knights defensively if you're producing valuable resources on high-probability hexes

TRADING TACTICS:
- Avoid trading resources that directly help opponents score points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades

# Game Analysis

Let me carefully analyze the current game state and my available options:

## Current Game State
- I have 8/10 VP (2 cities + 2 VP for longest road + 2 VP for largest army)
- I need 2 more VP to win
- My resources: 3 🧱BRICK, 2 🌾WHEAT, 4 ⛏️ORE
- Robber is on the sheep hex (-1, 1, 0), blocking RED's best sheep production

## Victory Point Options
To get 2 more VP, I could:
1. Build 2 settlements (requires 2 wood, 2 brick, 2 wheat, 2 sheep)
2. Build 1 city upgrade (requires 3 ore, 2 wheat)
3. Buy development cards hoping for victory point cards (requires ore, wheat, sheep)

## Resource Analysis
- I'm short on WHEAT (only have 2, need at least 2 for a city)
- I have plenty of ORE (4)
- I have sufficient BRICK (3)
- I'm missing WOOD and SHEEP completely

## Available Actions
- Options 1-4 are port trades using my ORE (4:1 rate)
- Option 0 is to end turn

## Decision Process
Looking at my current plan, I was planning to build a road toward the Wood 8 hex. However, I have no wood currently to build any roads.

The most efficient path to victory would be upgrading a settlement to a city (if I had a settlement), but I don't have any settlements to upgrade.

Building a new settlement requires wood and sheep, which I don't have.

Since I have 4 ORE and 2 WHEAT, trading for 1 WHEAT would allow me to build a city if I had a settlement to upgrade. But without a settlement, this doesn't help immediately.

Given my 3 BRICK, trading for 1 WOOD would let me build a road, advancing my expansion plan toward the Wood 8 hex.

<plan>
1. Trade 4 ORE for 1 WOOD
2. Build a road toward the Wood 8 hex
3. On future turns, continue expanding toward high-value locations, especially targeting wood production
4. Focus on building 2 more settlements to reach 10 VP
</plan>

Based on this analysis, I should trade 4 ORE for 1 WOOD, which corresponds to option 3.

# Game Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state and available options thoroughly to make the optimal decision.

## Current Game State Assessment
- I have 8 VP (2 cities + Longest Road bonus + Largest Army bonus)
- RED has 5 VP (1 settlement + 2 cities)
- I need 2 more VP to win, which means either:
  - Building 2 more settlements (requiring 2 wood, 2 brick, 2 wheat, 2 sheep)
  - Building 1 city (requiring 3 ore, 2 wheat)
  - Getting VP development cards

## Resources
- I have: 1 wood, 3 brick, 2 wheat (lacking ore and sheep)
- My production: Strong on brick (node 1), very strong on wood (node 1), decent on wheat (nodes 1 and 20), decent on ore (node 20)
- Missing production: I have no sheep production

## Available Road Building Options
I can build one road with my current resources (1 wood + 1 brick):
1. Edge (9, 10) - Expands toward the desert
2. Edge (2, 3) - Connects toward RED's settlement at node 3
3. Edge (6, 7) - Expands toward the Wood 8 hex (very valuable)
4. Edge (6, 23) - Expands toward Wheat 10 hex
5. Edge (0, 5) - Connected to RED's city
6. Edge (19, 21) - Expands from node 20 city
7. Edge (7, 8) - Expands further along the Wood 8 hex

## Strategic Evaluation

Looking at the node map and resources:
- Building toward the Wood 8 hex seems most valuable for securing strong wood production
- I already have the Longest Road bonus, so road building now is primarily for reaching settlement locations
- I need to identify the best potential settlement locations that I can reach

Based on the hex layout, edge (6, 7) [option 3] continues my expansion toward the Wood 8 hex, which aligns with my current plan. This would help me secure good wood production for my future settlements.

Edge (7, 8) [option 7] is also in the direction of the valuable Wood 8 hex but extends further.

<plan>
1. Build a road at edge (6, 7) toward the Wood 8 hex
2. Continue expanding toward high-value locations to build 2 more settlements
3. Focus on reaching node locations that provide access to sheep (my missing resource)
4. With my next builds, secure the 2 settlements needed to reach 10 VP
</plan>

After reviewing all options, I will build a road at edge (6, 7) to continue my expansion toward the valuable Wood 8 hex, aligning with my current plan.

PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL SETTLEMENT PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Place settlements on high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Target at least one spot with good ore and wheat production for city development
- Try to secure at least one high-probability spot (5, 6, 8, 9) for each critical resource
- Place your second settlement to complement your first (fill resource gaps)
- Aim for access to all five resources or position near useful ports if resource diversity isn't possible
- Always consider which settlements opponents are likely to place and avoid areas that will become contested
- Place roads pointing toward valuable future expansion spots, not toward the center
- Consider the long-term impact: settlements that can't expand are less valuable

MID-GAME RESOURCE PRIORITIES:
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each possible build (cities: 1VP for 5 resources is most efficient)
- Early phase: Secure at least one good source of brick and wood for minimal expansion
- Growth phase: Prioritize ore and wheat production for city upgrades (3VP for 5 resources is optimal)
- Late phase: Focus on the fastest path to victory points, whether through buildings or development cards
- Avoid trading resources that opponents need for immediate victory point gains
- Use 4:1 trades only when necessary; prioritize port usage when possible

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and limited expansion options
- If you get an early knight, save it for defense or until you can start building toward largest army
- Time monopoly card usage for when opponents likely have accumulated specific resources
- Save year of plenty cards for completing crucial builds when you're short 1-2 specific resources
- Development cards are most valuable when:
  * You need hidden victory points to surprise opponents
  * You need knights to break up longest road or secure largest army
  * You're lacking wood/brick for expansion but have plenty of sheep/wheat/ore

EXPANSION STRATEGY:
- Build roads only with clear settlement locations in mind
- Target settlements that give you access to ports or new resources
- Block opponents' expansion paths when it gives you a strategic advantage
- Consider the timing of expansion vs. city upgrades based on your resource production
- Calculate whether longest road is achievable and worth the resource investment
- When deciding between a new settlement and a city upgrade, compare immediate vs. long-term returns

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-probability hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Save knight cards for breaking up opponent strategies or securing largest army
- Use knights defensively if you're producing valuable resources on high-probability hexes

TRADING TACTICS:
- Avoid trading resources that directly help opponents score points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades
- Trade excess resources before rolling 7 if you have more than 7 cards
- Consider bank/port trades when they enable an immediate build that advances your strategy
- When trading with players, try to receive resources that complete a build

ENDGAME STRATEGY:
- In the late game, hide your victory point potential (keep development cards hidden)
- Calculate the fastest path to 10 VP and focus exclusively on that path
- Be aware of the exact number of remaining development cards and their probabilities
- Track opponents' potential victory points, including hidden development cards
- If you're close to winning, prioritize actions that can be completed in a single turn

Before finalizing your action, check:
1. Is there a more efficient path to victory points?
2. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
3. Does this move help or hinder opponents?
4. Is there a defensive move needed to prevent an opponent from winning?
5. Are you properly diversified against dice probability?

Board Understanding Guide:

# Game Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state and determine the optimal move:

## Current Status
- I have 8/10 victory points
- 2 cities (4 VP), longest road (2 VP), largest army (2 VP)
- My resources: 2 🧱BRICK, 6 🌾WHEAT, 2 ⛏️ORE
- I need 2 more victory points to win

## Path to Victory Options
1. Build 2 new settlements (2 VP) - requires 2 wood, 2 brick, 2 wheat, 2 sheep
2. Build 1 city upgrade (1 VP) and 1 development card (hoping for a VP card) - requires 3 ore, 2 wheat for city + 1 ore, 1 wheat, 1 sheep for dev card
3. Build 2 development cards (hoping for VP cards) - requires 2 ore, 2 wheat, 2 sheep

## Resource Assessment
I have brick and wheat, but I'm missing wood and sheep completely. I need these to build settlements according to my current plan.

## Action Evaluation
- Option [0] End Turn: Not optimal when I can make progress toward victory
- Option [1] Trade for 🌲WOOD: Would help with road/settlement building path
- Option [2] Trade for 🧱BRICK: Already have brick, not needed
- Option [3] Trade for ⛏️ORE: Would help with city upgrade path
- Option [4] Trade for 🐑SHEEP: Would help with settlement building or dev cards

Since I already have 2 brick, trading for wood would help me build a road and continue my expansion strategy toward settlements. However, I also need sheep for settlements, so trading for sheep is another viable option.

Given my current plan to expand and build more settlements, and considering I already have brick, I should trade for wood to continue road building toward valuable locations.

<plan>
1. Trade 4 wheat for 1 wood
2. Use wood and brick to build a road at edge (6, 7)
3. Continue expanding toward high-value locations to build 2 more settlements
4. Focus on reaching node locations that provide access to sheep (my missing resource)
5. With my next builds, secure the 2 settlements needed to reach 10 VP
</plan>

Based on my analysis, I should trade wheat for wood to continue my expansion strategy.

# Game State Analysis

Let me think through the current game state and my strategic options:

## Victory Point Status
- I (BLUE) have 8/10 VP: 2 cities (4 VP), Longest Road (+2 VP), and Largest Army (+2 VP)
- RED has 5/10 VP: 1 settlement (1 VP) and 2 cities (4 VP)
- I need 2 more VP to win

## Resources
- I have: 1 🌲WOOD, 2 🧱BRICK, 2 🌾WHEAT, 2 ⛏️ORE
- I have enough to build one road (1 🌲WOOD, 1 🧱BRICK)
- I'm lacking 🐑SHEEP, which I need for settlements or development cards

## Strategic Analysis

My current plan involves trading for wood and building roads, but I already have wood and brick to build a road immediately. I need to evaluate if my current road options advance my goal of reaching 10 VP.

The fastest path to victory would be:
1. Build 2 more settlements (+2 VP)
2. Alternatively, get 2 VP development cards, but I'd need sheep for that

Road building options should focus on reaching high-value settlement locations with sheep production, as that's my missing resource.

Let me evaluate each road option:
1. Road at edge (9, 10): Extends toward the desert tile, not immediately useful
2. Road at edge (2, 3): Extends toward node 3 which RED already has a settlement on
3. Road at edge (6, 23): Extends toward node 23, connected to a wheat hex
4. Road at edge (0, 5): This connects to node 5 which RED already occupies
5. Road at edge (19, 21): Extends toward node 21, connected to the ore hex
6. Road at edge (7, 8): Extends toward node 8, connected to the wood hex

Looking at the map, I need to prioritize reaching potential settlement locations that give me access to sheep. The issue is that the sheep hex (at -1, 1, 0) currently has the robber on it and RED already has strong presence there.

<plan>
1. Build a road this turn that advances toward a potential settlement location
2. Continue expanding my road network to reach at least 2 buildable settlement locations
3. Focus on getting sheep (through production or trades) to build those settlements
4. Maintain my Longest Road and Largest Army bonuses
5. Reach 10 VP through 2 new settlements
</plan>

Based on the options, road (3) at edge (6, 23) seems most promising as it expands toward a wheat hex (node 23), potentially giving me a new settlement location. While it doesn't directly give me sheep access, expanding my road network is necessary to reach settlement locations.

## Final Decision
I'll build a road at edge (6, 23) to expand my options for future settlements.

- Place the robber on the highest-probability hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Save knight cards for breaking up opponent strategies or securing largest army
- Use knights defensively if you're producing valuable resources on high-probability hexes

TRADING TACTICS:
- Avoid trading resources that directly help opponents score points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades
- Trade excess resources before rolling 7 if you have more than 7 cards
- Consider bank/port trades when they enable an immediate build that advances your strategy
- When trading with players, try to receive resources that complete a build

ENDGAME STRATEGY:
- In the late game, hide your victory point potential (keep development cards hidden)
- Calculate the fastest path to 10 VP and focus exclusively on that path
- Be aware of the exact number of remaining development cards and their probabilities
- Track opponents' potential victory points, including hidden development cards
- If you're close to winning, prioritize actions that can be completed in a single turn

Before finalizing your action, check:
1. Is there a more efficient path to victory points?
2. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
3. Does this move help or hinder opponents?
4. Is there a defensive move needed to prevent an opponent from winning?
5. Are you properly diversified against dice probability?

# Robber Placement Analysis

I need to analyze the best hex to place the robber on to maximize my chances of winning while minimizing RED's opportunities.

## Game State Assessment
- I have 8 VP (2 cities + 2 VP from Longest Road + 2 VP from Largest Army)
- RED has 6 VP (3 cities)
- I need 2 more VP to win (likely through building 2 settlements)
- I have 1 brick, 1 wheat, 4 ore, but lack wood and sheep
- RED has 5 hidden cards

## Robber Placement Options Analysis

[0] Move to Brick (0,0,0) and steal from RED
- Blocks RED's production at their city at node 5 and node 3
- This hex has number 3 (low probability)
- RED has two cities on this hex, so blocking it hurts them significantly

[1] Move to Wood (1,-1,0)
- Blocks production with number 8 (high probability)
- This prevents me from getting wood at my city at node 1
- No opponent to steal from - this is a bad choice

[2] Move to Desert (0,-1,1)
- Desert produces nothing, so placing robber here has no effect
- Not a good strategic choice

[3] Move to Wheat (-1,0,1) and steal from RED
- Blocks wheat with number 4 (moderate probability)
- RED has a city at node 3 and node 15 that produce wheat from this hex
- I could benefit by stealing wheat which I need

[4] Move to Sheep (-1,1,0) and steal from RED
- Blocks sheep with number 6 (high probability)
- RED has a city at node 5 and node 15 producing sheep from this hex
- I need sheep for settlements, could steal it from RED
- This is RED's best production hex (6 = high probability)

[5] Move to Ore (0,1,-1) and steal from RED
- Blocks ore with number 9 (moderate probability)
- RED has a city at node 5 producing ore
- I already have 4 ore, so stealing more isn't as valuable

## Strategic Decision

Looking at my resource needs and RED's production:
- I need sheep to build settlements according to my plan
- RED appears to have strong sheep production (two cities on sheep6)
- Blocking RED's highest probability resource (sheep6) would significantly hamper their progress
- I could potentially steal a sheep from RED to help build a settlement

Option [4] is the optimal choice because:
1. It blocks RED's highest probability resource (sheep6 = high probability)
2. It impacts multiple RED cities (nodes 5 and 15)
3. I might steal sheep which I need for my settlement strategy
4. Disrupting RED's sheep production slows their progress significantly

<plan>
1. Block RED's sheep production and steal a sheep if possible
2. Build roads toward potential settlement locations
3. Gather sheep and wood (my missing resources) for settlements
4. Maintain my Longest Road and Largest Army bonuses
5. Reach 10 VP through 2 new settlements
</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL SETTLEMENT PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Place settlements on high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Target at least one spot with good ore and wheat production for city development
- Try to secure at least one high-probability spot (5, 6, 8, 9) for each critical resource
- Place your second settlement to complement your first (fill resource gaps)
- Aim for access to all five resources or position near useful ports if resource diversity isn't possible
- Always consider which settlements opponents are likely to place and avoid areas that will become contested
- Place roads pointing toward valuable future expansion spots, not toward the center
- Consider the long-term impact: settlements that can't expand are less valuable

MID-GAME RESOURCE PRIORITIES:
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each possible build (cities: 1VP for 5 resources is most efficient)
- Early phase: Secure at least one good source of brick and wood for minimal expansion
- Growth phase: Prioritize ore and wheat production for city upgrades (3VP for 5 resources is optimal)
- Late phase: Focus on the fastest path to victory points, whether through buildings or development cards
- Avoid trading resources that opponents need for immediate victory point gains
- Use 4:1 trades only when necessary; prioritize port usage when possible

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and limited expansion options
- If you get an early knight, save it for defense or until you can start building toward largest army
- Time monopoly card usage for when opponents likely have accumulated specific resources
- Save year of plenty cards for completing crucial builds when you're short 1-2 specific resources
- Development cards are most valuable when:
  * You need hidden victory points to surprise opponents
  * You need knights to break up longest road or secure largest army
  * You're lacking wood/brick for expansion but have plenty of sheep/wheat/ore

EXPANSION STRATEGY:
- Build roads only with clear settlement locations in mind
- Target settlements that give you access to ports or new resources
- Block opponents' expansion paths when it gives you a strategic advantage
- Consider the timing of expansion vs. city upgrades based on your resource production
- Calculate whether longest road is achievable and worth the resource investment
- When deciding between a new settlement and a city upgrade, compare immediate vs. long-term returns

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-probability hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Save knight cards for breaking up opponent strategies or securing largest army
- Use knights defensively if you're producing valuable resources on high-probability hexes

# Game Analysis: Settlers of Catan Turn 82

Let me analyze the current game state:

## Current Status
- I have 8/10 victory points (2 cities, largest army, and longest road)
- Red has 6/10 victory points (3 cities)
- I have 1 brick, 1 wheat, and 5 ore
- The robber is on Red's 6-value sheep hex (good placement)

## Resource Assessment
I'm lacking:
- Wood: Need for roads and settlements
- Sheep: Need for development cards and settlements

## Victory Path Options
1. **Building settlements**: Need brick + wood + wheat + sheep per settlement (1 VP each)
2. **Buying development cards**: Need ore + wheat + sheep (20% chance of instant VP)

## Available Actions
My only actions are to end turn or make a 4:1 port trade with my ore.

## Strategic Analysis
- I need to advance my victory points from 8 to 10
- I have no immediate build options with my current resources
- With 5 ore, I could trade for a needed resource
- Most efficient path to victory seems to be through settlements (need wood & sheep)
- Trading 4 ore for 1 resource seems expensive but might enable building next turn

## Decision Reasoning
- End turn: Conserve resources, but make no progress
- Trade for sheep: Helps toward settlement, but still need wood and more resources
- Trade for wood: Helps toward settlement, but still need sheep and more resources
- Trade for wheat: I already have 1 wheat, getting another isn't optimal
- Trade for brick: I already have 1 brick, getting another isn't optimal

Since I have 5 ore but need wood and sheep the most, trading for one of those makes the most sense. Both are equally important for my settlement strategy, but having 0 of each means I need to start somewhere.

<plan>
1. Trade ore for wood this turn
2. Focus on collecting sheep next
3. Continue building toward settlement locations
4. Maintain my Longest Road and Largest Army bonuses
5. Reach 10 VP through 2 new settlements
</plan>

I'll trade my ore for wood to start gathering the resources I need for a settlement.

# Game Analysis for Turn 82

Let me analyze the current game state to determine the best move:

## Current Status
- I have 8/10 victory points (2 cities = 4VP, Longest Road +2VP, Largest Army +2VP)
- Resources: 1 Wood, 1 Brick, 1 Wheat, 1 Ore
- I need 2 more VP to win
- Red has 6/10 victory points (3 cities = 6VP)

## Resource Analysis
With just 1 Wood and 1 Brick, I can build exactly one road. My resources are limited, and I don't have enough to build a settlement (would need 1 more Wood, 1 more Brick, 1 more Sheep) or buy a development card.

## Available Options
The only meaningful action I can take is to build one road. I need to evaluate which road location is most strategic:

1. Road at (9, 10): Extends toward the unexplored part of the map
2. Road at (2, 3): Extends southward, unknown potential
3. Road at (0, 5): Connects toward the center
4. Road at (19, 21): Extends northward 
5. Road at (7, 8): Extends toward the unexplored western area

## Strategic Considerations
1. **Maintain Longest Road**: With Red having only 4 roads (longest 2), my Longest Road (9) is secure for now
2. **Road Placement Strategy**: I should place roads that:
   - Lead to potential settlement spots
   - Secure additional resources I need (especially Sheep which I currently lack)
   - Further extend my road network to maintain Longest Road

Without seeing the full board layout, I need to make some assumptions about which road offers the best future settlement opportunities.

<plan>
1. Build one road this turn to extend my network
2. Collect resources (especially sheep) for a new settlement
3. Continue maintaining Longest Road and Largest Army advantages
4. Add 2 more settlements to reach 10 VP (or 1 settlement plus a VP development card)
</plan>

Since I have exactly the resources for one road, and no other immediate build options, I should build a road rather than ending my turn. Without complete visibility of the full board connectivity, I'll choose option #1 (edge 9, 10) as it appears to extend toward unexplored territory and potentially good settlement locations.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL SETTLEMENT PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Place settlements on high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Target at least one spot with good ore and wheat production for city development
- Try to secure at least one high-probability spot (5, 6, 8, 9) for each critical resource
- Place your second settlement to complement your first (fill resource gaps)
- Aim for access to all five resources or position near useful ports if resource diversity isn't possible
- Always consider which settlements opponents are likely to place and avoid areas that will become contested
- Place roads pointing toward valuable future expansion spots, not toward the center
- Consider the long-term impact: settlements that can't expand are less valuable

MID-GAME RESOURCE PRIORITIES:
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each possible build (cities: 1VP for 5 resources is most efficient)
- Early phase: Secure at least one good source of brick and wood for minimal expansion
- Growth phase: Prioritize ore and wheat production for city upgrades (3VP for 5 resources is optimal)
- Late phase: Focus on the fastest path to victory points, whether through buildings or development cards
- Avoid trading resources that opponents need for immediate victory point gains
- Use 4:1 trades only when necessary; prioritize port usage when possible

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and limited expansion options
- If you get an early knight, save it for defense or until you can start building toward largest army
- Time monopoly card usage for when opponents likely have accumulated specific resources
- Save year of plenty cards for completing crucial builds when you're short 1-2 specific resources
- Development cards are most valuable when:
  * You need hidden victory points to surprise opponents
  * You need knights to break up longest road or secure largest army
  * You're lacking wood/brick for expansion but have plenty of sheep/wheat/ore

EXPANSION STRATEGY:
- Build roads only with clear settlement locations in mind
- Target settlements that give you access to ports or new resources
- Block opponents' expansion paths when it gives you a strategic advantage
- Consider the timing of expansion vs. city upgrades based on your resource production
- Calculate whether longest road is achievable and worth the resource investment
- When deciding between a new settlement and a city upgrade, compare immediate vs. long-term returns

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-probability hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Save knight cards for breaking up opponent strategies or securing largest army
- Use knights defensively if you're producing valuable resources on high-probability hexes

TRADING TACTICS:
- Avoid trading resources that directly help opponents score points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades
- Trade excess resources before rolling 7 if you have more than 7 cards
- Consider bank/port trades when they enable an immediate build that advances your strategy
- When trading with players, try to receive resources that complete a build

ENDGAME STRATEGY:
- In the late game, hide your victory point potential (keep development cards hidden)
- Calculate the fastest path to 10 VP and focus exclusively on that path
- Be aware of the exact number of remaining development cards and their probabilities
- Track opponents' potential victory points, including hidden development cards
- If you're close to winning, prioritize actions that can be completed in a single turn

Before finalizing your action, check:
1. Is there a more efficient path to victory points?
2. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
3. Does this move help or hinder opponents?
4. Is there a defensive move needed to prevent an opponent from winning?
5. Are you properly diversified against dice probability?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game Analysis

Let me analyze this game state to determine the best action:

## My Current Position
- 8 VPs: 2 cities (4 VP) + Longest Road (2 VP) + Largest Army (2 VP)
- Need 2 more VPs to win
- Resources: 2 wood, 2 brick, 1 wheat, 1 ore
- I have the longest road (9 segments) and largest army (3 knights)

## Current Plan Evaluation
My plan was to build one road this turn, collect resources for a settlement, and maintain longest road and largest army. I need 2 more settlement placements (or 1 settlement + VP card) to win.

## Options Analysis
I need to decide whether to build a road this turn, and if so, which one.

Looking at my available resources (2 wood, 2 brick, 1 wheat, 1 ore), I can:
1. Build 1 road (costs 1 wood, 1 brick)
2. Can't build a settlement (need sheep)
3. Can't build a city (need 2 more ore, 1 more wheat)
4. Can't buy a development card (need sheep)

## Road Building Options:
Let me evaluate each road option:

[1] Road at (10, 11): Need to understand where this would extend my network
[2] Road at (2, 3): This appears to be near one of my cities at node 1
[3] Road at (0, 5): This could connect toward the RED player's territory
[4] Road at (19, 21): This would extend toward RED's settlement at node 21
[5] Road at (7, 8): This extends my network near my city at node 1

Without a full visualization of the board connectivity, I need to consider:
- Which road best protects my longest road status
- Which road opens up potential settlement spots (especially with sheep access)
- Which road blocks RED from expanding

## Strategic Considerations
- RED has 7 VPs and could be close to winning
- I need to maintain my longest road advantage
- I need to find sheep production to build a settlement
- I should avoid roads that don't lead to viable settlement locations

## Decision
Since I already have a strong position with longest road (9 segments) and I need sheep for my next settlement, I should build a road that either:
1. Strengthens my road network to protect longest road
2. Leads toward potential settlement spots with sheep access

Without complete board visualization, I'll build a road that seems most likely to achieve these goals. Based on the information provided, road option [5] at edge (7, 8) appears to extend from my city at node 1, potentially opening new settlement opportunities.

<plan>
1. Build road at (7, 8) to extend my network
2. Focus on acquiring sheep for a settlement
3. Continue maintaining longest road and largest army advantages
4. Need 2 more VPs: either two settlements or 1 settlement + VP development card
</plan>

I'll build a road at edge (7, 8).

# Analyzing the Game State

## Current Position
- I have 8/10 victory points
- Resources: 1 wood, 1 brick, 1 wheat, 1 ore
- I have Longest Road (+2 VP) and Largest Army (+2 VP)
- 2 cities for 4 VPs

## Red's Position
- 7/10 victory points
- 5 hidden resources
- 1 settlement and 3 cities (1 VP + 6 VP = 7 VP)
- No road or army bonuses

## Available Actions
I have the resources to build one road (costs 1 wood + 1 brick), with 4 different locations available.

## Strategic Analysis

I'm 2 points away from victory (10 VP). To get those points, I could:
1. Build 2 settlements (would need 2 wood, 2 brick, 2 wheat, 2 sheep)
2. Build 1 settlement + 1 VP development card (would need 1 wood, 1 brick, 1 wheat, 1 sheep + 1 wheat, 1 sheep, 1 ore)
3. Build 1 city (would need 3 ore, 2 wheat)
4. Buy 2 VP development cards (would need 2 ore, 2 wheat, 2 sheep)

Currently, I have 1 wood, 1 brick, 1 wheat, 1 ore. I'm missing sheep for options 2 and 4, and need more resources for all options.

My current plan states I need more sheep for a settlement, and I want to maintain my longest road. Red player is close to winning with 7 points, so I need to be careful.

Let me evaluate each road building option:
- Option [1] - edge (2, 3): Extends toward the desert, doesn't seem strategic
- Option [2] - edge (10, 11): Extends toward the desert edge, not strategic
- Option [3] - edge (19, 21): This would connect to Red's settlement at node 21, which isn't helpful
- Option [4] - edge (0, 5): This would connect to Red's city at node 5, which isn't helpful

None of these road options seem particularly strong strategically. They don't open up new settlement spots in good locations, and they don't significantly extend my longest road (I already have longest road with 11 segments).

Since I'm not seeing a clear benefit to building any of these roads, and I need to conserve resources to reach 10 VP, the best option may be to end my turn and save resources.

<plan>
1. Save my wood and brick for a future settlement rather than building suboptimal roads
2. Focus on gathering sheep and additional resources for either a settlement or development card
3. Continue maintaining longest road and largest army advantages
4. Need 2 more VPs: prioritize settlement + VP card as the most attainable path

- Place the robber on the highest-probability hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Save knight cards for breaking up opponent strategies or securing largest army
- Use knights defensively if you're producing valuable resources on high-probability hexes

TRADING TACTICS:
- Avoid trading resources that directly help opponents score points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades
- Trade excess resources before rolling 7 if you have more than 7 cards
- Consider bank/port trades when they enable an immediate build that advances your strategy
- When trading with players, try to receive resources that complete a build

ENDGAME STRATEGY:
- In the late game, hide your victory point potential (keep development cards hidden)
- Calculate the fastest path to 10 VP and focus exclusively on that path
- Be aware of the exact number of remaining development cards and their probabilities
- Track opponents' potential victory points, including hidden development cards
- If you're close to winning, prioritize actions that can be completed in a single turn

Before finalizing your action, check:
1. Is there a more efficient path to victory points?
2. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
3. Does this move help or hinder opponents?
4. Is there a defensive move needed to prevent an opponent from winning?
5. Are you properly diversified against dice probability?

- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Save my wood and brick for a future settlement rather than building suboptimal roads
2. Focus on gathering sheep and additional resources for either a settlement or development card
3. Continue maintaining longest road and largest army advantages
4. Need 2 more VPs: prioritize settlement + VP card as the most attainable path

# Game Analysis for Settlers of Catan

I'll analyze the current game state and available actions to determine the optimal move.

## Current Situation Assessment
- I have 8/10 victory points (2 cities + longest road + largest army)
- Resources: 1 Wood, 1 Brick, 1 Wheat, 3 Ore
- No development cards in hand
- Available actions: End turn or build one of 4 possible roads

## Victory Point Analysis
I need 2 more VP to win. Potential paths to victory:
- Settlement (1 VP): Requires 1 wood, 1 brick, 1 wheat, 1 sheep
- City upgrade (1 VP): Requires 2 wheat, 3 ore (insufficient settlements to upgrade)
- Development card with VP (1 VP): Requires 1 wheat, 1 sheep, 1 ore
- Keep longest road (already have +2 VP)

## Resource Evaluation
With my current resources (1 wood, 1 brick, 1 wheat, 3 ore), I could:
1. Build a road (using wood and brick)
2. Save resources for future builds

## Road Building Strategic Analysis
Let me evaluate each road option:
- Edge (2,3): Does this road expand my network toward a potential settlement location?
- Edge (10,11): Similarly, what opportunities does this create?
- Edge (19,21): This connects to node 21 where RED already has a settlement
- Edge (0,5): This connects to node 5 where RED already has a city

None of these roads appear to directly enable a settlement build on my next turn. They would use up my only wood and brick, which are critical resources for settlements.

## Resource Generation Projection
I need to consider what resources I'm likely to collect before my next turn. My production:
- Cities at nodes 1 and 20 produce brick, wood, wheat, and ore
- My most reliable numbers are 8 (wood) and 9 (ore)

## Strategic Decision Making
Building a road now would:
- Use my only wood and brick
- Not immediately lead to a victory point
- Potentially extend my longest road advantage

Saving my resources would:
- Preserve wood and brick for a potential settlement
- Allow flexibility for my next turn
- Position me better for opportunistic builds

<plan>
1. Preserve my wood and brick for future settlement opportunities
2. Continue focusing on city/development card strategy with my ore production
3. Maintain longest road and largest army advantages
4. Next turn, evaluate development card purchase if I get wheat/sheep
</plan>

The most strategic action is to end my turn and preserve resources for more impactful builds in future turns.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL SETTLEMENT PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Place settlements on high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Target at least one spot with good ore and wheat production for city development
- Try to secure at least one high-probability spot (5, 6, 8, 9) for each critical resource
- Place your second settlement to complement your first (fill resource gaps)
- Aim for access to all five resources or position near useful ports if resource diversity isn't possible
- Always consider which settlements opponents are likely to place and avoid areas that will become contested
- Place roads pointing toward valuable future expansion spots, not toward the center
- Consider the long-term impact: settlements that can't expand are less valuable

MID-GAME RESOURCE PRIORITIES:
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each possible build (cities: 1VP for 5 resources is most efficient)
- Early phase: Secure at least one good source of brick and wood for minimal expansion
- Growth phase: Prioritize ore and wheat production for city upgrades (3VP for 5 resources is optimal)
- Late phase: Focus on the fastest path to victory points, whether through buildings or development cards
- Avoid trading resources that opponents need for immediate victory point gains
- Use 4:1 trades only when necessary; prioritize port usage when possible

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and limited expansion options
- If you get an early knight, save it for defense or until you can start building toward largest army
- Time monopoly card usage for when opponents likely have accumulated specific resources
- Save year of plenty cards for completing crucial builds when you're short 1-2 specific resources
- Development cards are most valuable when:
  * You need hidden victory points to surprise opponents
  * You need knights to break up longest road or secure largest army
  * You're lacking wood/brick for expansion but have plenty of sheep/wheat/ore

EXPANSION STRATEGY:
- Build roads only with clear settlement locations in mind
- Target settlements that give you access to ports or new resources
- Block opponents' expansion paths when it gives you a strategic advantage
- Consider the timing of expansion vs. city upgrades based on your resource production
- Calculate whether longest road is achievable and worth the resource investment
- When deciding between a new settlement and a city upgrade, compare immediate vs. long-term returns

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-probability hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Save knight cards for breaking up opponent strategies or securing largest army
- Use knights defensively if you're producing valuable resources on high-probability hexes

TRADING TACTICS:
- Avoid trading resources that directly help opponents score points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades

# Game Analysis

First, let me assess the current game state:

- I have 8/10 victory points (2 cities = 4VP, longest road = 2VP, largest army = 2VP)
- Red has 7/10 victory points (3 cities = 6VP, 1 settlement = 1VP)
- I control both longest road and largest army bonuses
- My resources: 1 wood, 1 brick, 1 wheat, 3 ore
- No development cards in hand

## Available Actions
I can:
1. End my turn
2. Build a road at one of four possible locations (cost: 1 wood, 1 brick)

## Strategic Considerations

**Victory path analysis:** I'm at 8VP vs Red's 7VP. I need 2 more VP to win.
- Options for my next 2VP:
  - Build 2 settlements (requires 4 wood, 4 brick, 2 wheat, 2 sheep)
  - Build 1 city (requires 2 wheat, 3 ore) - I'm close with 1 wheat, 3 ore
  - Get VP development cards (requires wheat, sheep, ore)

**Road building decision:**
- I already have longest road (11 segments vs Red's 2)
- Building another road wouldn't increase my VP total
- Using my wood and brick now means I can't build a settlement on my next turn
- Since I'm close to having enough resources for a city upgrade (just need 1 more wheat), I should preserve options

**Future production considerations:**
- My two cities produce wood (8), wheat (10), and ore (9)
- Red has the robber on the sheep hex (6), but I don't produce sheep anyway

<plan>
1. End turn to preserve wood and brick for potential settlement building
2. Focus on getting one more wheat to complete a city upgrade (need 2 wheat, 3 ore total)
3. Watch for development card opportunities if I get sheep
4. Defend longest road and largest army advantages
5. Aim for city upgrade next as my primary VP path
</plan>

Since I'm already winning, have a significant lead in longest road, and am close to having resources for a city upgrade, the most prudent move is to preserve my wood and brick. Building any road now would not increase my VP count but would deplete resources I'll need for settlements later.

# Game Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state and my available options:

## Current Game Status
- I (BLUE) have 8/10 VP:
  - 2 Cities (4 VP)
  - Longest Road bonus (2 VP)
  - Largest Army bonus (2 VP)
- RED has 7/10 VP:
  - 3 Cities (6 VP)
  - 1 Settlement (1 VP)
- My resources: 3 wood, 1 brick, 1 wheat, 3 ore
- No development cards in hand

## Victory Path Analysis
To reach 10 VP, I need 2 more points. Options:
1. Build 2 settlements (+2 VP)
2. Upgrade to 1 more city (+1 VP) + 1 settlement (+1 VP)
3. Get 2 victory point development cards

## Resource Assessment
- For a settlement: Need 1 wood, 1 brick, 1 sheep, 1 wheat (I have wood and brick)
- For a city upgrade: Need 2 wheat, 3 ore (I have 1 wheat, 3 ore)
- For a development card: Need 1 sheep, 1 wheat, 1 ore (I have 1 wheat, 3 ore)

## Action Options Analysis
- [0] End turn: Preserves resources but gains no immediate advantage
- [1-4] Build a road: Uses my wood and brick, but I already have longest road and don't have enough resources to build a settlement afterward

## Strategic Considerations
1. I'm ahead by just 1 VP (8 vs 7)
2. RED has 3 cards in hand, could be close to building something significant
3. I need to defend my longest road (11 segments) and largest army advantages
4. I'm just short of resources for a city (need 1 more wheat)
5. I don't have sheep for settlement building or development cards

<plan>
1. End turn to preserve wood and brick
2. Focus on collecting sheep and wheat next turn for either:
   a) Settlement building (if I get sheep)
   b) City upgrade (if I get another wheat)
3. Continue protecting longest road and largest army
4. Watch what RED builds and adjust strategy accordingly
</plan>

Since I can't make meaningful progress toward victory this turn (can't complete a settlement, city, or development card), and building a road would deplete my wood and brick without immediate benefit, I should preserve my resources.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL SETTLEMENT PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Place settlements on high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Target at least one spot with good ore and wheat production for city development
- Try to secure at least one high-probability spot (5, 6, 8, 9) for each critical resource
- Place your second settlement to complement your first (fill resource gaps)
- Aim for access to all five resources or position near useful ports if resource diversity isn't possible
- Always consider which settlements opponents are likely to place and avoid areas that will become contested
- Place roads pointing toward valuable future expansion spots, not toward the center
- Consider the long-term impact: settlements that can't expand are less valuable

MID-GAME RESOURCE PRIORITIES:
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each possible build (cities: 1VP for 5 resources is most efficient)
- Early phase: Secure at least one good source of brick and wood for minimal expansion
- Growth phase: Prioritize ore and wheat production for city upgrades (3VP for 5 resources is optimal)
- Late phase: Focus on the fastest path to victory points, whether through buildings or development cards
- Avoid trading resources that opponents need for immediate victory point gains
- Use 4:1 trades only when necessary; prioritize port usage when possible

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and limited expansion options
- If you get an early knight, save it for defense or until you can start building toward largest army
- Time monopoly card usage for when opponents likely have accumulated specific resources
- Save year of plenty cards for completing crucial builds when you're short 1-2 specific resources
- Development cards are most valuable when:
  * You need hidden victory points to surprise opponents
  * You need knights to break up longest road or secure largest army
  * You're lacking wood/brick for expansion but have plenty of sheep/wheat/ore

EXPANSION STRATEGY:
- Build roads only with clear settlement locations in mind
- Target settlements that give you access to ports or new resources
- Block opponents' expansion paths when it gives you a strategic advantage
- Consider the timing of expansion vs. city upgrades based on your resource production
- Calculate whether longest road is achievable and worth the resource investment
- When deciding between a new settlement and a city upgrade, compare immediate vs. long-term returns

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-probability hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Save knight cards for breaking up opponent strategies or securing largest army
- Use knights defensively if you're producing valuable resources on high-probability hexes

TRADING TACTICS:
- Avoid trading resources that directly help opponents score points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades
- Trade excess resources before rolling 7 if you have more than 7 cards
- Consider bank/port trades when they enable an immediate build that advances your strategy
- When trading with players, try to receive resources that complete a build

ENDGAME STRATEGY:
- In the late game, hide your victory point potential (keep development cards hidden)
- Calculate the fastest path to 10 VP and focus exclusively on that path
- Be aware of the exact number of remaining development cards and their probabilities
- Track opponents' potential victory points, including hidden development cards
- If you're close to winning, prioritize actions that can be completed in a single turn

Before finalizing your action, check:
1. Is there a more efficient path to victory points?
2. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
3. Does this move help or hinder opponents?
4. Is there a defensive move needed to prevent an opponent from winning?
5. Are you properly diversified against dice probability?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 94 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. End turn to preserve wood and brick
2. Focus on collecting sheep and wheat next turn for either:
   a) Settlement building (if I get sheep)
   b) City upgrade (if I get another wheat)
3. Continue protecting longest road and largest army
4. Watch what RED builds and adjust strategy accordingly

# Game State Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state and available options:

## Victory Point Count:
- I (BLUE) have 8/10 VP: 2 cities (4 VP) + Longest Road (2 VP) + Largest Army (2 VP)
- RED has 7/10 VP: 3 cities (6 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP)

## Resource Inventory:
- I have: 5 WOOD, 1 BRICK, 1 WHEAT, 3 ORE
- I'm missing SHEEP completely

## Available Actions:
- End turn
- Build additional roads (have resources for 1 road)
- Trade 4 WOOD for another resource

## Strategic Considerations:

1. **VP Path to Victory**: I need 2 more VP to win. Options:
   - Build 2 settlements (2 VP) - Need 2 WOOD, 2 BRICK, 2 WHEAT, 2 SHEEP
   - Build 1 city (1 VP) - Need 2 ORE, 3 WHEAT (short on WHEAT)
   - Get 2 VP development cards - Need 2x (1 ORE, 1 WHEAT, 1 SHEEP)

2. **Resource Assessment**:
   - I have 5 WOOD, which is more than needed
   - I'm short on WHEAT for city upgrades
   - I have no SHEEP for either settlements or development cards

3. **Road Building Analysis**:
   - I already have the Longest Road bonus
   - Building additional roads doesn't directly contribute to victory points
   - Using WOOD+BRICK now may prevent settlement building next turn

4. **Trading Options**:
   - Could trade 4 WOOD for SHEEP or WHEAT to prepare for future builds
   - The 4:1 trade rate is inefficient but might be strategic

5. **Opponent Analysis**:
   - RED is at 7 VP and needs 3 more
   - They have 3 cities already, suggesting a city-focused strategy
   - The robber is on SHEEP (6), blocking RED's best production

## Decision Process:

Looking at my path to victory, I need 2 more VP. My most efficient options:
1. Build settlements (requires SHEEP which I don't have)
2. Upgrade to city (requires more WHEAT than I have)
3. Buy development cards (requires SHEEP which I don't have)

I see that I can build an additional road, but this doesn't directly help me win since I already have Longest Road. Using my WOOD+BRICK now could delay settlement building if I get SHEEP next turn.

Trading 4 WOOD for SHEEP or WHEAT could prepare me for future builds, but at a very inefficient rate.

<plan>
1. End turn to preserve wood and brick
2. If I roll well and get WHEAT, aim for either:
   a) A settlement (if I also get SHEEP)
   b) A city upgrade (if I get 2 more WHEAT)
3. Continue protecting longest road and largest army
4. Consider trading only if absolutely necessary for a winning move
</plan>

The most strategic move is to end my turn, preserving resources for more efficient builds in the future rather than making suboptimal trades or unnecessary roads.

# Analyzing Robber Placement Options

I need to move the robber strategically to both disrupt RED's resource production and potentially gain a useful resource.

## Game State Analysis
- I'm at 8VP vs RED's 7VP (I'm leading but RED is close)
- I have Longest Road (+2VP) and Largest Army (+2VP)
- I have 2 Wood, 1 Wheat, 1 Ore
- RED has 4 unknown cards
- RED has 3 cities and 1 settlement for strong production

## Evaluating each robber placement option:

**[0] (0,0,0) Brick 3:**
- Blocks RED's brick production from 2 cities
- RED might need brick for roads to challenge my longest road
- Low probability number (3)

**[1] (1,-1,0) Wood 8:**
- High probability (8) wood
- Blocks MY OWN city at node 1
- Would severely hurt my wood production
- Not stealing from RED (no benefit)

**[2] (0,-1,1) Desert:**
- No production to block
- Can steal from RED
- Completely ineffective placement

**[3] (-1,0,1) Wheat 4:**
- Blocks wheat for RED's 2 buildings
- Average probability (4)
- Can steal from RED

**[4] (-1,1,0) Sheep 6:**
- Blocks high probability sheep (6) for RED's 2 cities
- This is RED's best sheep production
- Can steal from RED

**[5] (0,1,-1) Ore 9:**
- Blocks good probability ore (9) for RED's 2 buildings
- Ore is critical for city upgrades
- Can steal from RED

## Decision Logic:
1. I should avoid option [1] as it hurts my own production
2. Option [2] is ineffective (desert)
3. Between options [0], [3], [4], and [5], I need to consider:
   - Which resource is most valuable to RED right now?
   - Which has the highest production probability?

RED has 3 cities and may be trying to build settlements or more cities. They would need:
- For settlements: wood, brick, sheep, wheat
- For cities: ore, wheat
- For development cards: ore, wheat, sheep

Option [4] blocks RED's best sheep source (6) and option [5] blocks RED's best ore source (9). These are both high-probability hexes. Given that RED already has 3 cities, blocking ore (option [5]) seems most critical to prevent further city development.

<plan>
1. Block RED's ore production to slow their city development
2. Continue protecting longest road and largest army
3. Use my wood, wheat and ore to work toward another settlement
4. Save resources and aim for city upgrade or settlement as soon as I get the right resources

- Save knight cards for breaking up opponent strategies or securing largest army
- Use knights defensively if you're producing valuable resources on high-probability hexes

TRADING TACTICS:
- Avoid trading resources that directly help opponents score points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades
- Trade excess resources before rolling 7 if you have more than 7 cards
- Consider bank/port trades when they enable an immediate build that advances your strategy
- When trading with players, try to receive resources that complete a build

ENDGAME STRATEGY:
- In the late game, hide your victory point potential (keep development cards hidden)
- Calculate the fastest path to 10 VP and focus exclusively on that path
- Be aware of the exact number of remaining development cards and their probabilities
- Track opponents' potential victory points, including hidden development cards
- If you're close to winning, prioritize actions that can be completed in a single turn

Before finalizing your action, check:
1. Is there a more efficient path to victory points?
2. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
3. Does this move help or hinder opponents?
4. Is there a defensive move needed to prevent an opponent from winning?
5. Are you properly diversified against dice probability?

# Game Analysis and Decision Making

I need to carefully analyze this critical game state to make the optimal move.

## Current Game Status
- I (BLUE) have 8/10 VP from: 2 cities (4 VP), Longest Road (2 VP), Largest Army (2 VP)
- RED has 7/10 VP from: 3 cities (6 VP), 1 settlement (1 VP)
- I have 2 WOOD, 1 BRICK, 1 WHEAT, 1 ORE
- The robber is on an ore hex (0, 1, -1), which affects RED's production

## Key Strategic Considerations
1. I'm leading by only 1 VP, and RED is close to winning with 7 VP
2. RED has strong production with 3 cities and 1 settlement
3. I have both Longest Road and Largest Army bonuses to protect
4. With my current resources, I can build a road but not a settlement or city

## Action Analysis
Let me consider each available option:

**[0] End Turn**
- Pros: Saves resources for more significant build later
- Cons: Misses opportunity to strengthen position, gives RED another turn to advance

**[1-4] Build Road (costs 1 WOOD, 1 BRICK)**
I need to determine which road location is most strategically valuable:
- [1] edge (2, 3) - Need to check if this extends my longest road
- [2] edge (10, 11) - Need to check if this extends my longest road
- [3] edge (19, 21) - This would connect to RED's settlement at node 21
- [4] edge (0, 5) - This would connect toward RED's city at node 5

The most critical factor is protecting my Longest Road bonus, as losing it would drop me to 6 VP and put RED ahead if they can claim it. Secondary consideration is blocking RED's expansion.

Road option [3] at edge (19, 21) seems most valuable as it appears to both extend toward RED's settlement at node 21, potentially blocking their expansion, while also likely extending my longest road.

I already have 11 segments in my longest road, which is substantial, but I still need to protect and potentially extend it to prevent RED from challenging it.

Looking at my resources, after building a road I'll have 1 WOOD, 0 BRICK, 1 WHEAT, 1 ORE - not enough for any significant build next turn unless I get lucky with production.

<plan>
1. Build road at strategic location to block RED's expansion and strengthen longest road
2. Continue protecting longest road and largest army bonuses
3. Gather resources for next settlement or city upgrade
4. Keep robber on RED's key production hexes to slow their progress
</plan>

Based on my analysis, I'll build a road at edge (19, 21) as it appears to offer the best strategic advantage by potentially blocking RED's expansion while strengthening my position.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL SETTLEMENT PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Place settlements on high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Target at least one spot with good ore and wheat production for city development
- Try to secure at least one high-probability spot (5, 6, 8, 9) for each critical resource
- Place your second settlement to complement your first (fill resource gaps)
- Aim for access to all five resources or position near useful ports if resource diversity isn't possible
- Always consider which settlements opponents are likely to place and avoid areas that will become contested
- Place roads pointing toward valuable future expansion spots, not toward the center
- Consider the long-term impact: settlements that can't expand are less valuable

MID-GAME RESOURCE PRIORITIES:
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each possible build (cities: 1VP for 5 resources is most efficient)
- Early phase: Secure at least one good source of brick and wood for minimal expansion
- Growth phase: Prioritize ore and wheat production for city upgrades (3VP for 5 resources is optimal)
- Late phase: Focus on the fastest path to victory points, whether through buildings or development cards
- Avoid trading resources that opponents need for immediate victory point gains
- Use 4:1 trades only when necessary; prioritize port usage when possible

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and limited expansion options
- If you get an early knight, save it for defense or until you can start building toward largest army
- Time monopoly card usage for when opponents likely have accumulated specific resources
- Save year of plenty cards for completing crucial builds when you're short 1-2 specific resources
- Development cards are most valuable when:
  * You need hidden victory points to surprise opponents
  * You need knights to break up longest road or secure largest army
  * You're lacking wood/brick for expansion but have plenty of sheep/wheat/ore

EXPANSION STRATEGY:
- Build roads only with clear settlement locations in mind
- Target settlements that give you access to ports or new resources
- Block opponents' expansion paths when it gives you a strategic advantage
- Consider the timing of expansion vs. city upgrades based on your resource production
- Calculate whether longest road is achievable and worth the resource investment
- When deciding between a new settlement and a city upgrade, compare immediate vs. long-term returns

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-probability hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Save knight cards for breaking up opponent strategies or securing largest army
- Use knights defensively if you're producing valuable resources on high-probability hexes

TRADING TACTICS:
- Avoid trading resources that directly help opponents score points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades
- Trade excess resources before rolling 7 if you have more than 7 cards
- Consider bank/port trades when they enable an immediate build that advances your strategy
- When trading with players, try to receive resources that complete a build

ENDGAME STRATEGY:
- In the late game, hide your victory point potential (keep development cards hidden)
- Calculate the fastest path to 10 VP and focus exclusively on that path
- Be aware of the exact number of remaining development cards and their probabilities
- Track opponents' potential victory points, including hidden development cards
- If you're close to winning, prioritize actions that can be completed in a single turn

Before finalizing your action, check:
1. Is there a more efficient path to victory points?
2. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
3. Does this move help or hinder opponents?
4. Is there a defensive move needed to prevent an opponent from winning?

# Robber Placement Analysis

I need to decide where to move the robber to maximize my advantage and hinder RED's progress toward 10 victory points.

## Current Game State Assessment
- I (BLUE) have 8/10 victory points, with Longest Road (+2 VP) and Largest Army (+2 VP)
- RED has 7/10 victory points with 3 cities (6 VP) and 1 settlement (1 VP)
- RED is only 3 points away from winning
- The robber is currently on (0, 1, -1), which is ore with a roll of 9

## Analyzing Each Option

**[0] Move robber to (0, 0, 0) and steal from RED**
- This is brick (🧱3) - low probability number
- RED has two cities connected to this hex (nodes 3 and 5)
- I have one city connected (node 1)
- Blocking my own resource, but it's a low-probability roll
- Can steal a card from RED

**[1] Move robber to (1, -1, 0)**
- This is wood (🌲8) - high probability number
- I have a city here (node 1)
- RED has no buildings here
- Would hurt my own production significantly
- Cannot steal from RED

**[2] Move robber to (0, -1, 1) and steal from RED**
- This is desert (🏜️) - produces nothing
- No benefit to placing the robber here
- Can steal from RED, but desert placement is wasteful

**[3] Move robber to (-1, 0, 1) and steal from RED**
- This is wheat (🌾4) - below average probability
- RED has a city here (node 3 and 15)
- Blocks wheat production for RED
- Can steal from RED

**[4] Move robber to (-1, 1, 0) and steal from RED**
- This is sheep (🐑6) - high probability number
- RED has two cities here (nodes 5 and 15)
- This would block a very productive hex for RED (🐑6[⭐⭐⭐])
- Can steal from RED

**[5] Move robber to (1, 0, -1)**
- This is wheat (🌾10) - average probability
- I have two cities here (nodes 1 and 20)
- RED has no buildings here
- Would significantly hurt my own production
- Cannot steal from RED

## Strategic Considerations
1. RED is close to winning (7/10 VP)
2. I should target RED's high-probability production
3. I should avoid blocking my own key resources
4. Stealing from RED provides additional benefit
5. Sheep (🐑6) is RED's highest producing resource, connected to two cities

<plan>
1. Keep robber on RED's key production hexes to slow their progress
2. Focus on converting my resources to additional victory points
3. Maintain longest road and largest army bonuses
4. Work toward my final city or settlement to reach 10 VP
</plan>

Looking at all options, the most effective placement would be on (-1, 1, 0), the sheep hex with a roll of 6. This targets RED's highest production hex that supplies two cities, and allows me to steal a card. This is clearly option [4].

# Game Analysis for Turn 98

Let me analyze the current game state and determine the optimal action:

## Current Situation
- I have 8 VP: 2 cities (4 VP), longest road (2 VP), largest army (2 VP)
- I need 2 more VP to win
- My resources: 1 Wood, 5 Wheat, 2 Ore
- Robber is on RED's sheep hex (6), blocking one of their key production spots
- RED has 7 VP and is catching up

## Resource Assessment
With my current resources (1 Wood, 5 Wheat, 2 Ore), I cannot:
- Build a settlement (need 1 Brick, 1 Wood, 1 Wheat, 1 Sheep)
- Build a city (need 3 Ore, 2 Wheat - I'm 1 Ore short)
- Buy a development card (need 1 Ore, 1 Wheat, 1 Sheep - missing Sheep)

## Action Options
1. Trading wheat for other resources
2. Ending my turn to collect more resources on future rolls

## Strategic Analysis
To reach 10 VP, my most efficient path would be:
1. Build a city (2 VP) to replace one of my remaining settlements - but I need 1 more Ore
2. Buy a development card hoping for a Victory Point card - but I need a Sheep

Looking at my trading options (1-4), none are particularly efficient as they would require a 4:1 trade ratio. If I traded 4 Wheat for 1 Ore, I could then build a city on my next turn if I roll some Wheat.

However, I already have 5 Wheat and only need 2 for a city. Trading would be inefficient when I can simply wait to collect Ore naturally on my next rolls. Since I have the longest road and largest army bonuses secured, I'm in a strong position to wait.

<plan>
1. Maintain robber position on RED's key production hexes to slow their progress
2. End turn to collect resources, particularly hoping for Ore to build my final city
3. Continue protecting my longest road and largest army bonuses
4. With 3 Ore and 2 Wheat, build a city to reach 10 VP and win
</plan>

The most strategic move is to preserve my resource advantage and end my turn. Trading at a 4:1 ratio would be inefficient given my current position.

PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL SETTLEMENT PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Place settlements on high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Target at least one spot with good ore and wheat production for city development
- Try to secure at least one high-probability spot (5, 6, 8, 9) for each critical resource
- Place your second settlement to complement your first (fill resource gaps)
- Aim for access to all five resources or position near useful ports if resource diversity isn't possible
- Always consider which settlements opponents are likely to place and avoid areas that will become contested
- Place roads pointing toward valuable future expansion spots, not toward the center
- Consider the long-term impact: settlements that can't expand are less valuable

MID-GAME RESOURCE PRIORITIES:
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each possible build (cities: 1VP for 5 resources is most efficient)
- Early phase: Secure at least one good source of brick and wood for minimal expansion
- Growth phase: Prioritize ore and wheat production for city upgrades (3VP for 5 resources is optimal)
- Late phase: Focus on the fastest path to victory points, whether through buildings or development cards
- Avoid trading resources that opponents need for immediate victory point gains
- Use 4:1 trades only when necessary; prioritize port usage when possible

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and limited expansion options
- If you get an early knight, save it for defense or until you can start building toward largest army
- Time monopoly card usage for when opponents likely have accumulated specific resources
- Save year of plenty cards for completing crucial builds when you're short 1-2 specific resources
- Development cards are most valuable when:
  * You need hidden victory points to surprise opponents
  * You need knights to break up longest road or secure largest army
  * You're lacking wood/brick for expansion but have plenty of sheep/wheat/ore

EXPANSION STRATEGY:
- Build roads only with clear settlement locations in mind
- Target settlements that give you access to ports or new resources
- Block opponents' expansion paths when it gives you a strategic advantage
- Consider the timing of expansion vs. city upgrades based on your resource production
- Calculate whether longest road is achievable and worth the resource investment
- When deciding between a new settlement and a city upgrade, compare immediate vs. long-term returns

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-probability hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Save knight cards for breaking up opponent strategies or securing largest army
- Use knights defensively if you're producing valuable resources on high-probability hexes

TRADING TACTICS:
- Avoid trading resources that directly help opponents score points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades
- Trade excess resources before rolling 7 if you have more than 7 cards
- Consider bank/port trades when they enable an immediate build that advances your strategy
- When trading with players, try to receive resources that complete a build

ENDGAME STRATEGY:
- In the late game, hide your victory point potential (keep development cards hidden)
- Calculate the fastest path to 10 VP and focus exclusively on that path
- Be aware of the exact number of remaining development cards and their probabilities
- Track opponents' potential victory points, including hidden development cards
- If you're close to winning, prioritize actions that can be completed in a single turn

Before finalizing your action, check:
1. Is there a more efficient path to victory points?
2. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
3. Does this move help or hinder opponents?
4. Is there a defensive move needed to prevent an opponent from winning?
5. Are you properly diversified against dice probability?

# Game Analysis

I need to carefully analyze the current game state and determine my optimal move to maximize my chances of winning.

## Current Victory Point Status
- I (BLUE) have 8 VP: 2 cities (4 VP) + Longest Road (2 VP) + Largest Army (2 VP)
- RED has 7 VP: 3 cities (6 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP)
- I need 2 more VP to win

## Resource Analysis
- I currently have: 1 Wood, 9 Wheat, 2 Ore
- To build a city (worth 2 VP), I need: 3 Ore, 2 Wheat
- I currently have enough Wheat but am short 1 Ore

## Action Options
- End turn and collect resources on next rolls
- Maritime trade 4 Wheat for 1 Ore, which would give me exactly enough resources for a city

## Strategy Evaluation

Trading 4 Wheat for 1 Ore would give me exactly enough resources (3 Ore, 2 Wheat) to build a city, which would get me to 10 VP and win the game immediately.

Alternatively, ending my turn would mean:
- Hoping for an Ore roll on my next turn
- Risking RED getting to 10 VP before me (they're at 7 VP)
- Risking getting a 7 roll and losing resources if I have more than 7

Given that I can win this turn with a guaranteed action versus taking a risk by waiting, the optimal move is clear.

<plan>Trade 4 Wheat for 1 Ore, then build a city to reach 10 VP and win the game</plan>

I'll trade 4 of my 9 Wheat to get the 1 Ore I need. This will give me exactly 3 Ore and still leave me with 5 Wheat (more than the 2 needed for a city). After the trade, I can immediately build a city and win the game with 10 VP.

# Game Analysis

Let me analyze my current position and available actions to determine the optimal move.

## Current Game State
- I have 8/10 VP:
  - 2 cities (4 VP)
  - Longest road (2 VP)
  - Largest army (2 VP)
- Resources: 1 Wood, 5 Wheat, 3 Ore
- RED has 7/10 VP and is close behind

## Victory Point Analysis
To reach 10 VP, I need 2 more points. My options:
1. Build a city (+1 VP) - Requires 3 Ore + 2 Wheat (I have 3 Ore, 5 Wheat)
2. Build 2 settlements (+2 VP) - Requires 2 Wood, 2 Brick, 2 Wheat, 2 Sheep
3. Buy development cards hoping for VP - Requires Ore, Wheat, Sheep

## Resource Assessment
For a city upgrade, I have sufficient Wheat (5) but exactly enough Ore (3). Since I already have the resources needed for a city, this is my most efficient path to victory.

## Action Evaluation
Looking at my available actions:
- [0] End turn - This wastes my opportunity to win this turn
- [1-4] Trade options - I don't need any trades since I already have the resources needed for a city

However, I notice an issue - the action to build a city isn't listed in the available actions. This suggests that either:
1. I don't have any settlements to upgrade to cities
2. The game interface didn't include building options in the action list

Since I have 0 settlements according to the player status, I can't build a city. This means I need to reconsider my strategy.

<plan>
Since I can't build a city (having no settlements to upgrade), I'll trade 4 Wheat for 1 Ore to accumulate resources toward building a settlement (when possible) or buying development cards on future turns.
</plan>

Given I have 5 Wheat and trading 4 Wheat for 1 Ore would give me 4 Ore total, I should make this trade to prepare for future turns. Since I can't win this turn, accumulating the most valuable resources is best.

Ore is the most valuable resource because:
1. It's needed for both cities and development cards
2. It appears on only 2 hexes on this board (and one is blocked by the robber)

Therefore, the optimal action is:

Based on this information, which action number do you choose? Think step by step about your options, then put the final action number in a box like \boxed{1}.
RESPONSE:
I'll analyze the current game state and the available options:

**Current Game State Analysis:**
- I have 8/10 VP (2 cities + 2 VP from Longest Road + 2 VP from Largest Army)
- RED has 7/10 VP (1 settlement + 3 cities)
- I currently hold 1 🌲WOOD, 1 🌾WHEAT, 4 ⛏️ORE
- Robber is on a sheep tile, impacting a resource I don't currently have

**Resources Needed for Building:**
- Settlement: 1 WOOD + 1 BRICK + 1 WHEAT + 1 SHEEP (I have 1 WOOD + 1 WHEAT, missing BRICK and SHEEP)
- Development Card: 1 ORE + 1 WHEAT + 1 SHEEP (I have 4 ORE + 1 WHEAT, missing SHEEP)
- Road: 1 WOOD + 1 BRICK (I have 1 WOOD, missing BRICK)

**Strategic Options:**
1. End turn without trading (accumulate resources)
2. Trade for SHEEP to work toward a development card
3. Trade for BRICK to work toward a road or settlement
4. Trade for more WHEAT or WOOD (less optimal now)

Since I'm ahead in VP (8 vs 7), I need to focus on the fastest path to 2 more VP. Development cards offer a chance at immediate VP or knights to reinforce my largest army, and I'm closer to building a dev card than a settlement.

My main bottleneck right now is SHEEP. If I trade 4 ORE for 1 SHEEP, I would have 1 WOOD, 1 WHEAT, 1 SHEEP, and 0 ORE - which still isn't enough for any build.

<plan>I'll end my turn without making a trade. Trading 4:1 is inefficient, and I'm already in the lead. Better to roll and potentially gain resources that complement what I already have. I'll focus on getting a SHEEP to buy a development card, or BRICK to expand with a new settlement.</plan>

Since none of the available trades will enable an immediate build and I'm already in a leading position, the most strategic choice is to:

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL SETTLEMENT PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Place settlements on high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Target at least one spot with good ore and wheat production for city development
- Try to secure at least one high-probability spot (5, 6, 8, 9) for each critical resource
- Place your second settlement to complement your first (fill resource gaps)
- Aim for access to all five resources or position near useful ports if resource diversity isn't possible
- Always consider which settlements opponents are likely to place and avoid areas that will become contested
- Place roads pointing toward valuable future expansion spots, not toward the center
- Consider the long-term impact: settlements that can't expand are less valuable

MID-GAME RESOURCE PRIORITIES:
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each possible build (cities: 1VP for 5 resources is most efficient)
- Early phase: Secure at least one good source of brick and wood for minimal expansion
- Growth phase: Prioritize ore and wheat production for city upgrades (3VP for 5 resources is optimal)
- Late phase: Focus on the fastest path to victory points, whether through buildings or development cards
- Avoid trading resources that opponents need for immediate victory point gains
- Use 4:1 trades only when necessary; prioritize port usage when possible

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and limited expansion options
- If you get an early knight, save it for defense or until you can start building toward largest army
- Time monopoly card usage for when opponents likely have accumulated specific resources
- Save year of plenty cards for completing crucial builds when you're short 1-2 specific resources
- Development cards are most valuable when:
  * You need hidden victory points to surprise opponents
  * You need knights to break up longest road or secure largest army
  * You're lacking wood/brick for expansion but have plenty of sheep/wheat/ore

EXPANSION STRATEGY:
- Build roads only with clear settlement locations in mind
- Target settlements that give you access to ports or new resources
- Block opponents' expansion paths when it gives you a strategic advantage
- Consider the timing of expansion vs. city upgrades based on your resource production
- Calculate whether longest road is achievable and worth the resource investment
- When deciding between a new settlement and a city upgrade, compare immediate vs. long-term returns

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-probability hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Save knight cards for breaking up opponent strategies or securing largest army
- Use knights defensively if you're producing valuable resources on high-probability hexes

TRADING TACTICS:
- Avoid trading resources that directly help opponents score points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades
- Trade excess resources before rolling 7 if you have more than 7 cards
- Consider bank/port trades when they enable an immediate build that advances your strategy
- When trading with players, try to receive resources that complete a build

ENDGAME STRATEGY:
- In the late game, hide your victory point potential (keep development cards hidden)
- Calculate the fastest path to 10 VP and focus exclusively on that path
- Be aware of the exact number of remaining development cards and their probabilities
- Track opponents' potential victory points, including hidden development cards
- If you're close to winning, prioritize actions that can be completed in a single turn

Before finalizing your action, check:
1. Is there a more efficient path to victory points?
2. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
3. Does this move help or hinder opponents?
4. Is there a defensive move needed to prevent an opponent from winning?
5. Are you properly diversified against dice probability?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game Analysis and Decision

Let me analyze the current game state and available actions:

## Current Situation:
- I'm at 8 VP (2 cities = 4 VP, Longest Road = 2 VP, Largest Army = 2 VP)
- RED is at 7 VP (3 cities = 6 VP, 1 settlement = 1 VP)
- My resources: 1 WOOD, 1 WHEAT, 6 ORE
- Available actions: End turn or trade 4 ORE for any resource

## VP Gap Analysis:
I'm ahead by only 1 VP, and RED could be hiding VP cards. I need 2 more VP to win.

## Resource Evaluation:
- With current resources, I can't build anything immediately
- I have excess ORE (6), but lacking other resources
- Trading 4:1 is inefficient but might enable a build

## Options:

1. **End Turn (Option 0)** 
   - Roll dice and potentially gain new resources
   - Risk: RED might get to 10 VP on their turn
   - Benefit: Preserve resources for more efficient builds later

2. **Trade for BRICK (Option 4)**
   - Would have: 1 WOOD, 1 BRICK, 1 WHEAT, 2 ORE
   - Still can't build a settlement (need 1 more SHEEP)
   - Can't build a road (need 1 more WOOD)

3. **Trade for SHEEP (Option 1)**
   - Would have: 1 WOOD, 1 WHEAT, 1 SHEEP, 2 ORE
   - Could potentially buy a development card on next turn if I get another WHEAT and ORE
   - Could be a VP card which would get me to 9/10

4. **Trade for WHEAT (Option 2)**
   - Would have: 1 WOOD, 2 WHEAT, 2 ORE
   - Still insufficient for any immediate build

5. **Trade for WOOD (Option 3)**
   - Would have: 2 WOOD, 1 WHEAT, 2 ORE
   - Still insufficient for any immediate build

## Strategic Decision:
Trading 4:1 is very inefficient, and none of the trades enable an immediate build. It's better to end the turn and roll for resources that might complement what I already have.

<plan>
End my turn without trading. I'll aim to collect more diverse resources on my roll. With my production capabilities, I'll focus on:
1. Getting a development card (need 1 ORE + 1 WHEAT + 1 SHEEP) which could give me my 9th VP
2. OR building a settlement (need 1 WOOD + 1 BRICK + 1 WHEAT + 1 SHEEP) for my 9th VP
3. Then focus on the final VP through either development card or settlement
</plan>

Given this analysis and the fact that no trade provides an immediate strategic advantage, ending my turn is the best action.

# Game Analysis for Blue Player at Turn 104

I'll carefully analyze my situation as Blue to determine the optimal move.

## Current Position Assessment
- I have 8/10 VP: 2 cities (4 VP) + Longest Road (2 VP) + Largest Army (2 VP)
- Current resources: 1 Wood, 1 Wheat, 6 Ore
- Red has 7/10 VP: 3 cities (6 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP)

## Strategic Position
- I'm ahead by 1 VP (8 vs 7)
- I have control of both special bonuses (Longest Road and Largest Army)
- My production is strong on Ore (cities on 9) but limited diversity

## Path to Victory Analysis
To reach 10 VP, I need 2 more points from:
1. Building 2 settlements (2 VP) - requires 2 Wood, 2 Brick, 2 Wheat, 2 Sheep
2. Building 1 city (1 VP) - requires 3 Ore, 2 Wheat
3. Getting Victory Point cards (1 VP each) - requires 1 Ore, 1 Wheat, 1 Sheep per card
4. Any combination of the above

## Resource Analysis
My bottlenecks are:
- No Sheep currently
- No Brick currently
- Only 1 Wheat
- Only 1 Wood

## Action Evaluation

**Option 0: End my turn**
- I keep my 6 Ore, 1 Wood, and 1 Wheat
- On next roll, I might get more resources to complete a build
- Risk: Red could get closer to winning on their turn

**Option 1-4: Trade with port**
- Converting 4 Ore to Sheep (Option 1) would give me 1 Ore, 1 Wood, 1 Wheat, 1 Sheep
   - This is 1 Ore short of a development card
   - Still need Brick for a settlement

- Converting 4 Ore to Wheat (Option 2) would give me 1 Ore, 1 Wood, 2 Wheat
   - Not enough resources for any immediate build

- Converting 4 Ore to Wood (Option 3) would give me 1 Ore, 2 Wood, 1 Wheat
   - Not enough resources for any immediate build

- Converting 4 Ore to Brick (Option 4) would give me 1 Ore, 1 Wood, 1 Wheat, 1 Brick
   - Not enough resources for a settlement (need 1 more Sheep)
   - Not enough for any other build

## Decision Logic

None of the trades will enable me to build anything immediately. At a 4:1 rate, these trades are inefficient.

Given that:
1. I have excess Ore but not enough to justify a 4:1 trade
2. I'm 2 VP ahead of Red with control of both special bonuses
3. I'm likely to get more resources on my next roll

<plan>
End my turn without trading. On my next turn, I'll focus on:
1. If I roll more resources, try to build a development card (need 1 ORE + 1 WHEAT + 1 SHEEP)
2. OR collect resources for a settlement (need 1 WOOD + 1 BRICK + 1 WHEAT + 1 SHEEP)
3. Maintain my Longest Road and Largest Army advantages
4. Be cautious of Red building a 4th city which would put them at 8 VP
</plan>

The optimal move is to end my turn and wait for better opportunities after my next dice roll.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL SETTLEMENT PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Place settlements on high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Target at least one spot with good ore and wheat production for city development
- Try to secure at least one high-probability spot (5, 6, 8, 9) for each critical resource
- Place your second settlement to complement your first (fill resource gaps)
- Aim for access to all five resources or position near useful ports if resource diversity isn't possible
- Always consider which settlements opponents are likely to place and avoid areas that will become contested
- Place roads pointing toward valuable future expansion spots, not toward the center
- Consider the long-term impact: settlements that can't expand are less valuable

MID-GAME RESOURCE PRIORITIES:
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each possible build (cities: 1VP for 5 resources is most efficient)
- Early phase: Secure at least one good source of brick and wood for minimal expansion
- Growth phase: Prioritize ore and wheat production for city upgrades (3VP for 5 resources is optimal)
- Late phase: Focus on the fastest path to victory points, whether through buildings or development cards
- Avoid trading resources that opponents need for immediate victory point gains
- Use 4:1 trades only when necessary; prioritize port usage when possible

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and limited expansion options
- If you get an early knight, save it for defense or until you can start building toward largest army
- Time monopoly card usage for when opponents likely have accumulated specific resources
- Save year of plenty cards for completing crucial builds when you're short 1-2 specific resources
- Development cards are most valuable when:
  * You need hidden victory points to surprise opponents
  * You need knights to break up longest road or secure largest army
  * You're lacking wood/brick for expansion but have plenty of sheep/wheat/ore

EXPANSION STRATEGY:
- Build roads only with clear settlement locations in mind
- Target settlements that give you access to ports or new resources
- Block opponents' expansion paths when it gives you a strategic advantage
- Consider the timing of expansion vs. city upgrades based on your resource production
- Calculate whether longest road is achievable and worth the resource investment
- When deciding between a new settlement and a city upgrade, compare immediate vs. long-term returns

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-probability hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Save knight cards for breaking up opponent strategies or securing largest army
- Use knights defensively if you're producing valuable resources on high-probability hexes

TRADING TACTICS:
- Avoid trading resources that directly help opponents score points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades
- Trade excess resources before rolling 7 if you have more than 7 cards
- Consider bank/port trades when they enable an immediate build that advances your strategy
- When trading with players, try to receive resources that complete a build

ENDGAME STRATEGY:
- In the late game, hide your victory point potential (keep development cards hidden)
- Calculate the fastest path to 10 VP and focus exclusively on that path
- Be aware of the exact number of remaining development cards and their probabilities
- Track opponents' potential victory points, including hidden development cards
- If you're close to winning, prioritize actions that can be completed in a single turn

Before finalizing your action, check:
1. Is there a more efficient path to victory points?
2. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
3. Does this move help or hinder opponents?
4. Is there a defensive move needed to prevent an opponent from winning?
5. Are you properly diversified against dice probability?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game Analysis

I'll analyze the current state of the game and determine the best course of action.

## Victory Point Status
- I (Blue) have 8 VP: 2 cities (4 VP), Longest Road (2 VP), Largest Army (2 VP)
- Red has 7 VP: 3 cities (6 VP), 1 settlement (1 VP)
- I need 2 more VP to win

## Resource Inventory
I have:
- 3 🌲WOOD
- 1 🌾WHEAT
- 6 ⛏️ORE
- Missing: BRICK and SHEEP

## Possible Builds with Current Resources
- City: Requires 3 ORE + 2 WHEAT (I have enough ORE but not enough WHEAT)
- Development Card: Requires 1 ORE + 1 WHEAT + 1 SHEEP (Missing SHEEP)
- Settlement: Requires 1 WOOD + 1 BRICK + 1 WHEAT + 1 SHEEP (Missing BRICK and SHEEP)
- Road: Requires 1 WOOD + 1 BRICK (Missing BRICK)

## Trading Options
I could trade 4 ORE for either SHEEP (option 1) or WHEAT (option 2).

If I trade 4 ORE for SHEEP (option 1):
- I'd have 2 ORE, 3 WOOD, 1 WHEAT, 1 SHEEP
- Still couldn't build anything immediately
- Would be closer to a dev card (would need more ORE and SHEEP)

If I trade 4 ORE for WHEAT (option 2):
- I'd have 2 ORE, 3 WOOD, 2 WHEAT
- Still couldn't build anything immediately
- Would be closer to a city (would still need 1 more ORE)

## Strategic Evaluation
- My current position is strong with both Longest Road and Largest Army
- Red is at 7 VP and could potentially build another city to reach 9 VP
- I don't have an immediate build opportunity even with trading
- Trading 4:1 is very inefficient and would deplete my ORE reserves
- Better to save resources for next turn when I might roll more complementary resources

<plan>
1. End turn without trading to maintain resource diversity
2. On next turn, hope to roll more WHEAT, SHEEP or BRICK
3. If I get WHEAT and SHEEP, buy a development card (could give VP or Knight)
4. If I get BRICK, focus on settlement expansion
5. Continue to protect Longest Road and Largest Army advantages
6. Watch out for Red's progress toward 10 VP
</plan>

Since none of the maritime trades would allow me to build anything immediately, and 4:1 trades are very inefficient, the best course of action is to end my turn and hope for better rolls next turn.

# Game Analysis for Settlers of Catan Turn 108

Let me thoroughly analyze the current game state and my available options.

## Current Game Position
- I have 8 VP: 2 cities (4 VP), longest road (2 VP), and largest army (2 VP)
- Red has 7 VP: 3 cities (6 VP) and 1 settlement (1 VP)
- I need 2 more VP to win
- Resources in hand: 3 Wood, 1 Wheat, 6 Ore

## Available Options
Let me evaluate each possible action:
1. End turn (option 0)
2. Trade 4 Ore for 1 Sheep (option 1)
3. Trade 4 Ore for 1 Wheat (option 2)
4. Trade 4 Ore for 1 Wood (option 3)
5. Trade 4 Ore for 1 Brick (option 4)

## Option Analysis

**End Turn (0):**
- Preserves all my resources
- I'll get new resources on next roll
- Currently can't build anything significant with my resources

**Trade for Sheep (1):**
- With 1 Sheep + 1 Wheat + 1 Ore = Development card
- I'd have 5 Ore left after trade
- Development cards offer: 20% chance of VP, 40% chance of Knight, 40% chance of progress card
- Knight would strengthen my largest army advantage
- VP card would put me at 9 VP

**Trade for Wheat (2):**
- With 1 more Wheat + 1 Ore = Development card (if I had Sheep)
- But I don't have Sheep, so this doesn't enable any immediate builds

**Trade for Wood (3):**
- Would give me 4 Wood total
- Not useful as I need Brick to build roads/settlements

**Trade for Brick (4):**
- With 1 Brick + 1 Wood = Road
- Could potentially expand, but would need multiple roads plus resources for settlement
- Not an efficient path to victory compared to other options

## Strategic Considerations
1. I have a solid lead with longest road and largest army
2. Red is 3 VP behind but has strong production
3. 4:1 trades are inefficient but may be necessary if they enable key builds
4. Development cards are valuable as they could provide hidden VP or knights to maintain largest army

## Decision Process
With my current resources, I can't build a new settlement or city. My most efficient path to victory is likely through development cards, which could give me VP or strengthen my largest army advantage.

The most sensible action would be to trade for a Sheep to potentially buy a development card on my next turn if I roll more Wheat. However, 4:1 trades are very inefficient, and I already have a strong position.

<plan>
1. End turn without trading to preserve resources
2. On next turn, aim to buy a development card if I roll Sheep and Wheat
3. Continue to protect Longest Road and Largest Army advantages
4. If development cards aren't viable, consider settlement expansion only with efficient resource trades
5. Watch Red closely, especially if they approach 8-9 VP
</plan>

Given these considerations, the most prudent choice is to end my turn and hope for better rolls rather than make an inefficient 4:1 trade.

# Game Analysis

I'll analyze the current game state and available options to determine the optimal action.

## Game Position Analysis
- I have 8 VP: 4 from buildings (2 cities), 2 from Longest Road, and 2 from Largest Army
- Red has 7 VP: 7 from buildings (3 cities, 1 settlement)
- I need 2 more VP to win
- My resources: 3 Wood, 9 Wheat, 6 Ore
- Available actions: End turn or various maritime trades

## Resource Evaluation
With my current resources, I can't build anything significant:
- City upgrade requires: 3 Ore, 2 Wheat (have enough resources but no settlement to upgrade)
- Settlement requires: 1 Wood, 1 Brick, 1 Wheat, 1 Sheep (missing Brick and Sheep)
- Development card requires: 1 Ore, 1 Wheat, 1 Sheep (missing Sheep)
- Road requires: 1 Wood, 1 Brick (missing Brick)

## Trading Analysis
Should I trade for missing resources?
- Trading for Brick would allow road building (but I already have Longest Road)
- Trading for Sheep would allow development card purchase (potential VP or Knight)
- However, the 4:1 trade ratio is very inefficient

## Decision Logic
1. I already have Longest Road and don't need more roads immediately
2. Trading 4 resources for 1 is highly inefficient when not enabling a critical build
3. I have plenty of Wheat (9) and Ore (6), suggesting I should save these for city upgrades
4. With 8 VP vs Red's 7 VP, I'm in the lead and don't need to make risky trades
5. By ending my turn, I preserve my resources for future opportunities

The best strategy is to hold my resources, wait for better dice rolls or trading opportunities on future turns, and maintain my lead.

<plan>
1. End turn and preserve resources
2. On next turn, aim to build another settlement if I roll or can trade for Brick and Sheep
3. Continue protecting Longest Road and Largest Army advantages
4. Watch for development card opportunities if I get a Sheep
5. Keep monitoring Red carefully as they're just 1 VP behind
</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL SETTLEMENT PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Place settlements on high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Target at least one spot with good ore and wheat production for city development
- Try to secure at least one high-probability spot (5, 6, 8, 9) for each critical resource
- Place your second settlement to complement your first (fill resource gaps)
- Aim for access to all five resources or position near useful ports if resource diversity isn't possible
- Always consider which settlements opponents are likely to place and avoid areas that will become contested
- Place roads pointing toward valuable future expansion spots, not toward the center
- Consider the long-term impact: settlements that can't expand are less valuable

MID-GAME RESOURCE PRIORITIES:
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each possible build (cities: 1VP for 5 resources is most efficient)
- Early phase: Secure at least one good source of brick and wood for minimal expansion
- Growth phase: Prioritize ore and wheat production for city upgrades (3VP for 5 resources is optimal)
- Late phase: Focus on the fastest path to victory points, whether through buildings or development cards
- Avoid trading resources that opponents need for immediate victory point gains
- Use 4:1 trades only when necessary; prioritize port usage when possible

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and limited expansion options
- If you get an early knight, save it for defense or until you can start building toward largest army
- Time monopoly card usage for when opponents likely have accumulated specific resources
- Save year of plenty cards for completing crucial builds when you're short 1-2 specific resources
- Development cards are most valuable when:
  * You need hidden victory points to surprise opponents
  * You need knights to break up longest road or secure largest army
  * You're lacking wood/brick for expansion but have plenty of sheep/wheat/ore

EXPANSION STRATEGY:
- Build roads only with clear settlement locations in mind
- Target settlements that give you access to ports or new resources
- Block opponents' expansion paths when it gives you a strategic advantage
- Consider the timing of expansion vs. city upgrades based on your resource production
- Calculate whether longest road is achievable and worth the resource investment
- When deciding between a new settlement and a city upgrade, compare immediate vs. long-term returns

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-probability hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Save knight cards for breaking up opponent strategies or securing largest army
- Use knights defensively if you're producing valuable resources on high-probability hexes

TRADING TACTICS:
- Avoid trading resources that directly help opponents score points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades
- Trade excess resources before rolling 7 if you have more than 7 cards
- Consider bank/port trades when they enable an immediate build that advances your strategy
- When trading with players, try to receive resources that complete a build

ENDGAME STRATEGY:
- In the late game, hide your victory point potential (keep development cards hidden)
- Calculate the fastest path to 10 VP and focus exclusively on that path
- Be aware of the exact number of remaining development cards and their probabilities
- Track opponents' potential victory points, including hidden development cards
- If you're close to winning, prioritize actions that can be completed in a single turn

Before finalizing your action, check:
1. Is there a more efficient path to victory points?
2. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
3. Does this move help or hinder opponents?
4. Is there a defensive move needed to prevent an opponent from winning?
5. Are you properly diversified against dice probability?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game Analysis - Turn 112

I need to analyze the current game state and determine the optimal move.

## Current Position Assessment
- I have 8 VP out of 10 needed to win
  - 2 cities = 4 VP
  - Longest Road = 2 VP
  - Largest Army = 2 VP
- Resources: 3 Wood, 13 Wheat, 6 Ore
- Red has 7 VP (1 settlement, 3 cities = 7 VP)

## Resource Analysis
- I have abundant Wheat (13) and Ore (6)
- I'm missing Brick and Sheep, which I'd need for:
  - Settlement: 1 Brick, 1 Wood, 1 Wheat, 1 Sheep
  - Development Card: 1 Wheat, 1 Sheep, 1 Ore

## Victory Path Options
1. Build 1 more city (2 Ore + 3 Wheat) = +1 VP → 9 VP
2. Build settlements (need Brick and Sheep) = +1 VP each → 9 or 10 VP
3. Buy development cards hoping for Victory Point cards (need Sheep) → could reach 9 or 10 VP

## Available Actions
- End turn (0)
- Various maritime trades (1-8)

## Strategic Decision
The most efficient path to victory would be to obtain Sheep and either:
1. Buy development cards hoping for VP cards
2. Get Brick to build a settlement

Looking at the available maritime trades, I could trade 4 Wheat for 1 Sheep (option 6) or 4 Ore for 1 Brick (option 4).

Given my resource distribution:
- I have 13 Wheat and 6 Ore
- After the trade, I'd still have 9 Wheat or 2 Ore respectively
- Both resources are plentiful relative to what I need

However, development cards are a gamble - I could get a Knight, Road Building, Year of Plenty, Monopoly, or VP card. Only VP cards directly contribute to my victory condition immediately.

A settlement is a guaranteed VP, but I'd need both Brick AND Sheep.

<plan>
1. Trade 4 Wheat for 1 Sheep now
2. Next turn, if I roll or can trade for Brick, build a settlement
3. If I can't get Brick, use the Sheep + Wheat + Ore to buy a development card
4. Continue protecting Longest Road and Largest Army advantages
5. Monitor Red closely as they're just 1 VP behind
</plan>

The most efficient action now is to trade 4 Wheat for 1 Sheep (option 6). This preserves more of my Ore (which is less abundant than my Wheat) and gives me the flexibility to either build a settlement (if I get Brick) or buy a development card on my next turn.

# Game Analysis and Decision-Making

Let me analyze the current game state and available actions to determine the optimal move.

## Current Game Status
- I have 8/10 victory points
- RED has 7/10 victory points (only 1 behind)
- My resources: 3 Wood, 1 Sheep, 9 Wheat, 6 Ore
- I have Longest Road (+2 VP) and Largest Army (+2 VP)

## Victory Point Analysis
My 8 points come from:
- 2 Cities (4 VP)
- Longest Road (2 VP)
- Largest Army (2 VP)

To reach 10 points, I need 2 more VP. Options include:
1. Build 2 settlements (2 VP)
2. Upgrade to 1 more city (1 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP)
3. Get 1-2 victory point development cards

## Resource Analysis
I'm missing brick, which is critical for settlements. I have excess wheat (9) and ore (6), which are good for cities and development cards.

## Action Options Evaluation

**Option 1: End Turn [0]**
- No immediate progress
- Risk allowing RED to catch up

**Option 2: Buy Development Card [1]**
- Costs: 1 Sheep, 1 Wheat, 1 Ore
- I have these resources
- Possible outcomes:
  - Victory Point card (25% chance): Direct path to 9 VP
  - Knight card: Strengthens my Largest Army lead
  - Year of Plenty/Monopoly: Could help get brick for settlement
  - Road Building: Not needed as I already have Longest Road

**Option 3: Trade Wheat for Brick [2]**
- Would allow me to build a road (if I need one)
- But I can't build a settlement yet as I'd still need more brick

**Option 4: Trade Ore for Sheep [3]**
- Would give me more sheep for development cards
- Not immediately useful without a specific build plan

**Options 5-9: Various other trades**
- Less immediately useful than options 1-3

## Strategic Decision

The most efficient path to victory appears to be buying a development card. This gives me:
- 25% chance of getting a Victory Point card (immediate progress)
- If not a VP card, strengthening my position with a knight or resource cards
- Maintains resource efficiency while making progress

I'll still have 8 Wheat and 5 Ore after buying the card, keeping my options open for next turn.

<plan>
1. Buy a development card now (hoping for VP card)
2. If I get a knight, save it for defense or to further strengthen my Largest Army lead
3. If I get resources cards, use them to get brick for settlement building
4. Next turn, trade for brick if needed and build a settlement, or continue with development cards
5. Keep protecting my Longest Road and Largest Army advantages
</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL SETTLEMENT PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Place settlements on high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Target at least one spot with good ore and wheat production for city development
- Try to secure at least one high-probability spot (5, 6, 8, 9) for each critical resource
- Place your second settlement to complement your first (fill resource gaps)
- Aim for access to all five resources or position near useful ports if resource diversity isn't possible
- Always consider which settlements opponents are likely to place and avoid areas that will become contested
- Place roads pointing toward valuable future expansion spots, not toward the center
- Consider the long-term impact: settlements that can't expand are less valuable

MID-GAME RESOURCE PRIORITIES:
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each possible build (cities: 1VP for 5 resources is most efficient)
- Early phase: Secure at least one good source of brick and wood for minimal expansion
- Growth phase: Prioritize ore and wheat production for city upgrades (3VP for 5 resources is optimal)
- Late phase: Focus on the fastest path to victory points, whether through buildings or development cards
- Avoid trading resources that opponents need for immediate victory point gains
- Use 4:1 trades only when necessary; prioritize port usage when possible

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and limited expansion options
- If you get an early knight, save it for defense or until you can start building toward largest army
- Time monopoly card usage for when opponents likely have accumulated specific resources
- Save year of plenty cards for completing crucial builds when you're short 1-2 specific resources
- Development cards are most valuable when:
  * You need hidden victory points to surprise opponents
  * You need knights to break up longest road or secure largest army
  * You're lacking wood/brick for expansion but have plenty of sheep/wheat/ore

EXPANSION STRATEGY:
- Build roads only with clear settlement locations in mind
- Target settlements that give you access to ports or new resources
- Block opponents' expansion paths when it gives you a strategic advantage
- Consider the timing of expansion vs. city upgrades based on your resource production
- Calculate whether longest road is achievable and worth the resource investment
- When deciding between a new settlement and a city upgrade, compare immediate vs. long-term returns

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-probability hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Save knight cards for breaking up opponent strategies or securing largest army
- Use knights defensively if you're producing valuable resources on high-probability hexes

TRADING TACTICS:
- Avoid trading resources that directly help opponents score points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades
- Trade excess resources before rolling 7 if you have more than 7 cards
- Consider bank/port trades when they enable an immediate build that advances your strategy
- When trading with players, try to receive resources that complete a build

ENDGAME STRATEGY:
- In the late game, hide your victory point potential (keep development cards hidden)
- Calculate the fastest path to 10 VP and focus exclusively on that path
- Be aware of the exact number of remaining development cards and their probabilities
- Track opponents' potential victory points, including hidden development cards
- If you're close to winning, prioritize actions that can be completed in a single turn

Before finalizing your action, check:
1. Is there a more efficient path to victory points?
2. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
3. Does this move help or hinder opponents?
4. Is there a defensive move needed to prevent an opponent from winning?
5. Are you properly diversified against dice probability?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game State Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state carefully to determine the optimal move:

## Victory Points (Current)
- BLUE (me): 8/10 VP
  - 2 cities (4 VP)
  - Longest road (2 VP)
  - Largest army (2 VP)
- RED: 7/10 VP
  - 3 cities (6 VP)
  - 1 settlement (1 VP)

## Resources
- I have: 3 wood, 8 wheat, 5 ore
- I'm missing: brick and sheep
- RED has 4 hidden cards

## Development Cards
- I have 1 knight card in hand
- 21 development cards remain in the bank

## Strategic Position
- I have Longest Road secured with 11 segments (RED has only 3)
- I have Largest Army with 3 knights (RED has 0)
- The robber is on RED's 6-sheep hex, which is good for me

## Action Evaluation:

1. **Buy a Development Card?**
   - Cost: 1 ore + 1 wheat + 1 sheep
   - I don't have sheep, so I can't buy a development card without trading

2. **Build a Settlement?**
   - Cost: 1 wood + 1 brick + 1 wheat + 1 sheep
   - I'm missing brick and sheep
   - Even with trading, I can't efficiently get both resources this turn

3. **Trading Options:**
   - I could trade 4 wheat for 1 brick (Action 1)
   - I could trade 4 ore for 1 sheep (Action 2)
   - Both trades are expensive at 4:1

4. **End Turn?**
   - Currently holding 16 cards, well over the 7-card limit
   - If I roll a 7, I'll lose half my cards (rounded down)
   - This is very risky and inefficient

## Decision Logic:

I need 2 more VP to win. My current plan was to buy development cards hoping for a VP card, but I lack sheep. RED is at 7 VP and could be close to victory.

The most efficient move is to convert excess resources through trade and build toward victory. With my current resources, I should aim to set up for a settlement next turn since I'm only 2 VP away from winning.

1. I should trade for brick using my excess wheat
2. Hold my knight card for defense
3. Next turn, I can try to get sheep and build a settlement

<plan>
1. Trade for brick now using excess wheat
2. End turn with brick, wood, wheat, and ore (but still below 7 cards if possible)
3. Next turn, focus on getting sheep through trades or production
4. Build a settlement next turn to reach 9 VP
5. Then either get one more development card for a potential VP or prepare for another settlement
</plan>

Based on my analysis, the optimal action is to trade 4 wheat for 1 brick:

# Game Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state and available options:

## Current Status
- I (BLUE) have 8 VP: 2 cities (4 VP), longest road (2 VP), largest army (2 VP)
- RED has 7 VP: 3 cities (6 VP), 1 settlement (1 VP)
- My resources: 3 Wood, 1 Brick, 4 Wheat, 5 Ore, 1 Knight card
- I need 2 more VP to win

## Victory Path Options
1. Build 2 more settlements (+2 VP) - Need more brick and sheep
2. Build another city (+1 VP) and get a VP development card (+1 VP) - Need sheep
3. Get 2 VP development cards (+2 VP) - Need sheep

## Resource Assessment
- I'm missing sheep, which I need for development cards
- I only have 1 brick, which limits my expansion options
- I have excess ore (5) and decent wheat (4)

## Action Evaluation
- I can't build a settlement now (need sheep)
- I can't buy a development card now (need sheep)
- I could build a road, but it doesn't directly help me get VP
- Trading options: I could trade ore or wheat to get brick or sheep

Looking at my current plan, I need sheep for development cards and more brick for expansion. The most efficient trade would be trading 4 ore for 1 sheep (option 5), as I have excess ore.

<plan>
1. Trade 4 ore for 1 sheep now
2. End turn with wood, brick, wheat, sheep, and remaining ore (still below 7 cards)
3. Next turn, buy a development card hoping for a VP card
4. If not a VP card, focus on getting more brick and wood for settlement
5. Maintain longest road and largest army bonuses
</plan>

Since RED has 7 VP, I need to make progress toward 10 VP quickly. Getting sheep now positions me to potentially draw a VP development card on my next turn.

# Game Analysis for Settlers of Catan

Let me analyze the current game state and available options systematically.

## Current Status
- I have 8/10 victory points (2 cities, longest road bonus, largest army bonus)
- RED player has 7/10 victory points (1 settlement, 3 cities)
- I need 2 more VP to win

## Resource Inventory
- 3 Wood, 1 Brick, 1 Sheep, 4 Wheat, 1 Ore
- 1 Knight development card in hand

## Victory Point Options

1. **Build Settlement (1 VP)**
   - Costs: 1 Wood, 1 Brick, 1 Wheat, 1 Sheep
   - I have sufficient Wood, Brick, and Wheat but only 1 Sheep
   - Settlement locations: nodes 7, 8, 9, 10, 23

2. **Buy Development Card (Potential VP)**
   - Costs: 1 Sheep, 1 Wheat, 1 Ore
   - I have all required resources
   - 21 development cards remain, some might be Victory Point cards

3. **Upgrade to City (1 VP)**
   - Not possible as I have no settlements to upgrade

## Immediate Options Analysis

Let's evaluate each action:

- **End Turn [0]**: Not optimal when I can make productive moves
- **Build Road [1-3]**: Maintains longest road but doesn't progress toward 10 VP
- **Build Settlement [4-8]**: Requires 1 more Sheep, which I don't have
- **Buy Development Card [9]**: Could yield immediate VP or Knight (for army security)
- **Maritime Trade [10-13]**: Option 13 gives me a Sheep for 4 Wheat

The critical path to victory requires either:
1. Trade for Sheep, then build settlement next turn (2 turns to victory)
2. Buy development card hoping for VP card (could win this turn if lucky)

## Decision Logic

I need to evaluate which path has higher probability of winning fastest:

- Getting a VP from development card is not guaranteed (probability depends on remaining cards)
- Building settlement is guaranteed 1 VP but requires another turn

Since I already have longest road and largest army secured, and RED is only at 7 VP, I can take a strategic approach.

Trading 4 Wheat for 1 Sheep (Action 13) will:
1. Allow me to build a settlement next turn (guaranteed VP)
2. Keep me below 7 cards to avoid robber issues
3. Maintain resource diversity for flexibility

This aligns with my current plan, and is the safest path forward given RED is 3 VP away from winning.

<plan>
1. Trade 4 wheat for 1 sheep now
2. End turn with 3 wood, 1 brick, 2 sheep, 0 wheat, 1 ore
3. Next turn, build a settlement for 1 VP to reach 9 VP
4. Continue developing toward final VP through development card or another settlement
</plan>

\boxed{13}
========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL SETTLEMENT PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Place settlements on high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Target at least one spot with good ore and wheat production for city development
- Try to secure at least one high-probability spot (5, 6, 8, 9) for each critical resource
- Place your second settlement to complement your first (fill resource gaps)
- Aim for access to all five resources or position near useful ports if resource diversity isn't possible
- Always consider which settlements opponents are likely to place and avoid areas that will become contested
- Place roads pointing toward valuable future expansion spots, not toward the center
- Consider the long-term impact: settlements that can't expand are less valuable

MID-GAME RESOURCE PRIORITIES:
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each possible build (cities: 1VP for 5 resources is most efficient)
- Early phase: Secure at least one good source of brick and wood for minimal expansion
- Growth phase: Prioritize ore and wheat production for city upgrades (3VP for 5 resources is optimal)
- Late phase: Focus on the fastest path to victory points, whether through buildings or development cards
- Avoid trading resources that opponents need for immediate victory point gains
- Use 4:1 trades only when necessary; prioritize port usage when possible

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and limited expansion options
- If you get an early knight, save it for defense or until you can start building toward largest army
- Time monopoly card usage for when opponents likely have accumulated specific resources
- Save year of plenty cards for completing crucial builds when you're short 1-2 specific resources
- Development cards are most valuable when:
  * You need hidden victory points to surprise opponents
  * You need knights to break up longest road or secure largest army
  * You're lacking wood/brick for expansion but have plenty of sheep/wheat/ore

EXPANSION STRATEGY:
- Build roads only with clear settlement locations in mind
- Target settlements that give you access to ports or new resources
- Block opponents' expansion paths when it gives you a strategic advantage
- Consider the timing of expansion vs. city upgrades based on your resource production
- Calculate whether longest road is achievable and worth the resource investment
- When deciding between a new settlement and a city upgrade, compare immediate vs. long-term returns

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-probability hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Save knight cards for breaking up opponent strategies or securing largest army
- Use knights defensively if you're producing valuable resources on high-probability hexes

TRADING TACTICS:
- Avoid trading resources that directly help opponents score points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades
- Trade excess resources before rolling 7 if you have more than 7 cards
- Consider bank/port trades when they enable an immediate build that advances your strategy
- When trading with players, try to receive resources that complete a build

ENDGAME STRATEGY:
- In the late game, hide your victory point potential (keep development cards hidden)
- Calculate the fastest path to 10 VP and focus exclusively on that path
- Be aware of the exact number of remaining development cards and their probabilities
- Track opponents' potential victory points, including hidden development cards
- If you're close to winning, prioritize actions that can be completed in a single turn

Before finalizing your action, check:
1. Is there a more efficient path to victory points?
2. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
3. Does this move help or hinder opponents?
4. Is there a defensive move needed to prevent an opponent from winning?
5. Are you properly diversified against dice probability?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game Analysis and Decision

Let me analyze the current game state and determine the optimal action from the available options.

## Current Game Status
- I have 8 victory points
- I need 2 more VPs to win (10 VP)
- Resources: 3 wood, 1 brick, 2 sheep, 1 ore
- Development cards: 1 knight
- I already have longest road (+2 VP) and largest army (+2 VP)
- Opponent has 7 VP

## Possible Paths to Victory
1. Build a settlement (+1 VP) → need brick, wood, wheat, sheep
2. Upgrade settlement to city (+1 VP) → need 3 ore, 2 wheat
3. Buy development card (chance at VP card) → need ore, wheat, sheep
4. Play my knight card (no direct VP gain)

## Available Actions Analysis
- [0] End turn
- [1] Build road at edge (2, 3) - costs 1 wood, 1 brick
- [2] Build road at edge (10, 11) - costs 1 wood, 1 brick
- [3] Build road at edge (0, 5) - costs 1 wood, 1 brick

Looking at my resources, I'm missing wheat to build a settlement (I have wood, brick, sheep, but no wheat). I only have 1 ore, so I'm far from a city upgrade.

According to my current plan, I was going to:
1. Trade 4 wheat for 1 sheep
2. End turn with 3 wood, 1 brick, 2 sheep, 0 wheat, 1 ore
3. Next turn, build a settlement

However, I don't have 4 wheat to trade, and I already have 2 sheep. Also, even with another resource trade, I don't have enough resources to build a settlement this turn.

<plan>
1. End turn and keep my resources (3 wood, 1 brick, 2 sheep, 1 ore)
2. Next turn, acquire wheat to build a settlement
3. Save the knight card for defensive purposes or to maintain largest army
4. Continue toward 10 VP through settlement building
</plan>

Since I don't have the resources needed for a settlement, and building another road doesn't directly help my position (I already have longest road), the most efficient action is to end my turn and save my resources for next turn.

# Game Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state and determine the optimal action.

## Current Situation
- I have 8 VP: 2 Cities (4 VP) + Longest Road (2 VP) + Largest Army (2 VP)
- I need just 2 more VP to win
- Resources: 3 Wood, 1 Brick, 2 Sheep, 1 Ore (but no Wheat)
- I have 1 Knight card available
- Opponent has 7 VP: 3 Cities (6 VP) + 1 Settlement (1 VP)

## Options Analysis
1. **Play Knight card** (Option 0):
   - Benefits:
     - Move robber away from my resource production (currently on sheep)
     - Potentially steal a needed resource like Wheat
     - Secure Largest Army further (I already have it)
   - Downsides:
     - Knight is my only development card - using it now means I won't have it for defense later
     - Already have Largest Army, so no immediate VP gain

2. **Roll Dice** (Option 1):
   - Benefits:
     - Chance to get more resources to build
     - Keep Knight card for future defensive or strategic use
   - Risks:
     - If I roll a 7, I'll need to move the robber without gaining resources
     - Opponent might get valuable resources if I roll their numbers

## Strategic Evaluation

The robber is currently on a sheep hex with 6 pips. This is a high-probability hex, but it's not blocking any of my production - it's potentially blocking the opponent's production at nodes 15 and 5. Since I already have 2 sheep, I don't urgently need to move the robber.

I don't have wheat right now, which I would need for any development card or settlement. Rolling offers a chance to get wheat from my City at node 1 (wheat-10) or City at node 20 (wheat-10).

Playing a Knight now wouldn't improve my victory point position, as I already have Largest Army. Saving it for a defensive move or strategic timing later seems more valuable.

<plan>
1. Roll the dice to gain resources
2. If I get wheat, build a settlement to reach 9 VP
3. Save the knight card for defensive purposes or to maintain largest army
4. Focus on getting the final VP through either another settlement or a VP development card
</plan>

Looking at my options, rolling the dice (Option 1) is more strategically sound at this point as it has the potential to advance my position without using up my Knight card defense.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL SETTLEMENT PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Place settlements on high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Target at least one spot with good ore and wheat production for city development
- Try to secure at least one high-probability spot (5, 6, 8, 9) for each critical resource
- Place your second settlement to complement your first (fill resource gaps)
- Aim for access to all five resources or position near useful ports if resource diversity isn't possible
- Always consider which settlements opponents are likely to place and avoid areas that will become contested
- Place roads pointing toward valuable future expansion spots, not toward the center
- Consider the long-term impact: settlements that can't expand are less valuable

MID-GAME RESOURCE PRIORITIES:
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each possible build (cities: 1VP for 5 resources is most efficient)
- Early phase: Secure at least one good source of brick and wood for minimal expansion
- Growth phase: Prioritize ore and wheat production for city upgrades (3VP for 5 resources is optimal)
- Late phase: Focus on the fastest path to victory points, whether through buildings or development cards
- Avoid trading resources that opponents need for immediate victory point gains
- Use 4:1 trades only when necessary; prioritize port usage when possible

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and limited expansion options
- If you get an early knight, save it for defense or until you can start building toward largest army
- Time monopoly card usage for when opponents likely have accumulated specific resources
- Save year of plenty cards for completing crucial builds when you're short 1-2 specific resources
- Development cards are most valuable when:
  * You need hidden victory points to surprise opponents
  * You need knights to break up longest road or secure largest army
  * You're lacking wood/brick for expansion but have plenty of sheep/wheat/ore

EXPANSION STRATEGY:
- Build roads only with clear settlement locations in mind
- Target settlements that give you access to ports or new resources
- Block opponents' expansion paths when it gives you a strategic advantage
- Consider the timing of expansion vs. city upgrades based on your resource production
- Calculate whether longest road is achievable and worth the resource investment
- When deciding between a new settlement and a city upgrade, compare immediate vs. long-term returns

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-probability hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Save knight cards for breaking up opponent strategies or securing largest army
- Use knights defensively if you're producing valuable resources on high-probability hexes

TRADING TACTICS:
- Avoid trading resources that directly help opponents score points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades
- Trade excess resources before rolling 7 if you have more than 7 cards
- Consider bank/port trades when they enable an immediate build that advances your strategy
- When trading with players, try to receive resources that complete a build

ENDGAME STRATEGY:
- In the late game, hide your victory point potential (keep development cards hidden)
- Calculate the fastest path to 10 VP and focus exclusively on that path
- Be aware of the exact number of remaining development cards and their probabilities
- Track opponents' potential victory points, including hidden development cards
- If you're close to winning, prioritize actions that can be completed in a single turn

Before finalizing your action, check:
1. Is there a more efficient path to victory points?
2. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
3. Does this move help or hinder opponents?
4. Is there a defensive move needed to prevent an opponent from winning?
5. Are you properly diversified against dice probability?

# Game Analysis

Let me carefully analyze the current game state to determine the optimal action:

## Current State Assessment
- I'm at 8 VP (2 cities = 4 VP, Longest Road = 2 VP, Largest Army = 2 VP)
- I need 2 more VP to win
- My resources: 3 Wood, 1 Brick, 2 Sheep, 1 Ore
- I have 1 Knight card available to play
- Red has 7 VP (3 cities = 6 VP, 1 settlement = 1 VP)

## Potential Victory Paths
1. **Build a settlement**: Would give me +1 VP, but I need 1 Wood, 1 Brick, 1 Sheep, 1 Wheat (I don't have wheat)
2. **Buy a development card**: Costs 1 Sheep, 1 Wheat, 1 Ore (I don't have wheat)
3. **Upgrade settlement to city**: Costs 2 Wheat, 3 Ore (I don't have enough resources)

## Action Analysis
- **[0] Play Knight card**: This maintains my Largest Army advantage, but doesn't immediately progress me toward 10 VP. It could help disrupt Red or gain a needed resource.
- **[1] End turn**: Saves resources for future turns but makes no progress this turn.
- **[2], [3], [4] Build road options**: These all cost 1 Wood, 1 Brick. This would use my brick, making it harder to build a settlement in the future. Road building doesn't give me immediate VP benefit since I already have Longest Road.

## Current Plan Review
My current plan mentions building a settlement if I get wheat, but I don't currently have wheat. Building a road doesn't align with this plan since I already have Longest Road secured, and would use up brick that I need for a settlement.

<plan>
1. End my turn to preserve resources
2. On next turn, try to acquire wheat through dice rolls or trading
3. Build a settlement (when I have wheat) to reach 9 VP
4. Aim for final VP through either another settlement or a development card
5. Keep knight card for defense or to maintain largest army
</plan>

Given my current resources and position, the best move is to end my turn and wait for better resource opportunities. I need to preserve my brick for a future settlement build. Playing the knight now doesn't provide immediate progress toward victory.

# Game Analysis: Turn 116

I need to decide whether to roll the dice or play my Knight card. Let me analyze the current game state:

## Current Game Position
- BLUE (me): 8/10 VP (2 cities, longest road, largest army)
- RED: 7/10 VP (3 cities, 1 settlement)
- I have: 3 Wood, 2 Sheep, 1 Ore, 1 Knight card
- I need 2 more VP to win

## Key Considerations

1. **Resource Needs:**
   - I currently have no wheat or brick
   - To build a settlement (1 VP), I would need wheat + brick + wood + sheep
   - I'm missing at least wheat and brick for a settlement

2. **Knight Card Value:**
   - I already have Largest Army (3 knights played)
   - Playing the knight would let me move the robber and steal a resource
   - The robber is currently on the wheat hex (10), which I need production from

3. **Risk Assessment:**
   - RED has 7 VP and could be close to winning
   - If I roll a 7, I'd have to move the robber anyway
   - RED has 0 visible cards, so stealing via Knight would likely yield nothing

## Decision Logic

If I play the Knight card:
- I can move the robber off my wheat hex (10)
- Might steal a resource from RED (though they have 0 visible cards)
- Would still need to roll dice afterward

If I roll the dice:
- I can potentially gain resources directly
- If I roll a 10, I'd immediately get wheat from both my cities
- Preserves my Knight card for defensive purposes
- Risk of rolling a 7 (which would require moving the robber anyway)

Looking at my current plan, I need wheat to build a settlement. Rolling gives me a chance to gain resources directly, while preserving my Knight card for when it would be more valuable.

<plan>
1. Roll the dice to potentially gain resources
2. If I get wheat, try to trade for brick to build a settlement
3. If resources aren't sufficient, end turn and continue resource collection
4. Save Knight card for defense or critical robber movement later
5. Focus on reaching 9 VP via settlement, then secure final VP
</plan>

Since the robber is already blocking a wheat hex I need, and RED has no visible cards to steal, rolling the dice is more valuable than playing the Knight now.

# Analyzing Robber Placement Strategy

I need to determine the optimal hex to place the robber by analyzing both defensive and offensive considerations.

## Current Game State Analysis
- I'm BLUE with 8 VP (2 cities, longest road +2 VP, largest army +2 VP)
- RED has 7 VP (3 cities, 1 settlement)
- I have 3 wood, 2 sheep, 1 ore, and 1 knight card
- The robber is currently on RED's wheat production at (1, 0, -1)

## Evaluating Each Option:
[0] Move robber to (0, 0, 0) - 🧱3
- This blocks a brick hex with number 3 (low probability)
- Affects: BLUE city at node 1 and RED city at nodes 3 and 5
- This would hurt both me and RED's brick production

[1] Move robber to (1, -1, 0) - 🌲8
- This blocks a wood hex with number 8 (high probability)
- Affects: BLUE city at node 1
- This would significantly hurt my own wood production (8 is high value)

[2] Move robber to (0, -1, 1) - 🏜️ Desert
- This is a desert tile that produces nothing
- Placing the robber here wastes the robber's blocking ability

[3] Move robber to (-1, 0, 1) - 🌾4
- This blocks a wheat hex with number 4 (medium-low probability)
- Affects: RED cities at nodes 3 and 15
- This targets exclusively RED's wheat production

[4] Move robber to (-1, 1, 0) - 🐑6
- This blocks a sheep hex with number 6 (high probability)
- Affects: RED cities at nodes 5 and 15
- This targets exclusively RED's sheep production at a high-probability hex

[5] Move robber to (0, 1, -1) - ⛏️9
- This blocks an ore hex with number 9 (medium-high probability)
- Affects: BLUE city at node 20, RED city at node 5, and RED settlement at node 21
- This would hurt both my ore production and RED's ore production

## Strategic Considerations
1. RED is at 7 VP and only 3 VP away from winning
2. Since RED has 3 cities and 1 settlement, blocking high-probability resources could slow their progress
3. I should ideally block resources critical to RED without hurting my own production
4. The sheep hex at (-1, 1, 0) with number 6 is a high-probability spot that feeds two of RED's cities
5. Placing the robber there would deny RED an important resource without hurting my own production

<plan>
1. Block RED's high-probability sheep production to slow their progress
2. Continue collecting resources to build my final settlement (need brick)
3. Save Knight card for defense against future robber placements on my key hexes
4. Look for opportunities to trade for brick to build my final settlement (to reach 9 VP)
5. Position for a development card purchase if settlement isn't viable
</plan>

Based on this analysis, I should place the robber on the sheep hex at (-1, 1, 0), which has a high production value (6) and feeds two of RED's cities without affecting my production.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL SETTLEMENT PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Place settlements on high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Target at least one spot with good ore and wheat production for city development
- Try to secure at least one high-probability spot (5, 6, 8, 9) for each critical resource
- Place your second settlement to complement your first (fill resource gaps)
- Aim for access to all five resources or position near useful ports if resource diversity isn't possible
- Always consider which settlements opponents are likely to place and avoid areas that will become contested
- Place roads pointing toward valuable future expansion spots, not toward the center
- Consider the long-term impact: settlements that can't expand are less valuable

MID-GAME RESOURCE PRIORITIES:
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each possible build (cities: 1VP for 5 resources is most efficient)
- Early phase: Secure at least one good source of brick and wood for minimal expansion
- Growth phase: Prioritize ore and wheat production for city upgrades (3VP for 5 resources is optimal)
- Late phase: Focus on the fastest path to victory points, whether through buildings or development cards
- Avoid trading resources that opponents need for immediate victory point gains
- Use 4:1 trades only when necessary; prioritize port usage when possible

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and limited expansion options
- If you get an early knight, save it for defense or until you can start building toward largest army
- Time monopoly card usage for when opponents likely have accumulated specific resources
- Save year of plenty cards for completing crucial builds when you're short 1-2 specific resources
- Development cards are most valuable when:
  * You need hidden victory points to surprise opponents
  * You need knights to break up longest road or secure largest army
  * You're lacking wood/brick for expansion but have plenty of sheep/wheat/ore

EXPANSION STRATEGY:
- Build roads only with clear settlement locations in mind
- Target settlements that give you access to ports or new resources
- Block opponents' expansion paths when it gives you a strategic advantage
- Consider the timing of expansion vs. city upgrades based on your resource production
- Calculate whether longest road is achievable and worth the resource investment
- When deciding between a new settlement and a city upgrade, compare immediate vs. long-term returns

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-probability hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Save knight cards for breaking up opponent strategies or securing largest army
- Use knights defensively if you're producing valuable resources on high-probability hexes

TRADING TACTICS:
- Avoid trading resources that directly help opponents score points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades
- Trade excess resources before rolling 7 if you have more than 7 cards
- Consider bank/port trades when they enable an immediate build that advances your strategy
- When trading with players, try to receive resources that complete a build

ENDGAME STRATEGY:
- In the late game, hide your victory point potential (keep development cards hidden)
- Calculate the fastest path to 10 VP and focus exclusively on that path
- Be aware of the exact number of remaining development cards and their probabilities
- Track opponents' potential victory points, including hidden development cards
- If you're close to winning, prioritize actions that can be completed in a single turn

Before finalizing your action, check:
1. Is there a more efficient path to victory points?
2. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
3. Does this move help or hinder opponents?
4. Is there a defensive move needed to prevent an opponent from winning?
5. Are you properly diversified against dice probability?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game State Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state and available options:

## Victory Points Breakdown
- **My Points (BLUE)**: 8 VPs (2 cities = 4 VPs, Longest Road = 2 VPs, Largest Army = 2 VPs)
- **RED Points**: 7 VPs (3 cities = 6 VPs, 1 settlement = 1 VP)

## My Resources
- 3 WOOD, 2 SHEEP, 1 ORE
- Not enough for any building (settlement requires 1 wood, 1 brick, 1 wheat, 1 sheep)
- Not enough for a development card (1 ore, 1 wheat, 1 sheep)

## Options Analysis

**Option 0: Play Knight Card**
- Benefits:
  - Can move the robber from (-1,1,0) which is RED's 6-value sheep production
  - Could steal a resource from RED
  - Maintains my Largest Army advantage
- Considerations:
  - RED has 0 visible cards, so I may not steal anything
  - Moving the robber to another high-probability hex could disrupt RED's production

**Option 1: End Turn**
- Benefits:
  - Save my Knight card for when it might be more impactful
  - RED has 0 visible cards, making stealing ineffective right now
- Risks:
  - Missing opportunity to relocate the robber and potentially disrupt RED's production

## Strategic Evaluation

1. The robber is already on a 6-value sheep hex, which is one of RED's most productive resources
2. RED has 0 visible resources, so playing a Knight provides no guaranteed resource theft
3. My lead is only 1 VP and I need to maintain strategic advantages
4. Saving the Knight card for defensive purposes later could be valuable
5. I should end my turn and accumulate resources for my next build

<plan>
1. End my turn to accumulate more resources
2. Keep my Knight card for defense or for a more impactful moment
3. Focus on collecting brick to build my next settlement
4. Monitor RED closely as they're only 1 VP behind me
5. Use my Knight defensively if RED places the robber on my high-value hexes
</plan>

Given the current situation where RED has no cards to steal and the robber is already on one of RED's high-probability hexes, playing the Knight card would provide minimal benefit. I should save it for a more strategic moment.

# Game Analysis for Settlers of Catan

I'll analyze the current situation and determine the optimal move between playing my Knight card or rolling the dice.

## Current Game State Assessment
- I (BLUE) have 8 VP: 2 cities (4 VP) + Longest Road (2 VP) + Largest Army (2 VP)
- RED has 7 VP: 3 cities (6 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP)
- I have 3 wood, 2 sheep, 1 ore, and 1 Knight card
- The robber is currently on RED's sheep hex (6), which is one of their high-production hexes

## Option 0: Play Knight Card
**Pros:**
- Could disrupt RED's production by targeting another of their productive hexes
- Could steal a resource from RED
- Reinforces my Largest Army bonus (4 knights vs 0)

**Cons:**
- The robber is already on a good hex for RED (6 sheep)
- I don't have an immediate build need requiring specific resources
- I'd lose the defensive capability of the Knight card

## Option 1: Roll the Dice
**Pros:**
- Could generate more resources for my next build
- Preserves Knight card for defense or a more strategic moment
- I'm below 7 cards, so no risk of losing resources on a 7

**Cons:**
- Risk of rolling 7, which would allow RED to move the robber to one of my productive hexes

## Strategic Considerations
1. I'm leading by only 1 VP, so defensive play is important
2. I don't have brick to build roads or settlements currently
3. My wood production is strong (8) and I already have 3 wood
4. Holding the Knight is valuable as a defensive measure
5. RED has 0 cards currently, so playing Knight now wouldn't steal much

<plan>
1. Roll the dice to accumulate more resources
2. Keep my Knight card for defense if RED moves robber to my 8 wood or other high-value hex
3. Focus on getting brick to build my next settlement
4. Continue to monitor RED's progress carefully
5. Build toward a 3rd city if I can gather the necessary resources (ore, wheat)
</plan>

The optimal move is to roll the dice and continue accumulating resources. Playing the Knight now has limited benefit as RED has no resources to steal, and I should save it for defense or a more impactful moment.

INITIAL SETTLEMENT PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Place settlements on high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Target at least one spot with good ore and wheat production for city development
- Try to secure at least one high-probability spot (5, 6, 8, 9) for each critical resource
- Place your second settlement to complement your first (fill resource gaps)
- Aim for access to all five resources or position near useful ports if resource diversity isn't possible
- Always consider which settlements opponents are likely to place and avoid areas that will become contested
- Place roads pointing toward valuable future expansion spots, not toward the center
- Consider the long-term impact: settlements that can't expand are less valuable

MID-GAME RESOURCE PRIORITIES:
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each possible build (cities: 1VP for 5 resources is most efficient)
- Early phase: Secure at least one good source of brick and wood for minimal expansion
- Growth phase: Prioritize ore and wheat production for city upgrades (3VP for 5 resources is optimal)
- Late phase: Focus on the fastest path to victory points, whether through buildings or development cards
- Avoid trading resources that opponents need for immediate victory point gains
- Use 4:1 trades only when necessary; prioritize port usage when possible

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and limited expansion options
- If you get an early knight, save it for defense or until you can start building toward largest army
- Time monopoly card usage for when opponents likely have accumulated specific resources
- Save year of plenty cards for completing crucial builds when you're short 1-2 specific resources
- Development cards are most valuable when:
  * You need hidden victory points to surprise opponents
  * You need knights to break up longest road or secure largest army
  * You're lacking wood/brick for expansion but have plenty of sheep/wheat/ore

EXPANSION STRATEGY:
- Build roads only with clear settlement locations in mind
- Target settlements that give you access to ports or new resources
- Block opponents' expansion paths when it gives you a strategic advantage
- Consider the timing of expansion vs. city upgrades based on your resource production
- Calculate whether longest road is achievable and worth the resource investment
- When deciding between a new settlement and a city upgrade, compare immediate vs. long-term returns

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-probability hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Save knight cards for breaking up opponent strategies or securing largest army
- Use knights defensively if you're producing valuable resources on high-probability hexes

TRADING TACTICS:
- Avoid trading resources that directly help opponents score points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades
- Trade excess resources before rolling 7 if you have more than 7 cards
- Consider bank/port trades when they enable an immediate build that advances your strategy
- When trading with players, try to receive resources that complete a build

ENDGAME STRATEGY:
- In the late game, hide your victory point potential (keep development cards hidden)
- Calculate the fastest path to 10 VP and focus exclusively on that path
- Be aware of the exact number of remaining development cards and their probabilities
- Track opponents' potential victory points, including hidden development cards
- If you're close to winning, prioritize actions that can be completed in a single turn

Before finalizing your action, check:
1. Is there a more efficient path to victory points?
2. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
3. Does this move help or hinder opponents?
4. Is there a defensive move needed to prevent an opponent from winning?
5. Are you properly diversified against dice probability?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Robber Placement Analysis

Let me analyze where to place the robber to maximize my strategic advantage:

## Examining Hex Options:

0. (0, 0, 0) - Brick with number 3
   - This is a low probability hex (3)
   - RED has two cities that produce from this (nodes 3 and 5)
   - BLUE has one city that produces from this (node 1)
   - Blocking this would hurt RED more than me

1. (1, -1, 0) - Wood with number 8
   - This is a high probability hex (8)
   - BLUE has one city that produces from this (node 1)
   - This is my only wood production and it's a high value (8)
   - Blocking this would hurt me significantly

2. (0, -1, 1) - Desert
   - No production to block
   - Wasteful choice

3. (-1, 0, 1) - Wheat with number 4
   - Low-medium probability (4)
   - RED has two buildings producing from this (city at node 15, city at node 3)
   - Blocking this would deny RED wheat

4. (0, 1, -1) - Ore with number 9
   - Good probability hex (9)
   - BLUE has one city producing from this (node 20)
   - RED has two buildings producing from this (city at node 5, settlement at node 21)
   - This is important for city building
   - Blocking this would hurt both players but RED more than me

5. (1, 0, -1) - Wheat with number 10
   - Medium probability (10)
   - BLUE has two cities producing from this (node 1 and node 20)
   - This is my only wheat production
   - Blocking this would hurt me significantly

## Player Analysis:
- RED has 7 VP and is catching up with 3 cities already
- RED appears to be focusing on city development (needs ore and wheat)
- I have 8 VP and need only 2 more to win

## Strategic Decision:
The best targets are hexes that hurt RED more than me. Options 0, 3, and 4 are candidates.

Option 4 (ore hex) is the best choice because:
1. It blocks a high-probability (9) ore hex
2. It hurts RED's city development strategy more than mine
3. RED has two buildings producing from this hex, maximizing the impact
4. I already have 1 ore in hand, while RED may need ore for development

<plan>
1. Move the robber to the ore hex to block RED's access to critical city-building resources
2. Continue accumulating resources for my next build
3. Save my Knight card for defense if RED targets my high-value production
4. Focus on getting brick for road/settlement expansion
5. Monitor RED's progress carefully as they're close to 10 VP
</plan>

# Game Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state and my available options:

## Current Game State
- I have 8 VP (2 cities = 4 VP, Longest Road = 2 VP, Largest Army = 2 VP)
- RED has 7 VP (3 cities = 6 VP, 1 settlement = 1 VP)
- I have 3 wood, 2 sheep, 1 ore, and 1 Knight development card
- The robber is currently on the ore hex (0, 1, -1), which produces on a roll of 9
- This ore hex is connected to RED's settlement at node 21 and RED's city at node 5

## Available Actions
0. Play Knight card - Move the robber and steal a resource
1. End turn

## Strategic Analysis

Let's evaluate my options:

### Option 0: Play Knight Card
Pros:
- I could move the robber to a productive hex for RED, blocking their resource generation
- I would get to steal a resource from RED (though RED currently has 0 visible cards)
- Playing a Knight now would further solidify my Largest Army bonus

Cons:
- RED currently has 0 visible cards, so I might not steal anything valuable
- The Knight could be saved for a more strategic moment when RED has resources
- I might need the Knight later for defense if RED places the robber on one of my productive hexes

### Option 1: End Turn
Pros:
- I preserve my Knight card for a more opportune moment
- The robber is already on a hex that produces for RED (ore on a 9)
- With no resources to build anything this turn, ending the turn is efficient

Cons:
- I miss an opportunity to potentially steal a resource (RED may be hiding resources)
- I don't further secure my Largest Army advantage

## Decision Logic

Since RED has 0 visible cards, playing a Knight now would likely result in no resource gain. The robber is already on a good blocking position (RED's ore hex), so moving it wouldn't significantly improve my position. Additionally, saving the Knight for defense when RED has more resources seems more valuable.

<plan>
1. End turn and continue accumulating resources
2. Save Knight card for a more strategic moment when RED has resources or for defense
3. Focus on building another settlement to reach 10 VP (needs 4 wood + 4 brick for 2 roads + settlement)
4. Monitor RED's progress carefully as they're close to 10 VP
</plan>

Based on this analysis, I should end my turn.

# Game Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state and available options to make the optimal decision.

## Current Situation
- I have 8 VP (2 cities + 2 VP for Longest Road + 2 VP for Largest Army)
- RED has 7 VP (1 settlement + 3 cities)
- I have resources: 3 Wood, 2 Brick, 2 Sheep, 1 Ore
- The robber is on ore (9) - blocking one of my city's production and RED's city and settlement
- I have 1 KNIGHT card in hand

## Available Options
[0] Play Knight card - Move robber and steal a resource
[1] Roll the dice

## Option Analysis

### Option 0: Play Knight
- Benefits:
  * Could move the robber from the ore hex that's blocking my city's production
  * Could steal a resource from RED
  * Strengthens my Largest Army position
- Drawbacks:
  * RED only has 1 resource card, so the steal might not be valuable
  * I already have Largest Army, so playing a Knight doesn't give me additional VP
  * Knight cards are more valuable later for defense if I get a lot of resources

### Option 1: Roll Dice
- Benefits:
  * Likely to get resources needed for expansion
  * I need 4 Wood + 4 Brick to build 2 roads + 1 settlement to win
  * I already have 3 Wood + 2 Brick, so good rolls could get me closer
- Drawbacks:
  * Risk of rolling a 7 if I accumulate too many cards

## Strategic Considerations
- I need 2 more VP to win, which could come from building a settlement (need 1 wood + 1 brick + 1 sheep + 1 wheat)
- RED needs 3 more VP to win, so they're not an immediate threat
- The robber is already on a hex that impacts both me and RED
- My current plan focuses on building another settlement

<plan>
1. Roll for resources to continue accumulating what I need for expansion
2. Save Knight card for defense if I collect many resources or to use when RED has more cards
3. Focus on building roads and a settlement to reach 10 VP (need more wood/brick)
4. Monitor RED's progress as they need 3 more VP
</plan>

Given that I already have Largest Army and playing the Knight doesn't directly gain me VP, while rolling could get me the resources I need for expansion, rolling seems optimal.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL SETTLEMENT PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Place settlements on high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Target at least one spot with good ore and wheat production for city development
- Try to secure at least one high-probability spot (5, 6, 8, 9) for each critical resource
- Place your second settlement to complement your first (fill resource gaps)
- Aim for access to all five resources or position near useful ports if resource diversity isn't possible
- Always consider which settlements opponents are likely to place and avoid areas that will become contested
- Place roads pointing toward valuable future expansion spots, not toward the center
- Consider the long-term impact: settlements that can't expand are less valuable

MID-GAME RESOURCE PRIORITIES:
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each possible build (cities: 1VP for 5 resources is most efficient)
- Early phase: Secure at least one good source of brick and wood for minimal expansion
- Growth phase: Prioritize ore and wheat production for city upgrades (3VP for 5 resources is optimal)
- Late phase: Focus on the fastest path to victory points, whether through buildings or development cards
- Avoid trading resources that opponents need for immediate victory point gains
- Use 4:1 trades only when necessary; prioritize port usage when possible

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and limited expansion options
- If you get an early knight, save it for defense or until you can start building toward largest army
- Time monopoly card usage for when opponents likely have accumulated specific resources
- Save year of plenty cards for completing crucial builds when you're short 1-2 specific resources
- Development cards are most valuable when:
  * You need hidden victory points to surprise opponents
  * You need knights to break up longest road or secure largest army
  * You're lacking wood/brick for expansion but have plenty of sheep/wheat/ore

EXPANSION STRATEGY:
- Build roads only with clear settlement locations in mind
- Target settlements that give you access to ports or new resources
- Block opponents' expansion paths when it gives you a strategic advantage
- Consider the timing of expansion vs. city upgrades based on your resource production
- Calculate whether longest road is achievable and worth the resource investment
- When deciding between a new settlement and a city upgrade, compare immediate vs. long-term returns

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-probability hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Save knight cards for breaking up opponent strategies or securing largest army
- Use knights defensively if you're producing valuable resources on high-probability hexes

TRADING TACTICS:
- Avoid trading resources that directly help opponents score points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades
- Trade excess resources before rolling 7 if you have more than 7 cards
- Consider bank/port trades when they enable an immediate build that advances your strategy
- When trading with players, try to receive resources that complete a build

ENDGAME STRATEGY:
- In the late game, hide your victory point potential (keep development cards hidden)
- Calculate the fastest path to 10 VP and focus exclusively on that path
- Be aware of the exact number of remaining development cards and their probabilities
- Track opponents' potential victory points, including hidden development cards
- If you're close to winning, prioritize actions that can be completed in a single turn

Before finalizing your action, check:
1. Is there a more efficient path to victory points?
2. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
3. Does this move help or hinder opponents?
4. Is there a defensive move needed to prevent an opponent from winning?
5. Are you properly diversified against dice probability?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 120 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Roll for resources to continue accumulating what I need for expansion
2. Save Knight card for defense if I collect many resources or to use when RED has more cards
3. Focus on building roads and a settlement to reach 10 VP (need more wood/brick)
4. Monitor RED's progress as they need 3 more VP
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.
  To adjust your plan, provide a NEW PLAN in your reasoning with <plan>your new plan</plan>

# Game Analysis and Action Selection

I'll carefully analyze the current game state and my available actions to make the optimal decision.

## Current Game State Assessment
- I have 8 VP (2 cities = 4 VP, Longest Road = 2 VP, Largest Army = 2 VP)
- RED has 7 VP (3 cities = 6 VP, 1 settlement = 1 VP)
- I need 2 more VP to win, RED needs 3 more VP
- Resources: 3 🌲WOOD, 2 🧱BRICK, 2 🐑SHEEP, 1 ⛏️ORE
- I have 1 unused KNIGHT card

## Available Actions Analysis
0. Play Knight card - This would strengthen my Largest Army lead and potentially steal a useful resource
1. End turn - Simply pass to next player
2-4. Build a road (costs: 1 🌲WOOD, 1 🧱BRICK) at different locations

## Strategic Considerations

1. **Victory Path Analysis**: 
   - I'm at 8 VP and need 2 more
   - My most direct path seems to be building a settlement (1 VP)
   - Since I already have Longest Road and Largest Army, I need to focus on settlements/cities/VP cards

2. **Road Building Options**:
   - I can afford one road (have 3 wood, 2 brick)
   - Building more roads doesn't directly increase my VP count, but may enable future settlement placement
   - Since I already have Longest Road secured with 11 segments vs RED's 4, defensive road building isn't urgent

3. **Knight Card Consideration**:
   - Playing the Knight would move the robber from hex (0,1,-1) which produces ⛏️9
   - This hex is already blocking my own production at node 20 (⛏️9[⭐⭐]), so moving it would benefit me
   - I could steal a resource from RED to potentially enable more builds
   - It would further secure my Largest Army (though I already lead 3-0)

## Optimal Decision Path
Looking at my overall position, I should focus on gathering resources for a settlement (need 1 wood, 1 brick, 1 sheep, 1 wheat). Playing the Knight card would:
1. Allow me to move the robber off my own production
2. Potentially steal a needed resource from RED
3. Maintain my Largest Army advantage

<plan>
1. Play Knight card to move robber off my ore production and steal from RED
2. Continue gathering resources for a settlement (need wheat)
3. Build a road toward a potential settlement location next turn
4. Aim to reach 10 VP with a new settlement in 1-2 turns
</plan>

Given this analysis, my optimal action is to play the Knight card:

# Game Analysis for Robber Movement

I need to carefully evaluate where to move the robber to maximize my winning chances while hindering my opponent who is close behind at 7 VP.

## Current Game Status
- I (BLUE): 8/10 VP (2 cities + longest road + largest army)
- RED: 7/10 VP (3 cities + 1 settlement)
- I need 2 more VP to win, which likely means building 2 settlements or 1 city

## Resource Analysis
- I have: 3 WOOD, 2 BRICK, 2 SHEEP, 1 ORE
- For a settlement I need: 1 WOOD, 1 BRICK, 1 WHEAT, 1 SHEEP
- Currently missing: WHEAT

## Robber Options Evaluation

Looking at the available options:
0. Move to BRICK(3) and steal from RED - This would block RED's brick production (3 stars total) and potentially get me resources
1. Move to WOOD(8) - This would block my own major wood production (3 stars)
2. Move to DESERT - No production blocked
3. Move to WHEAT(4) and steal from RED - This would block RED's wheat production (2 stars total) and potentially get me wheat
4. Move to SHEEP(6) and steal from RED - This would block RED's major sheep production (6 stars total) and potentially get me resources
5. Move to WHEAT(10) - This would block my own wheat production (2 stars) which I desperately need

## Strategic Decision

Option 4 (moving to SHEEP(6)) is optimal because:
1. It blocks RED's highest production tile (6 stars total)
2. I have sufficient sheep already (2 sheep)
3. It lets me steal from RED who might have the wheat I need
4. It doesn't block any of my own production

Moving to WHEAT(4) would block RED's wheat but I need wheat myself to build a settlement, and RED has multiple wheat sources.

<plan>
1. Move robber to SHEEP(6) hex to block RED's major production and steal from them
2. Use any wheat stolen to build a settlement, otherwise continue gathering resources
3. Build settlements to reach 10 VP
4. Maintain longest road and largest army advantage

- Consider the timing of expansion vs. city upgrades based on your resource production
- Calculate whether longest road is achievable and worth the resource investment
- When deciding between a new settlement and a city upgrade, compare immediate vs. long-term returns

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-probability hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Save knight cards for breaking up opponent strategies or securing largest army
- Use knights defensively if you're producing valuable resources on high-probability hexes

TRADING TACTICS:
- Avoid trading resources that directly help opponents score points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades
- Trade excess resources before rolling 7 if you have more than 7 cards
- Consider bank/port trades when they enable an immediate build that advances your strategy
- When trading with players, try to receive resources that complete a build

ENDGAME STRATEGY:
- In the late game, hide your victory point potential (keep development cards hidden)
- Calculate the fastest path to 10 VP and focus exclusively on that path
- Be aware of the exact number of remaining development cards and their probabilities
- Track opponents' potential victory points, including hidden development cards
- If you're close to winning, prioritize actions that can be completed in a single turn

Before finalizing your action, check:
1. Is there a more efficient path to victory points?
2. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
3. Does this move help or hinder opponents?
4. Is there a defensive move needed to prevent an opponent from winning?
5. Are you properly diversified against dice probability?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Move robber to SHEEP(6) hex to block RED's major production and steal from them
2. Use any wheat stolen to build a settlement, otherwise continue gathering resources
3. Build settlements to reach 10 VP
4. Maintain longest road and largest army advantage

# Game Analysis for Settlers of Catan

Let me analyze the current game state and available options to determine the optimal move:

## Current Game Situation
- I have 8/10 victory points (need 2 more to win)
- RED has 7/10 victory points (3 away from winning)
- I hold: 3 Wood, 2 Brick, 2 Sheep, 1 Wheat, 1 Ore
- I have longest road (+2 VP) and largest army (+2 VP)

## Victory Point Analysis
My 8 points come from:
- 2 Cities (4 VP)
- Longest Road (2 VP)
- Largest Army (2 VP)

To reach 10 VP, I need 2 more points, which could come from:
1. Building 2 settlements (2 VP)
2. Building 1 city upgrade (1 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP)
3. Building 1 settlement (1 VP) + 1 victory point development card (1 VP)

## Available Actions Assessment

### Settlement Options (Actions 4-8):
Each settlement costs 1 Wood, 1 Brick, 1 Wheat, 1 Sheep and gives 1 VP.
- I have enough resources to build 1 settlement right now
- Building a settlement would bring me to 9 VP (just 1 away from victory)
- Need to assess which node gives best future production

#### Node Evaluation:
- Node 7: Connected to Wood (8) - strong production
- Node 8: Connected to Wood (8) - strong production
- Node 9: Connected to Wood (8) and Desert - decent option
- Node 10: Connected to Desert - poor production
- Node 23: Connected to Wheat (10) - moderate production

### Development Card (Action 9):
- Cost: 1 Sheep, 1 Wheat, 1 Ore (I have these)
- Could potentially get a Victory Point card, bringing me to 9 VP
- Could get a Knight to strengthen largest army advantage
- However, might get a less useful card for immediate victory

### Road Options (Actions 1-3):
- I already have longest road secured with 11 segments vs RED's 4
- Building more roads won't give immediate VPs
- Roads cost Wood and Brick which I need for settlements

## Decision Logic
1. Building a settlement is the most direct path to victory, bringing me to 9 VP
2. Among settlement locations, Node 7 or 8 connected to the Wood (8) hex offer best production value
3. I'm one action away from 9 VP and two actions away from winning
4. RED is at 7 VP and isn't an immediate threat

Since my goal is to reach 10 VP as efficiently as possible, I should build a settlement at either Node 7 or 8 to reach 9 VP. Node 7 appears slightly better positioned on the board.

<plan>
1. Build a settlement at Node 7 this turn to reach 9 VP
2. Next turn, work toward either another settlement or development card for the final VP
3. Maintain longest road and largest army advantage
4. Watch for RED getting close to 10 VP
</plan>

Therefore, my optimal move is to build a settlement at Node 7:

\boxed{4}
========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL SETTLEMENT PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Place settlements on high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Target at least one spot with good ore and wheat production for city development
- Try to secure at least one high-probability spot (5, 6, 8, 9) for each critical resource
- Place your second settlement to complement your first (fill resource gaps)
- Aim for access to all five resources or position near useful ports if resource diversity isn't possible
- Always consider which settlements opponents are likely to place and avoid areas that will become contested
- Place roads pointing toward valuable future expansion spots, not toward the center
- Consider the long-term impact: settlements that can't expand are less valuable

MID-GAME RESOURCE PRIORITIES:
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each possible build (cities: 1VP for 5 resources is most efficient)
- Early phase: Secure at least one good source of brick and wood for minimal expansion
- Growth phase: Prioritize ore and wheat production for city upgrades (3VP for 5 resources is optimal)
- Late phase: Focus on the fastest path to victory points, whether through buildings or development cards
- Avoid trading resources that opponents need for immediate victory point gains
- Use 4:1 trades only when necessary; prioritize port usage when possible

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and limited expansion options
- If you get an early knight, save it for defense or until you can start building toward largest army
- Time monopoly card usage for when opponents likely have accumulated specific resources
- Save year of plenty cards for completing crucial builds when you're short 1-2 specific resources
- Development cards are most valuable when:
  * You need hidden victory points to surprise opponents
  * You need knights to break up longest road or secure largest army
  * You're lacking wood/brick for expansion but have plenty of sheep/wheat/ore

EXPANSION STRATEGY:
- Build roads only with clear settlement locations in mind
- Target settlements that give you access to ports or new resources
- Block opponents' expansion paths when it gives you a strategic advantage
- Consider the timing of expansion vs. city upgrades based on your resource production
- Calculate whether longest road is achievable and worth the resource investment
- When deciding between a new settlement and a city upgrade, compare immediate vs. long-term returns

# Game Analysis

Let me carefully analyze the current game state:

## Victory Point Status
- BLUE (me): 9/10 VP (need just 1 more to win)
- RED: 7/10 VP (needs 3 more)

## Current Resources
- I have: 2 🌲WOOD, 1 🧱BRICK, 1 🐑SHEEP, 1 ⛏️ORE
- This is not enough for any significant build (city, settlement, or development card)

## Strategic Position
- I already have Longest Road (+2 VP) with 11 segments
- I already have Largest Army (+2 VP) with 4 knights
- I need just 1 more VP to win

## Available Actions
- [0] End turn
- [1], [2], [3] Build different road segments (each costing 1 🌲WOOD, 1 🧱BRICK)

## Strategic Assessment

1. I'm at 9/10 VP and only need one more point to win.
2. My current resources (2 🌲, 1 🧱, 1 🐑, 1 ⛏️) aren't enough for:
   - Settlement (need 1 🌲, 1 🧱, 1 🐑, 1 🌾)
   - City upgrade (need 2 ⛏️, 3 🌾)
   - Development card (need 1 ⛏️, 1 🌾, 1 🐑)

3. Building a road:
   - Uses 1 🌲 and 1 🧱
   - Doesn't immediately give me a VP
   - But secures my longest road bonus

4. There's no immediate threat to my longest road (RED only has 4 segments vs my 11)

5. I need to collect resources on my next turn to build either:
   - A settlement (need additional 1 🌾)
   - A development card that might be a VP card (need additional 1 🌾)

<plan>
1. End my turn to collect more resources
2. On my next turn:
   - If I roll and get wheat, build either a development card or work toward a settlement
   - If I get more brick and wood, further extend my road network toward good settlement spots
3. Continue maintaining longest road and largest army advantages
4. Watch for RED getting close to 10 VP
</plan>

Since I can't build anything that would give me the final VP this turn, and there's no immediate threat to my position, the optimal move is to:

\boxed{0}

End my turn to collect more resources and potentially win on my next turn.

# Game State Analysis

I need to analyze the current game state and select the best action from the available options.

## Current Situation:
- I have 9/10 VP (almost at victory)
- I have 2 wood, 1 brick, 1 sheep, 3 ore
- My VP breakdown: 3 VP from buildings (1 settlement + 2 cities), 2 VP from longest road, 2 VP from largest army, so that's 7 VP shown + likely 2 VP from development cards
- Red has 7 VP: 7 VP from buildings (1 settlement + 3 cities)

## Available Actions:
0. End my turn
1. Build a road at edge (2, 3) (Cost: 1 wood, 1 brick)
2. Build a road at edge (10, 11) (Cost: 1 wood, 1 brick)
3. Build a road at edge (0, 5) (Cost: 1 wood, 1 brick)

## Decision Analysis:

1. **Building a road**:
   - I have exactly 2 wood and 1 brick, which is just enough for one road
   - I already have longest road (11 segments vs Red's 4)
   - Building another road doesn't immediately gain me any VP
   - I can't build a settlement now (would need wood, brick, wheat, sheep)
   - These roads might help with future expansion, but I'm already at 9 VP

2. **Ending my turn**:
   - I'm at 9 VP, just 1 VP away from winning
   - I need to collect more resources to either:
     - Build a settlement (need wood, brick, wheat, sheep)
     - Buy a development card (need wheat, sheep, ore) which could be a VP card
     - Upgrade a settlement to a city (need 3 ore, 2 wheat) but I only have 1 settlement
   - My current resources don't allow me to make any victory point progress

3. **Strategic considerations**:
   - RED has 7 VP and 3 hidden resource cards - they're not an immediate threat to win
   - I already have longest road secured (11 vs 4)
   - I already have largest army secured (4 knights)
   - Using my wood and brick now means I'd need to collect both again for a settlement

Looking at my options, building roads doesn't get me closer to victory now. I should save my brick and wood to potentially build a settlement on my next turn if I get the wheat and sheep I need.

<plan>
1. End my turn to collect more resources
2. On my next turn:
   - If I get wheat and sheep, aim to build a settlement
   - If I get wheat and more ore, buy a development card that could be a VP
   - Maintain my longest road and largest army advantages
3. Keep blocking RED's resource production with the robber if I roll 7
</plan>

The most efficient path to victory is to save my resources and end my turn, hoping to get the additional resources I need on my next turn.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL SETTLEMENT PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Place settlements on high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Target at least one spot with good ore and wheat production for city development
- Try to secure at least one high-probability spot (5, 6, 8, 9) for each critical resource
- Place your second settlement to complement your first (fill resource gaps)
- Aim for access to all five resources or position near useful ports if resource diversity isn't possible
- Always consider which settlements opponents are likely to place and avoid areas that will become contested
- Place roads pointing toward valuable future expansion spots, not toward the center
- Consider the long-term impact: settlements that can't expand are less valuable

MID-GAME RESOURCE PRIORITIES:
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each possible build (cities: 1VP for 5 resources is most efficient)
- Early phase: Secure at least one good source of brick and wood for minimal expansion
- Growth phase: Prioritize ore and wheat production for city upgrades (3VP for 5 resources is optimal)
- Late phase: Focus on the fastest path to victory points, whether through buildings or development cards
- Avoid trading resources that opponents need for immediate victory point gains
- Use 4:1 trades only when necessary; prioritize port usage when possible

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and limited expansion options
- If you get an early knight, save it for defense or until you can start building toward largest army
- Time monopoly card usage for when opponents likely have accumulated specific resources
- Save year of plenty cards for completing crucial builds when you're short 1-2 specific resources
- Development cards are most valuable when:
  * You need hidden victory points to surprise opponents
  * You need knights to break up longest road or secure largest army
  * You're lacking wood/brick for expansion but have plenty of sheep/wheat/ore

EXPANSION STRATEGY:
- Build roads only with clear settlement locations in mind
- Target settlements that give you access to ports or new resources
- Block opponents' expansion paths when it gives you a strategic advantage
- Consider the timing of expansion vs. city upgrades based on your resource production
- Calculate whether longest road is achievable and worth the resource investment
- When deciding between a new settlement and a city upgrade, compare immediate vs. long-term returns

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-probability hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Save knight cards for breaking up opponent strategies or securing largest army
- Use knights defensively if you're producing valuable resources on high-probability hexes

TRADING TACTICS:
- Avoid trading resources that directly help opponents score points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades
- Trade excess resources before rolling 7 if you have more than 7 cards
- Consider bank/port trades when they enable an immediate build that advances your strategy
- When trading with players, try to receive resources that complete a build

ENDGAME STRATEGY:
- In the late game, hide your victory point potential (keep development cards hidden)
- Calculate the fastest path to 10 VP and focus exclusively on that path
- Be aware of the exact number of remaining development cards and their probabilities
- Track opponents' potential victory points, including hidden development cards
- If you're close to winning, prioritize actions that can be completed in a single turn

Before finalizing your action, check:
1. Is there a more efficient path to victory points?
2. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
3. Does this move help or hinder opponents?
4. Is there a defensive move needed to prevent an opponent from winning?
5. Are you properly diversified against dice probability?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 124 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

# Game Analysis: Turn 124 for BLUE

Let me analyze the current game state thoroughly:

## Victory Point Analysis
- BLUE (me): 9/10 VP
  - 2 cities (4 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + Longest Road (2 VP) + Largest Army (2 VP)
- RED: 8/10 VP
  - 4 cities (8 VP)
  - RED is just 2 VP away from winning

## Resource Analysis
My resources: 2 Wood, 1 Brick, 1 Sheep, 3 Ore
- I have the exact resources needed to build a road (1 wood + 1 brick)
- I don't have enough resources for a settlement (1 wood, 1 brick, 1 wheat, 1 sheep)
- I don't have enough resources for a city (2 wheat, 3 ore)
- I don't have enough resources for a development card (1 ore, 1 wheat, 1 sheep)

## Strategic Position
1. I'm leading with 9 VP, just 1 VP short of winning
2. I have longest road (11 segments) and largest army (4 knights)
3. RED has 4 cities, providing strong production
4. The robber is currently on RED's sheep hex (6), blocking their strongest production

## Action Analysis

[0] End Turn:
- Pros: Can collect more resources next turn to potentially build settlements/development cards
- Cons: Gives RED another turn, who is just 2 VP away from winning

[1-3] Build Road Options:
- Pros: Uses my limited resources, potentially strengthens my longest road position
- Cons: Doesn't immediately gain VP, leaves me with fewer resources

Looking at my 9/10 VP, I need just 1 more VP to win. Options for getting that last VP:
1. Build a settlement (need wheat + more brick/wood)
2. Buy a development card hoping for a victory point (need wheat + sheep)
3. Upgrade settlement to city (need 2 wheat + 2 more ore)

Since I'm already at 9 VP and have a commanding position with longest road and largest army, my priority should be to collect resources that can give me the final VP. Building another road doesn't directly help me win since I already have longest road, and the potential road locations don't enable immediate settlement building.

<plan>
1. End turn to collect more resources
2. Next turn priority:
   - If I get wheat + sheep: buy development card (chance for immediate VP)
   - If I get wheat: build settlement if I can secure brick/wood
   - If I get wheat + ore: work toward city upgrade
3. Maintain robber position on RED's key resources
</plan>

Given that I already have longest road secured and need different resources than what I currently have to reach 10 VP, ending my turn to collect more resources is the optimal play.

# Game State Analysis

I'll analyze the current game state to determine the best action:

## Victory Point Status
- BLUE (me): 9/10 VP (1 VP away from winning)
- RED: 8/10 VP (2 VP away from winning)

## My Resources
- 1 WOOD, 1 BRICK, 1 SHEEP, 3 ORE
- No development cards

## Possible Actions
- [0] End Turn
- [1-3] Build Road (costs 1 WOOD, 1 BRICK)

## Strategic Assessment

I'm very close to winning with 9 VP, while RED has 8 VP. My points come from:
- 1 Settlement (1 VP)
- 2 Cities (4 VP)
- Longest Road bonus (2 VP)
- Largest Army bonus (2 VP)

Let me analyze my options:

### Option 1-3: Build Road
While I have exactly enough resources to build a road (1 WOOD, 1 BRICK), this doesn't immediately increase my VP count. Looking at the potential road placements:
- Edge (2, 3)
- Edge (10, 11)
- Edge (0, 5)

None of these directly contribute to victory since:
1. I already have Longest Road bonus (11 segments)
2. I don't have resources to build a settlement after placing the road
3. These roads don't appear to block critical RED expansion paths

Building a road would deplete my WOOD and BRICK, making it harder to build a settlement when I get more resources.

### Option 0: End Turn
By ending my turn:
- I'll collect resources based on the next dice roll
- I need just 1 more VP to win, which could come from:
  - Building a settlement (need more WOOD + BRICK)
  - Building a city (need 2 more ORE + 2 WHEAT)
  - Getting a VP development card (need SHEEP + WHEAT + ORE)

I have 3 ORE already, which positions me well for either a city upgrade or development card purchase.

## Decision Logic

Since I'm at 9 VP and need just 1 more to win, my priority should be maximizing my chances of getting that final VP on my next turn. 

Building a road doesn't advance me toward my goal of 10 VP. I should instead conserve my WOOD and BRICK in case I collect more of these resources on the next turn, allowing me to build a settlement.

With 3 ORE already, I'm well-positioned for either a city upgrade (if I get WHEAT) or a development card (if I get WHEAT and SHEEP). A VP development card would immediately win the game.

<plan>
1. End turn to collect more resources
2. On next turn:
   - Priority 1: Buy a development card if I get WHEAT + more SHEEP (chance for immediate VP)
   - Priority 2: Build a city if I get 2 WHEAT + 2 more ORE
   - Priority 3: Build a settlement if I get more WOOD/BRICK
3. Continue to use the robber strategically to slow RED's progress
</plan>

The optimal move is to end my turn and collect more resources that could help me secure the final VP.

- Try to secure at least one high-probability spot (5, 6, 8, 9) for each critical resource
- Place your second settlement to complement your first (fill resource gaps)
- Aim for access to all five resources or position near useful ports if resource diversity isn't possible
- Always consider which settlements opponents are likely to place and avoid areas that will become contested
- Place roads pointing toward valuable future expansion spots, not toward the center
- Consider the long-term impact: settlements that can't expand are less valuable

MID-GAME RESOURCE PRIORITIES:
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each possible build (cities: 1VP for 5 resources is most efficient)
- Early phase: Secure at least one good source of brick and wood for minimal expansion
- Growth phase: Prioritize ore and wheat production for city upgrades (3VP for 5 resources is optimal)
- Late phase: Focus on the fastest path to victory points, whether through buildings or development cards
- Avoid trading resources that opponents need for immediate victory point gains
- Use 4:1 trades only when necessary; prioritize port usage when possible

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and limited expansion options
- If you get an early knight, save it for defense or until you can start building toward largest army
- Time monopoly card usage for when opponents likely have accumulated specific resources
- Save year of plenty cards for completing crucial builds when you're short 1-2 specific resources
- Development cards are most valuable when:
  * You need hidden victory points to surprise opponents
  * You need knights to break up longest road or secure largest army
  * You're lacking wood/brick for expansion but have plenty of sheep/wheat/ore

EXPANSION STRATEGY:
- Build roads only with clear settlement locations in mind
- Target settlements that give you access to ports or new resources
- Block opponents' expansion paths when it gives you a strategic advantage
- Consider the timing of expansion vs. city upgrades based on your resource production
- Calculate whether longest road is achievable and worth the resource investment
- When deciding between a new settlement and a city upgrade, compare immediate vs. long-term returns

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-probability hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Save knight cards for breaking up opponent strategies or securing largest army
- Use knights defensively if you're producing valuable resources on high-probability hexes

TRADING TACTICS:
- Avoid trading resources that directly help opponents score points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades
- Trade excess resources before rolling 7 if you have more than 7 cards
- Consider bank/port trades when they enable an immediate build that advances your strategy
- When trading with players, try to receive resources that complete a build

ENDGAME STRATEGY:
- In the late game, hide your victory point potential (keep development cards hidden)
- Calculate the fastest path to 10 VP and focus exclusively on that path
- Be aware of the exact number of remaining development cards and their probabilities
- Track opponents' potential victory points, including hidden development cards
- If you're close to winning, prioritize actions that can be completed in a single turn

Before finalizing your action, check:
1. Is there a more efficient path to victory points?
2. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
3. Does this move help or hinder opponents?
4. Is there a defensive move needed to prevent an opponent from winning?
5. Are you properly diversified against dice probability?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 128 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. End turn to collect more resources
2. On next turn:
   - Priority 1: Buy a development card if I get WHEAT + more SHEEP (chance for immediate VP)
   - Priority 2: Build a city if I get 2 WHEAT + 2 more ORE
   - Priority 3: Build a settlement if I get more WOOD/BRICK
3. Continue to use the robber strategically to slow RED's progress

# Game State Analysis

Let me analyze my current position and available options:

## Victory Point Status
- I (BLUE) have 9/10 VP: 2 cities (4 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + Longest Road bonus (2 VP) + Largest Army bonus (2 VP)
- RED has 8/10 VP: 4 cities (8 VP)
- I'm just 1 VP away from winning!

## Resources
- I have: 4 WOOD, 1 BRICK, 1 SHEEP, 3 ORE
- Missing: WHEAT (critical for development cards and city upgrades)

## Current Board Position
- I have Longest Road (11 segments) and Largest Army (4 knights)
- The robber is on a WHEAT hex (1,0,-1) with 10 value
- This is actually blocking my own WHEAT production at both my cities

## Available Actions
1. End Turn (option 0)
2. Build Roads (options 1-3) - costs 1 WOOD, 1 BRICK each
3. Maritime Trade (options 4-7) - trade 4 WOOD for another resource

## Strategic Options Analysis

1. **Building a Road (Options 1-3)**
   - I already have Longest Road
   - I have enough WOOD (4) but only 1 BRICK, so I can build only one road
   - No immediate settlement spots available to build toward
   - This would use up my BRICK which I might need for future settlement builds

2. **Maritime Trade (Options 4-7)**
   - Trading 4 WOOD for 1 of another resource seems inefficient
   - If I trade for WHEAT, I could be one step closer to a development card (need WHEAT+SHEEP+ORE)
   - However, I'd still need more SHEEP to actually get a development card

3. **End Turn (Option 0)**
   - This preserves my resources
   - Dice roll might give me needed resources (especially WHEAT)
   - RED is at 8 VP, so they need 2 more VP to win. They likely can't win in a single turn.

## Decision Logic

Since I'm at 9 VP and need just 1 more to win:
- The fastest path to victory appears to be getting a development card (chance of a VP card)
- I need WHEAT + more SHEEP to get a development card
- Building roads doesn't get me closer to victory right now
- Trading 4:1 is inefficient and doesn't solve my resource gaps adequately

<plan>
1. End turn to collect more resources
2. Focus on getting a development card (need WHEAT + SHEEP)
3. If I roll a 7, move the robber off my WHEAT hex to restore my WHEAT production
4. Alternative winning paths:
   - Build a new settlement (need WOOD + BRICK + WHEAT + SHEEP)
   - Upgrade my last settlement to a city (need 2 WHEAT + 3 ORE)
</plan>

Since I'm so close to winning (9/10 VP), I need to maximize my chances of getting that final point. None of the available builds get me closer to victory, and trading is inefficient. The best move is to end my turn and hope for better resources on the next roll.

PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:

# Game Analysis for Settlers of Catan - Turn 130

Let me analyze my current position and available options:

## Current Status
- I have 9/10 victory points (almost winning!)
- Resources: 4 Wood, 3 Brick, 1 Sheep, 3 Ore, 0 Wheat
- I have longest road (+2 VP) and largest army (+2 VP)
- I need just 1 more victory point to win

## Victory Point Options
1. **Build a settlement**: Requires 1 Wood, 1 Brick, 1 Wheat, 1 Sheep (missing Wheat)
2. **Upgrade my last settlement to a city**: Requires 2 Wheat, 3 Ore (missing 2 Wheat)
3. **Buy a development card**: Requires 1 Ore, 1 Wheat, 1 Sheep (missing Wheat)

## Available Actions Analysis
- **End turn [0]**: This would let me collect more resources on the next roll
- **Build roads ([1], [2], [3])**: I already have longest road, so building more roads doesn't help me get that crucial 10th VP
- **Trade options ([4]-[7])**: I could trade 4 Wood for 1 Wheat, which would help toward a development card

Looking at my current resources and what's missing, I see that I primarily need Wheat to make progress. I have 4 Wood, which I could trade for 1 Wheat using option [7].

However, even with that Wheat, I would still be short resources for all victory point options:
- For a settlement: Would still need more Wheat
- For a city upgrade: Would still need 1 more Wheat
- For a development card: Would have exactly the right resources (1 Ore, 1 Wheat, 1 Sheep)

A development card has a chance of being a Victory Point card, which would immediately win me the game. Even if it's not, I could get a Knight to strengthen my largest army, a Monopoly, Year of Plenty, or Road Building card - all valuable.

The most efficient path to potentially winning appears to be trading for Wheat and buying a development card.

<plan>
1. Trade 4 Wood for 1 Wheat using port trade
2. Use 1 Ore + 1 Wheat + 1 Sheep to buy a development card
3. If I get a Victory Point card, I win immediately
4. If not, I still strengthen my position and have Brick and Ore resources to utilize on next turn
</plan>

Given that I'm at 9 VP and need just 1 more to win, the most strategic move is to trade for the Wheat I need to potentially get a Victory Point development card.

# Game Analysis: BLUE Player at Turn 130

I'll analyze the current game state thoroughly to make the optimal decision.

## Victory Point Situation:
- I have 9/10 VP (2 cities = 4 VP, 1 settlement = 1 VP, Longest Road = 2 VP, Largest Army = 2 VP)
- RED has 8/10 VP (4 cities = 8 VP)
- I'm only 1 VP away from winning

## Resource Analysis:
- I have: 3 🧱BRICK, 1 🐑SHEEP, 1 🌾WHEAT, 3 ⛏️ORE
- This allows me to buy exactly one development card (1 SHEEP + 1 WHEAT + 1 ORE)

## Development Card Probability Analysis:
Of the 21 remaining development cards:
- There are likely ~5 Victory Point cards remaining
- The rest are Knight, Year of Plenty, Monopoly, and Road Building cards

## Strategic Decision:
Since I'm at 9 VP and need just 1 more VP to win, buying a development card gives me approximately a 5/21 ≈ 24% chance of drawing a VP card and winning immediately.

Even if I don't draw a VP card:
- A Knight would strengthen my Largest Army lead
- Year of Plenty/Monopoly would help gather resources for my next play
- Road Building could extend my Longest Road lead

The alternative is to end my turn, but that:
1. Gives RED another turn where they might reach 10 VP
2. Doesn't advance my position at all

Since I'm so close to winning and RED is just behind me at 8 VP, I should take the chance to potentially win now or strengthen my position.

<plan>
Buy a development card with hopes of drawing a Victory Point card for the immediate win.
If I don't get a Victory Point card, I'll still have 3 BRICK and 2 ORE remaining for my next turn.
</plan>

I'll buy a development card as it's my only path to potentially win this turn, and it strengthens my position even if I don't draw a VP card.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL SETTLEMENT PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Place settlements on high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Target at least one spot with good ore and wheat production for city development
- Try to secure at least one high-probability spot (5, 6, 8, 9) for each critical resource
- Place your second settlement to complement your first (fill resource gaps)
- Aim for access to all five resources or position near useful ports if resource diversity isn't possible
- Always consider which settlements opponents are likely to place and avoid areas that will become contested
- Place roads pointing toward valuable future expansion spots, not toward the center
- Consider the long-term impact: settlements that can't expand are less valuable

MID-GAME RESOURCE PRIORITIES:
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each possible build (cities: 1VP for 5 resources is most efficient)
- Early phase: Secure at least one good source of brick and wood for minimal expansion
- Growth phase: Prioritize ore and wheat production for city upgrades (3VP for 5 resources is optimal)
- Late phase: Focus on the fastest path to victory points, whether through buildings or development cards
- Avoid trading resources that opponents need for immediate victory point gains
- Use 4:1 trades only when necessary; prioritize port usage when possible

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and limited expansion options
- If you get an early knight, save it for defense or until you can start building toward largest army
- Time monopoly card usage for when opponents likely have accumulated specific resources
- Save year of plenty cards for completing crucial builds when you're short 1-2 specific resources
- Development cards are most valuable when:
  * You need hidden victory points to surprise opponents
  * You need knights to break up longest road or secure largest army
  * You're lacking wood/brick for expansion but have plenty of sheep/wheat/ore

EXPANSION STRATEGY:
- Build roads only with clear settlement locations in mind
- Target settlements that give you access to ports or new resources
- Block opponents' expansion paths when it gives you a strategic advantage
- Consider the timing of expansion vs. city upgrades based on your resource production
- Calculate whether longest road is achievable and worth the resource investment
- When deciding between a new settlement and a city upgrade, compare immediate vs. long-term returns

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-probability hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Save knight cards for breaking up opponent strategies or securing largest army
- Use knights defensively if you're producing valuable resources on high-probability hexes

TRADING TACTICS:
- Avoid trading resources that directly help opponents score points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades
- Trade excess resources before rolling 7 if you have more than 7 cards
- Consider bank/port trades when they enable an immediate build that advances your strategy
- When trading with players, try to receive resources that complete a build

ENDGAME STRATEGY:
- In the late game, hide your victory point potential (keep development cards hidden)
- Calculate the fastest path to 10 VP and focus exclusively on that path
- Be aware of the exact number of remaining development cards and their probabilities
- Track opponents' potential victory points, including hidden development cards
- If you're close to winning, prioritize actions that can be completed in a single turn

Before finalizing your action, check:
1. Is there a more efficient path to victory points?
2. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
3. Does this move help or hinder opponents?
4. Is there a defensive move needed to prevent an opponent from winning?
5. Are you properly diversified against dice probability?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Initial Settlement Placement Analysis

I'm making the first settlement placement in the game, which is a crucial decision that will impact my entire strategy. Let me analyze the board systematically.

## Resource Analysis
From the map, I can see:
- 🌾 Wheat tiles at (0, -1, 1) with number 4 and (0, 1, -1) with number 10
- 🌲 Wood at (1, -1, 0) with number 6 (excellent probability)
- ⛏️ Ore at (-1, 0, 1) with number 9 (good probability)
- 🐑 Sheep at (0, 0, 0) with number 8 (excellent probability)
- 🧱 Brick at (1, 0, -1) with number 3 (poor probability)
- 🏜️ Desert at (-1, 1, 0) with the robber

## Node Evaluation
Let me identify the most valuable nodes:

1. Nodes touching the 6 (wood) and 8 (sheep): Nodes 1 and 2
   - Node 1 also touches 3 (brick)
   - Node 2 also touches 4 (wheat)

2. Nodes touching the 8 (sheep) and 9 (ore): Nodes 3 and 4
   - Node 3 also touches 4 (wheat)
   - Node 4 is adjacent to desert (less valuable)

3. Node 6 touches 6 (wood) and 3 (brick)
   - Good for early road building

4. Node 9 touches 6 (wood) and 4 (wheat)

The ideal settlement placement should:
- Access high probability numbers (6, 8, 9)
- Provide diverse resources (especially ore/wheat for cities)
- Allow for future expansion

## Best Options:

Node 1: Gives 6 (wood), 8 (sheep), 3 (brick) - Great for early expansion with road-building resources plus sheep
Node 2: Gives 6 (wood), 8 (sheep), 4 (wheat) - Strong overall with important city-building resources
Node 3: Gives 8 (sheep), 9 (ore), 4 (wheat) - Excellent for city development strategy

Looking at these options, Node 2 appears to be the strongest choice as it gives me access to wood (6), sheep (8), and wheat (4). This provides a good balance of resources for early expansion and later city upgrades. The 6 and 8 are high probability numbers, making this a productive spot.

<plan>Place first settlement at Node 2 for strong wood (6), sheep (8), and wheat (4) production. For second settlement, look to secure ore access, ideally at Node 3 or another spot with brick if available. Focus on early expansion then city development.</plan>

# Analysis of Initial Road Placement

I'm placing my first initial road after setting my first settlement at Node 2. This is a crucial decision as it will determine my expansion direction for the rest of the game. Let me analyze each option:

## Option [0]: Build road at edge (2, 3)
- Direction: Going east toward node 3
- Node 3 connects to wheat(4), sheep(8), and ore(9) hexes
- This creates a nice complement to my current settlement's resources
- Ore access is crucial for city development later
- This maintains my plan to secure ore for my second settlement

## Option [1]: Build road at edge (2, 9)
- Direction: Going southwest toward node 9
- Node 9 connects to wheat(4), wood(6), but no new resources
- This duplicates resources I already have access to
- Less strategic as it doesn't diversify my resource access

## Option [2]: Build road at edge (1, 2)
- Direction: Going northwest toward node 1
- Node 1 connects to wood(6), sheep(8), and potentially brick(3)
- Would give access to brick which I need for expansion
- However, node 1 looks less promising for my second settlement compared to node 3

## Decision Making
The most strategic move is to build toward node 3 because:
1. It gives me access to ore (critical for city upgrades)
2. It aligns with my current plan to secure ore with my second settlement
3. It positions me for a balanced resource portfolio

<plan>Place first settlement at Node 2 for strong wood (6), sheep (8), and wheat (4) production. Build road toward Node 3 to secure access to ore. For second settlement, place at Node 3 to add ore production to my portfolio. Then focus on early expansion toward brick resources, followed by city development.</plan>

1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL SETTLEMENT PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Place settlements on high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Target at least one spot with good ore and wheat production for city development
- Try to secure at least one high-probability spot (5, 6, 8, 9) for each critical resource
- Place your second settlement to complement your first (fill resource gaps)
- Aim for access to all five resources or position near useful ports if resource diversity isn't possible
- Always consider which settlements opponents are likely to place and avoid areas that will become contested
- Place roads pointing toward valuable future expansion spots, not toward the center
- Consider the long-term impact: settlements that can't expand are less valuable

MID-GAME RESOURCE PRIORITIES:
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each possible build (cities: 1VP for 5 resources is most efficient)
- Early phase: Secure at least one good source of brick and wood for minimal expansion
- Growth phase: Prioritize ore and wheat production for city upgrades (3VP for 5 resources is optimal)
- Late phase: Focus on the fastest path to victory points, whether through buildings or development cards
- Avoid trading resources that opponents need for immediate victory point gains
- Use 4:1 trades only when necessary; prioritize port usage when possible

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and limited expansion options
- If you get an early knight, save it for defense or until you can start building toward largest army
- Time monopoly card usage for when opponents likely have accumulated specific resources
- Save year of plenty cards for completing crucial builds when you're short 1-2 specific resources
- Development cards are most valuable when:
  * You need hidden victory points to surprise opponents
  * You need knights to break up longest road or secure largest army
  * You're lacking wood/brick for expansion but have plenty of sheep/wheat/ore

EXPANSION STRATEGY:
- Build roads only with clear settlement locations in mind
- Target settlements that give you access to ports or new resources
- Block opponents' expansion paths when it gives you a strategic advantage
- Consider the timing of expansion vs. city upgrades based on your resource production
- Calculate whether longest road is achievable and worth the resource investment
- When deciding between a new settlement and a city upgrade, compare immediate vs. long-term returns

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-probability hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Save knight cards for breaking up opponent strategies or securing largest army
- Use knights defensively if you're producing valuable resources on high-probability hexes

TRADING TACTICS:
- Avoid trading resources that directly help opponents score points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades
- Trade excess resources before rolling 7 if you have more than 7 cards
- Consider bank/port trades when they enable an immediate build that advances your strategy
- When trading with players, try to receive resources that complete a build

ENDGAME STRATEGY:
- In the late game, hide your victory point potential (keep development cards hidden)
- Calculate the fastest path to 10 VP and focus exclusively on that path
- Be aware of the exact number of remaining development cards and their probabilities
- Track opponents' potential victory points, including hidden development cards
- If you're close to winning, prioritize actions that can be completed in a single turn

Before finalizing your action, check:
1. Is there a more efficient path to victory points?
2. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
3. Does this move help or hinder opponents?
4. Is there a defensive move needed to prevent an opponent from winning?
5. Are you properly diversified against dice probability?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 2 | Player: BLUE | Action: BUILD_INITIAL_SETTLEMENT

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  Place first settlement at Node 2 for strong wood (6), sheep (8), and wheat (4) production. Build road toward Node 3 to secure access to ore. For second settlement, place at Node 3 to add ore production to my portfolio. Then focus on early expansion toward brick resources, followed by city development.
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.

# Initial Settlement Placement Analysis

I need to place my second settlement, which is a critical decision that will shape my entire game strategy. Let me analyze the available options based on the key principles for initial settlement placement.

## Current Resources and Position
- My first settlement is at Node 2, producing wood (6), sheep (8), and wheat (4)
- I'm missing ore and brick production
- Red's settlements are at nodes 0 (sheep 8, wheat 10, brick 3) and 6 (wood 6, brick 3)

## Node Analysis

Let me evaluate the most promising nodes:

### Node 3
- Resources: ore (9), sheep (8), wheat (4)
- Probability: ore (9) is good [⭐⭐], sheep (8) is excellent [⭐⭐⭐], wheat (4) is low [⭐]
- Adds ore to my portfolio which I currently lack
- Complements my first settlement well

### Node 4
- Resources: ore (9), desert (-), sheep (8)
- Adds ore but desert is unproductive and I already have good sheep

### Node 12
- Resources: ore (9), wheat (4)
- Adds ore but duplicates wheat I already have

### Node 13
- Resources: ore (9)
- Only one resource (ore) with medium probability

## Strategic Decision

For my second settlement placement, I need to:
1. Secure resources I'm missing (ore and brick)
2. Maximize high-probability numbers
3. Position for future expansion
4. Consider ports if visible on the map

Node 3 is clearly the optimal choice as it:
- Gives me access to ore which I currently lack
- Maintains my sheep production on the excellent 8 value
- Continues my wheat production
- Is connected to my road from the first settlement
- Creates a balanced resource portfolio (wood, sheep, wheat, ore)
- Only missing brick, which I'll need to trade for

<plan>
Place second settlement at Node 3 to secure ore (9), sheep (8), and wheat (4) production. This gives me all resources except brick. Early game strategy: trade for brick to enable minimal expansion, then focus on city development using my ore and wheat production. Target additional settlements near brick production when possible.
</plan>

The only challenge will be accessing brick, but with my strong wood and sheep production, I should be able to trade for it.

After careful analysis, node 3 is clearly the optimal choice for my second settlement.

# Analysis of Initial Road Placement Options

I need to carefully evaluate my road placement options after having placed my second settlement at node 4. This is a crucial decision that will affect my expansion potential and resource access.

## Current Game State Assessment
- I have settlements at nodes 2 and 4
- I have good sheep production (8), decent ore (9), wood (6), and wheat (4)
- I'm missing brick production entirely
- I currently have 1 sheep and 1 ore in my inventory
- Road options: (3,4), (4,15), or (4,5)

## Evaluating Each Road Option

### Option 0: Road at edge (3,4)
This road would connect node 3, which is adjacent to ore(9), sheep(8), and wheat(4). However, I already have access to all these resources through my existing settlements. This road would mainly open up expansion toward nodes 12 and 13, which might provide access to additional resources later.

### Option 1: Road at edge (4,15)
This road would lead toward nodes 14 and 15, connected to ore(9). While this would strengthen my ore production eventually, it's not giving me access to any new resource types that I don't already have.

### Option 2: Road at edge (4,5)
This road would lead toward node 5, which connects to sheep(8), the desert, and wheat(10). The desert hex currently has the robber, but it's likely to move soon. This direction would lead me toward possible brick access and potentially the 3:1 port if one exists in that region.

## Strategic Considerations
- My biggest weakness is lack of brick, which I need for future expansion
- I should position my road to maximize future settlement options
- I need to consider both immediate access and long-term growth potential

<plan>
Place road at edge (4,5) to expand toward nodes 5, 16, 17, which may give access to brick production or useful ports. Continue to develop ore/wheat production for city upgrades while trading for brick when possible to enable minimal expansion. Once I've secured a source of brick or a brick port, focus on city upgrades.
</plan>

After analyzing all options, I believe road placement at edge (4,5) gives me the best expansion potential toward potentially unexplored regions that might provide brick access or useful ports. This aligns with my strategic need to find brick production while maintaining my strong position with other resources.

# Analysis of Robber Move Options

I need to carefully consider where to place the robber to maximize my strategic advantage while hindering my opponent.

Let me analyze each option:

**[0] Move robber to (0, 0, 0) and steal from RED**
- This is the sheep hex with an 8 (high probability)
- Both RED and I have settlements on this hex
- Blocking would hurt me significantly as I have two settlements producing from this 8-sheep hex
- Not strategically sound as it hampers my own production

**[1] Move robber to (1, -1, 0) and steal from RED**
- This is the wood hex with a 6 (high probability)
- Both RED and I have settlements on this hex
- Blocking would hurt my wood production, which I need for expansion
- Not ideal as it hurts my own production

**[2] Move robber to (0, -1, 1)**
- This is the wheat hex with a 4 (lower probability)
- Only I have a settlement here
- Placing the robber here would only hurt myself
- Very poor choice

**[3] Move robber to (-1, 0, 1)**
- This is the ore hex with a 9 (good probability)
- Only I have a settlement here
- Placing the robber here would only hurt myself
- Very poor choice

**[4] Move robber to (0, 1, -1) and steal from RED**
- This is the wheat hex with a 10 (moderate probability)
- Only RED has a settlement here
- This would block RED's wheat production and let me steal a card
- Good option that doesn't affect my production

**[5] Move robber to (1, 0, -1) and steal from RED**
- This is the brick hex with a 3 (low probability)
- Only RED has settlements here
- This would block RED's brick production and let me steal a card
- Lower impact due to the 3 being a low-probability number

## Strategic Considerations:
1. I should avoid blocking my own high-probability resources
2. RED has control of brick which I currently lack
3. Blocking wheat (10) seems more impactful than brick (3) due to probability
4. RED having access to brick is concerning as it enables expansion

<plan>
Continue with expansion toward nodes 5, 16, 17 to secure brick production or access. Focus on converting ore and wheat to city upgrades while trading for brick when necessary. Block RED's wheat production to slow their development and potentially steal a useful resource.
</plan>

## Decision:
I should place the robber on RED's wheat hex (0, 1, -1) which has a 10. This blocks a moderate-probability resource that I don't currently produce while allowing me to steal a card from RED. This won't affect my own production and could slow RED's development.

PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL SETTLEMENT PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Place settlements on high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Target at least one spot with good ore and wheat production for city development
- Try to secure at least one high-probability spot (5, 6, 8, 9) for each critical resource
- Place your second settlement to complement your first (fill resource gaps)
- Aim for access to all five resources or position near useful ports if resource diversity isn't possible
- Always consider which settlements opponents are likely to place and avoid areas that will become contested
- Place roads pointing toward valuable future expansion spots, not toward the center
- Consider the long-term impact: settlements that can't expand are less valuable

MID-GAME RESOURCE PRIORITIES:
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each possible build (cities: 1VP for 5 resources is most efficient)
- Early phase: Secure at least one good source of brick and wood for minimal expansion
- Growth phase: Prioritize ore and wheat production for city upgrades (3VP for 5 resources is optimal)
- Late phase: Focus on the fastest path to victory points, whether through buildings or development cards
- Avoid trading resources that opponents need for immediate victory point gains
- Use 4:1 trades only when necessary; prioritize port usage when possible

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and limited expansion options
- If you get an early knight, save it for defense or until you can start building toward largest army
- Time monopoly card usage for when opponents likely have accumulated specific resources
- Save year of plenty cards for completing crucial builds when you're short 1-2 specific resources
- Development cards are most valuable when:
  * You need hidden victory points to surprise opponents
  * You need knights to break up longest road or secure largest army
  * You're lacking wood/brick for expansion but have plenty of sheep/wheat/ore

EXPANSION STRATEGY:
- Build roads only with clear settlement locations in mind
- Target settlements that give you access to ports or new resources
- Block opponents' expansion paths when it gives you a strategic advantage
- Consider the timing of expansion vs. city upgrades based on your resource production
- Calculate whether longest road is achievable and worth the resource investment
- When deciding between a new settlement and a city upgrade, compare immediate vs. long-term returns

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-probability hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Save knight cards for breaking up opponent strategies or securing largest army
- Use knights defensively if you're producing valuable resources on high-probability hexes

TRADING TACTICS:
- Avoid trading resources that directly help opponents score points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades
- Trade excess resources before rolling 7 if you have more than 7 cards
- Consider bank/port trades when they enable an immediate build that advances your strategy
- When trading with players, try to receive resources that complete a build

ENDGAME STRATEGY:
- In the late game, hide your victory point potential (keep development cards hidden)
- Calculate the fastest path to 10 VP and focus exclusively on that path
- Be aware of the exact number of remaining development cards and their probabilities
- Track opponents' potential victory points, including hidden development cards
- If you're close to winning, prioritize actions that can be completed in a single turn

Before finalizing your action, check:
1. Is there a more efficient path to victory points?
2. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
3. Does this move help or hinder opponents?
4. Is there a defensive move needed to prevent an opponent from winning?
5. Are you properly diversified against dice probability?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 8 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  Continue with expansion toward nodes 5, 16, 17 to secure brick production or access. Focus on converting ore and wheat to city upgrades while trading for brick when necessary. Block RED's wheat production to slow their development and potentially steal a useful resource.
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.

# Game Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state and my options:

## Current Resources
- 3 Wood
- 1 Sheep
- 1 Wheat
- 3 Ore

## Current Position
- I have 2 VP from 2 settlements
- I have settlements at nodes 2 and 4, with good sheep (8), wood (6), and some ore (9) and wheat (4)
- I have 4 roads but my longest sequence is just 1 segment
- The robber is currently on wheat (10), which affects RED's production

## Available Actions
- [0] End turn
- [1] Buy a development card (costs 1 sheep, 1 wheat, 1 ore)

## Strategic Analysis

Looking at my resources and my current plan, I need to decide between:
1. Buying a development card, which could be:
   - Victory point (immediate hidden VP)
   - Knight (can move robber and contribute to largest army)
   - Year of Plenty (resource gain)
   - Monopoly (resource steal)
   - Road Building (free expansion)

2. Ending my turn to save resources for building in future turns

If I buy a development card:
- I'll spend all my sheep and wheat, plus 1 ore
- I'll have 2 ore and 3 wood remaining
- I might get a VP card, which would be hidden progress toward victory
- If it's a knight, I could defend against the robber or attack RED
- The other cards provide tactical advantages

If I end my turn:
- I'll keep all current resources
- I'll be at risk of losing cards if a 7 is rolled (8 cards total)
- I'll be closer to building a city (need 3 ore, 2 wheat)
- I could potentially build more roads next turn if I get wood/brick

My plan was to focus on city upgrades while trading for brick. I currently have enough ore (3) for a city but need more wheat (only have 1). However, I'm also at risk of losing cards if a 7 is rolled since I have 8 resources.

<plan>Buy a development card to reduce hand size below 7 cards. This protects against the robber while potentially gaining a victory point or useful action card. Continue focus on city upgrades with remaining ore, collecting more wheat through production.</plan>

Given that I have 8 cards and risk losing half on a 7 roll, plus the potential value of development cards, I'll buy a development card now to reduce my hand size while potentially gaining advantage.

# Game Analysis for Settlers of Catan Turn 10

Let me analyze the current game state and my available actions to determine the optimal move.

## Game State Assessment
- I have 2 VP from my 2 settlements
- I have 3 Wood, 2 Ore, and 1 Year of Plenty development card
- I'm missing Wheat, Brick, and Sheep in my hand
- The robber is on the Wheat hex (10), which doesn't directly affect my production
- My settlements produce Wood (6), Sheep (8), Wheat (4) and Ore (9)

## Strategic Options

I have two main choices:
1. Play Year of Plenty card to get specific resources
2. Roll the dice to get more resources naturally

Let me consider what I can build with different resource combinations:
- Road (Wood + Brick) - Costs 2 resources, 0 VP
- Settlement (Wood + Brick + Wheat + Sheep) - Costs 4 resources, 1 VP
- City (Ore + Ore + Ore + Wheat + Wheat) - Costs 5 resources, 1 VP (upgrades from settlement)
- Development card (Ore + Wheat + Sheep) - Costs 3 resources, potentially 1 VP

I currently have 2 Ore, which means I'm 3 resources away from a city upgrade (need 1 more Ore and 2 Wheat).

### Option 1: Use Year of Plenty
If I use Year of Plenty, my best choices would be:
- [0] Get 2 Ore - This would give me 4 Ore total, getting me closer to a city (still need 2 Wheat)
- [5] Get 2 Wheat - This would give me 2 Wheat, getting me closer to a city (still need 1 Ore)
- [6] Get 1 Wheat + 1 Ore - This would give me 3 Ore and 1 Wheat total, getting me closer to a city (need 1 more Wheat)

Getting 2 Wheat or Wheat+Ore seems most efficient as I would only need 1 more resource to build a city.

### Option 2: Roll the Dice
If I roll, I could get:
- More Wood from my 6 (3 dots) production
- More Sheep from my 8 (3 dots) production 
- More Wheat from my 4 (1 dot) production
- More Ore from my 9 (2 dots) production

My strong production is on Wood and Sheep, though neither helps immediately with a city.

## Decision Logic

My previous plan was to buy a development card to reduce hand size, but with 5 cards, I'm not at risk of the robber (threshold is 7+). Instead, I should focus on working toward a city upgrade.

The most efficient path to a city is to get Wheat and additional Ore. Using Year of Plenty for Wheat+Ore [6] would put me one Wheat away from a city. If I roll after getting these resources, I might get the final Wheat I need from my Wheat hex (4).

<plan>Use Year of Plenty to acquire Wheat and Ore, putting me one Wheat away from a city. Then work toward building that city by trying to produce or trade for the final Wheat needed.</plan>

Therefore, my optimal action is to play Year of Plenty for Wheat and Ore.

3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL SETTLEMENT PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Place settlements on high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Target at least one spot with good ore and wheat production for city development
- Try to secure at least one high-probability spot (5, 6, 8, 9) for each critical resource
- Place your second settlement to complement your first (fill resource gaps)
- Aim for access to all five resources or position near useful ports if resource diversity isn't possible
- Always consider which settlements opponents are likely to place and avoid areas that will become contested
- Place roads pointing toward valuable future expansion spots, not toward the center
- Consider the long-term impact: settlements that can't expand are less valuable

MID-GAME RESOURCE PRIORITIES:
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each possible build (cities: 1VP for 5 resources is most efficient)
- Early phase: Secure at least one good source of brick and wood for minimal expansion
- Growth phase: Prioritize ore and wheat production for city upgrades (3VP for 5 resources is optimal)
- Late phase: Focus on the fastest path to victory points, whether through buildings or development cards
- Avoid trading resources that opponents need for immediate victory point gains
- Use 4:1 trades only when necessary; prioritize port usage when possible

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and limited expansion options
- If you get an early knight, save it for defense or until you can start building toward largest army
- Time monopoly card usage for when opponents likely have accumulated specific resources
- Save year of plenty cards for completing crucial builds when you're short 1-2 specific resources
- Development cards are most valuable when:
  * You need hidden victory points to surprise opponents
  * You need knights to break up longest road or secure largest army
  * You're lacking wood/brick for expansion but have plenty of sheep/wheat/ore

EXPANSION STRATEGY:
- Build roads only with clear settlement locations in mind
- Target settlements that give you access to ports or new resources
- Block opponents' expansion paths when it gives you a strategic advantage
- Consider the timing of expansion vs. city upgrades based on your resource production
- Calculate whether longest road is achievable and worth the resource investment
- When deciding between a new settlement and a city upgrade, compare immediate vs. long-term returns

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-probability hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Save knight cards for breaking up opponent strategies or securing largest army
- Use knights defensively if you're producing valuable resources on high-probability hexes

TRADING TACTICS:
- Avoid trading resources that directly help opponents score points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades
- Trade excess resources before rolling 7 if you have more than 7 cards
- Consider bank/port trades when they enable an immediate build that advances your strategy
- When trading with players, try to receive resources that complete a build

ENDGAME STRATEGY:
- In the late game, hide your victory point potential (keep development cards hidden)
- Calculate the fastest path to 10 VP and focus exclusively on that path
- Be aware of the exact number of remaining development cards and their probabilities
- Track opponents' potential victory points, including hidden development cards
- If you're close to winning, prioritize actions that can be completed in a single turn

Before finalizing your action, check:
1. Is there a more efficient path to victory points?
2. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
3. Does this move help or hinder opponents?
4. Is there a defensive move needed to prevent an opponent from winning?
5. Are you properly diversified against dice probability?

# Robber Movement Analysis

Let me analyze each hex to determine the optimal robber placement:

1. (0, 0, 0) - Sheep 8 [⭐⭐⭐]
   - This is a high probability hex (8)
   - Currently producing for BOTH players (crucial for both)
   - Blocking this would hurt my own production significantly
   - I have 2 settlements producing from this hex

2. (1, -1, 0) - Wood 6 [⭐⭐⭐]
   - High probability hex (6)
   - I have 1 settlement producing from this
   - Red has 1 settlement producing from this
   - I currently have 2 Wood resources

3. (0, -1, 1) - Wheat 4 [⭐]
   - Low probability hex (4)
   - I have 1 settlement producing from this
   - Red has no settlements here
   - I need Wheat for my city strategy

4. (-1, 0, 1) - Ore 9 [⭐⭐]
   - Good probability hex (9)
   - I have 1 settlement producing from this
   - Red has no settlements here
   - I already have 2 Ore resources

5. (-1, 1, 0) - Desert
   - No production here, placing robber would be wasted

6. (1, 0, -1) - Brick 3 [⭐]
   - Low probability hex (3)
   - Red has 2 settlements producing from this
   - I have no settlements here
   - Brick is not critical for my current strategy

Looking at my current plan:
- I need Wheat to build a city
- I already have 2 Ore which is halfway to a city
- Blocking my own Sheep 8 production would be detrimental
- Robber is currently on Wheat 10, which I don't produce from

Strategic considerations:
- Red has settlements on Sheep 8, Wood 6, and Brick 3 (2 settlements)
- Blocking a high-probability resource that Red needs while also stealing a card would be optimal
- Wood 6 affects both of us equally, but I already have 2 Wood
- Brick 3 affects only Red, though it's a low probability

<plan>Block Red's resource production and steal a card. Specifically target Wood 6 or Brick 3 to disrupt Red's expansion potential, then continue working toward building a city with my Ore and the Wheat I'll get from Year of Plenty.</plan>

Based on this analysis, I should either:
1. Move the robber to Wood 6 (1, -1, 0) and steal from Red - This would hurt us both equally for Wood production, but I already have 2 Wood.
2. Move the robber to Brick 3 (1, 0, -1) and steal from Red - This only affects Red's production.

Since I already have 2 Wood and don't immediately need more, while Red might be collecting Brick for expansion that could block my future plans, I'll choose option 5:

Based on this information, which action number do you choose? Think step by step about your options, then put the final action number in a box like \boxed{1}.
RESPONSE:
I'll analyze the current game state and make the optimal decision step by step.

First, let me assess our position:
- We have 2 victory points from our settlements
- Resources: 3 Wood, 2 Sheep, 1 Wheat, 2 Ore
- We have a Year of Plenty card played
- Only two options: End turn [0] or Buy development card [1]

Current game status:
- Both players have 2 victory points
- Both players have 2 settlements
- Red has more roads (6 vs 4) and is working toward longest road
- Robber is on Brick (3) hex, blocking one of Red's resources

Analyzing our options:

1. Buy a development card [1]:
   - Cost: 1 Sheep, 1 Wheat, 1 Ore
   - Benefits: Possible knight (to move robber again), VP card, or utility cards
   - After purchase we'd have: 3 Wood, 1 Sheep, 0 Wheat, 1 Ore
   - Development cards can provide hidden victory points and tactical advantages

2. End turn [0]:
   - We keep all resources for next turn
   - We might get more resources on die rolls before our next turn
   - We can make a more substantial build next turn
   - Our plan mentioned using Year of Plenty for Wheat, but it's already been played

Decision factors:
- Buying a development card reduces our hand size, making us less vulnerable to robber/7 rolls
- Development cards could provide hidden VP or knights to contest largest army
- However, saving resources could let us build a settlement (2W, 2B, 1S, 1W) or city (3O, 2W) soon
- We have no Brick currently, so settlement building isn't immediately possible anyway

Looking at our current plan, there's a discrepancy - it mentions using Year of Plenty in the future, but the game state shows it's already been played. I need to update our strategy.

<plan>Focus on city development with our current Ore production. Buy development cards when possible for potential VPs and knights. Since we lack brick, focus on city upgrades rather than expansion until we can secure a brick source. Target Red's high-probability resources with robbers when possible.</plan>

Given our lack of brick and the need to progress toward higher VP generating moves, buying a development card is our best option. It could give us a hidden VP or knight, and reduces our vulnerability to the robber.

# Game Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state and options carefully.

## Current Situation
- I have 2 VP from my 2 settlements
- Resources: 3 Wood, 1 Sheep
- 1 Road Building development card in hand
- Robber is on a Wheat hex (0, -1, 1) with dice value 4

## Available Actions
- [0] Play Road Building card - Build two roads for free
- [1] Roll the dice

## Strategic Considerations

My current resources are insufficient for:
- Building a settlement (need: 1 wood, 1 brick, 1 wheat, 1 sheep; have: 3 wood, 1 sheep)
- Building a city (need: 3 ore, 2 wheat; have: none of these)
- Buying a development card (need: 1 ore, 1 wheat, 1 sheep; have: only 1 sheep)

If I roll the dice, with my current settlements I could potentially gain:
- Wheat (from my settlement at node 2, on hex with dice value 4) - but this is blocked by the robber
- Wood (from my settlement at node 2, on hex with dice value 6)
- Sheep (from both settlements, on hex with dice value 8)
- Ore (from my settlement at node 4, on hex with dice value 9)

Looking at my Road Building card:
- It allows me to build 2 free roads which could help:
  1. Expand toward new settlement locations
  2. Work toward longest road (currently no one has it)

<plan>
Play the Road Building card to expand toward promising settlement locations. 
Target expansion toward resource diversity, especially brick and wheat which we're lacking. 
Continue city development strategy once we have secured better resource production.
</plan>

Since I have limited resources and a Road Building card, using it now makes strategic sense. It would allow me to expand without spending precious wood resources, potentially setting up for a new settlement on my next turn if I can acquire brick and additional resources.

Therefore, I choose to play the Road Building card:

PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL SETTLEMENT PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Place settlements on high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Target at least one spot with good ore and wheat production for city development
- Try to secure at least one high-probability spot (5, 6, 8, 9) for each critical resource
- Place your second settlement to complement your first (fill resource gaps)
- Aim for access to all five resources or position near useful ports if resource diversity isn't possible
- Always consider which settlements opponents are likely to place and avoid areas that will become contested
- Place roads pointing toward valuable future expansion spots, not toward the center
- Consider the long-term impact: settlements that can't expand are less valuable

MID-GAME RESOURCE PRIORITIES:
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each possible build (cities: 1VP for 5 resources is most efficient)
- Early phase: Secure at least one good source of brick and wood for minimal expansion
- Growth phase: Prioritize ore and wheat production for city upgrades (3VP for 5 resources is optimal)
- Late phase: Focus on the fastest path to victory points, whether through buildings or development cards
- Avoid trading resources that opponents need for immediate victory point gains
- Use 4:1 trades only when necessary; prioritize port usage when possible

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and limited expansion options
- If you get an early knight, save it for defense or until you can start building toward largest army
- Time monopoly card usage for when opponents likely have accumulated specific resources
- Save year of plenty cards for completing crucial builds when you're short 1-2 specific resources
- Development cards are most valuable when:
  * You need hidden victory points to surprise opponents
  * You need knights to break up longest road or secure largest army
  * You're lacking wood/brick for expansion but have plenty of sheep/wheat/ore

EXPANSION STRATEGY:
- Build roads only with clear settlement locations in mind
- Target settlements that give you access to ports or new resources
- Block opponents' expansion paths when it gives you a strategic advantage
- Consider the timing of expansion vs. city upgrades based on your resource production
- Calculate whether longest road is achievable and worth the resource investment
- When deciding between a new settlement and a city upgrade, compare immediate vs. long-term returns

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-probability hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Save knight cards for breaking up opponent strategies or securing largest army
- Use knights defensively if you're producing valuable resources on high-probability hexes

TRADING TACTICS:
- Avoid trading resources that directly help opponents score points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades
- Trade excess resources before rolling 7 if you have more than 7 cards
- Consider bank/port trades when they enable an immediate build that advances your strategy
- When trading with players, try to receive resources that complete a build

ENDGAME STRATEGY:
- In the late game, hide your victory point potential (keep development cards hidden)
- Calculate the fastest path to 10 VP and focus exclusively on that path
- Be aware of the exact number of remaining development cards and their probabilities
- Track opponents' potential victory points, including hidden development cards
- If you're close to winning, prioritize actions that can be completed in a single turn

Before finalizing your action, check:
1. Is there a more efficient path to victory points?
2. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
3. Does this move help or hinder opponents?
4. Is there a defensive move needed to prevent an opponent from winning?
5. Are you properly diversified against dice probability?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game Analysis for Settlers of Catan

Let me analyze the current game state and available actions to make an optimal decision:

## Resource Assessment
- I have 3 wood and 1 sheep
- No brick, wheat, or ore
- Cannot build settlements/cities directly

## Board Position
- I have 2 settlements producing:
  - Settlement at node 2: sheep (8), wood (6), wheat (4)
  - Settlement at node 4: sheep (8), ore (9)
- Good production on high-probability numbers (8, 6, 9)
- Robber is currently on the wheat hex (0, -1, 1)

## Available Actions
I can build a road in one of 5 locations:
- [0] Edge (1, 2): Connects toward RED's territory
- [1] Edge (3, 4): Creates a loop in my existing network
- [2] Edge (4, 15): Extends toward the desert hex
- [3] Edge (2, 9): Extends toward the wheat hex
- [4] Edge (3, 12): Extends toward the ore hex

## Strategic Considerations

Looking at each road option:
- Option [0] seems to build toward RED's territory, not creating immediate expansion opportunities
- Option [1] creates a loop in my network, which doesn't open new settlement spots
- Option [2] extends toward desert hex and potentially nodes 15/16, which could access the desert and wheat (10)
- Option [3] extends toward node 9, which connects to wood (6) and wheat (4)
- Option [4] extends toward node 12, connecting to ore (9) and wheat (4)

My current plan mentions expanding toward resource diversity, especially brick and wheat which I'm lacking. Looking at the board, expanding toward wheat makes sense.

Options [3] and [4] both lead toward wheat:
- Option [3] extends toward nodes 9-11, which could access wheat (4)
- Option [4] extends toward nodes 12-14, which could access wheat (4) and ore (9)

Since I already have decent ore production, and option [4] would lead to nodes with both ore and wheat, this seems to be the best path for expansion according to my plan.

<plan>
Continue expanding toward the wheat hex. Build a road at edge (3, 12) to position for a future settlement that can access wheat and additional ore. Next, continue expanding toward resource diversity, particularly pursuing brick access. Save resources for a settlement once we can secure a position with wheat production.
</plan>

# Game State Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state carefully:

## Current Resources
- I have: 3 🌲WOOD, 1 🐑SHEEP
- I'm missing: 🧱BRICK, 🌾WHEAT, ⛏️ORE

## Production Capabilities
- My settlements produce:
  * Settlement at node 2: 🐑8[⭐⭐⭐], 🌲6[⭐⭐⭐], 🌾4[⭐]
  * Settlement at node 4: 🐑8[⭐⭐⭐], ⛏️9[⭐⭐]
- Strong sheep and wood production
- Moderate ore production
- Weak wheat production
- No brick production

## Strategic Position
- I have two settlements positioned on strong number tiles (8 and 6)
- The robber is currently on the wheat hex (0, -1, 1), blocking my weak wheat production
- My opponent has access to brick which I lack completely

## Available Actions
I can't build anything significant this turn since I'm missing brick. All my road-building options require 1 wood + 1 brick, which I don't have. This means I need to plan where I want to expand when I do get brick.

## Expansion Opportunities
Looking at the possible road placements:
1. Edge (1, 2): Not clear where this expands to
2. Edge (3, 4): I already have settlements at nodes 3 and 4, so this doesn't open new expansion
3. Edge (12, 13): Extends toward hex (-1, 0, 1) with ore 9
4. Edge (4, 15): Extends toward desert hex and potentially wheat hex
5. Edge (2, 9): Extends toward wheat hex (0, -1, 1) and wood hex (1, -1, 0)
6. Edge (11, 12): Extends toward wheat hex (0, -1, 1)

Since I can't actually build a road this turn (no brick), there's no valid action to take among the options presented. However, this is a "PLAY_TURN" action, so I should be able to end my turn if I can't build anything.

<plan>
My long-term goal remains accessing all resources, particularly brick which I'm lacking completely. When I get brick, prioritize expanding toward node 13 (ore) or node 9 (wheat). I should also consider trading my excess sheep and wood for brick to enable expansion on future turns. Watch for development card opportunities with my sheep surplus.
</plan>

Since none of the provided actions are possible with my current resources (no brick), and no "end turn" option is explicitly listed, I'll need to select the most strategically valuable road location for when I do get brick. Based on my analysis, expanding toward the wheat hex via node 9 offers the best resource diversity.

TURN 18 | Player: BLUE | Action: MOVE_ROBBER

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  My long-term goal remains accessing all resources, particularly brick which I'm lacking completely. When I get brick, prioritize expanding toward node 13 (ore) or node 9 (wheat). I should also consider trading my excess sheep and wood for brick to enable expansion on future turns. Watch for development card opportunities with my sheep surplus.

# Game Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state and robber placement options to determine the optimal move.

## Game State Review
- I have 2 VP from my 2 settlements
- I have 3 wood and 1 sheep, lacking other resources
- Current robber is on wheat (0, -1, 1), which blocks my wheat production at node 2
- RED has 2 VP and 4 hidden cards

## Robber Movement Options
Let me analyze each option:

**[0] Move robber to (0, 0, 0) and steal from RED**
- This is the sheep hex with probability 8
- Blocks both my settlements (nodes 2 and 4)
- Would block a major resource for me (3 probability points for sheep)
- This would hurt me significantly more than RED

**[1] Move robber to (1, -1, 0) and steal from RED**
- This is the wood hex with probability 6
- Blocks RED's settlement at node 6 and my settlement at node 2
- Would hurt both of us, but I already have 3 wood in hand
- Blocking one of my key production hexes is not strategic

**[2] Move robber to (-1, 0, 1)**
- This is the ore hex with probability 9
- Blocks my settlement at node 4 but no RED settlements
- Would hurt my ore production (2 probability points)
- Not optimal since it hurts me but not RED

**[3] Move robber to (-1, 1, 0)**
- This is a desert hex
- Has no impact on either player
- Wastes the robber move completely

**[4] Move robber to (0, 1, -1) and steal from RED**
- This is the wheat hex with probability 10
- Blocks RED's settlement at node 0
- Good option as it impacts RED but not me

**[5] Move robber to (1, 0, -1) and steal from RED**
- This is the brick hex with probability 3
- Blocks both RED settlements (nodes 0 and 6)
- Excellent option as it impacts a key resource for RED (brick)
- I don't have access to brick yet, so it doesn't hurt me

## Strategic Decision

My best options are [4] or [5]:
- Option [4] blocks wheat (probability 10) for RED
- Option [5] blocks brick (probability 3) for RED, but affects both of RED's settlements

Since brick is crucial for expansion and RED has both settlements on the brick hex, option [5] seems optimal. While the probability is lower (3 vs 10), blocking RED's only source of brick could significantly impede their ability to expand, especially if they're planning to build roads.

Also, I would get to steal a card from RED, which could potentially give me a needed resource.

<plan>
Continue with my focus on securing brick through trades or robbing RED. Block RED's brick production with the robber to slow their expansion. Once I secure brick, I'll prioritize expanding toward node 13 (ore) or node 9 (wheat). Meanwhile, I'll look to trade my excess sheep and wood effectively, and consider development cards with my sheep surplus.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL SETTLEMENT PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Place settlements on high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Target at least one spot with good ore and wheat production for city development
- Try to secure at least one high-probability spot (5, 6, 8, 9) for each critical resource
- Place your second settlement to complement your first (fill resource gaps)
- Aim for access to all five resources or position near useful ports if resource diversity isn't possible
- Always consider which settlements opponents are likely to place and avoid areas that will become contested
- Place roads pointing toward valuable future expansion spots, not toward the center
- Consider the long-term impact: settlements that can't expand are less valuable

MID-GAME RESOURCE PRIORITIES:
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each possible build (cities: 1VP for 5 resources is most efficient)
- Early phase: Secure at least one good source of brick and wood for minimal expansion
- Growth phase: Prioritize ore and wheat production for city upgrades (3VP for 5 resources is optimal)
- Late phase: Focus on the fastest path to victory points, whether through buildings or development cards
- Avoid trading resources that opponents need for immediate victory point gains
- Use 4:1 trades only when necessary; prioritize port usage when possible

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and limited expansion options
- If you get an early knight, save it for defense or until you can start building toward largest army
- Time monopoly card usage for when opponents likely have accumulated specific resources
- Save year of plenty cards for completing crucial builds when you're short 1-2 specific resources
- Development cards are most valuable when:
  * You need hidden victory points to surprise opponents
  * You need knights to break up longest road or secure largest army
  * You're lacking wood/brick for expansion but have plenty of sheep/wheat/ore

EXPANSION STRATEGY:
- Build roads only with clear settlement locations in mind
- Target settlements that give you access to ports or new resources
- Block opponents' expansion paths when it gives you a strategic advantage
- Consider the timing of expansion vs. city upgrades based on your resource production
- Calculate whether longest road is achievable and worth the resource investment
- When deciding between a new settlement and a city upgrade, compare immediate vs. long-term returns

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-probability hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Save knight cards for breaking up opponent strategies or securing largest army
- Use knights defensively if you're producing valuable resources on high-probability hexes

TRADING TACTICS:
- Avoid trading resources that directly help opponents score points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades
- Trade excess resources before rolling 7 if you have more than 7 cards
- Consider bank/port trades when they enable an immediate build that advances your strategy
- When trading with players, try to receive resources that complete a build

ENDGAME STRATEGY:
- In the late game, hide your victory point potential (keep development cards hidden)
- Calculate the fastest path to 10 VP and focus exclusively on that path
- Be aware of the exact number of remaining development cards and their probabilities
- Track opponents' potential victory points, including hidden development cards
- If you're close to winning, prioritize actions that can be completed in a single turn

Before finalizing your action, check:
1. Is there a more efficient path to victory points?
2. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
3. Does this move help or hinder opponents?
4. Is there a defensive move needed to prevent an opponent from winning?
5. Are you properly diversified against dice probability?

# Game State Analysis

I'm being asked to choose where to move the robber as BLUE player. Let me analyze the current game state and my options:

## Current Game Status:
- BLUE (me): 2 VP, 2 settlements, 3 wood, 2 sheep
- RED: 4 VP (including 2 VP from longest road), 2 settlements, 4 hidden cards
- I need to decide where to place the robber and potentially steal from RED

## Resource Production Analysis:
- My settlements produce: wood (6), sheep (8), wheat (4), ore (9)
- RED produces: wood (6), sheep (8), wheat (10), brick (3)
- According to my current plan, I need brick to expand toward node 13 or 9

## Robber Placement Options:
[0] SHEEP (0,0,0) - Blocks a major sheep producer (8) for both of us, can steal from RED
[1] WOOD (1,-1,0) - Blocks wood (6) for both of us, can steal from RED
[2] ORE (-1,0,1) - Blocks my ore production (9), no stealing opportunity
[3] DESERT (-1,1,0) - Wastes the robber, no production blocked, no stealing
[4] WHEAT (0,1,-1) - Blocks RED's wheat (10), can steal from RED
[5] BRICK (1,0,-1) - Blocks RED's brick (3), can steal from RED

## Strategic Considerations:
1. My plan focuses on securing brick for expansion
2. RED is ahead with 4 VP and has longest road
3. I need to slow RED's expansion while advancing my own position
4. Blocking RED's brick production aligns with my current strategy
5. The brick hex is only producing for RED, not for me

## Decision Logic:
Option [5] is optimal because:
1. It blocks brick (resource 3) which RED needs for expansion
2. It doesn't affect my own production
3. I can potentially steal a card from RED, which could be brick
4. Aligns with my current strategy to hinder RED's road building

<plan>Continue focusing on securing brick through strategic robber placement and trades. After blocking RED's brick production, I'll work toward trading my sheep and wood for ore/wheat to build a development card, while saving up for expanding toward node 13 (ore) or node 9 (wheat). I'll maintain vigilance about RED's expansion and reconsider my options if they appear close to building another settlement.</plan>

2. Trade 4 🌲WOOD for 1 ⛏️ORE
3. Trade 4 🌲WOOD for 1 🐑SHEEP
4. Trade 4 🌲WOOD for 1 🌾WHEAT
5. End turn without making any trades

## Action Analysis

Option 0 (End Turn): 
This preserves my resources for future turns but doesn't advance my position now.

Option 1 (Trade for BRICK):
With brick, I could build a road, but I can't build a settlement yet as I'd still need wheat.

Option 2 (Trade for ORE):
Getting ore would diversify my resources but still wouldn't let me build anything immediately.

Option 3 (Trade for SHEEP):
I already have 2 sheep and good sheep production, so this doesn't make sense.

Option 4 (Trade for WHEAT):
Getting wheat would diversify my resources, but I still couldn't build anything immediately.

## Strategic Considerations

1. RED is at 4 VP and has the longest road. I need to accelerate my development.
2. I'm lacking brick, ore, and wheat for meaningful expansion.
3. Trading 4:1 is inefficient but sometimes necessary to diversify resources.
4. I have excessive wood that I can trade.

<plan>
Conserve resources this turn. The 4:1 trades are inefficient, and none of them would enable an immediate build. I'll wait until I have accumulated more resources to make a more efficient move like buying a development card (ore+wheat+sheep) or building roads and settlements when I have brick and wheat. In upcoming turns, I'll continue my focus on acquiring brick through robber placement and player trades, while also seeking wheat and ore.
</plan>

Since no 4:1 trade would allow me to complete a build this turn, and these trades are very inefficient, the best move is to end my turn and accumulate more resources on the next roll, especially since I have good production from my settlements.

PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}

5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL SETTLEMENT PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Place settlements on high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Target at least one spot with good ore and wheat production for city development
- Try to secure at least one high-probability spot (5, 6, 8, 9) for each critical resource
- Place your second settlement to complement your first (fill resource gaps)
- Aim for access to all five resources or position near useful ports if resource diversity isn't possible
- Always consider which settlements opponents are likely to place and avoid areas that will become contested
- Place roads pointing toward valuable future expansion spots, not toward the center
- Consider the long-term impact: settlements that can't expand are less valuable

MID-GAME RESOURCE PRIORITIES:
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each possible build (cities: 1VP for 5 resources is most efficient)
- Early phase: Secure at least one good source of brick and wood for minimal expansion
- Growth phase: Prioritize ore and wheat production for city upgrades (3VP for 5 resources is optimal)
- Late phase: Focus on the fastest path to victory points, whether through buildings or development cards
- Avoid trading resources that opponents need for immediate victory point gains
- Use 4:1 trades only when necessary; prioritize port usage when possible

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and limited expansion options
- If you get an early knight, save it for defense or until you can start building toward largest army
- Time monopoly card usage for when opponents likely have accumulated specific resources
- Save year of plenty cards for completing crucial builds when you're short 1-2 specific resources
- Development cards are most valuable when:
  * You need hidden victory points to surprise opponents
  * You need knights to break up longest road or secure largest army
  * You're lacking wood/brick for expansion but have plenty of sheep/wheat/ore

EXPANSION STRATEGY:
- Build roads only with clear settlement locations in mind
- Target settlements that give you access to ports or new resources
- Block opponents' expansion paths when it gives you a strategic advantage
- Consider the timing of expansion vs. city upgrades based on your resource production
- Calculate whether longest road is achievable and worth the resource investment
- When deciding between a new settlement and a city upgrade, compare immediate vs. long-term returns

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-probability hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Save knight cards for breaking up opponent strategies or securing largest army
- Use knights defensively if you're producing valuable resources on high-probability hexes

TRADING TACTICS:
- Avoid trading resources that directly help opponents score points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades
- Trade excess resources before rolling 7 if you have more than 7 cards
- Consider bank/port trades when they enable an immediate build that advances your strategy
- When trading with players, try to receive resources that complete a build

ENDGAME STRATEGY:
- In the late game, hide your victory point potential (keep development cards hidden)
- Calculate the fastest path to 10 VP and focus exclusively on that path
- Be aware of the exact number of remaining development cards and their probabilities
- Track opponents' potential victory points, including hidden development cards
- If you're close to winning, prioritize actions that can be completed in a single turn

Before finalizing your action, check:
1. Is there a more efficient path to victory points?
2. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?

# Game State Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state and my available options:

## My Current Position:
- Victory Points: 2/10 (2 settlements)
- Resources: 4 Wood, 2 Sheep, 1 Ore
- No development cards in hand

## Opponent's Position:
- RED has 4/10 VP (2 settlements + longest road)
- RED has 3 hidden resource cards
- RED has longest road with 5 segments

## My Available Actions:
0. End my turn
1-4. Trade 4 Wood for various resources (Brick, Ore, Sheep, or Wheat) at 4:1 ratio

## Strategy Analysis:

First, let's evaluate what I could build with my current resources:
- Cannot build settlements or cities (need brick and wheat)
- Cannot buy development cards (need wheat and more ore)
- Cannot build roads (need brick)

Looking at the 4:1 trade options:
- Trading for Brick would give me 1 Brick + 4 Wood, which still isn't enough for a road (need 1 Wood + 1 Brick)
- Trading for Ore would give me 2 Ore + 4 Wood, which doesn't complete any build
- Trading for Sheep would give me 3 Sheep + 4 Wood, which doesn't complete any build
- Trading for Wheat would give me 1 Wheat + 4 Wood, which doesn't complete any build

None of these trades enable an immediate build, and 4:1 trades are very inefficient. It's better to save my resources for future turns when I might be able to make more efficient trades or get the resources I need from dice rolls.

<plan>
Continue saving resources until I can make more efficient moves. Prioritize acquiring brick and wheat through future dice rolls or better trades. My next focus will be on:
1. Building roads toward valuable expansion spots when I get brick
2. Getting a settlement at a new production spot, ideally with wheat and brick
3. Working toward buying development cards when I have the right resource combination
</plan>

Since no trade currently leads to a significant advantage, and the 4:1 ratio is very inefficient, the best move is to end my turn and wait for better opportunities.

# Analyzing Robber Placement Options

Let me analyze the available options for placing the robber:

**Option 0:** Move robber to (0, 0, 0) [🐑8] and steal from RED
- This blocks a valuable 8 sheep hex
- Impacts: RED (one settlement) and both my settlements
- This would hurt my production significantly as both my settlements rely on sheep

**Option 1:** Move robber to (1, -1, 0) [🌲6] and steal from RED
- This blocks a valuable 6 wood hex
- Impacts: RED (one settlement) and one of my settlements
- This would hurt my wood production, which I need for expansion

**Option 2:** Move robber to (-1, 0, 1) [⛏️9]
- This blocks an ore hex with number 9
- Impacts: One of my settlements
- This would hurt my already limited ore production

**Option 3:** Move robber to (-1, 1, 0) [🏜️-]
- This is a desert - no resource production to block
- No impact on any player's production
- Desert placement is never optimal

**Option 4:** Move robber to (0, 1, -1) [🌾10] and steal from RED
- This blocks wheat with number 10
- Impacts: RED (one settlement)
- This would block RED's wheat production without affecting me

**Option 5:** Move robber to (1, 0, -1) [🧱3] and steal from RED
- This blocks brick with number 3
- Impacts: RED (two settlements)
- This would block RED's only source of brick

## Strategic Analysis

Looking at the game state:
- RED is ahead with 4 VP vs my 2 VP
- RED has longest road (+2 VP)
- I need brick for road building, which I currently don't have

Examining RED's production:
- RED has brick production at (1, 0, -1) with number 3
- Blocking this would limit RED's ability to extend roads further

My current situation:
- I need to slow RED down while improving my position
- I need brick for my own expansion
- I should avoid blocking my own valuable resources (sheep on 8 and wood on 6)

<plan>
1. Block RED's brick production to slow down their road building
2. Focus on acquiring brick through trades or dice rolls for my own expansion
3. Continue road building toward valuable expansion spots when I get brick
4. Work toward buying development cards with my sheep and ore
5. Consider breaking RED's longest road in future moves
</plan>

The best option is to place the robber on RED's brick hex and potentially steal a resource from them. This limits their ability to extend their road network further while not harming my own production.

Based on this analysis, I choose:

# Game State Analysis

I'll analyze the current game state and available options to determine the optimal action for this turn.

## Current Status
- I have 2 victory points (two settlements)
- RED has 4 victory points (two settlements + longest road)
- I have 3 🌲WOOD, 4 🐑SHEEP, 2 ⛏️ORE
- RED has longest road with 5 segments 
- I can't build anything immediately as I lack brick and wheat

## Resource Analysis
My settlements are producing:
- Good sheep (8) from both settlements
- Good wood (6) from settlement at node 2
- Mediocre ore (9) from settlement at node 4
- Poor wheat (4) from settlement at node 2
- No brick production at all

## Development Path Options
1. **Road Building**: I need brick to continue expanding
2. **Development Cards**: I need wheat + existing ore/sheep
3. **City Upgrades**: Not possible yet (need ore + wheat)

## Available Actions
My options are limited:
- End turn (0)
- Trade 4 sheep for another resource (1-4)

## Trading Decision
I have excess sheep (4) that I can trade for a needed resource. The question is which resource provides the most value:
- **Brick**: Would allow me to build 1 road with my existing wood
- **Wheat**: Would allow me to potentially buy a development card (with ore + sheep)
- **More Wood**: Not useful right now
- **More Ore**: Could save toward a city, but still need wheat

Looking at my current plan and board position:
- I need brick for expansion and have no production of it
- RED has brick production that I've blocked with the robber
- I have development card potential with my sheep and ore, but need wheat

<plan>
1. Trade for brick to continue expansion toward better resource spots
2. Build road toward potential settlement locations when I get more wood/brick
3. Look for wheat production in future expansion
4. Work toward buying development cards when I acquire wheat
5. Consider breaking RED's longest road if possible
</plan>

Given my current situation, trading for brick makes the most sense as it will let me build 1 road with my existing wood and continue my expansion efforts.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL SETTLEMENT PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Place settlements on high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Target at least one spot with good ore and wheat production for city development
- Try to secure at least one high-probability spot (5, 6, 8, 9) for each critical resource
- Place your second settlement to complement your first (fill resource gaps)
- Aim for access to all five resources or position near useful ports if resource diversity isn't possible
- Always consider which settlements opponents are likely to place and avoid areas that will become contested
- Place roads pointing toward valuable future expansion spots, not toward the center
- Consider the long-term impact: settlements that can't expand are less valuable

MID-GAME RESOURCE PRIORITIES:
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each possible build (cities: 1VP for 5 resources is most efficient)
- Early phase: Secure at least one good source of brick and wood for minimal expansion
- Growth phase: Prioritize ore and wheat production for city upgrades (3VP for 5 resources is optimal)
- Late phase: Focus on the fastest path to victory points, whether through buildings or development cards
- Avoid trading resources that opponents need for immediate victory point gains
- Use 4:1 trades only when necessary; prioritize port usage when possible

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and limited expansion options
- If you get an early knight, save it for defense or until you can start building toward largest army
- Time monopoly card usage for when opponents likely have accumulated specific resources
- Save year of plenty cards for completing crucial builds when you're short 1-2 specific resources
- Development cards are most valuable when:
  * You need hidden victory points to surprise opponents
  * You need knights to break up longest road or secure largest army
  * You're lacking wood/brick for expansion but have plenty of sheep/wheat/ore

EXPANSION STRATEGY:
- Build roads only with clear settlement locations in mind
- Target settlements that give you access to ports or new resources
- Block opponents' expansion paths when it gives you a strategic advantage
- Consider the timing of expansion vs. city upgrades based on your resource production
- Calculate whether longest road is achievable and worth the resource investment
- When deciding between a new settlement and a city upgrade, compare immediate vs. long-term returns

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-probability hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Save knight cards for breaking up opponent strategies or securing largest army
- Use knights defensively if you're producing valuable resources on high-probability hexes

TRADING TACTICS:
- Avoid trading resources that directly help opponents score points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades
- Trade excess resources before rolling 7 if you have more than 7 cards
- Consider bank/port trades when they enable an immediate build that advances your strategy
- When trading with players, try to receive resources that complete a build

ENDGAME STRATEGY:
- In the late game, hide your victory point potential (keep development cards hidden)
- Calculate the fastest path to 10 VP and focus exclusively on that path
- Be aware of the exact number of remaining development cards and their probabilities
- Track opponents' potential victory points, including hidden development cards
- If you're close to winning, prioritize actions that can be completed in a single turn

Before finalizing your action, check:
1. Is there a more efficient path to victory points?
2. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
3. Does this move help or hinder opponents?
4. Is there a defensive move needed to prevent an opponent from winning?
5. Are you properly diversified against dice probability?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game State Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state and my options carefully:

## Current Resources
- I have 3 Wood, 1 Brick, and 2 Ore
- This means I can build 1 road if I choose to do so

## Victory Points
- I have 2 VP (from 2 settlements)
- RED has 4 VP (2 settlements + 2 for longest road)
- I need to catch up and eventually reach 10 VP

## Production
- I have good sheep (8) and wood (6) production
- Also some ore (9) and wheat (4) production
- I'm lacking in brick production

## Position on Board
- I have settlements at nodes 2 and 4
- My roads are at (2,3), (3,2), (4,5), (5,4), (3,12), (12,3), (2,9), (9,2)
- I should consider where to expand for maximum benefit

## Available Actions
I can either build one of 7 possible roads or end my turn. Since I have resources to build a road, I should decide which one gives me the best strategic advantage.

## Road Options Analysis

Let me evaluate each road option:
1. Road at edge (9,10): Extends toward wheat hex, potentially allowing me to build a settlement that gets wheat
2. Road at edge (1,2): Redundant - I already have routes connecting these nodes
3. Road at edge (3,4): Redundant - I already have settlements at both nodes
4. Road at edge (12,13): Leads toward the ore hex (9) which I already produce
5. Road at edge (4,15): Leads toward the desert hex - less valuable
6. Road at edge (11,12): Leads toward wheat hex (4) - potentially valuable for resource diversity
7. Road at edge (8,9): Moves toward the wood (6) hex - I already have good wood production

The most strategic options seem to be:
- Option 1 (9,10): Expands toward wheat, which I need for settlements, cities, and development cards
- Option 6 (11,12): Also leads toward wheat and could potentially break RED's road network

Given that I need to improve my wheat production for future development, and considering my current position, the best choice is:

<plan>
1. Build road toward wheat hex to prepare for settlement that improves my wheat production
2. Continue gathering resources for settlements (particularly looking for brick)
3. Consider development card strategy once I have better wheat access
4. Evaluate opportunities to break RED's longest road
5. Long-term focus on city upgrades once I secure better resource diversity
</plan>

# Game Analysis for Robber Placement

I need to analyze where to move the robber to maximize my strategic position while hampering my opponent who is ahead of me by 2 victory points.

## Analyzing My Position
- I'm at 2 VP, while RED is at 4 VP (including 2 VP from longest road)
- I have limited resources: 2 wood, 2 sheep
- RED has 6 hidden resources
- RED has the longest road (5 segments), giving them a 2 VP advantage

## Robber Movement Options
Let me evaluate each hex:

**[0] Move to (0, 0, 0) - Sheep 8 hex**
- This is a high-value 8 hex producing sheep
- Both RED and I have settlements here
- This would block a ⭐⭐⭐ production hex for both players
- But I'm more dependent on sheep with two settlements producing it

**[1] Move to (1, -1, 0) - Wood 6 hex**
- This is a high-value 6 hex producing wood
- Both RED and I have settlements here
- This would block a ⭐⭐⭐ production hex for both of us
- But I need wood for expansion

**[2] Move to (-1, 0, 1) - Ore 9 hex**
- Only I have a settlement here (no impact to RED)
- This would block my ⭐⭐ ore production
- Not strategic since it only hurts me

**[3] Move to (-1, 1, 0) - Desert hex**
- Desert produces nothing
- Placing robber here is wasted

**[4] Move to (0, 1, -1) - Wheat 10 hex**
- RED has a settlement here
- It's a lower probability number (10)
- Would block RED's wheat production
- I have no wheat sources, so this doesn't hurt me

**[5] Move to (1, 0, -1) - Brick 3 hex**
- RED has two settlements here
- Low probability number (3)
- Would block RED's brick production
- According to my plan, I need brick for expansion

## Strategic Considerations
1. RED is ahead by 2 VP
2. I need to focus on expansion (wood/brick) or development cards (ore/wheat/sheep)
3. RED has 6 hidden resources which could enable significant moves

<plan>
1. Block RED's vital resources to slow their progress
2. Try to steal a resource I need for expansion
3. Prioritize getting brick to build my next settlement
4. Continue gathering resources for settlements to improve my wheat access
5. Consider blocking resources needed for RED's longest road strategy
</plan>

Looking at the options, I should target RED's resource production while also stealing a resource from them. Option [5] is best because:
- It blocks brick (3) hex which RED needs for expansion
- RED has two settlements on this hex
- I need brick for my expansion according to my plan
- It allows me to steal from RED

You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL SETTLEMENT PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Place settlements on high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Target at least one spot with good ore and wheat production for city development
- Try to secure at least one high-probability spot (5, 6, 8, 9) for each critical resource
- Place your second settlement to complement your first (fill resource gaps)
- Aim for access to all five resources or position near useful ports if resource diversity isn't possible
- Always consider which settlements opponents are likely to place and avoid areas that will become contested
- Place roads pointing toward valuable future expansion spots, not toward the center
- Consider the long-term impact: settlements that can't expand are less valuable

MID-GAME RESOURCE PRIORITIES:
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each possible build (cities: 1VP for 5 resources is most efficient)
- Early phase: Secure at least one good source of brick and wood for minimal expansion
- Growth phase: Prioritize ore and wheat production for city upgrades (3VP for 5 resources is optimal)
- Late phase: Focus on the fastest path to victory points, whether through buildings or development cards
- Avoid trading resources that opponents need for immediate victory point gains
- Use 4:1 trades only when necessary; prioritize port usage when possible

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and limited expansion options
- If you get an early knight, save it for defense or until you can start building toward largest army
- Time monopoly card usage for when opponents likely have accumulated specific resources
- Save year of plenty cards for completing crucial builds when you're short 1-2 specific resources
- Development cards are most valuable when:
  * You need hidden victory points to surprise opponents
  * You need knights to break up longest road or secure largest army
  * You're lacking wood/brick for expansion but have plenty of sheep/wheat/ore

EXPANSION STRATEGY:
- Build roads only with clear settlement locations in mind
- Target settlements that give you access to ports or new resources
- Block opponents' expansion paths when it gives you a strategic advantage
- Consider the timing of expansion vs. city upgrades based on your resource production
- Calculate whether longest road is achievable and worth the resource investment
- When deciding between a new settlement and a city upgrade, compare immediate vs. long-term returns

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-probability hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Save knight cards for breaking up opponent strategies or securing largest army
- Use knights defensively if you're producing valuable resources on high-probability hexes

TRADING TACTICS:
- Avoid trading resources that directly help opponents score points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades
- Trade excess resources before rolling 7 if you have more than 7 cards
- Consider bank/port trades when they enable an immediate build that advances your strategy
- When trading with players, try to receive resources that complete a build

ENDGAME STRATEGY:
- In the late game, hide your victory point potential (keep development cards hidden)
- Calculate the fastest path to 10 VP and focus exclusively on that path
- Be aware of the exact number of remaining development cards and their probabilities
- Track opponents' potential victory points, including hidden development cards
- If you're close to winning, prioritize actions that can be completed in a single turn

Before finalizing your action, check:
1. Is there a more efficient path to victory points?
2. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
3. Does this move help or hinder opponents?
4. Is there a defensive move needed to prevent an opponent from winning?
5. Are you properly diversified against dice probability?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

❓ Select action by number (0-5):


Based on this information, which action number do you choose? Think step by step about your options, then put the final action number in a box like \boxed{1}.
RESPONSE:
I need to analyze the optimal robber placement by evaluating each hex's impact on resource production and strategic implications.

First, let's review the game state:
- I have 2 VP while RED has 4 VP (including 2 VP from longest road)
- RED is ahead with longest road (6 segments)
- I have 2 wood and 3 sheep, but no brick, wheat or ore
- Current robber is on wheat hex (4), but moving it will optimize my strategy

Let me evaluate each robber move option:

[0] Move to (0,0,0) - Sheep(8) hex:
- Blocks a high-probability hex (8 = 5 dots)
- Affects both RED and BLUE (both produce from this hex)
- This would hurt my own production significantly (my settlement at node 2 & 4 both produce from this)
- Not strategically sound since I'd be hurting myself as much as RED

[1] Move to (1,-1,0) - Wood(6) hex:
- Blocks another high-probability hex (6 = 5 dots)
- Affects both RED and BLUE (RED at node 6, BLUE at node 2)
- This would hurt my production of wood, which I need for expansion
- Not optimal as I'd harm my own wood production

[2] Move to (-1,0,1) - Ore(9) hex:
- Blocks a good probability hex (9 = 4 dots)
- Only affects BLUE (node 4)
- This would block my own ore production, which is counter-productive
- Definitely not a good option as I'm only hurting myself

[3] Move to (-1,1,0) - Desert hex:
- Desert produces nothing
- Placing robber here has no impact on production
- Completely wasting the robber placement
- Not a strategic choice

[4] Move to (0,1,-1) - Wheat(10) hex:
- Blocks a moderate probability hex (10 = 3 dots)
- Affects only RED (node 0)
- I can steal a resource from RED
- This targets a resource RED needs for development cards and cities

[5] Move to (1,0,-1) - Brick(3) hex:
- Blocks a low probability hex (3 = 2 dots)
- Affects RED (nodes 0 and 6)
- I can steal a resource from RED
- This targets brick which RED needs for road building to maintain longest road

Strategic considerations:
- RED has longest road and is at 4 VP, so slowing their road expansion is important
- RED has settlements at nodes 0 and 6, which both produce brick from hex (1,0,-1)
- Blocking RED's brick production would directly interfere with their road-building strategy
- With only 2 cards in RED's hand, there's a fair chance one is a brick

<plan>
1. Block RED's brick production to slow their road expansion
2. Attempt to steal a needed resource (hopefully brick)
3. Focus on getting brick myself to build roads and settlements
4. Target my next settlement to improve wheat production
5. Work towards breaking RED's longest road advantage
</plan>

Given RED's lead with longest road and their advantage in victory points, option 5 is the most strategic choice as it limits RED's ability to extend their road network while potentially giving me a resource I need.

❓ Select action by number (0-5):


Based on this information, which action number do you choose? Think step by step about your options, then put the final action number in a box like \boxed{1}.
RESPONSE:
I'll analyze this game state and determine the optimal move for the robber placement.

First, let's assess the game state:
- I have 2 VP, RED has 4 VP (including 2 VP for longest road)
- RED currently has the advantage with longest road (6 segments)
- I have 2 wood, 2 sheep, 1 ore, but need brick to continue expanding
- The robber is currently on wheat (4) at (0, -1, 1)

Let's analyze each robber placement option:

[0] Move robber to (0, 0, 0) - Sheep (8):
This is RED and my best production hex (8 is high probability). Blocking this would hurt me significantly as I have settlements at nodes 2 and 4 that produce from this hex. Bad move.

[1] Move robber to (1, -1, 0) - Wood (6):
This would block wood production for both RED and me. Since I already have 2 wood and need other resources more, this isn't optimal.

[2] Move robber to (-1, 0, 1) - Ore (9):
This would block my ore production at node 4. Since I need ore for cities and development cards, I shouldn't block my own resource.

[3] Move robber to (-1, 1, 0) - Desert:
This is a desert hex and has no production to block. This would be wasting the robber move.

[4] Move robber to (0, 1, -1) - Wheat (10):
This would block RED's wheat production. Since wheat is crucial for settlements, cities, and development cards, this could slow RED down.

[5] Move robber to (1, 0, -1) - Brick (3):
This is RED's only source of brick (nodes 0 and 6), and brick is critical for road building. Blocking this would directly impede RED's ability to extend their longest road advantage. Additionally, I could potentially steal a brick card, which I need myself.

<plan>
1. Block RED's brick production to slow their road expansion
2. Try to steal brick from RED if possible
3. Focus on acquiring brick myself to build roads and settlements
4. Target breaking RED's longest road advantage
5. Work toward my next settlement to improve resource production
</plan>

Option 5 is clearly the best choice as it:
1. Blocks RED's only brick source, hampering their road expansion
2. Gives me a chance to steal brick which I critically need
3. Directly addresses RED's current advantage (longest road)
4. Aligns with my strategic plan to slow RED while building my own position

# Game Analysis for Settlers of Catan

I'll analyze my current position and available actions to determine the optimal move.

## Current Game State Assessment
- **My position (BLUE)**: 2 VP, 2 settlements, 4-segment road
- **RED position**: 4 VP (2 from settlements + 2 from longest road), 6-segment road
- **My resources**: 2 Wood, 3 Sheep, 1 Wheat, 1 Ore
- **Available actions**:
  1. Buy a development card
  2. End turn

## Resource Analysis
My current resources allow me to buy a development card (1 Sheep + 1 Wheat + 1 Ore). After purchase, I would still have 2 Wood and 2 Sheep remaining.

## Strategic Considerations

Development cards offer several potential benefits:
1. 1/5 chance for a Victory Point card (immediate hidden VP)
2. Knight cards (3/5 chance) could:
   - Move the robber from the brick hex
   - Help toward Largest Army (2 VP bonus)
3. Road Building/Year of Plenty/Monopoly (1/5 chance) could accelerate my strategy

My current plan focuses on blocking RED's brick and expanding my own road network. However, I've already played my Road Building card, so I need new ways to catch up to RED's road advantage.

## Decision Analysis

**Option 1: Buy Development Card**
- PROS:
  - Could get a VP card (20% chance)
  - Knight cards help remove the robber from the brick hex (60% chance)
  - Progress cards provide utility (20% chance)
  - Keeps resources hidden from opponents
  - Maintains flexibility for future turns
- CONS:
  - Uses my only Ore and Wheat resources
  - No immediate visible progress on the board

**Option 0: End Turn**
- PROS:
  - Preserve resources for future builds
- CONS:
  - No progress toward victory
  - RED continues to lead by 2 VP
  - No chance to address the robber on the brick hex

## Plan Adjustment

<plan>
1. Buy development card to potentially get a knight or VP
2. Use knight (if obtained) to move robber off brick hex
3. Focus on extending my road network with my remaining wood
4. Work toward breaking RED's longest road advantage
5. Continue expansion toward new settlement locations
</plan>

## Final Decision
Buying a development card is my best move. It offers a path toward addressing the robber situation and potentially gaining a hidden VP or knight. The card could be crucial for my comeback strategy against RED.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL SETTLEMENT PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Place settlements on high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Target at least one spot with good ore and wheat production for city development
- Try to secure at least one high-probability spot (5, 6, 8, 9) for each critical resource
- Place your second settlement to complement your first (fill resource gaps)
- Aim for access to all five resources or position near useful ports if resource diversity isn't possible
- Always consider which settlements opponents are likely to place and avoid areas that will become contested
- Place roads pointing toward valuable future expansion spots, not toward the center
- Consider the long-term impact: settlements that can't expand are less valuable

MID-GAME RESOURCE PRIORITIES:
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each possible build (cities: 1VP for 5 resources is most efficient)
- Early phase: Secure at least one good source of brick and wood for minimal expansion
- Growth phase: Prioritize ore and wheat production for city upgrades (3VP for 5 resources is optimal)
- Late phase: Focus on the fastest path to victory points, whether through buildings or development cards
- Avoid trading resources that opponents need for immediate victory point gains
- Use 4:1 trades only when necessary; prioritize port usage when possible

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and limited expansion options
- If you get an early knight, save it for defense or until you can start building toward largest army
- Time monopoly card usage for when opponents likely have accumulated specific resources
- Save year of plenty cards for completing crucial builds when you're short 1-2 specific resources
- Development cards are most valuable when:
  * You need hidden victory points to surprise opponents
  * You need knights to break up longest road or secure largest army
  * You're lacking wood/brick for expansion but have plenty of sheep/wheat/ore

EXPANSION STRATEGY:
- Build roads only with clear settlement locations in mind
- Target settlements that give you access to ports or new resources
- Block opponents' expansion paths when it gives you a strategic advantage
- Consider the timing of expansion vs. city upgrades based on your resource production
- Calculate whether longest road is achievable and worth the resource investment
- When deciding between a new settlement and a city upgrade, compare immediate vs. long-term returns

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-probability hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Save knight cards for breaking up opponent strategies or securing largest army
- Use knights defensively if you're producing valuable resources on high-probability hexes

TRADING TACTICS:
- Avoid trading resources that directly help opponents score points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades
- Trade excess resources before rolling 7 if you have more than 7 cards
- Consider bank/port trades when they enable an immediate build that advances your strategy
- When trading with players, try to receive resources that complete a build

ENDGAME STRATEGY:
- In the late game, hide your victory point potential (keep development cards hidden)
- Calculate the fastest path to 10 VP and focus exclusively on that path
- Be aware of the exact number of remaining development cards and their probabilities
- Track opponents' potential victory points, including hidden development cards
- If you're close to winning, prioritize actions that can be completed in a single turn

Before finalizing your action, check:
1. Is there a more efficient path to victory points?
2. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
3. Does this move help or hinder opponents?
4. Is there a defensive move needed to prevent an opponent from winning?
5. Are you properly diversified against dice probability?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Analysis of Game State

Let me assess the current situation:

- I have 2 victory points (2 settlements)
- RED has 4 victory points (2 settlements + 2 for longest road)
- I own 1 KNIGHT development card
- My resources: 1 WOOD, 2 SHEEP (limited resources)
- I'm at the start of my turn with the option to either play a Knight or roll the dice

## Knight Card Considerations
- Playing the Knight would:
  - Allow me to move the robber from wheat (currently on 4)
  - Let me steal a resource from RED
  - Start building toward Largest Army (need 3 knights)
  - Protect me from potential resource loss if I roll a 7 (though I only have 3 cards)

## Roll Considerations
- Rolling gives me a chance to collect resources based on my current production:
  - Strong production on 8 (sheep) - two settlements
  - Strong production on 6 (wood) - one settlement
  - Some production on 9 (ore) and 4 (wheat)
- I have very limited resources now (just 1 wood, 2 sheep)
- I need more resources to build

## Strategic Direction
My current plan mentions buying a development card and using a knight if obtained. I already have a knight, and playing it now:
1. Would remove the robber from a wheat hex (4) where I have a settlement
2. Would let me steal a resource from RED
3. Would be the first step toward largest army (long-term goal)

<plan>
1. Roll the dice to collect more resources
2. Use the knight strategically when:
   - I need to protect high-value hexes from the robber
   - I need to steal a specific resource for an immediate build
   - I want to counter RED's longest road advantage by building toward largest army
3. Focus on expanding my settlement network to increase production
4. Work toward breaking RED's longest road or building toward largest army
</plan>

Since I have very few resources (only 3 cards total), the most beneficial action now is to roll the dice to collect more resources. The knight card will be more valuable later when I can plan what resource to target or protect a more productive hex.

# Game Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state and available options:

## Current Game Status
- I have 2/10 VP vs RED's 4/10 (RED has Longest Road bonus +2 VP)
- I have 1 WOOD and 4 SHEEP resources
- I have 1 KNIGHT development card
- The robber is currently on the wheat hex (0,-1,1) with value 4
- RED has 3 hidden resource cards

## Available Actions
- [0] Play Knight card - Move the robber and steal a resource
- [1] End turn
- [2-5] Various 4:1 port trades using my SHEEP

## Strategic Considerations

1. **Resource Analysis**: 
   - I have 4 SHEEP and 1 WOOD
   - I need BRICK to build more roads
   - I need ORE and WHEAT for city upgrades or development cards

2. **Opponent Position**:
   - RED has longest road with 6 segments (giving +2 VP)
   - RED has 4 VP total, so they're closer to winning

3. **Knight Card Value**:
   - Playing the knight would:
     - Let me move the robber to block RED's production
     - Allow me to steal a resource from RED
     - Count toward largest army (I'd have 1 knight played)

4. **Trade Value**:
   - 4:1 trades are extremely inefficient
   - I don't have immediate building plans that a single resource would enable

Looking at my current plan, I mentioned using knights strategically to counter RED's longest road by building toward largest army. Playing the knight now would be the first step toward that goal. It would also disrupt RED's production and potentially give me a valuable resource.

If I end my turn, I'll waste this opportunity to both block a resource hex that RED is using and steal a resource. The 4:1 trades are too inefficient when I have no immediate building plan.

<plan>
1. Play my knight card to move the robber to one of RED's productive hexes
2. Target either the 8-value sheep or 6-value wood hex to disrupt RED's production
3. Continue working toward largest army by buying development cards when possible
4. Use stolen resources to build toward breaking RED's longest road
5. Prioritize development cards and city upgrades with any ore/wheat I receive
</plan>

The optimal move is to play my knight card to disrupt RED's production and potentially steal a valuable resource, while also making progress toward largest army.

- Consider bank/port trades when they enable an immediate build that advances your strategy
- When trading with players, try to receive resources that complete a build

ENDGAME STRATEGY:
- In the late game, hide your victory point potential (keep development cards hidden)
- Calculate the fastest path to 10 VP and focus exclusively on that path
- Be aware of the exact number of remaining development cards and their probabilities
- Track opponents' potential victory points, including hidden development cards
- If you're close to winning, prioritize actions that can be completed in a single turn

Before finalizing your action, check:
1. Is there a more efficient path to victory points?
2. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
3. Does this move help or hinder opponents?
4. Is there a defensive move needed to prevent an opponent from winning?
5. Are you properly diversified against dice probability?

# Game Analysis for Robber Movement

I'll analyze the best location to move the robber based on the game state, focusing on maximizing my strategic advantage while disrupting RED's progress.

## Evaluating the Options

Let me analyze each potential robber location:

**[0] Move robber to (0, 0, 0) and steal from RED:**
- This is the 8-value sheep hex
- Currently producing for:
  * RED's settlement at node 0 (🐑8)
  * BLUE's settlements at nodes 2 and 4 (both produce 🐑8)
- This would block my own high-production sheep resource (2 settlements!)
- Not optimal as it hurts me more than RED

**[1] Move robber to (1, -1, 0) and steal from RED:**
- This is the 6-value wood hex
- Currently producing for:
  * RED's settlement at node 6 (🌲6)
  * BLUE's settlement at node 2 (🌲6)
- This would block my own wood production, but only from one settlement
- Would block RED's wood production and allow me to steal from RED

**[2] Move robber to (-1, 0, 1):**
- This is the 9-value ore hex
- Currently producing for only BLUE's settlement at node 4 (⛏️9)
- No reason to block my own production with no benefit

**[3] Move robber to (-1, 1, 0):**
- This is a desert tile (no production)
- Placing the robber here is wasteful as it blocks nothing

**[4] Move robber to (0, 1, -1) and steal from RED:**
- This is the 10-value wheat hex
- Currently producing for RED's settlement at node 0 (🌾10)
- Would block RED's wheat production and allow me to steal from RED
- Does not impact my own production

**[5] Move robber to (1, 0, -1) and steal from RED:**
- This is the 3-value brick hex
- Currently producing for:
  * RED's settlements at nodes 0 and 6 (both produce 🧱3)
- Would block RED's only brick production and allow me to steal from RED
- Does not impact my own production
- Brick is important for road building, and RED has the longest road advantage

## Strategic Considerations

1. RED has longest road (6 segments) and is at 4/10 VP, making them a threat
2. I need to disrupt RED's ability to further extend their road network
3. RED has 3 hidden cards that I could potentially steal
4. Blocking brick production would impair RED's ability to build more roads

Looking at my current plan, I want to:
- Disrupt RED's production
- Steal useful resources
- Work toward breaking RED's longest road advantage

## Decision

The best choice is **[5] Move robber to (1, 0, -1) and steal from RED** because:
- It blocks RED's only brick production completely (2 settlements affected)
- Brick is critical for RED to extend their longest road advantage
- It doesn't harm my own production
- I get to steal a card from RED, potentially getting a brick I can use myself
- This aligns perfectly with my strategy to break RED's longest road

<plan>
1. Move the robber to RED's brick hex (1, 0, -1) to block their only brick source
2. Steal a resource from RED, hoping for brick or other useful resources
3. Continue working toward largest army by buying development cards when possible
4. Use stolen resources and future production to build my road network strategically
5. Focus on breaking RED's longest road while working toward city upgrades
</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL SETTLEMENT PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Place settlements on high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Target at least one spot with good ore and wheat production for city development
- Try to secure at least one high-probability spot (5, 6, 8, 9) for each critical resource
- Place your second settlement to complement your first (fill resource gaps)
- Aim for access to all five resources or position near useful ports if resource diversity isn't possible
- Always consider which settlements opponents are likely to place and avoid areas that will become contested
- Place roads pointing toward valuable future expansion spots, not toward the center
- Consider the long-term impact: settlements that can't expand are less valuable

MID-GAME RESOURCE PRIORITIES:
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each possible build (cities: 1VP for 5 resources is most efficient)
- Early phase: Secure at least one good source of brick and wood for minimal expansion
- Growth phase: Prioritize ore and wheat production for city upgrades (3VP for 5 resources is optimal)
- Late phase: Focus on the fastest path to victory points, whether through buildings or development cards
- Avoid trading resources that opponents need for immediate victory point gains
- Use 4:1 trades only when necessary; prioritize port usage when possible

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and limited expansion options
- If you get an early knight, save it for defense or until you can start building toward largest army
- Time monopoly card usage for when opponents likely have accumulated specific resources
- Save year of plenty cards for completing crucial builds when you're short 1-2 specific resources
- Development cards are most valuable when:
  * You need hidden victory points to surprise opponents
  * You need knights to break up longest road or secure largest army
  * You're lacking wood/brick for expansion but have plenty of sheep/wheat/ore

EXPANSION STRATEGY:
- Build roads only with clear settlement locations in mind
- Target settlements that give you access to ports or new resources
- Block opponents' expansion paths when it gives you a strategic advantage
- Consider the timing of expansion vs. city upgrades based on your resource production
- Calculate whether longest road is achievable and worth the resource investment
- When deciding between a new settlement and a city upgrade, compare immediate vs. long-term returns

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-probability hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Save knight cards for breaking up opponent strategies or securing largest army
- Use knights defensively if you're producing valuable resources on high-probability hexes

TRADING TACTICS:
- Avoid trading resources that directly help opponents score points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades
- Trade excess resources before rolling 7 if you have more than 7 cards
- Consider bank/port trades when they enable an immediate build that advances your strategy
- When trading with players, try to receive resources that complete a build

ENDGAME STRATEGY:
- In the late game, hide your victory point potential (keep development cards hidden)
- Calculate the fastest path to 10 VP and focus exclusively on that path
- Be aware of the exact number of remaining development cards and their probabilities
- Track opponents' potential victory points, including hidden development cards
- If you're close to winning, prioritize actions that can be completed in a single turn

1. Is there a more efficient path to victory points?
2. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
3. Does this move help or hinder opponents?
4. Is there a defensive move needed to prevent an opponent from winning?
5. Are you properly diversified against dice probability?

# Analyzing Game State and Options

Let me analyze the current state thoroughly to determine my best move:

## Current Situation
- I have 2 VP (from my 2 settlements)
- RED has 4 VP (2 settlements + longest road bonus)
- I have 1 wood and 5 sheep
- Robber is on RED's brick hex (1, 0, -1)
- RED has longest road (6 segments)
- I need to reach 10 VP to win

## Production Assessment
My settlements are at:
- Node 2: producing sheep (8), wood (6), and wheat (4)
- Node 4: producing sheep (8) and ore (9)

I'm well positioned for sheep (excellent production on 8), decent with wood (6), and have some ore (9) and wheat (4) production.

## Available Actions
I only have trading options available - no building options since I need brick for roads/settlements and ore+wheat for cities/development cards:
- [0] End turn
- [1-4] Maritime trade: Give 4 sheep for wood, brick, ore, or wheat

## Strategic Considerations

The current plan aims to:
1. Block RED's brick (already done)
2. Work toward largest army
3. Build roads strategically
4. Break RED's longest road

To execute this plan, I need resources beyond sheep. Most pressing needs:
- Brick for road building and settlements
- Ore + wheat for development cards (to work toward largest army)

Let's evaluate each trade option:
1. Trade for wood: I already have 1 wood
2. Trade for brick: Critical for road building and settlements
3. Trade for ore: Needed for development cards and cities
4. Trade for wheat: Needed for development cards and settlements

Given my 5 sheep, I can make one trade at the standard 4:1 rate.

## Decision Logic

Since my plan involves road building (to break RED's longest road) and buying development cards, I need brick most urgently. Without brick, I cannot build roads or settlements, which limits my expansion and ability to contest longest road.

Trading 4 sheep for 1 brick would give me 1 wood and 1 brick, preparing me for:
- Building a road on my next turn
- Setting up for future settlements
- Working toward breaking RED's longest road

<plan>
1. Trade 4 sheep for 1 brick
2. Next turn, build a road strategically toward breaking RED's longest road
3. Continue saving resources for development cards to work toward largest army
4. Target future settlements at locations that complement my resource production
5. Maintain pressure on RED's brick supply with the robber

❓ Select action by number (0-7):


Based on this information, which action number do you choose? Think step by step about your options, then put the final action number in a box like \boxed{1}.
RESPONSE:
I'll analyze the current game state and determine the optimal action.

## Current Game State Analysis
- I have 2 VP from my 2 settlements
- RED has 4 VP (2 from settlements + 2 from longest road)
- I have 1 wood, 1 brick, and 1 sheep
- RED has longest road with 6 segments
- My settlement at node 2 produces sheep (8), wood (6), and wheat (4)
- My settlement at node 4 produces sheep (8) and ore (9)
- I have good sheep production but limited wood/brick for expansion

## Available Options
I can either:
1. Build a road using my 1 wood + 1 brick
2. End my turn and save resources

## Road Building Analysis
If I build a road, I should choose the location that:
- Extends toward potential new settlement spots
- Blocks RED's expansion
- Potentially helps me break RED's longest road

Looking at my road options:
- Edge (1, 2): Doesn't seem to lead to valuable expansion
- Edge (10, 11): Not clear where this leads
- Edge (3, 4): Connects existing nodes but doesn't extend my reach
- Edge (12, 13): Might lead toward unexplored territory
- Edge (4, 15): Extends from my settlement at node 4
- Edge (11, 12): Not clear where this leads
- Edge (8, 9): Not clear where this leads

Without seeing a full map, I don't have perfect information about which road would provide the best strategic advantage. However, building a road at edge (4, 15) seems promising as it extends from my settlement at node 4, which could lead to new expansion opportunities.

## Strategic Consideration
Looking at resources, I have exactly enough for one road. Since roads are crucial for expansion and potentially breaking RED's longest road, building now makes sense rather than risking resource loss if a 7 is rolled.

<plan>
1. Build road at edge (4, 15) to extend from my settlement at node 4
2. Focus on gathering resources for development cards and/or settlements
3. Work toward breaking RED's longest road when possible
4. Target settlements that give me better wheat or brick production
5. Continue saving for development cards to work toward largest army
</plan>

Based on this analysis, I'll build a road at edge (4, 15).

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL SETTLEMENT PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Place settlements on high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Target at least one spot with good ore and wheat production for city development
- Try to secure at least one high-probability spot (5, 6, 8, 9) for each critical resource
- Place your second settlement to complement your first (fill resource gaps)
- Aim for access to all five resources or position near useful ports if resource diversity isn't possible
- Always consider which settlements opponents are likely to place and avoid areas that will become contested
- Place roads pointing toward valuable future expansion spots, not toward the center
- Consider the long-term impact: settlements that can't expand are less valuable

MID-GAME RESOURCE PRIORITIES:
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each possible build (cities: 1VP for 5 resources is most efficient)
- Early phase: Secure at least one good source of brick and wood for minimal expansion
- Growth phase: Prioritize ore and wheat production for city upgrades (3VP for 5 resources is optimal)
- Late phase: Focus on the fastest path to victory points, whether through buildings or development cards
- Avoid trading resources that opponents need for immediate victory point gains
- Use 4:1 trades only when necessary; prioritize port usage when possible

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and limited expansion options
- If you get an early knight, save it for defense or until you can start building toward largest army
- Time monopoly card usage for when opponents likely have accumulated specific resources
- Save year of plenty cards for completing crucial builds when you're short 1-2 specific resources
- Development cards are most valuable when:
  * You need hidden victory points to surprise opponents
  * You need knights to break up longest road or secure largest army
  * You're lacking wood/brick for expansion but have plenty of sheep/wheat/ore

EXPANSION STRATEGY:
- Build roads only with clear settlement locations in mind
- Target settlements that give you access to ports or new resources
- Block opponents' expansion paths when it gives you a strategic advantage
- Consider the timing of expansion vs. city upgrades based on your resource production
- Calculate whether longest road is achievable and worth the resource investment
- When deciding between a new settlement and a city upgrade, compare immediate vs. long-term returns

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-probability hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Save knight cards for breaking up opponent strategies or securing largest army
- Use knights defensively if you're producing valuable resources on high-probability hexes

TRADING TACTICS:
- Avoid trading resources that directly help opponents score points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades
- Trade excess resources before rolling 7 if you have more than 7 cards
- Consider bank/port trades when they enable an immediate build that advances your strategy
- When trading with players, try to receive resources that complete a build

ENDGAME STRATEGY:
- In the late game, hide your victory point potential (keep development cards hidden)
- Calculate the fastest path to 10 VP and focus exclusively on that path
- Be aware of the exact number of remaining development cards and their probabilities
- Track opponents' potential victory points, including hidden development cards
- If you're close to winning, prioritize actions that can be completed in a single turn

Before finalizing your action, check:
1. Is there a more efficient path to victory points?
2. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
3. Does this move help or hinder opponents?
4. Is there a defensive move needed to prevent an opponent from winning?
5. Are you properly diversified against dice probability?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Robber Placement Analysis

Let me analyze each potential robber placement option to determine the optimal move:

## Option Analysis

**[0] Move robber to (0, 0, 0) and steal from RED**
- This is the sheep (8) hex
- Affects: RED's settlement at node 0 and BLUE's settlements at nodes 2 and 4
- Blocks one of my own high-probability resources (sheep 8, rated ⭐⭐⭐)
- Would disable my own strongest production tile
- I currently have 3 sheep so I don't need immediate sheep production

**[1] Move robber to (1, -1, 0) and steal from RED**
- This is the wood (6) hex
- Affects: RED's settlement at node 6 and BLUE's settlement at node 2
- Would block a high-probability resource (⭐⭐⭐) that both I and RED rely on
- I already have 3 wood resources, so blocking this is acceptable for me temporarily
- This would significantly hurt RED's wood production

**[2] Move robber to (0, -1, 1)**
- This is the wheat (4) hex
- Only affects BLUE's settlement at node 2
- Low impact on the game as it's a less productive hex (⭐)
- Placing the robber here would be ineffective as it only hurts myself

**[3] Move robber to (-1, 0, 1)**
- This is the ore (9) hex
- Affects BLUE's settlement at node 4
- Would block my only ore production (⭐⭐)
- Not strategic as I currently need ore for development cards and cities

**[4] Move robber to (-1, 1, 0)**
- This is the desert hex
- Doesn't block any resource production
- Completely ineffective move - wastes the robber action

**[5] Move robber to (0, 1, -1) and steal from RED**
- This is the wheat (10) hex
- Affects RED's settlement at node 0
- Blocks a low-probability resource (⭐) for RED
- Allows me to steal from RED

## Strategic Considerations

1. RED is ahead with 4 victory points (including longest road) vs my 2 points
2. RED's resource holdings are unknown (3 cards)
3. I should prioritize slowing RED's progress while maintaining my own development
4. I should target resources that RED needs for expansion but that I already have enough of

## Decision

Option [1] is optimal because:
- It blocks RED's access to wood (6), a high-probability resource needed for expansion
- I already have 3 wood resources, so I can afford to block this temporarily
- It allows me to steal a resource from RED, potentially disrupting their next build
- It targets a resource critical for road-building, which could slow RED's expansion of longest road

<plan>
1. Move robber to wood hex to disrupt RED's development and steal a resource
2. Build road at edge (4, 15) to extend from my settlement at node 4
3. Work toward breaking RED's longest road when possible
4. Save resources for development cards to work toward largest army
5. Target settlements that give me better wheat or ore production

❓ Select action by number (0-4):


Based on this information, which action number do you choose? Think step by step about your options, then put the final action number in a box like \boxed{1}.
RESPONSE:
I'll analyze the current game state and options to determine the optimal move.

## Game Analysis

1. **Victory Points**:
   - I have: 2 VP (from 2 settlements)
   - RED has: 4 VP (2 settlements + 2 VP for longest road)

2. **Resources**:
   - I have: 3 wood, 4 sheep, 1 ore
   - These resources are insufficient for any direct building (settlement needs brick+wood+sheep+wheat; city needs 3 ore + 2 wheat; development card needs sheep+wheat+ore)

3. **Board Position**:
   - RED has longest road (6 segments)
   - The robber is currently on the wood hex (1,-1,0) which produces on a 6 (high probability)
   - I have settlements at nodes 2 and 4, with good sheep production (8) at both

## Available Actions Assessment

Looking at my options (0-4), I only have trading options or ending my turn:
- [0] End turn (no building possible with current resources)
- [1-4] Maritime trades giving away 4 sheep for 1 of another resource

Since I have 4 sheep, I could make one maritime trade, but is it worth it?

## Strategic Considerations

Currently, I can't build anything meaningful just by trading sheep:
- Settlement: Would need brick+wheat (missing both)
- Road: Would need brick (missing)
- City: Would need 2 more ore + 2 wheat
- Development card: Would need wheat (missing)

If I trade 4 sheep for 1 brick [2], I'd have: 3 wood, 0 sheep, 1 ore, 1 brick
- Still couldn't build anything immediately
- But brick is hard to get for me (I don't produce any)

If I trade 4 sheep for 1 wheat [4], I'd have: 3 wood, 0 sheep, 1 ore, 1 wheat
- Still couldn't build anything immediately
- But wheat would move me closer to development cards

Looking at my current plan and resource production capabilities, I need to focus on resources I don't produce. My settlements produce wood (6), sheep (8), and ore (9), but I lack brick and wheat production.

<plan>
1. End turn to maintain resource flexibility
2. Work toward acquiring brick through trades to build roads and expand
3. Target wheat production for development cards and cities
4. Continue building toward breaking RED's longest road
5. Save resources for strategic builds when better opportunities arise
</plan>

Since I can't build anything meaningful this turn even with trading, and trading at a 4:1 ratio is inefficient, the best option is to end my turn and maintain flexibility for better opportunities next turn.

# Analysis of Robber Placement Options

I need to decide where to place the robber strategically to maximize my chances of winning. Let me analyze each option carefully.

## Current Game State Assessment
- I (BLUE) have 2 VP, while RED has 5 VP (including 2 VP from longest road)
- RED is halfway to victory, so disrupting their progress is important
- I have 2 wood and 2 sheep, which isn't enough for any builds yet
- The robber is currently on wheat (0, -1, 1) with a dice value of 4

## Robber Placement Options Analysis

**[0] Move robber to (0, 0, 0) and steal from RED**
- This is the sheep hex with an 8 value (high probability)
- This would block both my settlements (nodes 2 and 4)
- This would also block RED's settlement at node 0
- This is a terrible move as it hurts me more than RED (blocks two of my settlements vs one of RED's)

**[1] Move robber to (1, -1, 0) and steal from RED**
- This is the wood hex with a 6 value (high probability)
- This would block my settlement at node 2 and RED's settlement at node 6
- This hurts both of us equally, but I already have 2 wood, so it's not optimal

**[2] Move robber to (-1, 0, 1)**
- This is the ore hex with a 9 value (medium-high probability)
- Only affects my settlement at node 4
- I would not get to steal from RED
- This would hurt my own development without affecting RED

**[3] Move robber to (-1, 1, 0) and steal from RED**
- This is the desert hex with no value
- Doesn't affect resource production
- I get to steal from RED but waste the blocking opportunity
- Generally inefficient move

**[4] Move robber to (0, 1, -1) and steal from RED**
- This is the wheat hex with a 10 value
- Blocks RED's settlements at nodes 0 and 16
- I get to steal from RED
- This disrupts RED's wheat production on a decent probability hex

**[5] Move robber to (1, 0, -1) and steal from RED**
- This is the brick hex with a 3 value (low probability)
- Blocks RED's settlements at nodes 0 and 6
- I get to steal from RED
- Brick is crucial for road building, which RED needs to maintain longest road advantage
- Even though it's a low probability hex, blocking RED's only brick sources could significantly slow them down

## Strategic Considerations
1. RED is ahead with 5 VP vs my 2 VP
2. RED has longest road, requiring brick to maintain/extend
3. RED has more settlements and could be preparing to build cities
4. I need to disrupt RED's progress while maintaining my own development path

<plan>
1. Disrupt RED's brick supply by placing robber on their brick hex
2. Use trades to acquire brick myself and work toward breaking RED's longest road
3. Continue developing my settlement at node 4 with high-probability ore production
4. Look for opportunities to build development cards to contest largest army
5. Save resources for strategic builds when I have enough resources
</plan>

Based on this analysis, I'll place the robber on RED's brick hex. Even though it's a low probability (3), it's RED's only source of brick, which they need to maintain their longest road advantage. Additionally, I'll get to steal a resource from RED.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL SETTLEMENT PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Place settlements on high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Target at least one spot with good ore and wheat production for city development
- Try to secure at least one high-probability spot (5, 6, 8, 9) for each critical resource
- Place your second settlement to complement your first (fill resource gaps)
- Aim for access to all five resources or position near useful ports if resource diversity isn't possible
- Always consider which settlements opponents are likely to place and avoid areas that will become contested
- Place roads pointing toward valuable future expansion spots, not toward the center
- Consider the long-term impact: settlements that can't expand are less valuable

MID-GAME RESOURCE PRIORITIES:
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each possible build (cities: 1VP for 5 resources is most efficient)
- Early phase: Secure at least one good source of brick and wood for minimal expansion
- Growth phase: Prioritize ore and wheat production for city upgrades (3VP for 5 resources is optimal)
- Late phase: Focus on the fastest path to victory points, whether through buildings or development cards
- Avoid trading resources that opponents need for immediate victory point gains
- Use 4:1 trades only when necessary; prioritize port usage when possible

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and limited expansion options
- If you get an early knight, save it for defense or until you can start building toward largest army
- Time monopoly card usage for when opponents likely have accumulated specific resources
- Save year of plenty cards for completing crucial builds when you're short 1-2 specific resources
- Development cards are most valuable when:
  * You need hidden victory points to surprise opponents
  * You need knights to break up longest road or secure largest army
  * You're lacking wood/brick for expansion but have plenty of sheep/wheat/ore

EXPANSION STRATEGY:
- Build roads only with clear settlement locations in mind
- Target settlements that give you access to ports or new resources
- Block opponents' expansion paths when it gives you a strategic advantage
- Consider the timing of expansion vs. city upgrades based on your resource production
- Calculate whether longest road is achievable and worth the resource investment
- When deciding between a new settlement and a city upgrade, compare immediate vs. long-term returns

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-probability hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Save knight cards for breaking up opponent strategies or securing largest army
- Use knights defensively if you're producing valuable resources on high-probability hexes

TRADING TACTICS:
- Avoid trading resources that directly help opponents score points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades
- Trade excess resources before rolling 7 if you have more than 7 cards
- Consider bank/port trades when they enable an immediate build that advances your strategy
- When trading with players, try to receive resources that complete a build

ENDGAME STRATEGY:
- In the late game, hide your victory point potential (keep development cards hidden)
- Calculate the fastest path to 10 VP and focus exclusively on that path
- Be aware of the exact number of remaining development cards and their probabilities
- Track opponents' potential victory points, including hidden development cards
- If you're close to winning, prioritize actions that can be completed in a single turn

Before finalizing your action, check:
1. Is there a more efficient path to victory points?
2. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
3. Does this move help or hinder opponents?
4. Is there a defensive move needed to prevent an opponent from winning?
5. Are you properly diversified against dice probability?

# Game Analysis for Settlers of Catan

I'll analyze my current position to determine the optimal action.

## Current Game State Assessment
- I have 2 VP from my 2 settlements
- RED has 5 VP (3 settlements + 2 VP for longest road)
- I have 2 WOOD, 1 BRICK, 2 SHEEP
- RED has longest road with 6 segments, while my longest is only 4
- The robber is currently on RED's brick hex (1,0,-1) with number 3 - this aligns with my plan

## Resource Production Analysis
My settlements:
- Node 2: Produces from 8🐑, 6🌲, 4🌾 (good production)
- Node 4: Produces from 8🐑, 9⛏️ (good ore production)

However, I'm not producing any brick directly, which makes expansion challenging.

## Available Actions
My only build options are roads (options 1-8), as I have exactly the required 1 WOOD + 1 BRICK. I could also end my turn (option 0).

## Strategic Considerations

1. **Road Building Strategy**:
   - Building a road would use all my brick, leaving me with 1 WOOD, 2 SHEEP
   - Building in the right direction could help me:
     - Work toward breaking RED's longest road
     - Set up for future settlement placement
     - Block RED's expansion

2. **End Turn Strategy**:
   - Saving resources might allow me to make a more impactful move later
   - But I risk losing resources to a 7 roll if I accumulate more than 7
   - Currently at 5 resources, so not immediately at risk

Looking at the road options, I need to determine which would best position me for future expansion or disrupt RED's plans.

Since my plan involves disrupting RED's longest road and developing around node 4 (with high ore production), I should build a road that advances these goals. Without seeing the full road network layout, I'm making my best assessment based on node connections.

Road option 3 (edge 3, 4) or option 8 (edge 14, 15) would likely extend my network from my settlement at node 4, which aligns with my plan to develop around that area with high ore production.

<plan>
1. Continue building roads to expand from my settlement at node 4 (with good ore production)
2. Aim to establish a new settlement that provides brick production
3. Work toward breaking RED's longest road by building a competing network
4. Save for development cards when I have excess ore, wheat, and sheep
5. Continue disrupting RED's resource production with the robber
</plan>

Based on my analysis, I believe building a road at edge (3, 4) makes the most strategic sense as it likely expands from my settlement at node 4 with the valuable ore production.

# Game Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state and available options:

## Current Position
- **Victory Points**: I have 2 VP vs RED's 5 VP
- **Resources**: I have 1 WOOD and 4 SHEEP
- **Settlements**: I have 2 settlements with decent production
- **Roads**: I have 7 roads with longest road of 5 (RED has longest road with 6)
- **Development Cards**: I've already played 1 KNIGHT, 1 YEAR_OF_PLENTY, 1 ROAD_BUILDING

## Available Actions
- End turn [0]
- Trade 4 SHEEP for various resources [1-4]

## Strategic Assessment

Looking at the game state, I'm at a significant disadvantage with only 2 VP compared to RED's 5 VP. RED has longest road (+2 VP) and more settlements (+1 VP).

I need to consider:
1. What immediate builds can I make?
2. What resources do I most need?
3. What's my path to victory?

With 1 WOOD and 4 SHEEP, my only option is to trade 4 SHEEP for another resource. Since I can't build anything immediately (would need brick for a road or various combinations for other builds), I need to decide what resource would be most strategic to acquire.

The robber is currently on the brick hex (1,0,-1), which is blocking brick production. This is limiting both my and RED's access to brick, but I need brick for expansion.

From my current plan, I aimed to:
- Build roads to expand from settlement at node 4
- Establish settlements for brick production
- Break RED's longest road

For these goals, acquiring BRICK seems most strategic, as:
1. I need it to build roads for expansion
2. It's currently blocked by the robber, making it scarce
3. It would help me work toward breaking RED's longest road by continuing my road network

<plan>
1. Trade for BRICK to continue road expansion
2. Focus on creating a longer road network to break RED's longest road bonus
3. Look for settlement opportunities that provide brick/ore production
4. Continue using knights to disrupt RED's resource production
5. Work toward largest army as a path to victory points
</plan>

Given these considerations, trading 4 SHEEP for 1 BRICK (action #2) is my best option to advance my strategy.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL SETTLEMENT PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Place settlements on high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Target at least one spot with good ore and wheat production for city development
- Try to secure at least one high-probability spot (5, 6, 8, 9) for each critical resource
- Place your second settlement to complement your first (fill resource gaps)
- Aim for access to all five resources or position near useful ports if resource diversity isn't possible
- Always consider which settlements opponents are likely to place and avoid areas that will become contested
- Place roads pointing toward valuable future expansion spots, not toward the center
- Consider the long-term impact: settlements that can't expand are less valuable

MID-GAME RESOURCE PRIORITIES:
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each possible build (cities: 1VP for 5 resources is most efficient)
- Early phase: Secure at least one good source of brick and wood for minimal expansion
- Growth phase: Prioritize ore and wheat production for city upgrades (3VP for 5 resources is optimal)
- Late phase: Focus on the fastest path to victory points, whether through buildings or development cards
- Avoid trading resources that opponents need for immediate victory point gains
- Use 4:1 trades only when necessary; prioritize port usage when possible

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and limited expansion options
- If you get an early knight, save it for defense or until you can start building toward largest army
- Time monopoly card usage for when opponents likely have accumulated specific resources
- Save year of plenty cards for completing crucial builds when you're short 1-2 specific resources
- Development cards are most valuable when:
  * You need hidden victory points to surprise opponents
  * You need knights to break up longest road or secure largest army
  * You're lacking wood/brick for expansion but have plenty of sheep/wheat/ore

EXPANSION STRATEGY:
- Build roads only with clear settlement locations in mind
- Target settlements that give you access to ports or new resources
- Block opponents' expansion paths when it gives you a strategic advantage
- Consider the timing of expansion vs. city upgrades based on your resource production
- Calculate whether longest road is achievable and worth the resource investment
- When deciding between a new settlement and a city upgrade, compare immediate vs. long-term returns

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-probability hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Save knight cards for breaking up opponent strategies or securing largest army
- Use knights defensively if you're producing valuable resources on high-probability hexes

TRADING TACTICS:
- Avoid trading resources that directly help opponents score points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades
- Trade excess resources before rolling 7 if you have more than 7 cards
- Consider bank/port trades when they enable an immediate build that advances your strategy
- When trading with players, try to receive resources that complete a build

ENDGAME STRATEGY:
- In the late game, hide your victory point potential (keep development cards hidden)
- Calculate the fastest path to 10 VP and focus exclusively on that path
- Be aware of the exact number of remaining development cards and their probabilities
- Track opponents' potential victory points, including hidden development cards
- If you're close to winning, prioritize actions that can be completed in a single turn

Before finalizing your action, check:
1. Is there a more efficient path to victory points?
2. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
3. Does this move help or hinder opponents?
4. Is there a defensive move needed to prevent an opponent from winning?
5. Are you properly diversified against dice probability?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game Analysis for Turn 76

Let me assess the current game state and available options:

## Current Situation
- I have 2 VP (from 2 settlements)
- RED has 5 VP (3 settlements + Longest Road bonus)
- I have only 1 WOOD and 1 BRICK
- I've already played 3 development cards (KNIGHT, YEAR_OF_PLENTY, ROAD_BUILDING)
- My roads built: 7 (Longest: 5)
- RED's roads built: 6 (Longest: 6) - giving them +2 VP from Longest Road

## Available Actions
I have exactly the resources needed to build one road (1 WOOD, 1 BRICK). My options are to either:
1. Build a road at one of the 7 possible locations
2. End my turn

## Strategic Assessment
RED is at 5 VP while I'm at 2 VP. A critical element of my strategy is breaking RED's Longest Road bonus. If I can create a road network longer than 6 segments, I can take away 2 VP from RED and gain 2 VP myself - a 4-point swing.

Looking at my road options, I need to evaluate which one would most effectively extend my current longest road segment of 5 to potentially create a longer continuous path.

Without seeing the complete board layout, I need to determine which of these road options connects to my existing longest path. Since my goal is to break RED's longest road, I should prioritize an option that extends my current longest road network.

Given my current plan to focus on creating a longer road network to break RED's longest road bonus, and with the resources I have available, building a road is clearly preferable to ending my turn.

<plan>
1. Build a road to extend my current longest path toward breaking RED's longest road bonus
2. Continue gathering resources (especially BRICK and WOOD) for further road expansion
3. Look for settlement opportunities at resource-producing locations
4. Use knights strategically to disrupt RED's production and work toward largest army
5. Calculate the most efficient path to 10 VP, considering both building and development cards
</plan>

Without detailed information about which road would extend my current longest path, I'll build a road at edge (1, 2) as my best option to potentially extend my longest road network.

# Game State Analysis

Let me analyze the current situation and the robber placement options:

- I (BLUE) have 2 VP, while RED has 5 VP (including 2 VP for longest road)
- RED is well ahead with 5 VP vs my 2 VP
- Currently, I have no resources and RED has 2 hidden resources
- The robber needs to be moved from its current location at (1, 0, -1), which is a brick hex with a roll value of 3

## Robber Placement Options:
0. (0, 0, 0) - Sheep hex with 8 (high probability) and steal from RED
1. (1, -1, 0) - Wood hex with 6 (high probability) and steal from RED
2. (0, -1, 1) - Wheat hex with 4 (low-medium probability)
3. (-1, 0, 1) - Ore hex with 9 (medium-high probability)
4. (-1, 1, 0) - Desert hex (no production to block)
5. (0, 1, -1) - Wheat hex with 10 (low-medium probability) and steal from RED

## Production Analysis:
- RED produces from:
  * 🐑8 (high value)
  * 🌲6 (high value)
  * 🌾10 (low-medium value)
  * 🧱3 (low value)

- I (BLUE) produce from:
  * 🐑8 (high value)
  * 🌲6 (high value)
  * ⛏️9 (medium-high value)
  * 🌾4 (low value)

## Strategic Considerations:

1. **Targeting High-Value Production**: Option [0] blocks 8-sheep (high value) which hurts both of us equally. Option [1] blocks 6-wood (high value) which also hurts both of us equally.

2. **Asymmetric Impact**: I should look for moves that hurt RED more than they hurt me.

3. **Stealing Opportunity**: Options [0], [1], [4], and [5] allow me to steal from RED.

4. **Resource Needs**: According to my plan, I need BRICK and WOOD for road building. Blocking RED's WOOD source could be strategic.

## Decision Making:

- Option [1] (Wood hex) is strategically strong because:
  * It blocks a high-probability resource (6-wood)
  * This directly impacts RED's ability to build roads
  * It allows me to steal from RED
  * Even though it impacts my production too, it's better to stop RED's momentum

- Option [0] (Sheep hex) blocks a high-value hex but sheep is less critical for road building

- Option [3] (Ore hex) doesn't allow stealing from RED

- Option [4] (Desert hex) doesn't block any production, only allows stealing

<plan>
1. Block RED's wood production to slow their road building
2. Continue gathering resources for road expansion toward breaking RED's longest road
3. Work toward settlement opportunities by expanding my road network
4. Buy development cards when possible to work toward largest army
5. Calculate the most efficient path to 10 VP, targeting RED's longest road bonus
</plan>

Based on this analysis, I'll move the robber to the wood hex to disrupt RED's road building capabilities while also stealing a card from them.

# Game Analysis for Settlers of Catan

Let me analyze the current game state and available options:

## Current Game State
- I (BLUE) have 2 VP from my 2 settlements
- RED has 5 VP (3 from settlements + 2 from longest road)
- I have 3 🐑SHEEP, 1 🌾WHEAT, 1 ⛏️ORE
- RED has 4 hidden resource cards
- The robber is on the 🌲6 tile, which blocks one of my settlements' wood production
- Development cards remaining: 22

## Available Actions
1. Buy a development card (costs 1 🐑SHEEP, 1 🌾WHEAT, 1 ⛏️ORE)
2. End turn

## Strategic Analysis

Buying a development card provides several potential benefits:
- Could get a VP card (immediate hidden point)
- Could get a Knight (helps toward largest army bonus and moves the robber)
- Could get a progress card (Road Building, Year of Plenty, or Monopoly)

If I end my turn, I keep my resources but don't make immediate progress.

Looking at RED's position (5 VP with longest road), they're halfway to victory. Breaking their longest road would subtract 2 VP from them, which is significant.

My current plan focuses on blocking RED's production and working toward breaking their longest road. I've already played 1 Knight, 1 Year of Plenty, and 1 Road Building card, showing I've been using development cards strategically.

With exactly the right resources to buy a development card (1 🐑, 1 🌾, 1 ⛏️), this is an opportunity to potentially get:
- A Knight (25% chance) to move the robber and work toward largest army
- A Victory Point card (20% chance) for an immediate hidden point
- Or a progress card (55% chance) that could help with my road strategy

<plan>
1. Buy development cards to increase chances of getting Knights (for largest army) or hidden VP
2. Continue gathering resources for road expansion toward breaking RED's longest road
3. Work toward settlement opportunities by expanding my road network
4. Calculate the most efficient path to 10 VP, targeting both RED's longest road bonus and largest army bonus
</plan>

Given the options and our position, buying a development card makes the most sense. It aligns with our plan to slow RED while building toward breaking their longest road and/or securing largest army.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL SETTLEMENT PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Place settlements on high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Target at least one spot with good ore and wheat production for city development
- Try to secure at least one high-probability spot (5, 6, 8, 9) for each critical resource
- Place your second settlement to complement your first (fill resource gaps)
- Aim for access to all five resources or position near useful ports if resource diversity isn't possible
- Always consider which settlements opponents are likely to place and avoid areas that will become contested
- Place roads pointing toward valuable future expansion spots, not toward the center
- Consider the long-term impact: settlements that can't expand are less valuable

MID-GAME RESOURCE PRIORITIES:
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each possible build (cities: 1VP for 5 resources is most efficient)
- Early phase: Secure at least one good source of brick and wood for minimal expansion
- Growth phase: Prioritize ore and wheat production for city upgrades (3VP for 5 resources is optimal)
- Late phase: Focus on the fastest path to victory points, whether through buildings or development cards
- Avoid trading resources that opponents need for immediate victory point gains
- Use 4:1 trades only when necessary; prioritize port usage when possible

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and limited expansion options
- If you get an early knight, save it for defense or until you can start building toward largest army
- Time monopoly card usage for when opponents likely have accumulated specific resources
- Save year of plenty cards for completing crucial builds when you're short 1-2 specific resources
- Development cards are most valuable when:
  * You need hidden victory points to surprise opponents
  * You need knights to break up longest road or secure largest army
  * You're lacking wood/brick for expansion but have plenty of sheep/wheat/ore

EXPANSION STRATEGY:
- Build roads only with clear settlement locations in mind
- Target settlements that give you access to ports or new resources
- Block opponents' expansion paths when it gives you a strategic advantage
- Consider the timing of expansion vs. city upgrades based on your resource production
- Calculate whether longest road is achievable and worth the resource investment
- When deciding between a new settlement and a city upgrade, compare immediate vs. long-term returns

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-probability hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Save knight cards for breaking up opponent strategies or securing largest army
- Use knights defensively if you're producing valuable resources on high-probability hexes

TRADING TACTICS:
- Avoid trading resources that directly help opponents score points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades
- Trade excess resources before rolling 7 if you have more than 7 cards
- Consider bank/port trades when they enable an immediate build that advances your strategy
- When trading with players, try to receive resources that complete a build

ENDGAME STRATEGY:
- In the late game, hide your victory point potential (keep development cards hidden)
- Calculate the fastest path to 10 VP and focus exclusively on that path
- Be aware of the exact number of remaining development cards and their probabilities
- Track opponents' potential victory points, including hidden development cards
- If you're close to winning, prioritize actions that can be completed in a single turn

Before finalizing your action, check:
1. Is there a more efficient path to victory points?
2. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?

# Game State Analysis

Let me analyze my current position and available actions:

## Current Game State
- I have 2 victory points from my 2 settlements
- RED has 5 victory points (3 settlements + 2 from longest road)
- I have 2 sheep resources and 1 knight development card
- I've already played 1 knight, 1 year of plenty, and 1 road building card
- The robber is currently on the lumber hex with a 6 (blocking one of my productive hexes)

## Available Actions
- [0] Play Knight card - Move robber and steal a resource
- [1] Roll the dice

## Strategic Considerations

### Option 0: Play Knight Card
**Benefits:**
- Remove the robber from my valuable 6-lumber hex, which is currently blocking production
- Steal a resource from RED (who has 4 resources)
- Move toward largest army (I would have 2 knights played)
- Potentially disrupt RED's production by placing robber on their hex

### Option 1: Roll the Dice
**Benefits:**
- Could gain more resources if I roll well
- Keep the knight card for later strategic use

**Risks:**
- The robber stays on my valuable lumber hex, continuing to block production
- If I roll 7, I won't lose cards (only have 2), but I'd just be moving the robber again

## Decision Analysis

The robber is currently on my high-probability lumber hex (6), which is one of my most valuable production spots. Playing the knight now would:
1. Immediately unblock my valuable resource
2. Allow me to steal a card from RED
3. Move me closer to largest army (need 3 knights)
4. Let me place the robber to disrupt RED's production

Given RED is ahead with 5 VP versus my 2 VP, and the robber is blocking one of my critical production hexes, playing the knight now seems optimal. This aligns with my plan to work toward largest army while disrupting RED's lead.

<plan>
1. Play knight to unblock my lumber production and move toward largest army
2. Target RED's high-probability hexes with the robber
3. Continue gathering resources for road expansion and settlement building
4. Work toward breaking RED's longest road while building toward largest army bonus
5. Consider development card purchases when I have excess sheep/wheat/ore

# Analysis of Robber Placement Options

Let me analyze each possible robber placement to determine the optimal move:

## Option Review:
- [0] Move to (0, 0, 0) - Sheep hex with 8 value (high probability)
   * Impact: Blocks RED's settlement at node 0 (8 sheep production)
   * Impact: Blocks my own settlements at nodes 2 and 4 (both produce from this hex)
   * Can steal from RED

- [1] Move to (0, -1, 1) - Wheat hex with 4 value (low probability)
   * Impact: Blocks my settlement at node 2 (low 4 wheat production)
   * No stealing opportunity

- [2] Move to (-1, 0, 1) - Ore hex with 9 value (good probability)
   * Impact: Blocks my settlement at node 4 (9 ore production)
   * No stealing opportunity

- [3] Move to (-1, 1, 0) - Desert hex (no production)
   * Impact: No production impact
   * Can steal from RED (settlement at node 16)

- [4] Move to (0, 1, -1) - Wheat hex with 10 value (moderate probability)
   * Impact: Blocks RED's settlements at nodes 0 and 16 (10 wheat production)
   * Can steal from RED

- [5] Move to (1, 0, -1) - Brick hex with 3 value (low probability)
   * Impact: Blocks RED's settlements at nodes 0 and 6 (3 brick production)
   * Can steal from RED

## Strategic Considerations:
1. RED is leading with 5 VP vs my 2 VP
2. RED has longest road (6 segments)
3. I want to maximize my own production while limiting RED's
4. Brick and wood are essential for road building (to break RED's longest road)
5. RED has 4 hidden resource cards I could potentially steal

## Decision Logic:
- Option [0] is poor because it blocks my high-probability sheep production on both of my settlements
- Option [1] and [2] are poor because they block my production and don't allow stealing
- Option [3] is decent because desert has no production, but offers limited strategic value
- Option [4] blocks RED's wheat on two settlements with moderate probability (10)
- Option [5] blocks RED's brick production, which could limit their road building capability

<plan>
1. Block RED's access to brick to slow their road expansion
2. Work on expanding my road network to challenge longest road

4. Build toward largest army with future development card purchases
5. Consider city upgrades once I secure better production

The most strategic choice is to place the robber on RED's brick hex and steal from them. This disrupts their ability to build more roads while potentially giving me a resource I need for expansion.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL SETTLEMENT PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Place settlements on high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Target at least one spot with good ore and wheat production for city development
- Try to secure at least one high-probability spot (5, 6, 8, 9) for each critical resource
- Place your second settlement to complement your first (fill resource gaps)
- Aim for access to all five resources or position near useful ports if resource diversity isn't possible
- Always consider which settlements opponents are likely to place and avoid areas that will become contested
- Place roads pointing toward valuable future expansion spots, not toward the center
- Consider the long-term impact: settlements that can't expand are less valuable

MID-GAME RESOURCE PRIORITIES:
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each possible build (cities: 1VP for 5 resources is most efficient)
- Early phase: Secure at least one good source of brick and wood for minimal expansion
- Growth phase: Prioritize ore and wheat production for city upgrades (3VP for 5 resources is optimal)
- Late phase: Focus on the fastest path to victory points, whether through buildings or development cards
- Avoid trading resources that opponents need for immediate victory point gains
- Use 4:1 trades only when necessary; prioritize port usage when possible

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and limited expansion options
- If you get an early knight, save it for defense or until you can start building toward largest army
- Time monopoly card usage for when opponents likely have accumulated specific resources
- Save year of plenty cards for completing crucial builds when you're short 1-2 specific resources
- Development cards are most valuable when:
  * You need hidden victory points to surprise opponents
  * You need knights to break up longest road or secure largest army
  * You're lacking wood/brick for expansion but have plenty of sheep/wheat/ore

EXPANSION STRATEGY:
- Build roads only with clear settlement locations in mind
- Target settlements that give you access to ports or new resources
- Block opponents' expansion paths when it gives you a strategic advantage
- Consider the timing of expansion vs. city upgrades based on your resource production
- Calculate whether longest road is achievable and worth the resource investment
- When deciding between a new settlement and a city upgrade, compare immediate vs. long-term returns

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-probability hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Save knight cards for breaking up opponent strategies or securing largest army
- Use knights defensively if you're producing valuable resources on high-probability hexes

TRADING TACTICS:
- Avoid trading resources that directly help opponents score points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades
- Trade excess resources before rolling 7 if you have more than 7 cards
- Consider bank/port trades when they enable an immediate build that advances your strategy
- When trading with players, try to receive resources that complete a build

ENDGAME STRATEGY:
- In the late game, hide your victory point potential (keep development cards hidden)
- Calculate the fastest path to 10 VP and focus exclusively on that path
- Be aware of the exact number of remaining development cards and their probabilities
- Track opponents' potential victory points, including hidden development cards
- If you're close to winning, prioritize actions that can be completed in a single turn

Before finalizing your action, check:
1. Is there a more efficient path to victory points?
2. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
3. Does this move help or hinder opponents?
4. Is there a defensive move needed to prevent an opponent from winning?
5. Are you properly diversified against dice probability?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game State Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state:

## Victory Point Status
- BLUE (me): 2 VPs (from 2 settlements)
- RED: 6 VPs (4 from settlements + 2 from longest road)

RED is 4 points ahead and at 6/10 VPs, making them a serious threat to win.

## Current Resources
I have: 4 🌲WOOD, 3 🐑SHEEP, 1 🌾WHEAT, 2 ⛏️ORE

## Production Assessment
My settlements are on good numbers:
- Node 2: 🐑8, 🌲6, 🌾4 (strong wood and sheep)
- Node 4: 🐑8, ⛏️9 (good ore and sheep)

I'm strong on sheep and wood, decent on ore, but weak on wheat and have no brick production.

## Action Analysis

### Option 0: End Turn
Simply ending my turn wastes resources and momentum.

### Option 1: Buy Development Card (1 🐑, 1 🌾, 1 ⛏️)
- I have 3 sheep, 1 wheat, and 2 ore, so I can afford this
- Benefits:
  - Could get a Victory Point card (immediate hidden VP)
  - Knight would help toward largest army (worth 2 VP)
  - Could get a useful action card (Road Building, Year of Plenty, Monopoly)
- RED is at 6 VP, so I need to accelerate my strategy

### Options 2-5: Trade Wood for Other Resources
I have 4 wood, so I could trade, but at the poor 4:1 rate:
- Option 2: Get brick - could help with road building
- Option 3: Get more ore - not immediately useful since I already have 2
- Option 4: Get more sheep - unnecessary with 3 already
- Option 5: Get more wheat - could be useful, but not optimal use of 4 wood

## Strategic Considerations

RED is at 6 VP and has longest road, making them 4 points ahead. I need to:
1. Accelerate my own VP acquisition
2. Consider breaking their longest road (would subtract 2 VP from them)

Buying a development card is my best option because:
- Potentially immediate VP gain if I draw a Victory Point card
- Knights help toward largest army (2 VP) and I already have 2 played
- I have sufficient resources to buy one
- Trading 4:1 is inefficient and doesn't advance my position enough

<plan>
1. Purchase development cards for potential VPs or knights to work toward largest army (2 VP)
2. When possible, expand my road network to challenge longest road
3. Save resources for strategic settlements that enhance my production
4. Continue building toward largest army with future development card purchases
5. Watch for opportunities to block RED's expansion 
</plan>

Based on this analysis, I'll buy a development card:

# Game Analysis and Action Selection

## Game State Assessment
- I'm BLUE with 2 VP, while RED has 6 VP (including 2 VP from longest road)
- I have 4 Wood, 2 Sheep, 1 Ore, and a MONOPOLY development card
- RED is significantly ahead with 6/10 VP vs my 2/10 VP
- I have only 5 roads in my longest path vs RED's 7 roads

## Resource Analysis
- My current resources (4 Wood, 2 Sheep, 1 Ore) don't allow me to build any significant structures:
  - Settlement: Need Brick, Wood, Wheat, Sheep
  - Development Card: Need Ore, Wheat, Sheep
  - City: Need 3 Ore, 2 Wheat
- The robber is on the Brick hex, limiting brick production
- RED is 4 VP ahead, so I need to accelerate my point acquisition

## Available Actions
Given my limited options (0-4), I need to assess:
- Keep my turn and current resources (Action 0)
- Trade Wood for other resources using the port (Actions 1-4)

## Strategy Evaluation

### End Turn (Action 0)
- Pros: Preserves my resources for future turns when I might draw better combinations
- Cons: Does nothing to progress my position; RED may extend their lead

### Trading Options (Actions 1-4)
- Trading Wood for Brick (Action 1): Could help me build roads, but I already have 4 Wood, so adding Brick alone doesn't complete any builds
- Trading Wood for Ore (Action 2): I already have 1 Ore, getting another doesn't immediately help
- Trading Wood for Sheep (Action 3): I already have 2 Sheep, getting another doesn't immediately help
- Trading Wood for Wheat (Action 4): Could be useful for development cards, but I'd still be missing requirements

Since none of the trading actions will let me complete a build this turn, and the 4:1 port trade is very inefficient, I should hold my resources.

I need to modify my plan to account for RED's significant lead:

<plan>
1. Save resources for development cards (hoping for victory point cards)
2. Use my MONOPOLY card strategically when RED likely has many of one resource
3. Continue building roads to challenge longest road (2 VP)
4. Save resources for a settlement placement at a strategic location
5. Play defensively to slow RED's progress while I catch up
</plan>

Based on this analysis, I'll end my turn without making inefficient trades:

Based on this information, which action number do you choose? Think step by step about your options, then put the final action number in a box like \boxed{1}.
RESPONSE:
I'll analyze the game state and available actions to find the optimal move.

## Game State Analysis
- I have 2 VP, while RED has 6 VP (including 2 VP from longest road)
- RED is ahead and potentially 4 VP away from winning
- I have 4 Wood, 2 Sheep, 1 Wheat, 1 Ore
- I have 1 MONOPOLY development card
- The robber is on Brick (3)
- RED has 3 hidden resource cards

## Action Analysis

Currently, my options are to either play my Monopoly card targeting a specific resource, or to roll the dice.

Let's analyze the Monopoly options:
- [0] Take all WOOD: RED likely doesn't have much wood since they're focused on settlements and haven't been building roads recently.
- [1] Take all BRICK: Brick is valuable for road-building. The brick hex has the robber on it, so RED's production is limited here.
- [2] Take all SHEEP: RED needs sheep for development cards but not for settlements/cities.
- [3] Take all WHEAT: Wheat is needed for settlements and development cards - RED might be saving this.
- [4] Take all ORE: Ore is needed for cities and development cards - RED might be saving this.

Rolling dice [5]:
- This would continue my turn normally, allowing me to gain resources and potentially build or buy development cards.

## Strategic Considerations

Looking at RED's position:
- RED has 4 settlements (4 VP) + longest road (2 VP) = 6 VP
- To reach 10 VP, RED needs 4 more VP, which could come from:
  - 2 more settlements (2 VP)
  - Development cards with victory points
  - Upgrading to a city (1 additional VP each)

I'm significantly behind at 2 VP and need to:
1. Slow down RED's progress
2. Accelerate my own path to victory points
3. Potentially break RED's longest road (which would reduce them to 4 VP)

Given that I have 8 roads built (longest: 5), I need 3 more connected roads to challenge RED's longest road.

## Decision

The best strategic move is to roll the dice [5] rather than play the Monopoly card now. Here's why:

1. RED only has 3 hidden resources, so Monopoly's impact would be minimal
2. I should save the Monopoly card for when RED has accumulated more resources
3. Rolling allows me to potentially gain more resources and make a more substantial move
4. With my current resources, I could potentially build another road after rolling

<plan>
1. Roll dice to gather more resources
2. Build more roads toward challenging longest road
3. Save Monopoly for a more impactful moment (when RED has accumulated resources)
4. Focus on either getting more development cards or building new settlements
5. Work toward breaking RED's longest road to bring them back to 4 VP
</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL SETTLEMENT PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Place settlements on high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Target at least one spot with good ore and wheat production for city development
- Try to secure at least one high-probability spot (5, 6, 8, 9) for each critical resource
- Place your second settlement to complement your first (fill resource gaps)
- Aim for access to all five resources or position near useful ports if resource diversity isn't possible
- Always consider which settlements opponents are likely to place and avoid areas that will become contested
- Place roads pointing toward valuable future expansion spots, not toward the center
- Consider the long-term impact: settlements that can't expand are less valuable

MID-GAME RESOURCE PRIORITIES:
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each possible build (cities: 1VP for 5 resources is most efficient)
- Early phase: Secure at least one good source of brick and wood for minimal expansion
- Growth phase: Prioritize ore and wheat production for city upgrades (3VP for 5 resources is optimal)
- Late phase: Focus on the fastest path to victory points, whether through buildings or development cards
- Avoid trading resources that opponents need for immediate victory point gains
- Use 4:1 trades only when necessary; prioritize port usage when possible

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and limited expansion options
- If you get an early knight, save it for defense or until you can start building toward largest army
- Time monopoly card usage for when opponents likely have accumulated specific resources
- Save year of plenty cards for completing crucial builds when you're short 1-2 specific resources
- Development cards are most valuable when:
  * You need hidden victory points to surprise opponents
  * You need knights to break up longest road or secure largest army
  * You're lacking wood/brick for expansion but have plenty of sheep/wheat/ore

EXPANSION STRATEGY:
- Build roads only with clear settlement locations in mind
- Target settlements that give you access to ports or new resources
- Block opponents' expansion paths when it gives you a strategic advantage
- Consider the timing of expansion vs. city upgrades based on your resource production
- Calculate whether longest road is achievable and worth the resource investment
- When deciding between a new settlement and a city upgrade, compare immediate vs. long-term returns

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-probability hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Save knight cards for breaking up opponent strategies or securing largest army
- Use knights defensively if you're producing valuable resources on high-probability hexes

TRADING TACTICS:
- Avoid trading resources that directly help opponents score points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades
- Trade excess resources before rolling 7 if you have more than 7 cards
- Consider bank/port trades when they enable an immediate build that advances your strategy
- When trading with players, try to receive resources that complete a build

ENDGAME STRATEGY:
- In the late game, hide your victory point potential (keep development cards hidden)
- Calculate the fastest path to 10 VP and focus exclusively on that path
- Be aware of the exact number of remaining development cards and their probabilities
- Track opponents' potential victory points, including hidden development cards
- If you're close to winning, prioritize actions that can be completed in a single turn

Before finalizing your action, check:
1. Is there a more efficient path to victory points?
2. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
3. Does this move help or hinder opponents?
4. Is there a defensive move needed to prevent an opponent from winning?
5. Are you properly diversified against dice probability?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game Analysis

Let me carefully analyze the current game state and available options to determine the optimal move.

## Current Situation
- I have 2 VP while RED has 6 VP (including 2 VP from longest road)
- I have 4 🌲WOOD, 2 🐑SHEEP, 1 🌾WHEAT, 2 ⛏️ORE
- I have 1 MONOPOLY development card
- RED has 3 hidden resource cards
- I need to catch up as RED is much closer to winning

## Available Actions
1. Play Monopoly card for various resources
2. End my turn
3. Buy a development card
4. Maritime trade options (4:1)

## Option Analysis

### Play Monopoly Card
The Monopoly card could be valuable, but its effectiveness depends on what RED has. With only 3 hidden cards, the expected return isn't great, and I have no information about what resources RED holds.

### End Turn
This wastes my opportunity to make a move and doesn't advance my position.

### Buy Development Card (1 🐑SHEEP, 1 🌾WHEAT, 1 ⛏️ORE)
I have exactly the resources needed. This could give me:
- Victory Point card (immediate hidden VP)
- Knight (helps toward Largest Army and can move robber)
- Road Building (helps expand network)
- Year of Plenty (resource flexibility)
- Monopoly (another chance at resource gathering)

### Maritime Trade
Trading 4:1 is very inefficient and wouldn't allow me to build anything significant.

## Strategic Considerations
1. I'm 4 VP behind RED, so I need high-impact moves
2. Development cards offer hidden victory points and tactical options
3. I already have 5 roads in a row, so additional knights could help me break RED's longest road
4. Saving the Monopoly for when RED has more resources could be more impactful

## Decision Making
Buying a development card offers the best risk/reward profile:
- 20% chance of a direct Victory Point
- 40% chance of a Knight (which helps toward Largest Army)
- The remaining options provide tactical flexibility
- Keeps my strategy hidden from RED
- Uses my current resources efficiently

<plan>
1. Buy development card to potentially get VP or work toward Largest Army
2. Look for opportunities to block RED's expansion
3. Save Monopoly for when RED has accumulated more resources
4. Continue building toward challenging longest road
5. Focus on either securing more development cards or building new settlements
</plan>

The optimal action is to buy a development card.

# Game Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state and available actions.

## Current Status
- RED is leading with 6/10 VP (4 settlements + 2 longest road)
- BLUE (me) has 2/10 VP from settlements, with 1 hidden VP from a development card
- I have: 4 🌲WOOD, 1 🐑SHEEP, 1 ⛏️ORE, a MONOPOLY card, and a VICTORY_POINT card
- Available actions: Play Monopoly for different resources or end turn or maritime trading

## Resource Assessment
- RED has 3 hidden resource cards
- I need BRICK and WHEAT for expansion (settlements require WOOD, BRICK, SHEEP, WHEAT)
- I currently cannot build anything useful with my current resources

## Strategic Considerations

1. **Monopoly Card Value**: 
   - WOOD: I already have 4, so monopolizing WOOD might not yield much
   - BRICK: Critical for expansion and RED might have some after building 7 roads
   - SHEEP: I only need 1 more to build a settlement (if I get brick and wheat)
   - WHEAT: Essential for settlements and development cards
   - ORE: I have 1, could be useful for development cards

2. **RED's Likely Resources**:
   - RED has longest road (7 segments) which required WOOD and BRICK
   - RED has settlements on BRICK, WOOD, WHEAT and SHEEP production
   - Since RED built many roads, they might have consumed most BRICK and WOOD
   - RED might be accumulating WHEAT to build cities or buy development cards

3. **My Options**:
   - Playing Monopoly for BRICK could help me build roads to potentially challenge longest road
   - Playing Monopoly for WHEAT could help me build settlements or buy development cards
   - Ending turn preserves my Monopoly card for when RED has accumulated more resources

<plan>
1. Play Monopoly for WHEAT to potentially prepare for settlement building
2. Continue road expansion to challenge RED's longest road
3. Look to build settlements at strategic locations
4. Buy development cards when possible to gain VPs or knights for largest army
</plan>

Given that RED is quite ahead (6 VP vs my effective 3 VP), I need to make a bold move. Since RED has settlements on WHEAT hexes (producing on 10), there's a decent chance they have WHEAT. WHEAT is crucial for both settlements and development cards, making it a high-value monopoly target.

Playing Monopoly for WHEAT (action #3) would potentially give me a key resource and disrupt RED's strategy. Even if RED only has 1-2 WHEAT, this could be significant for my next build.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL SETTLEMENT PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Place settlements on high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Target at least one spot with good ore and wheat production for city development
- Try to secure at least one high-probability spot (5, 6, 8, 9) for each critical resource
- Place your second settlement to complement your first (fill resource gaps)
- Aim for access to all five resources or position near useful ports if resource diversity isn't possible
- Always consider which settlements opponents are likely to place and avoid areas that will become contested
- Place roads pointing toward valuable future expansion spots, not toward the center
- Consider the long-term impact: settlements that can't expand are less valuable

MID-GAME RESOURCE PRIORITIES:
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each possible build (cities: 1VP for 5 resources is most efficient)
- Early phase: Secure at least one good source of brick and wood for minimal expansion
- Growth phase: Prioritize ore and wheat production for city upgrades (3VP for 5 resources is optimal)
- Late phase: Focus on the fastest path to victory points, whether through buildings or development cards
- Avoid trading resources that opponents need for immediate victory point gains
- Use 4:1 trades only when necessary; prioritize port usage when possible

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and limited expansion options
- If you get an early knight, save it for defense or until you can start building toward largest army
- Time monopoly card usage for when opponents likely have accumulated specific resources
- Save year of plenty cards for completing crucial builds when you're short 1-2 specific resources
- Development cards are most valuable when:
  * You need hidden victory points to surprise opponents
  * You need knights to break up longest road or secure largest army
  * You're lacking wood/brick for expansion but have plenty of sheep/wheat/ore

EXPANSION STRATEGY:
- Build roads only with clear settlement locations in mind
- Target settlements that give you access to ports or new resources
- Block opponents' expansion paths when it gives you a strategic advantage
- Consider the timing of expansion vs. city upgrades based on your resource production
- Calculate whether longest road is achievable and worth the resource investment
- When deciding between a new settlement and a city upgrade, compare immediate vs. long-term returns

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-probability hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Save knight cards for breaking up opponent strategies or securing largest army
- Use knights defensively if you're producing valuable resources on high-probability hexes

TRADING TACTICS:
- Avoid trading resources that directly help opponents score points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades
- Trade excess resources before rolling 7 if you have more than 7 cards
- Consider bank/port trades when they enable an immediate build that advances your strategy
- When trading with players, try to receive resources that complete a build

ENDGAME STRATEGY:
- In the late game, hide your victory point potential (keep development cards hidden)
- Calculate the fastest path to 10 VP and focus exclusively on that path
- Be aware of the exact number of remaining development cards and their probabilities
- Track opponents' potential victory points, including hidden development cards
- If you're close to winning, prioritize actions that can be completed in a single turn

Before finalizing your action, check:
1. Is there a more efficient path to victory points?
2. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
3. Does this move help or hinder opponents?
4. Is there a defensive move needed to prevent an opponent from winning?
5. Are you properly diversified against dice probability?

Board Understanding Guide:

- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 96 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:

# Game State Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state and options:

## Victory Point Status
- BLUE (me): 2 VP (2 settlements) + 1 hidden VP (development card) = 3 VP
- RED: 6 VP (4 settlements + 2 VP for longest road)

RED is clearly ahead with 6 VP vs my 3 VP. I need to make strategic moves to catch up.

## Current Resources
I have: 4 🌲WOOD, 1 🐑SHEEP, 1 🌾WHEAT, 1 ⛏️ORE

## Available Actions
1. End turn
2. Buy a development card (costs 1 SHEEP, 1 WHEAT, 1 ORE)
3-6. Maritime trades (4:1) using my WOOD

## Production Analysis
My settlements are on good numbers (8, 6, 9, 4), but RED has more settlements total.

## Strategic Options

### Option 1: End Turn
- Not productive as I have resources that could be used

### Option 2: Buy Development Card
- Costs exactly the SHEEP, WHEAT, and ORE that I currently have
- Could get: Victory Point (instant progress), Knight (defense + potential largest army), Road Building (expansion), Year of Plenty or Monopoly (resource advantage)
- With 19 development cards remaining, chances are good for useful cards
- I already have 1 VP card and 2 played knights, so additional knights could help toward largest army

### Options 3-6: Maritime Trade
- Trading 4 WOOD for another resource is inefficient
- Could convert WOOD to another resource, but wouldn't have enough to build anything substantial afterward

## Strategic Decision Making

Buying a development card offers the highest potential value:
- If I get a VP card, I'll have 4 total VP
- If I get a knight, I'll have 3 played knights, getting closer to largest army (2 VP bonus)
- Road Building would help challenge RED's longest road
- Resource cards (Monopoly/Year of Plenty) provide flexibility

The 4:1 trade options are inefficient, and simply ending my turn wastes resources.

<plan>
1. Buy development card to potentially gain VP or knight for largest army
2. Continue road expansion to challenge RED's longest road
3. Look for opportunities to build settlements at strategic locations
4. Consider using maritime trades in future turns when absolutely necessary to complete key builds
</plan>

Therefore, I'll buy a development card (option 1).

# Game Analysis for Turn 96

Let me analyze the current game state and my available options:

## Victory Point Assessment
- I have 2 visible VP + 1 VP card = 3 VP
- RED has 6 VP (4 settlements + 2 VP for longest road)
- RED is leading by 3 points

## Resource Analysis
- I have 4 🌲 WOOD
- No other resources
- I have 1 Knight card and 1 VP card (hidden)

## Available Actions
- End turn [0]
- Trade 4 wood for various resources [1-4]

## Strategic Considerations

1) **Development Card Strategy**: I already have a VP card and a Knight. With 2 played knights, I need 1 more to get Largest Army (+2 VP).

2) **Road Building**: I have 5 consecutive road segments vs RED's 7. Breaking RED's longest road would swing 4 VP (taking 2 from RED, gaining 2 for myself).

3) **Current Resources**: With only 4 wood, I can't build anything directly. Trading options:
   - For BRICK: Could extend my road network
   - For ORE: Needed for city upgrades and dev cards
   - For SHEEP: Needed for dev cards and settlements
   - For WHEAT: Needed for settlements, cities, and dev cards

4) **RED's Position**: At 6 VP, RED is closer to winning. I need to accelerate my strategy.

## Decision Analysis

Given my current position, I need to focus on:
1. Breaking RED's longest road
2. Getting Largest Army
3. Building new settlements

To break RED's longest road, I need brick to build more roads. To get Largest Army, I need ore, wheat, and sheep for a dev card (hoping for a Knight). To build settlements, I need wood, brick, sheep, and wheat.

Trading my wood for brick makes the most sense right now. It would allow me to extend my road network, potentially blocking RED and working toward breaking their longest road.

<plan>
1. Trade wood for brick to extend road network
2. Focus on breaking RED's longest road (4 VP swing)
3. Build toward Largest Army by playing my Knight when strategic
4. Look for settlement opportunities along my road path
</plan>

Therefore, I will trade 4 wood for 1 brick to extend my road network.

# Game Analysis

I need to carefully consider my options in this critical game state.

## Current Game Situation
- I have 2 visible VP plus 1 hidden VP from a development card (total: 3 VP)
- RED has 6 VP (4 settlements + longest road bonus)
- RED is closer to winning (6/10 VP vs my 3/10 VP)
- I have no resources currently
- I have 1 Knight card and 1 Victory Point development card

## Strategic Options

### Option 0: Play Knight Card
**Pros:**
- Move the robber off wheat (0,-1,1), potentially allowing me to collect wheat again
- Steal a resource from RED (1 card currently)
- Increase my knight count from 2 to 3, putting me closer to Largest Army (2 VP)
- Prevent RED from gaining resources if I place the robber well
- Take immediate action even without resources

**Cons:**
- If RED's card isn't useful, this action has limited impact
- Using the Knight now means I can't use it in a more crucial moment later

### Option 1: Roll Dice
**Pros:**
- Might generate resources needed for building
- Preserves my Knight card for later strategic use
- Could potentially get enough resources to build something this turn

**Cons:**
- Passive approach when I'm behind in VP
- Risk of rolling a 7 when I have no cards (no negative consequence for me, but robber could move)
- RED is ahead and likely has a stronger strategy in place

## Strategic Evaluation
Looking at the board and my current position:
- RED is 4 VP ahead of me (including my hidden VP)
- I have no resources to work with right now
- The robber is on wheat (4), blocking one of my resource producers
- By moving the robber, I guarantee getting at least 1 resource (from stealing)

<plan>
1. Play Knight to move robber away from my wheat production and steal from RED
2. Focus on breaking RED's longest road (could be a 4 VP swing)
3. Work toward gaining Largest Army (need 1 more Knight)
4. Build settlements strategically to block RED's expansion
5. Collect resources for my next development card play
</plan>

The optimal play is to use the Knight card now. Moving the robber helps my production, stealing gives me a resource I currently don't have, and I'm one step closer to Largest Army. Rolling the dice is too passive when I'm significantly behind.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL SETTLEMENT PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Place settlements on high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Target at least one spot with good ore and wheat production for city development
- Try to secure at least one high-probability spot (5, 6, 8, 9) for each critical resource
- Place your second settlement to complement your first (fill resource gaps)
- Aim for access to all five resources or position near useful ports if resource diversity isn't possible
- Always consider which settlements opponents are likely to place and avoid areas that will become contested
- Place roads pointing toward valuable future expansion spots, not toward the center
- Consider the long-term impact: settlements that can't expand are less valuable

MID-GAME RESOURCE PRIORITIES:
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each possible build (cities: 1VP for 5 resources is most efficient)
- Early phase: Secure at least one good source of brick and wood for minimal expansion
- Growth phase: Prioritize ore and wheat production for city upgrades (3VP for 5 resources is optimal)
- Late phase: Focus on the fastest path to victory points, whether through buildings or development cards
- Avoid trading resources that opponents need for immediate victory point gains
- Use 4:1 trades only when necessary; prioritize port usage when possible

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and limited expansion options
- If you get an early knight, save it for defense or until you can start building toward largest army
- Time monopoly card usage for when opponents likely have accumulated specific resources
- Save year of plenty cards for completing crucial builds when you're short 1-2 specific resources
- Development cards are most valuable when:
  * You need hidden victory points to surprise opponents
  * You need knights to break up longest road or secure largest army
  * You're lacking wood/brick for expansion but have plenty of sheep/wheat/ore

EXPANSION STRATEGY:
- Build roads only with clear settlement locations in mind
- Target settlements that give you access to ports or new resources
- Block opponents' expansion paths when it gives you a strategic advantage
- Consider the timing of expansion vs. city upgrades based on your resource production
- Calculate whether longest road is achievable and worth the resource investment
- When deciding between a new settlement and a city upgrade, compare immediate vs. long-term returns

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-probability hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Save knight cards for breaking up opponent strategies or securing largest army
- Use knights defensively if you're producing valuable resources on high-probability hexes

TRADING TACTICS:
- Avoid trading resources that directly help opponents score points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades
- Trade excess resources before rolling 7 if you have more than 7 cards
- Consider bank/port trades when they enable an immediate build that advances your strategy
- When trading with players, try to receive resources that complete a build

ENDGAME STRATEGY:
- In the late game, hide your victory point potential (keep development cards hidden)
- Calculate the fastest path to 10 VP and focus exclusively on that path
- Be aware of the exact number of remaining development cards and their probabilities
- Track opponents' potential victory points, including hidden development cards
- If you're close to winning, prioritize actions that can be completed in a single turn

Before finalizing your action, check:
1. Is there a more efficient path to victory points?
2. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
3. Does this move help or hinder opponents?
4. Is there a defensive move needed to prevent an opponent from winning?
5. Are you properly diversified against dice probability?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 98 | Player: BLUE | Action: MOVE_ROBBER

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Play Knight to move robber away from my wheat production and steal from RED
2. Focus on breaking RED's longest road (could be a 4 VP swing)
3. Work toward gaining Largest Army (need 1 more Knight)
4. Build settlements strategically to block RED's expansion
5. Collect resources for my next development card play
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.

# Settlers of Catan Action Analysis

Let me analyze the game state and determine the optimal robber placement:

## Game Status Assessment
- BLUE (me): 4 VP (with Largest Army +2 VP)
- RED: 6 VP (with Longest Road +2 VP)
- RED is ahead by 2 VP, making them the primary target
- I have a Victory Point development card, so my actual score is 5/10

## Resource Analysis
- RED has only 1 card, limiting the value of stealing
- The robber is currently on wheat (0, -1, 1) with a roll value of 4
- My settlement at node 2 produces from this wheat hex

## Robber Placement Options

Let me evaluate each option:

[0] Move to (0, 0, 0) - sheep with roll value 8
- This is a high-probability hex (8)
- Would block RED settlement at node 0
- Would also block my settlements at nodes 2 and 4
- This would hurt me as much as RED, potentially more

[1] Move to (1, -1, 0) - wood with roll value 6
- This is a high-probability hex (6)
- Blocks RED settlement at node 6
- Also blocks my settlement at node 2
- Would hurt both of us

[2] Move to (-1, 0, 1) - ore with roll value 9
- Medium probability hex (9)
- Blocks no one at the moment
- Cannot steal from RED
- Low strategic value

[3] Move to (-1, 1, 0) - desert
- Desert produces nothing
- No impact on production
- Can still steal from RED
- But wastes the blocking effect of the robber

[4] Move to (0, 1, -1) - wheat with roll value 10
- Lower probability hex (10)
- Blocks TWO of RED's settlements (nodes 16 and 19)
- This is a key resource for RED (two settlements produce from it)
- Can steal from RED

[5] Move to (1, 0, -1) - brick with roll value 3
- Low probability hex (3)
- Blocks RED settlements at nodes 0 and 6
- This is their only brick source
- Can steal from RED

## Strategic Decision

Considering RED is ahead and approaching victory:
- Disrupting RED's production is my highest priority
- Option [4] blocks wheat production from TWO of RED's settlements
- Wheat is critical for development cards and settlements
- This will significantly hamper RED's growth while having minimal impact on me

<plan>
1. Block RED's wheat production by moving the robber to hex (0, 1, -1)
2. Continue focusing on breaking RED's longest road
3. Work toward gaining more knights to secure Largest Army advantage
4. Build settlements to block RED's expansion opportunities
5. Save resources for city upgrades and development cards
</plan>

The optimal move is option [4], which places the robber on RED's wheat production and allows me to steal from them.

# Robber Placement Analysis

Let me analyze each option for placing the robber to determine the optimal move:

## Game State Assessment
- I'm at 4 VP vs RED's 6 VP
- RED has Longest Road (2 VP), I have Largest Army (2 VP)
- I have limited resources (4 sheep only)
- RED has 5 hidden resources
- RED has settlements producing wheat on hex (0, 1, -1)

## Robber Options Analysis:

**[0] Move robber to (0, 0, 0) and steal from RED**
- This blocks the sheep hex with roll 8
- Would block my own production at settlements on nodes 2 and 4
- Both my settlements produce from this 8-sheep hex
- This would be a very poor self-sabotage move

**[1] Move robber to (1, -1, 0) and steal from RED**
- This blocks the wood hex with roll 6
- Would affect both RED and me (settlement at node 6 for RED, node 2 for me)
- This is not optimal as it hurts my own production on a high-probability hex

**[2] Move robber to (0, -1, 1)**
- This blocks the wheat hex with roll 4
- Only affects my settlement at node 2
- Not strategic as it only hurts me and doesn't affect RED

**[3] Move robber to (-1, 1, 0) and steal from RED**
- This is the desert hex
- Placing robber here has no production impact
- Would gain me one random card from RED
- Wastes the robber's blocking potential

**[4] Move robber to (0, 1, -1) and steal from RED**
- This blocks a wheat hex with roll 10
- RED has 3 settlements producing from this hex (nodes 0, 16, and 19)
- This will significantly disrupt RED's wheat production
- I can also steal a resource from RED

**[5] Move robber to (1, 0, -1) and steal from RED**
- This blocks a brick hex with roll 3
- Would affect RED's settlements at nodes 0 and 6
- Brick is useful for road building, which RED needs for maintaining longest road

## Strategic Considerations:
- RED is 2 VP ahead, so disrupting their strategy is crucial
- RED has settlements producing wheat on high numbers
- RED needs brick for maintaining longest road advantage
- RED's wheat production appears to be their strength with 3 settlements on a wheat hex

<plan>
1. Block RED's wheat production by moving the robber to hex (0, 1, -1)
2. Continue focusing on breaking RED's longest road
3. Work toward gaining more knights to secure Largest Army advantage
4. Build settlements to block RED's expansion opportunities
5. Save resources for city upgrades and development cards
</plan>

Based on this analysis, I should target RED's wheat production, as it's likely crucial for their development card strategy and city upgrades. Moving the robber to the wheat hex (0, 1, -1) will impact 3 of RED's settlements while having no impact on my production. This also gives me a chance to steal a resource from RED.

- Consider the long-term impact: settlements that can't expand are less valuable

MID-GAME RESOURCE PRIORITIES:
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each possible build (cities: 1VP for 5 resources is most efficient)
- Early phase: Secure at least one good source of brick and wood for minimal expansion
- Growth phase: Prioritize ore and wheat production for city upgrades (3VP for 5 resources is optimal)
- Late phase: Focus on the fastest path to victory points, whether through buildings or development cards
- Avoid trading resources that opponents need for immediate victory point gains
- Use 4:1 trades only when necessary; prioritize port usage when possible

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and limited expansion options
- If you get an early knight, save it for defense or until you can start building toward largest army
- Time monopoly card usage for when opponents likely have accumulated specific resources
- Save year of plenty cards for completing crucial builds when you're short 1-2 specific resources
- Development cards are most valuable when:
  * You need hidden victory points to surprise opponents
  * You need knights to break up longest road or secure largest army
  * You're lacking wood/brick for expansion but have plenty of sheep/wheat/ore

EXPANSION STRATEGY:
- Build roads only with clear settlement locations in mind
- Target settlements that give you access to ports or new resources
- Block opponents' expansion paths when it gives you a strategic advantage
- Consider the timing of expansion vs. city upgrades based on your resource production
- Calculate whether longest road is achievable and worth the resource investment
- When deciding between a new settlement and a city upgrade, compare immediate vs. long-term returns

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-probability hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Save knight cards for breaking up opponent strategies or securing largest army
- Use knights defensively if you're producing valuable resources on high-probability hexes

TRADING TACTICS:
- Avoid trading resources that directly help opponents score points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades
- Trade excess resources before rolling 7 if you have more than 7 cards
- Consider bank/port trades when they enable an immediate build that advances your strategy
- When trading with players, try to receive resources that complete a build

ENDGAME STRATEGY:
- In the late game, hide your victory point potential (keep development cards hidden)
- Calculate the fastest path to 10 VP and focus exclusively on that path
- Be aware of the exact number of remaining development cards and their probabilities
- Track opponents' potential victory points, including hidden development cards
- If you're close to winning, prioritize actions that can be completed in a single turn

Before finalizing your action, check:
1. Is there a more efficient path to victory points?
2. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
3. Does this move help or hinder opponents?
4. Is there a defensive move needed to prevent an opponent from winning?
5. Are you properly diversified against dice probability?

# Game Analysis and Decision

I'll analyze the current game state, available resources, and potential actions to determine the optimal move.

## Current Game State
- **Victory Points**: I have 4 VP vs. RED's 6 VP
- **Resources**: I have 4 sheep and 1 ore
- **Largest Army**: I control it with 3 knights (+2 VP already counted)
- **Longest Road**: RED controls it with 8 segments (+2 VP)
- **Hidden VP**: I have 1 victory point development card

## Strategic Assessment
RED is ahead with 6 VP and has a strong longest road of 8 segments. My 5-segment longest road isn't close to challenging theirs yet. The robber is currently on RED's wheat hex (0, 1, -1), which is already blocking their wheat production as per my plan.

## Available Actions
My only options are to trade at unfavorable 4:1 rates or end my turn. With only sheep and ore, I can't build anything directly.

### Trade Options Analysis:
1. **Trade 4 sheep for 1 wood**: Could help toward building roads/settlements
2. **Trade 4 sheep for 1 brick**: Could help toward building roads/settlements
3. **Trade 4 sheep for 1 ore**: Would give me 2 ore total (still need 1 more for development card)
4. **Trade 4 sheep for 1 wheat**: Would give me 1 wheat (still need more resources for any build)

Let's evaluate each option:

For a development card (3 resources: 1 sheep, 1 wheat, 1 ore):
- I have 4 sheep and 1 ore
- Trading sheep for wheat would give me all needed resources

For a road (2 resources: 1 wood, 1 brick):
- I have no wood or brick
- Trading for just one of these wouldn't allow me to build

Since I'm already behind and RED is at 6 points, I need to focus on both blocking RED and advancing my position. Getting a development card could potentially give me:
- A knight (to strengthen largest army)
- A victory point card (bringing me closer to winning)
- A helpful action card

However, trading 4 sheep for 1 resource at 4:1 rate is very inefficient. Since I'm already blocking RED's wheat with the robber and can't make progress toward a meaningful build this turn, ending my turn to collect more resources is more efficient.

<plan>
1. End my turn to collect more diverse resources
2. Continue focusing on blocking RED's expansion and strengthening my position
3. Aim to get resources for development cards to secure largest army and hidden VPs
4. Look for opportunities to build settlements at strategic locations
5. Continue blocking RED's resource production with the robber
</plan>

The most efficient action is to:

PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL SETTLEMENT PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Place settlements on high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Target at least one spot with good ore and wheat production for city development
- Try to secure at least one high-probability spot (5, 6, 8, 9) for each critical resource
- Place your second settlement to complement your first (fill resource gaps)
- Aim for access to all five resources or position near useful ports if resource diversity isn't possible
- Always consider which settlements opponents are likely to place and avoid areas that will become contested
- Place roads pointing toward valuable future expansion spots, not toward the center
- Consider the long-term impact: settlements that can't expand are less valuable

MID-GAME RESOURCE PRIORITIES:
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each possible build (cities: 1VP for 5 resources is most efficient)

Based on this information, which action number do you choose? Think step by step about your options, then put the final action number in a box like \boxed{1}.
RESPONSE:
I'll analyze the available robber placement options to make the optimal strategic decision.

First, let me consider the game state:
- I'm the BLUE player with 4 VP (including largest army bonus)
- RED has 6 VP (including longest road bonus)
- RED is ahead and closer to winning
- I have 6 sheep and 1 ore in my hand

Let me evaluate each robber placement option:

[0] Move robber to (0, 0, 0) and steal from RED
- This targets the sheep hex with 8 (high probability)
- Currently produces for both RED and BLUE settlements
- RED has only one settlement here, while I have two
- This would hurt my own production significantly (I'd lose production from TWO settlements)

[1] Move robber to (1, -1, 0) and steal from RED
- This targets the wood hex with 6 (high probability)
- Affects one RED settlement and one BLUE settlement 
- Would hurt both of us, but helps me steal from RED

[2] Move robber to (0, -1, 1)
- This targets the wheat hex with 4 (low probability)
- Only affects my settlement, doesn't affect RED
- Not optimal since I'd only hurt myself

[3] Move robber to (-1, 0, 1)
- This targets the ore hex with 9 (good probability)
- Only affects my settlement, doesn't affect RED
- Not optimal as I'd only hurt myself

[4] Move robber to (-1, 1, 0) and steal from RED
- This targets the desert hex
- Desert produces nothing, so placing robber here has no effect
- Can still steal from RED, but wastes the blocking effect

[5] Move robber to (1, 0, -1) and steal from RED
- This targets the brick hex with 3 (low probability)
- Affects two RED settlements
- RED's only source of brick, which is crucial for expansion
- Doesn't hurt my production at all

Considering these options:
- Option [5] seems best as it blocks RED's only brick production, doesn't hurt my production, and lets me steal from RED
- RED has the longest road, so limiting their brick will slow their expansion
- Brick is essential for both settlements and roads
- RED is ahead at 6 VP vs my 4 VP, so hampering their progress is critical

<plan>
1. Block RED's brick production with robber to slow their expansion
2. Focus on getting resources for development cards to secure more knights and VPs
3. Try to build at least one more settlement when I get wood and brick
4. Long-term goal: challenge RED for longest road or build toward 10 VP through settlements/cities and development cards

# Game State Analysis

Let me analyze my current position and available options:

## Current Resources
- 7 sheep
- 1 ore
- No wood, brick, or wheat

## Victory Points (4/10)
- 2 settlements (2 VP)
- Largest Army bonus (2 VP)
- 1 hidden Victory Point card (1 VP) - currently at 5 VP total
- RED has 6 VP (4 settlements + Longest Road)

## Production Capabilities
- Strong sheep production (8 is a high probability number)
- Decent ore production from node 4 (9 is good)
- Some wheat production from node 2 (4 is lower probability)
- No reliable brick or wood production

## Available Actions
I can only end my turn or trade sheep through the port (4:1 ratio).

## Strategic Assessment

1) RED is ahead with 6 VP to my effective 5 VP (including hidden VP card)
2) I need 5 more points to win
3) I have 7 sheep and 1 ore, which isn't enough for any direct build
4) I can't build roads (need wood/brick) or settlements (need all resources)
5) Development cards cost sheep+wheat+ore, and I'm missing wheat
6) Trading 4 sheep for 1 resource would leave me with 3 sheep + the traded resource + 1 ore

The robber is currently on brick (3), which aligns with my plan to block RED's brick production and slow their expansion. However, I have a lot of sheep that I can't effectively use right now.

## Options Analysis

1. **End Turn** - Keep my 7 sheep and 1 ore, roll again next turn.
   - Risk: If I roll a 7, I'll have to discard half my cards
   - Benefit: Preserve resources for potential better uses next turn

2. **Trade Port: 4 sheep for 1 wheat** 
   - This would give me 3 sheep + 1 wheat + 1 ore
   - This combination doesn't let me build anything immediately
   - But with one more ore roll, I could buy a development card next turn

3. **Trade Port: 4 sheep for 1 wood/brick**
   - This doesn't get me closer to any immediate build
   - Could be useful if I get complementary resources on my next roll

4. **Trade Port: 4 sheep for 1 ore**
   - Would give me 3 sheep + 2 ore
   - Still insufficient for any immediate build
   - With one wheat roll, I could buy a development card next turn

## Strategic Direction

Given my current position, I need to focus on:
1. Getting development cards for potential victory points or knights
2. Building toward another settlement when possible
3. Protecting my largest army advantage

<plan>
1. Trade sheep for wheat to position for a development card purchase
2. Continue blocking RED's brick production with robber
3. Push for development cards to secure more VPs and maintain largest army
4. Look for settlement opportunities when I can gather wood and brick
</plan>

Trading 4 sheep for wheat (option 4) is my best move as it positions me for a development card purchase if I roll a 9 for ore on my next turn. Development cards are my most reliable path forward given my resource production.

PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL SETTLEMENT PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Place settlements on high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Target at least one spot with good ore and wheat production for city development
- Try to secure at least one high-probability spot (5, 6, 8, 9) for each critical resource
- Place your second settlement to complement your first (fill resource gaps)
- Aim for access to all five resources or position near useful ports if resource diversity isn't possible
- Always consider which settlements opponents are likely to place and avoid areas that will become contested
- Place roads pointing toward valuable future expansion spots, not toward the center
- Consider the long-term impact: settlements that can't expand are less valuable

MID-GAME RESOURCE PRIORITIES:
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each possible build (cities: 1VP for 5 resources is most efficient)
- Early phase: Secure at least one good source of brick and wood for minimal expansion
- Growth phase: Prioritize ore and wheat production for city upgrades (3VP for 5 resources is optimal)
- Late phase: Focus on the fastest path to victory points, whether through buildings or development cards
- Avoid trading resources that opponents need for immediate victory point gains
- Use 4:1 trades only when necessary; prioritize port usage when possible

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and limited expansion options
- If you get an early knight, save it for defense or until you can start building toward largest army
- Time monopoly card usage for when opponents likely have accumulated specific resources
- Save year of plenty cards for completing crucial builds when you're short 1-2 specific resources
- Development cards are most valuable when:
  * You need hidden victory points to surprise opponents
  * You need knights to break up longest road or secure largest army
  * You're lacking wood/brick for expansion but have plenty of sheep/wheat/ore

EXPANSION STRATEGY:
- Build roads only with clear settlement locations in mind
- Target settlements that give you access to ports or new resources
- Block opponents' expansion paths when it gives you a strategic advantage
- Consider the timing of expansion vs. city upgrades based on your resource production
- Calculate whether longest road is achievable and worth the resource investment
- When deciding between a new settlement and a city upgrade, compare immediate vs. long-term returns

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-probability hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Save knight cards for breaking up opponent strategies or securing largest army
- Use knights defensively if you're producing valuable resources on high-probability hexes

TRADING TACTICS:
- Avoid trading resources that directly help opponents score points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades
- Trade excess resources before rolling 7 if you have more than 7 cards
- Consider bank/port trades when they enable an immediate build that advances your strategy
- When trading with players, try to receive resources that complete a build

ENDGAME STRATEGY:
- In the late game, hide your victory point potential (keep development cards hidden)
- Calculate the fastest path to 10 VP and focus exclusively on that path
- Be aware of the exact number of remaining development cards and their probabilities
- Track opponents' potential victory points, including hidden development cards
- If you're close to winning, prioritize actions that can be completed in a single turn

Before finalizing your action, check:
1. Is there a more efficient path to victory points?
2. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
3. Does this move help or hinder opponents?
4. Is there a defensive move needed to prevent an opponent from winning?
5. Are you properly diversified against dice probability?

# Game Analysis for Turn 112

Let me analyze the current game state and available options:

## Current Situation
- I have 4 VP (2 settlements + 2 for largest army + hidden VP card = 5 VP total)
- RED has 6 VP (4 settlements + 2 for longest road)
- I currently have 3 sheep, 1 wheat, 1 ore
- Only two available actions: end turn [0] or buy a development card [1]
- Robber is currently blocking RED's brick production at (1,0,-1)

## Dev Card Analysis
If I buy a development card (costs 1 sheep, 1 wheat, 1 ore):
- Possible outcomes:
  - Victory Point card: Would increase my VPs to 6 (still hidden)
  - Knight: Strengthens my largest army bonus and helps keep the robber on RED's resources
  - Year of Plenty/Monopoly/Road Building: All utility cards that could help in future turns

## Current Resources
After buying a dev card, I would have 2 sheep remaining and no other resources.

## Strategic Considerations
- RED is 4 VP away from winning (at 6/10)
- I'm 5 VP away from winning (at 5/10 including my hidden VP)
- Buying a dev card gives me a chance at another VP or knight to solidify largest army
- Getting a VP card would bring me to 6 VP, and I'd need 4 more to win
- If I don't buy anything, I risk losing resources to a 7 roll and make no progress

<plan>
1. Buy development cards to secure more VPs or knights
2. Continue blocking RED's brick production with robber
3. Look to build settlements when I can gather wood and brick
4. Aim for city upgrades when possible as they're resource-efficient for VPs
</plan>

The optimal play is to buy a development card, as it's my only productive move and aligns with my strategy of securing more VPs while maintaining largest army.

# Analysis of Game State

Let me analyze the current game state to determine the optimal action:

## Current Victory Points
- BLUE (me): 4/10 VP (2 settlements + 2 VP from largest army + 1 hidden VP card = 5/10)
- RED: 6/10 VP (4 settlements + 2 VP from longest road)

RED is ahead with 6 VP versus my effective 5 VP (including hidden VP card).

## Resource Analysis
I currently have:
- 2 sheep
- 1 Year of Plenty card
- 1 hidden Victory Point card

My settlements produce:
- Node 2: sheep (8), wood (6), wheat (4)
- Node 4: sheep (8), ore (9)

Good production of sheep and decent production of wood and ore, but limited wheat and no brick.

## Strategic Options

1. **Play Year of Plenty**:
   - I could use it to get resources for specific builds
   - Key options: brick+wood (for road/settlement), wheat+ore (for city or dev card)

2. **Roll the dice**:
   - Potentially get more resources before deciding next move
   - Risk robber activation if I roll a 7

## Objective Assessment

The most efficient builds for me would be:
- City upgrade (2 VP for 3 ore + 2 wheat)
- New settlement (1 VP for 1 wood + 1 brick + 1 sheep + 1 wheat)
- Development card (potential VP or knight for 1 ore + 1 wheat + 1 sheep)

With my current resources (2 sheep) and Year of Plenty, I need to determine which build path gets me closer to victory fastest.

## Decision Process

Since I have 5 effective VP (including hidden VP card) and need 10 to win, I need 5 more VP.

Options with Year of Plenty:
1. Get wood+brick: Could build 1 road but not a settlement yet (need wheat)
2. Get wheat+ore: Could save toward city or dev card (need more ore for city)
3. Get brick+brick: Not immediately useful without other resources

The most strategic approach is to roll first to see what resources I get naturally. If I get resources that complement what I need, I can then use Year of Plenty more effectively to complete a build.

<plan>
1. Roll first to gather resources naturally
2. Use Year of Plenty strategically to complete specific builds after seeing roll results
3. Focus on either settlement expansion if I get wood/brick or city/development cards if I get wheat/ore
4. Continue blocking RED's brick production with robber when possible
5. Watch for opportunity to extend road network if RED's longest road can be challenged
</plan>

Therefore, I choose to roll the dice.

- Avoid trading resources that opponents need for immediate victory point gains
- Use 4:1 trades only when necessary; prioritize port usage when possible

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and limited expansion options
- If you get an early knight, save it for defense or until you can start building toward largest army
- Time monopoly card usage for when opponents likely have accumulated specific resources
- Save year of plenty cards for completing crucial builds when you're short 1-2 specific resources
- Development cards are most valuable when:
  * You need hidden victory points to surprise opponents
  * You need knights to break up longest road or secure largest army
  * You're lacking wood/brick for expansion but have plenty of sheep/wheat/ore

EXPANSION STRATEGY:
- Build roads only with clear settlement locations in mind
- Target settlements that give you access to ports or new resources
- Block opponents' expansion paths when it gives you a strategic advantage
- Consider the timing of expansion vs. city upgrades based on your resource production
- Calculate whether longest road is achievable and worth the resource investment
- When deciding between a new settlement and a city upgrade, compare immediate vs. long-term returns

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-probability hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Save knight cards for breaking up opponent strategies or securing largest army
- Use knights defensively if you're producing valuable resources on high-probability hexes

TRADING TACTICS:
- Avoid trading resources that directly help opponents score points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades
- Trade excess resources before rolling 7 if you have more than 7 cards
- Consider bank/port trades when they enable an immediate build that advances your strategy
- When trading with players, try to receive resources that complete a build

ENDGAME STRATEGY:
- In the late game, hide your victory point potential (keep development cards hidden)
- Calculate the fastest path to 10 VP and focus exclusively on that path
- Be aware of the exact number of remaining development cards and their probabilities
- Track opponents' potential victory points, including hidden development cards
- If you're close to winning, prioritize actions that can be completed in a single turn

Before finalizing your action, check:
1. Is there a more efficient path to victory points?
2. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
3. Does this move help or hinder opponents?
4. Is there a defensive move needed to prevent an opponent from winning?
5. Are you properly diversified against dice probability?

TURN 114 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Roll first to gather resources naturally
2. Use Year of Plenty strategically to complete specific builds after seeing roll results
3. Focus on either settlement expansion if I get wood/brick or city/development cards if I get wheat/ore
4. Continue blocking RED's brick production with robber when possible
5. Watch for opportunity to extend road network if RED's longest road can be challenged

# Game Analysis for Blue Player

## Current Game State Assessment
- I'm BLUE with 4 VP (2 settlements, largest army bonus (+2 VP), 1 hidden VP card)
- RED has 6 VP (4 settlements, longest road bonus (+2 VP))
- Resources: I have 2 sheep and 1 wheat
- Development cards: I have 1 Year of Plenty and 1 Victory Point card
- Robber is on a brick hex (1,0,-1) blocking RED's brick production
- The game is in late stages as many development cards have been played

## Strategic Options Analysis

My current situation requires careful planning. With RED at 6 VP, they're 4 VP away from winning. I'm at 4 VP (plus 1 hidden VP), so I need 5 more VP.

Available options:
1. Play Year of Plenty to get resources for immediate building
2. End my turn and save the Year of Plenty for later

### Resource Analysis
To win, I need to prioritize efficient VP generation:
- Building 2 settlements (2 VP) and 1 city (1 VP) would cost: 4 wood, 4 brick, 2 wheat, 2 ore
- Building 1 city (1 VP) and buying 1 dev card (potentially 1 VP) would cost: 3 ore, 3 wheat
- Challenging RED's longest road would require extending my road network

Given my current resources (2 sheep, 1 wheat), the Year of Plenty card is critical for immediate building.

### Evaluation of Year of Plenty Options

Taking brick and wood would allow me to build a road immediately, working toward:
1. Expanding to new settlements
2. Potentially challenging RED's longest road bonus

Taking wheat and ore would progress toward:
1. City upgrades (need 3 ore, 2 wheat)
2. Development cards (need 1 ore, 1 wheat, 1 sheep)

I currently can't build any settlements without first building roads to reach new nodes. I also can't immediately build a development card or upgrade to a city with any single Year of Plenty option.

## Decision Logic

Since RED is at 6 VP and I'm at effective 5 VP (including my hidden VP card), I need to focus on the most efficient path to additional VPs.

Looking at the options:
- Option [3] (wood + brick) would allow immediate road building to expand
- Option [6] (wheat + ore) would give me 2 wheat, 1 ore - getting closer to city/development card
- Option [9] (brick + ore) diversifies my resources but doesn't complete any build

**Strategic reasoning**: Building a road now puts me on a path to settlement expansion, but doesn't give immediate VP gain. RED already has longest road, and I need multiple roads to challenge it. Meanwhile, gaining wheat+ore positions me closer to city upgrades or development cards, which provide more efficient VP returns.

<plan>
1. Get wheat+ore from Year of Plenty to prepare for city upgrade or development card
2. Position for future expansion by getting ore which I currently don't produce
3. Try to get wood/brick from next dice roll to enable settlement expansion
4. Keep robber on RED's brick production to slow their progress
5. Focus on city upgrade at a settlement with good production as soon as I can gather 3 ore, 2 wheat
</plan>

Based on this analysis, I choose option 6: Play Year of Plenty for wheat and ore.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL SETTLEMENT PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Place settlements on high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Target at least one spot with good ore and wheat production for city development
- Try to secure at least one high-probability spot (5, 6, 8, 9) for each critical resource
- Place your second settlement to complement your first (fill resource gaps)
- Aim for access to all five resources or position near useful ports if resource diversity isn't possible
- Always consider which settlements opponents are likely to place and avoid areas that will become contested
- Place roads pointing toward valuable future expansion spots, not toward the center
- Consider the long-term impact: settlements that can't expand are less valuable

MID-GAME RESOURCE PRIORITIES:
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each possible build (cities: 1VP for 5 resources is most efficient)
- Early phase: Secure at least one good source of brick and wood for minimal expansion
- Growth phase: Prioritize ore and wheat production for city upgrades (3VP for 5 resources is optimal)
- Late phase: Focus on the fastest path to victory points, whether through buildings or development cards
- Avoid trading resources that opponents need for immediate victory point gains
- Use 4:1 trades only when necessary; prioritize port usage when possible

# Game State Analysis

Let me carefully analyze the current game state:

## My Position:
- I have 4 victory points (2 settlements + 2 VP from Largest Army)
- I have 1 hidden Victory Point card, so I'm actually at 5VP
- Resources: 2 sheep, 2 wheat, 1 ore
- No other development cards in hand
- My settlements produce sheep (8), wheat (4), wood (6), and ore (9)

## Opponent Position:
- RED has 6 victory points (4 settlements + 2 VP from Longest Road)
- They have 4 hidden resource cards
- They have settlements producing sheep (8), wheat (10), brick (3), and wood (6)
- RED is leading by 1-2 VP

## Available Actions:
- [0] End turn
- [1] Buy a development card (1 sheep, 1 wheat, 1 ore)

## Decision Analysis:

If I buy a development card, I'll spend all my resources but could get:
- A Victory Point card (immediate hidden VP)
- A Knight card (can protect my resources or attack RED)
- A Progress card (Road Building, Year of Plenty, Monopoly)

If I end my turn:
- I keep my resources for future builds
- I might get more resources on the next roll to build something substantial
- I risk losing resources to a "7" roll if I accumulate more than 7 cards

Looking at the long-term strategy:
1. I need 5 more VP to win
2. RED needs 4 more VP to win
3. I have few resources for future builds
4. A development card could potentially give me a hidden VP or useful action

Since I already have Largest Army, getting another Knight wouldn't immediately help my VP count, but could protect my production or disrupt RED. A VP card would be ideal.

<plan>
1. Buy development card hoping for VP or utility
2. Focus on building cities with future ore and wheat production
3. Look for settlement expansion opportunities with my extensive road network
4. Keep robber on RED's resources to slow their progress
5. Track hidden VP potential (I already have 1 hidden VP)
</plan>

Given my limited resources and the fact that I can afford a development card, buying one is the optimal move. It could be a VP card which brings me closer to winning, or a utility card that helps me in future turns.

# Game Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state and evaluate my options:

## Victory Point Assessment
- BLUE (me): 4 VP (2 settlements + 2 VP from largest army + 2 hidden VP from cards)
- RED: 6 VP (4 settlements + 2 VP from longest road)
- Reality: I actually have 6 VP due to my hidden VP cards

## Resource Assessment
- I have 5 sheep and 1 wheat
- RED has 6 hidden cards
- Limited options with current resources

## Board Position
- I have extensive road network (16 roads with longest at 5)
- RED has longest road with 8 segments
- Robber is on brick (3) which affects RED

## Available Actions
0. End turn
1-4. Maritime trade options (4:1 ratio for trading sheep)

## Decision Analysis

With my current resources (5 sheep, 1 wheat), I cannot:
- Build a settlement (2 wheat + 2 brick + 1 sheep + 1 wood)
- Build a city (3 ore + 2 wheat)
- Build a road (1 brick + 1 wood)
- Buy a development card (1 ore + 1 wheat + 1 sheep)

I'm one wheat short of buying a development card. Since I already have 2 hidden VP cards, buying more development cards could be a direct path to victory if I get another VP card.

Trading options:
- I could trade 4 sheep for 1 wheat (option 4), then I'd have 2 wheat and 1 sheep
- This would enable me to possibly buy a development card on my next turn if I collect an ore

Looking at the long term:
- I already have 6 VP (4 visible + 2 hidden)
- RED has 6 VP (all visible)
- I need 4 more VP to win
- Development cards are my quickest path to victory since I already have 2 hidden VP

<plan>
1. End turn now - trading 4 sheep for 1 wheat is inefficient
2. Hope to collect ore and wheat on next rolls to buy development cards
3. Continue building toward promising settlement locations with my extensive road network
4. Maintain largest army for the 2 VP bonus
5. Track that I actually have 6 VP (not 4) with my hidden VP cards
</plan>

None of the available actions advance my position efficiently. Maritime trading at 4:1 is very inefficient. I'll conserve my resources and wait for better opportunities on my next turn, hoping for more favorable dice rolls.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL SETTLEMENT PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Place settlements on high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Target at least one spot with good ore and wheat production for city development
- Try to secure at least one high-probability spot (5, 6, 8, 9) for each critical resource
- Place your second settlement to complement your first (fill resource gaps)
- Aim for access to all five resources or position near useful ports if resource diversity isn't possible
- Always consider which settlements opponents are likely to place and avoid areas that will become contested
- Place roads pointing toward valuable future expansion spots, not toward the center
- Consider the long-term impact: settlements that can't expand are less valuable

MID-GAME RESOURCE PRIORITIES:
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each possible build (cities: 1VP for 5 resources is most efficient)
- Early phase: Secure at least one good source of brick and wood for minimal expansion
- Growth phase: Prioritize ore and wheat production for city upgrades (3VP for 5 resources is optimal)
- Late phase: Focus on the fastest path to victory points, whether through buildings or development cards
- Avoid trading resources that opponents need for immediate victory point gains
- Use 4:1 trades only when necessary; prioritize port usage when possible

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and limited expansion options
- If you get an early knight, save it for defense or until you can start building toward largest army
- Time monopoly card usage for when opponents likely have accumulated specific resources
- Save year of plenty cards for completing crucial builds when you're short 1-2 specific resources
- Development cards are most valuable when:
  * You need hidden victory points to surprise opponents
  * You need knights to break up longest road or secure largest army
  * You're lacking wood/brick for expansion but have plenty of sheep/wheat/ore

EXPANSION STRATEGY:
- Build roads only with clear settlement locations in mind
- Target settlements that give you access to ports or new resources
- Block opponents' expansion paths when it gives you a strategic advantage
- Consider the timing of expansion vs. city upgrades based on your resource production
- Calculate whether longest road is achievable and worth the resource investment
- When deciding between a new settlement and a city upgrade, compare immediate vs. long-term returns

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-probability hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Save knight cards for breaking up opponent strategies or securing largest army
- Use knights defensively if you're producing valuable resources on high-probability hexes

TRADING TACTICS:
- Avoid trading resources that directly help opponents score points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades
- Trade excess resources before rolling 7 if you have more than 7 cards
- Consider bank/port trades when they enable an immediate build that advances your strategy
- When trading with players, try to receive resources that complete a build

ENDGAME STRATEGY:
- In the late game, hide your victory point potential (keep development cards hidden)
- Calculate the fastest path to 10 VP and focus exclusively on that path
- Be aware of the exact number of remaining development cards and their probabilities
- Track opponents' potential victory points, including hidden development cards
- If you're close to winning, prioritize actions that can be completed in a single turn

Before finalizing your action, check:
1. Is there a more efficient path to victory points?
2. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
3. Does this move help or hinder opponents?
4. Is there a defensive move needed to prevent an opponent from winning?
5. Are you properly diversified against dice probability?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

5. Track that I actually have 6 VP (not 4) with my hidden VP cards

# Game Analysis: Move Robber Decision

I need to decide where to place the robber to maximize my winning chances. Let me analyze the options systematically.

## Current Game State Assessment
- I have 6 VP total (4 visible + 2 hidden VP cards)
- RED has 6 VP (4 settlements + 2 VP from longest road)
- I have the largest army (+2 VP) which I need to maintain
- My current resources: 5 sheep, 1 wheat, 1 ore
- My plan involves buying development cards to possibly get more knights or VP cards

## Robber Placement Options Analysis

Let me examine each hex and what resources they produce:
- (0, 0, 0): Sheep 8 [⭐⭐⭐] - High-probability sheep
- (1, -1, 0): Wood 6 [⭐⭐⭐] - High-probability wood
- (0, -1, 1): Wheat 4 [⭐] - Low-probability wheat
- (-1, 0, 1): Ore 9 [⭐⭐] - Medium-probability ore
- (-1, 1, 0): Desert - No production
- (0, 1, -1): Wheat 10 [⭐] - Low-probability wheat

Now looking at impact on players:

Option 0: Move robber to (0, 0, 0) Sheep 8 and steal from RED
- This blocks a high-value sheep hex
- Affects both RED (1 settlement) and me (2 settlements)
- I'd be hurting my own production more than RED's
- NOT GOOD

Option 1: Move robber to (1, -1, 0) Wood 6 and steal from RED
- This blocks high-probability wood
- Affects RED (1 settlement) and me (1 settlement)
- Equal impact on both players
- Potential option

Option 2: Move robber to (0, -1, 1) Wheat 4
- This blocks low-probability wheat
- No stealing opportunity
- Low strategic value
- NOT GOOD

Option 3: Move robber to (-1, 0, 1) Ore 9
- This blocks medium-probability ore
- Only affects me (1 settlement)
- Would hurt my own production
- NOT GOOD

Option 4: Move robber to (-1, 1, 0) Desert and steal from RED
- Desert has no production
- Can still steal from RED
- Doesn't block any resources
- GOOD OPTION

Option 5: Move robber to (0, 1, -1) Wheat 10 and steal from RED
- This blocks low-probability wheat
- Affects RED (2 settlements)
- Doesn't affect my production
- GOOD OPTION

## Decision Logic

The best options are:
- Option 4: Desert (no production blocked) but still steal from RED
- Option 5: Wheat 10 (blocks two of RED's settlements) and steal from RED

Between these two, Option 5 is more strategically valuable because:
1. It blocks two of RED's settlements that produce wheat on a 10
2. I can still steal from RED
3. It doesn't affect my production at all
4. Wheat could be valuable for RED to build settlements or buy development cards

<plan>
1. Place robber on Wheat 10 hex to block RED's wheat production
2. Continue collecting resources for development cards, focusing on ore/wheat
3. Maintain largest army bonus
4. Look for settlement opportunities using my extensive road network
5. Track my actual VP count of 6 (not 4) due to hidden VP cards
</plan>

PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

- Place roads pointing toward valuable future expansion spots, not toward the center
- Consider the long-term impact: settlements that can't expand are less valuable

MID-GAME RESOURCE PRIORITIES:
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each possible build (cities: 1VP for 5 resources is most efficient)
- Early phase: Secure at least one good source of brick and wood for minimal expansion
- Growth phase: Prioritize ore and wheat production for city upgrades (3VP for 5 resources is optimal)
- Late phase: Focus on the fastest path to victory points, whether through buildings or development cards
- Avoid trading resources that opponents need for immediate victory point gains
- Use 4:1 trades only when necessary; prioritize port usage when possible

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and limited expansion options
- If you get an early knight, save it for defense or until you can start building toward largest army
- Time monopoly card usage for when opponents likely have accumulated specific resources
- Save year of plenty cards for completing crucial builds when you're short 1-2 specific resources

# Game Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state carefully and determine the optimal action:

## Game Status Assessment
- I have 4 visible VPs + 2 hidden VP cards = 6 total VPs
- RED has 6 VPs (4 settlements + Longest Road bonus)
- I have Largest Army bonus (+2 VP)
- My resources: 5 Sheep, 1 Wheat, 2 Ore
- Missing resources for immediate expansion: Wood and Brick

## Victory Path Analysis
To reach 10 VPs, I need 4 more VPs. Potential sources:
1. Building settlements (+1 VP each)
2. Upgrading to cities (+1 VP each)
3. More development cards (chance for VP cards)
4. Taking longest road from RED (unlikely with my 5 vs their 9)

## Available Actions
0. End turn (no build)
1. Buy a development card (cost: 1 Sheep, 1 Wheat, 1 Ore)
2-5. Maritime trades using Sheep

## Action Analysis

**Option 1: Buy a Development Card**
- Costs: 1 Sheep, 1 Wheat, 1 Ore
- Potential gains:
  - 20% chance of VP card (16 cards left in bank)
  - Knight would strengthen largest army lead
  - Year of Plenty or Monopoly could help future builds
- I have enough resources for this purchase

**Options 2-5: Maritime Trades**
- All require 4 Sheep for 1 resource
- Not efficient use of resources since I'd still lack complementary resources
- Trading for Wood or Brick wouldn't enable immediate settlement building

**Option 0: End Turn**
- Preserve resources for future turns
- May get better trades or rolls next turn
- No immediate progress toward victory

## Strategic Considerations
1. I have an extensive road network but can't build settlements without Wood/Brick
2. Development cards offer the most efficient path to victory given my resources
3. With 16 cards left in bank, odds of valuable cards are still good
4. RED is close to winning with 6 VP, so I need to maintain momentum

<plan>
1. Buy development cards to find VP cards or knights
2. Continue strengthening largest army advantage
3. Save resources for settlement/city opportunities
4. If I get Year of Plenty/Monopoly, use them to acquire brick/wood for expansion
5. Track my actual VP count of 6 (not 4) due to hidden VP cards
</plan>

Given my resources and position, buying a development card is clearly the optimal play. This could potentially give me another VP card or knight to strengthen my largest army advantage. With my resources, it's the only productive build I can make this turn.

INITIAL SETTLEMENT PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Place settlements on high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Target at least one spot with good ore and wheat production for city development
- Try to secure at least one high-probability spot (5, 6, 8, 9) for each critical resource
- Place your second settlement to complement your first (fill resource gaps)
- Aim for access to all five resources or position near useful ports if resource diversity isn't possible
- Always consider which settlements opponents are likely to place and avoid areas that will become contested
- Place roads pointing toward valuable future expansion spots, not toward the center
- Consider the long-term impact: settlements that can't expand are less valuable

MID-GAME RESOURCE PRIORITIES:
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each possible build (cities: 1VP for 5 resources is most efficient)
- Early phase: Secure at least one good source of brick and wood for minimal expansion
- Growth phase: Prioritize ore and wheat production for city upgrades (3VP for 5 resources is optimal)
- Late phase: Focus on the fastest path to victory points, whether through buildings or development cards
- Avoid trading resources that opponents need for immediate victory point gains
- Use 4:1 trades only when necessary; prioritize port usage when possible

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and limited expansion options
- If you get an early knight, save it for defense or until you can start building toward largest army
- Time monopoly card usage for when opponents likely have accumulated specific resources
- Save year of plenty cards for completing crucial builds when you're short 1-2 specific resources
- Development cards are most valuable when:
  * You need hidden victory points to surprise opponents
  * You need knights to break up longest road or secure largest army
  * You're lacking wood/brick for expansion but have plenty of sheep/wheat/ore

EXPANSION STRATEGY:
- Build roads only with clear settlement locations in mind
- Target settlements that give you access to ports or new resources
- Block opponents' expansion paths when it gives you a strategic advantage
- Consider the timing of expansion vs. city upgrades based on your resource production
- Calculate whether longest road is achievable and worth the resource investment
- When deciding between a new settlement and a city upgrade, compare immediate vs. long-term returns

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-probability hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Save knight cards for breaking up opponent strategies or securing largest army
- Use knights defensively if you're producing valuable resources on high-probability hexes

TRADING TACTICS:
- Avoid trading resources that directly help opponents score points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades
- Trade excess resources before rolling 7 if you have more than 7 cards
- Consider bank/port trades when they enable an immediate build that advances your strategy
- When trading with players, try to receive resources that complete a build

ENDGAME STRATEGY:
- In the late game, hide your victory point potential (keep development cards hidden)
- Calculate the fastest path to 10 VP and focus exclusively on that path
- Be aware of the exact number of remaining development cards and their probabilities
- Track opponents' potential victory points, including hidden development cards
- If you're close to winning, prioritize actions that can be completed in a single turn

Before finalizing your action, check:
1. Is there a more efficient path to victory points?
2. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
3. Does this move help or hinder opponents?
4. Is there a defensive move needed to prevent an opponent from winning?
5. Are you properly diversified against dice probability?

- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game Analysis and Strategic Decision

Let me break down the current game state and analyze my options:

## Current Game Status:
- **My Victory Points**: 4 visible + 3 hidden VP cards = 7 VP total (need 3 more to win)
- **Red's Victory Points**: 6 VP (4 settlements + Longest Road bonus)
- **My Resources**: 4 Sheep, 1 Ore
- **Largest Army**: I have it with 3 knights (+2 VP)
- **Longest Road**: Red has it with 9 segments (+2 VP)

## Strategic Assessment:

1. **Victory Path Analysis**:
   - I need 3 more VP to win (currently at 7 VP total)
   - Potential sources for remaining VP:
     - Settlement = 1 VP (costs: 1 Brick + 1 Wood + 1 Sheep + 1 Wheat)
     - City = 2 VP (costs: 3 Ore + 2 Wheat)
     - Development card = chance for VP card or knight to strengthen army

2. **Resource Situation**:
   - I have 4 Sheep + 1 Ore
   - Missing Brick, Wood, and Wheat for immediate builds
   - Cannot currently build any structures without trading

3. **Options Evaluation**:
   - **End Turn** (Option 0): No immediate gain, but preserves resources
   - **Trade for Wood** (Option 1): Could be part of working toward a settlement
   - **Trade for Brick** (Option 2): Could be part of working toward a settlement
   - **Trade for Ore** (Option 3): Would give me 2 Ore total, but still not enough for a City
   - **Trade for Wheat** (Option 4): Could be part of working toward a settlement or dev card

4. **Development Card Strategy**:
   - Development cards cost 1 Sheep + 1 Wheat + 1 Ore
   - I have Sheep and Ore, but no Wheat
   - Trading for Wheat would enable a development card purchase
   - 15 development cards remaining - good chance for VP cards or knights

## Decision Logic:

Trading 4 Sheep for 1 Wheat (Option 4) would leave me with 1 Ore and 1 Wheat. This would position me to buy a development card next turn if I can acquire 1 more Sheep through production.

Since I already have 3 hidden VP cards, buying more development cards gives me a good chance at finding additional VP cards or knights that could further secure my largest army bonus.

Red currently has 6 VP with longest road, so preventing them from gaining more VP is critical. Trading my sheep surplus now allows me to make progress toward another build while reducing hand size (protecting against the robber).

<plan>
1. Trade 4 Sheep for 1 Wheat
2. Save resources for development card purchase next turn
3. Continue development card strategy to find VP cards or knights
4. If I get resource-generating cards, focus on acquiring brick/wood for settlement expansion
5. Maintain largest army advantage to preserve those 2 VP
</plan>

Based on this analysis, I'll trade 4 Sheep for 1 Wheat:

# Game Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state and my available options:

## Current Game State
- I have 4 VP (2 from settlements, 2 from largest army)
- RED has 6 VP (4 from settlements, 2 from longest road)
- I have 2 Wheat and 3 Ore
- I have 3 hidden Victory Point cards
- With my hidden VP cards, I actually have 7 VP total (only need 3 more)
- Robber is on Wheat (10) - blocking RED's production, not mine

## Victory Point Count (Real)
- Me (BLUE): 4 visible VP + 3 hidden VP = 7 VP
- RED: 6 visible VP

## Resource Assessment
- I have exactly enough resources (2 Wheat, 3 Ore) to build a city
- Cities give +1 VP and double resource production

## Available Actions
1. End Turn
2. Upgrade settlement at node 2 (produces Sheep 8, Timber 6, Wheat 4)
3. Upgrade settlement at node 4 (produces Sheep 8, Ore 9)

## Strategic Analysis

Option 1 (End Turn):
- Saves resources for possible development card next turn
- But RED is at 6 VP and might be close to winning
- No strategic advantage to holding resources

Option 2 (City at node 2):
- Gain +1 VP, reaching 8 total VP (5 visible)
- Doubles production of Sheep 8, Timber 6, and Wheat 4
- Most diverse resource boost

Option 3 (City at node 4):
- Gain +1 VP, reaching 8 total VP (5 visible)
- Doubles production of Sheep 8 and Ore 9
- Better for city-building strategy (Ore is critical)

## Decision Making
Building a city is clearly better than ending turn since:
1. I need to catch up to RED's visible VP count (they have 6)
2. I have exactly enough resources for a city
3. A city provides immediate VP and long-term production boost

Between the two city locations, node 4 is superior because:
- Ore is more valuable in the late game for city upgrades and development cards
- Production numbers are better (8 and 9 are top probabilities)
- RED appears to be focusing on Wheat production, so I should focus on Ore

<plan>
1. Upgrade settlement at node 4 to city (gaining 1 VP, reaching 8 total VP with hidden cards)
2. Continue development card strategy if possible
3. Use increased Ore production to build more cities or buy development cards
4. Work toward 10 VP through a combination of visible builds and hidden victory points
5. Maintain largest army advantage
</plan>

The optimal action is to build a city at node 4:

# Analyzing the Robber Placement Options

Let me analyze each option for moving the robber:

[0] Move robber to (0, 0, 0) - This is the sheep (🐑) hex with 8 probability
[1] Move robber to (1, -1, 0) - This is the wood (🌲) hex with 6 probability
[2] Move robber to (0, -1, 1) - This is the wheat (🌾) hex with 4 probability
[3] Move robber to (-1, 1, 0) - This is the desert (🏜️) hex with no production
[4] Move robber to (0, 1, -1) - This is the wheat (🌾) hex with 10 probability
[5] Move robber to (1, 0, -1) - This is the brick (🧱) hex with 3 probability

## Strategic Considerations:
1. I want to block RED player's highest-value production since they're leading with 6 VPs
2. I should avoid blocking my own production
3. Desert hex has no strategic value since it produces nothing
4. RED has settlements at nodes 0, 6, 16, and 19

## Analyzing RED's Production:
- Node 0: Sheep(8), Wheat(10), Brick(3)
- Node 6: Wood(6), Brick(3)
- Node 16: Wheat(10)
- Node 19: Wheat(10)

The highest productivity hex for RED is the Sheep(8), followed by Wood(6) and Wheat(10).

However, I also produce from Sheep(8) at both my settlement and city, so blocking that would hurt me more than RED. Wheat(10) is important for RED as two settlements produce from it, and they'll need wheat for development cards or cities.

The Wood(6) hex is also highly productive (⭐⭐⭐) and used by RED at node 6. This could be a strong option, but it would also block my settlement at node 2.

## Best Strategic Choice:
Option [4] - Move robber to (0, 1, -1), the Wheat(10) hex, is optimal because:
- It blocks two RED settlements (nodes 16 and 19)
- It targets a resource RED will need for development cards and cities
- It doesn't block any of my own production
- Wheat is essential for both development cards and cities, limiting RED's ability to gain VPs

<plan>
1. Block RED's wheat production to slow their progress 
2. Focus on building my third settlement or upgrading to another city
3. Continue development card strategy to maintain Largest Army advantage
4. Work toward 10 VP through a combination of visible builds and hidden victory points
5. Consider how to disrupt RED's longest road advantage if possible
</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL SETTLEMENT PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Place settlements on high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Target at least one spot with good ore and wheat production for city development
- Try to secure at least one high-probability spot (5, 6, 8, 9) for each critical resource
- Place your second settlement to complement your first (fill resource gaps)
- Aim for access to all five resources or position near useful ports if resource diversity isn't possible
- Always consider which settlements opponents are likely to place and avoid areas that will become contested
- Place roads pointing toward valuable future expansion spots, not toward the center
- Consider the long-term impact: settlements that can't expand are less valuable

MID-GAME RESOURCE PRIORITIES:
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each possible build (cities: 1VP for 5 resources is most efficient)
- Early phase: Secure at least one good source of brick and wood for minimal expansion
- Growth phase: Prioritize ore and wheat production for city upgrades (3VP for 5 resources is optimal)
- Late phase: Focus on the fastest path to victory points, whether through buildings or development cards
- Avoid trading resources that opponents need for immediate victory point gains
- Use 4:1 trades only when necessary; prioritize port usage when possible

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and limited expansion options
- If you get an early knight, save it for defense or until you can start building toward largest army
- Time monopoly card usage for when opponents likely have accumulated specific resources
- Save year of plenty cards for completing crucial builds when you're short 1-2 specific resources
- Development cards are most valuable when:
  * You need hidden victory points to surprise opponents
  * You need knights to break up longest road or secure largest army
  * You're lacking wood/brick for expansion but have plenty of sheep/wheat/ore

EXPANSION STRATEGY:
- Build roads only with clear settlement locations in mind
- Target settlements that give you access to ports or new resources
- Block opponents' expansion paths when it gives you a strategic advantage
- Consider the timing of expansion vs. city upgrades based on your resource production
- Calculate whether longest road is achievable and worth the resource investment
- When deciding between a new settlement and a city upgrade, compare immediate vs. long-term returns

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-probability hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Save knight cards for breaking up opponent strategies or securing largest army
- Use knights defensively if you're producing valuable resources on high-probability hexes

TRADING TACTICS:
- Avoid trading resources that directly help opponents score points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades
- Trade excess resources before rolling 7 if you have more than 7 cards
- Consider bank/port trades when they enable an immediate build that advances your strategy
- When trading with players, try to receive resources that complete a build

ENDGAME STRATEGY:
- In the late game, hide your victory point potential (keep development cards hidden)
- Calculate the fastest path to 10 VP and focus exclusively on that path
- Be aware of the exact number of remaining development cards and their probabilities
- Track opponents' potential victory points, including hidden development cards
- If you're close to winning, prioritize actions that can be completed in a single turn

Before finalizing your action, check:
1. Is there a more efficient path to victory points?
2. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
3. Does this move help or hinder opponents?
4. Is there a defensive move needed to prevent an opponent from winning?
5. Are you properly diversified against dice probability?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game Analysis: Robber Placement Decision

Let me analyze the board state and determine the optimal robber placement.

## Current Game State Assessment:
- BLUE (me): 5 VP (2 from Largest Army, 1 settlement, 1 city, and 3 victory point cards)
- RED: 6 VP (2 from Longest Road, 4 settlements)
- RED is ahead by 1 VP and has good wheat production with two settlements on wheat (10)

## Strategic Goals:
- Disrupt RED's resource production to slow their progress toward 10 VP
- Position myself to continue executing my overall strategy

## Robber Placement Options Analysis:

[0] Move robber to (0, 0, 0) - Sheep 8:
- Affects: Both BLUE and RED
- BLUE has a city and settlement here (high production value)
- RED has one settlement here
- This would hurt my own production significantly

[1] Move robber to (1, -1, 0) - Wood 6:
- Affects: Both BLUE and RED
- BLUE has one settlement here
- RED has one settlement here
- Would disrupt both players equally on an important resource

[2] Move robber to (0, -1, 1) - Wheat 4:
- Affects: BLUE only
- Low production value (4 is less likely)
- Would only hurt myself

[3] Move robber to (-1, 0, 1) - Ore 9:
- Affects: BLUE only
- Would block my city's ore production
- Would only hurt myself

[4] Move robber to (-1, 1, 0) - Desert:
- Desert produces nothing, so placing robber here has no effect
- This would be wasting the robber move

[5] Move robber to (1, 0, -1) - Brick 3:
- Affects: RED only
- RED has two settlements here
- Low production value (3 is less likely)
- Would disrupt RED's brick production

## Strategic Decision:

I need to place the robber to maximize harm to RED while minimizing harm to myself. Looking at RED's buildings:
- They have settlements on wheat (10), sheep (8), wood (6), and brick (3)
- They have two settlements on wheat hex (10), indicating this is an important resource for them

Since RED has the Longest Road bonus and multiple settlements, they might be working toward city upgrades to reach 10 VP. City upgrades require ore and wheat. RED currently has two settlements on wheat (10), making it their strongest wheat producer.

<plan>
1. Block RED's wheat production to slow city upgrade potential
2. Focus on building my third settlement or upgrading to another city
3. Continue development card strategy to maintain Largest Army advantage
4. Work toward 10 VP through a combination of visible builds and hidden victory points
5. Consider acquiring Longest Road if possible to deny RED the 2 VP bonus
</plan>

The robber is currently on the wheat hex (0, 1, -1) with value 10, which is RED's primary wheat source. This is already the optimal placement. However, I need to choose a different hex since I'm required to move the robber.

Among the available options, the best strategic choice is to disrupt RED's wood production by placing the robber on the wood hex (1, -1, 0) with value 6. This will hurt both of us equally in terms of wood, but since RED might need wood for settlement expansion or road building to maintain their Longest Road advantage, this is still beneficial to me.

# Robber Placement Analysis

I need to decide where to place the robber to maximize my advantage while hindering my opponent's progress toward victory.

## Current Game State Analysis
- I (BLUE) have 5 VP: 2 from buildings (1 settlement + 1 city) and 3 from VP development cards
- RED has 6 VP: 4 from settlements and 2 from Longest Road
- RED is ahead by 1 VP and closer to winning
- We are in the MOVE_ROBBER phase, which suggests I just rolled a 7 or played a Knight card

## Analyzing Each Robber Placement Option

**[0] Move robber to (0, 0, 0) and steal from RED**
- This would block the 🐑8 hex (sheep/wool)
- This affects:
  - My settlement at node 2 (loses sheep production)
  - My city at node 4 (loses sheep production)
  - RED's settlement at node 0 (loses sheep production)
- This is a high-probability hex (8), but blocking it hurts me more than RED (I lose 2 production points, RED loses 1)
- Not optimal.

**[1] Move robber to (1, -1, 0) and steal from RED**
- This would block the 🌲6 hex (wood)
- This affects:
  - My settlement at node 2 (loses wood production)
  - RED's settlement at node 6 (loses wood production)
- This is a high-probability hex (6), but it hurts both of us equally
- Not ideal as it impacts my resource generation too.

**[2] Move robber to (0, -1, 1)**
- This would block the 🌾4 hex (wheat)
- This affects:
  - My settlement at node 2 (loses wheat production)
- This is a low-probability hex (4)
- This only hurts me and doesn't affect RED at all
- Very poor choice.

**[3] Move robber to (-1, 1, 0) and steal from RED**
- This would block the 🏜️- hex (desert)
- The desert produces no resources
- Placing the robber here has no effect on resource production
- Can still steal from RED, but wastes the blocking effect of the robber
- Not a strategic choice.

**[4] Move robber to (0, 1, -1) and steal from RED**
- This would block the 🌾10 hex (wheat)
- This affects:
  - RED's settlement at node 0 (loses wheat production)
  - RED's settlement at node 16 (loses wheat production)
  - RED's settlement at node 19 (loses wheat production)
- This is a medium-probability hex (10)
- This hurts RED's wheat production significantly (3 settlements affected)
- Excellent choice as it doesn't impact my production at all while significantly reducing RED's resource generation.

**[5] Move robber to (1, 0, -1) and steal from RED**
- This would block the 🧱3 hex (brick)
- This affects:
  - RED's settlement at node 0 (loses brick production)
  - RED's settlement at node 6 (loses brick production)
- This is a low-probability hex (3)
- While it affects two of RED's settlements, the low probability makes this less impactful.

## Strategic Decision
Looking at these options, option [4] is clearly the best choice:
1. It blocks wheat (🌾10) which RED heavily depends on (3 settlements)
2. It doesn't affect my own production at all
3. I still get to steal from RED
4. Wheat is crucial for both settlements and city upgrades, potentially slowing RED's progress
5. This aligns with my current plan of blocking RED's wheat production

<plan>
1. Block RED's wheat production by placing robber on (0, 1, -1)
2. Focus on building my third settlement or upgrading to a city (depending on what resources I gain)
3. Continue development card strategy to maintain Largest Army advantage
4. Work toward 10 VP through a combination of visible builds and hidden victory points
5. Consider acquiring Longest Road if possible to deny RED the 2 VP bonus

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL SETTLEMENT PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Place settlements on high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Target at least one spot with good ore and wheat production for city development
- Try to secure at least one high-probability spot (5, 6, 8, 9) for each critical resource
- Place your second settlement to complement your first (fill resource gaps)
- Aim for access to all five resources or position near useful ports if resource diversity isn't possible
- Always consider which settlements opponents are likely to place and avoid areas that will become contested
- Place roads pointing toward valuable future expansion spots, not toward the center
- Consider the long-term impact: settlements that can't expand are less valuable

MID-GAME RESOURCE PRIORITIES:
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each possible build (cities: 1VP for 5 resources is most efficient)
- Early phase: Secure at least one good source of brick and wood for minimal expansion
- Growth phase: Prioritize ore and wheat production for city upgrades (3VP for 5 resources is optimal)
- Late phase: Focus on the fastest path to victory points, whether through buildings or development cards
- Avoid trading resources that opponents need for immediate victory point gains
- Use 4:1 trades only when necessary; prioritize port usage when possible

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and limited expansion options
- If you get an early knight, save it for defense or until you can start building toward largest army
- Time monopoly card usage for when opponents likely have accumulated specific resources
- Save year of plenty cards for completing crucial builds when you're short 1-2 specific resources
- Development cards are most valuable when:
  * You need hidden victory points to surprise opponents
  * You need knights to break up longest road or secure largest army
  * You're lacking wood/brick for expansion but have plenty of sheep/wheat/ore

EXPANSION STRATEGY:
- Build roads only with clear settlement locations in mind
- Target settlements that give you access to ports or new resources
- Block opponents' expansion paths when it gives you a strategic advantage
- Consider the timing of expansion vs. city upgrades based on your resource production
- Calculate whether longest road is achievable and worth the resource investment
- When deciding between a new settlement and a city upgrade, compare immediate vs. long-term returns

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-probability hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Save knight cards for breaking up opponent strategies or securing largest army
- Use knights defensively if you're producing valuable resources on high-probability hexes

TRADING TACTICS:
- Avoid trading resources that directly help opponents score points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades
- Trade excess resources before rolling 7 if you have more than 7 cards
- Consider bank/port trades when they enable an immediate build that advances your strategy
- When trading with players, try to receive resources that complete a build

ENDGAME STRATEGY:
- In the late game, hide your victory point potential (keep development cards hidden)
- Calculate the fastest path to 10 VP and focus exclusively on that path
- Be aware of the exact number of remaining development cards and their probabilities
- Track opponents' potential victory points, including hidden development cards
- If you're close to winning, prioritize actions that can be completed in a single turn

Before finalizing your action, check:
1. Is there a more efficient path to victory points?
2. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
3. Does this move help or hinder opponents?
4. Is there a defensive move needed to prevent an opponent from winning?
5. Are you properly diversified against dice probability?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex

- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game Analysis for Settlers of Catan

Let me carefully analyze the current game state and available options:

## Current Victory Points Situation
- BLUE (me): 5/10 VP (1 settlement + 1 city + Largest Army bonus)
- RED: 6/10 VP (4 settlements + Longest Road bonus)

RED is ahead by 1 VP, making them the immediate threat.

## My Resources
- 2 🌲WOOD
- 4 🌾WHEAT
- 3 VICTORY_POINT development cards (hidden from RED)

## Key Strategic Considerations

1. With my 3 hidden VP development cards, I actually have 8 VP total, needing only 2 more to win.
2. The robber is already on RED's wheat hex (0, 1, -1), blocking some of their production.
3. RED has 6 hidden resource cards, which could enable significant progress.
4. My resource production is focused on sheep (8), wood (6), wheat (4), and ore (9).
5. I need 2 more victory points to win, which could come from:
   - Building a city (2 VP) - costs 3 ore + 2 wheat
   - Building 2 settlements (2 VP) - costs 2 wood + 2 brick + 2 wheat + 2 sheep
   - Another development card hoping for VP - costs 1 ore + 1 wheat + 1 sheep

## Available Actions Assessment

[0] End turn - This would let me collect more resources on the next round before making a move.
[1-4] Maritime trades - Trade wheat for other resources at a 4:1 rate.

I currently lack ore and brick, which limits my building options. I have 2 wood and 4 wheat, but need either ore (for a city) or brick (for settlements) to advance.

## Decision Process

Looking at my situation, I need to decide if trading now makes sense or if I should collect more resources next round:

- Trading 4 wheat for 1 ore wouldn't give me enough for a city (need 3 ore)
- Trading 4 wheat for 1 brick wouldn't give me enough for a settlement (need 1 brick, 1 wood, 1 sheep, 1 wheat)
- I would deplete most of my resources and still be unable to build anything significant

The most efficient move appears to be ending my turn to collect more resources next round. With my dice roll production, I have a good chance of collecting more wood, sheep, and possibly ore, which would position me better for my next move.

<plan>
1. End turn to collect more resources next round
2. Target either city upgrade (need 3 ore + 2 wheat) or new settlement (need 1 more brick)
3. Play conservatively as I have 3 hidden VP cards, putting my actual total at 8 VP
4. Continue to use the robber to hamper RED's progress, as they are at 6 VP
5. Consider revealing VP cards only when I can secure the 10th victory point
</plan>

Since ending my turn is the most strategic option given my current resources and position, I select:

# Game Analysis

Let me carefully review the game state and my options:

## Current Game State
- **My Points**: 5 VP visible + 3 hidden VP cards = 8 VP total (need 2 more for victory)
- **Resources**: 2 Wood, 4 Wheat, 2 Ore
- **Opponent**: RED has 6 VP and holds Longest Road (+2 VP)
- **My Advantages**: I have Largest Army (+2 VP) and hidden VP cards
- **Robber**: Currently on wheat (10) hex

## Possible Builds With Current Resources
- Cannot build a settlement (need 1 wood, 1 brick, 1 wheat, 1 sheep)
- Cannot build a city (need 3 ore, 2 wheat)
- Cannot build a road (need 1 wood, 1 brick)
- Cannot buy development cards (need 1 ore, 1 wheat, 1 sheep)

## Action Options
0. End turn
1-4. Trade wheat for other resources

## Strategic Assessment

I'm currently at 8 VP (with hidden cards), needing only 2 more to win. My most efficient path to victory is through city upgrades (2 VP for 5 resources) or revealing my hidden VP cards at the right moment.

To build a city, I need 3 ore + 2 wheat. I already have 2 ore and 4 wheat, so I'm only short 1 ore.

None of the maritime trade options (actions 1-4) make sense right now:
- Trading 4 wheat for 1 ore would give me enough resources for a city, but it's inefficient
- I don't need wood, brick, or sheep immediately
- I should preserve my wheat for next turn's potential city build

The most strategic action is to end my turn (action 0) and hope to roll ore on the next round. With my settlement on a 9-ore hex, I have a good chance of getting what I need naturally rather than through an inefficient trade.

<plan>
1. End turn to preserve resources
2. Next turn, prioritize city upgrade (need just 1 more ore)
3. Keep VP cards hidden until I can win in a single turn
4. Continue using the robber to slow RED's progress
5. I'm at 8VP (with hidden cards), so I'm closer to winning than apparent

# Game Analysis and Decision Making

Let me analyze the current game state and options carefully:

## Victory Point Count
- BLUE (me): 5 VP visible + 3 hidden VP cards = 8 VP total
- RED: 6 VP (4 settlements + Longest Road bonus)

## Resource Analysis
I have: 2 🌲WOOD, 4 🌾WHEAT, 4 ⛏️ORE
For a city upgrade, I need: 2 🌾WHEAT, 3 ⛏️ORE, which I can afford right now.

## Strategic Considerations
1. **Victory Point Calculation**:
   - If I upgrade my settlement at node 2 to a city, I gain +1 VP
   - This would bring me to 9 VP total (6 visible + 3 hidden)
   - I would need just 1 more VP to win

2. **Production Improvement**:
   - Node 2 produces resources from 🐑8, 🌲6, and 🌾4
   - Upgrading this to a city would double the production from these valuable hexes

3. **RED's Position**:
   - RED is at 6 VP and already has Longest Road
   - I need to maintain my lead and move closer to winning

4. **Trading Options**:
   - None of the maritime trades make sense right now as they would deplete resources I need for the city upgrade

## Decision Logic
Building a city now is clearly optimal because:
- It brings me to 9 VP total (just 1 VP away from winning)
- It improves my resource production at a key node
- It's the most efficient use of my current resources
- It advances my current plan effectively

<plan>
1. Build city at node 2 now to reach 9 VP total (with hidden VP cards)
2. Focus on acquiring 1 more VP - either through development card or another settlement
3. Continue keeping VP cards hidden until I can reveal for the win
4. Use robber strategically to slow RED while I secure the final VP
5. Watch for opportunities to break RED's longest road if needed
</plan>

The upgrade to city is clearly the best option, as it advances me closest to victory while improving my resource production.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL SETTLEMENT PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Place settlements on high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Target at least one spot with good ore and wheat production for city development
- Try to secure at least one high-probability spot (5, 6, 8, 9) for each critical resource
- Place your second settlement to complement your first (fill resource gaps)
- Aim for access to all five resources or position near useful ports if resource diversity isn't possible
- Always consider which settlements opponents are likely to place and avoid areas that will become contested
- Place roads pointing toward valuable future expansion spots, not toward the center
- Consider the long-term impact: settlements that can't expand are less valuable

MID-GAME RESOURCE PRIORITIES:
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each possible build (cities: 1VP for 5 resources is most efficient)
- Early phase: Secure at least one good source of brick and wood for minimal expansion
- Growth phase: Prioritize ore and wheat production for city upgrades (3VP for 5 resources is optimal)
- Late phase: Focus on the fastest path to victory points, whether through buildings or development cards
- Avoid trading resources that opponents need for immediate victory point gains
- Use 4:1 trades only when necessary; prioritize port usage when possible

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and limited expansion options
- If you get an early knight, save it for defense or until you can start building toward largest army
- Time monopoly card usage for when opponents likely have accumulated specific resources
- Save year of plenty cards for completing crucial builds when you're short 1-2 specific resources
- Development cards are most valuable when:
  * You need hidden victory points to surprise opponents
  * You need knights to break up longest road or secure largest army
  * You're lacking wood/brick for expansion but have plenty of sheep/wheat/ore

EXPANSION STRATEGY:
- Build roads only with clear settlement locations in mind
- Target settlements that give you access to ports or new resources
- Block opponents' expansion paths when it gives you a strategic advantage
- Consider the timing of expansion vs. city upgrades based on your resource production
- Calculate whether longest road is achievable and worth the resource investment
- When deciding between a new settlement and a city upgrade, compare immediate vs. long-term returns

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-probability hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Save knight cards for breaking up opponent strategies or securing largest army
- Use knights defensively if you're producing valuable resources on high-probability hexes

TRADING TACTICS:
- Avoid trading resources that directly help opponents score points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades
- Trade excess resources before rolling 7 if you have more than 7 cards
- Consider bank/port trades when they enable an immediate build that advances your strategy
- When trading with players, try to receive resources that complete a build

ENDGAME STRATEGY:
- In the late game, hide your victory point potential (keep development cards hidden)
- Calculate the fastest path to 10 VP and focus exclusively on that path
- Be aware of the exact number of remaining development cards and their probabilities
- Track opponents' potential victory points, including hidden development cards
- If you're close to winning, prioritize actions that can be completed in a single turn

Before finalizing your action, check:
1. Is there a more efficient path to victory points?
2. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
3. Does this move help or hinder opponents?
4. Is there a defensive move needed to prevent an opponent from winning?
5. Are you properly diversified against dice probability?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game Analysis for Blue Player

Let me systematically analyze the current game state and available options:

## Current Status
- **VP Breakdown**: 2 cities (4 VP) + Largest Army (2 VP) + 3 hidden VP cards = 9 VP total
- **Resources**: 4 Wood, 2 Wheat, 3 Ore
- **Position**: I'm at 9 VP (with hidden cards), just 1 VP away from winning

## Opponent Status
- RED has 6 visible VP (4 settlements + Longest Road bonus)
- RED has 5 hidden resources and no known development cards

## Available Actions
My only options are to end my turn [0] or make a maritime trade [1-4].

## Strategic Analysis

I'm in an excellent position with 9 VP (including my hidden VP cards). I just need 1 more VP to win. With my current resources, I cannot:
- Build a settlement (need brick and wood)
- Build a city (need 3 ore and 2 wheat, but I only have 3 ore and 2 wheat)
- Buy a development card (need 1 ore, 1 wheat, and 1 sheep)

None of the maritime trade options available will allow me to complete any of these builds immediately. Trading 4 wood for any resource still leaves me short of what I need to make meaningful progress this turn.

Moreover, making a trade now would reveal my resource interests to RED, potentially alerting them to my strategy or close position to victory.

## Decision Logic

Since I cannot make any build that gets me to 10 VP this turn, and none of the trades significantly improve my position:
1. I should save my resources for next turn
2. Ending my turn preserves my strong position
3. It's better to keep my resources (especially wood which I have in abundance) for my next turn when I might draw the additional resources needed

<plan>
1. End turn now, maintaining my hidden 9 VP position
2. On next turn, aim to secure the final VP through either:
   - A development card purchase (if I get 1 sheep)
   - A settlement (if I get brick)
   - A city upgrade (if I get 1 more ore and wheat)
3. Continue keeping VP cards hidden until I can reveal for the win
</plan>

Given this analysis, I should end my turn to maintain my position and resources.

# Game Analysis: Turn 152

Let me analyze my current position and determine the optimal action:

## Current Victory Point Count
- Visible VP: 6 (2 cities + Largest Army bonus)
- Hidden VP: 3 (from VP development cards)
- **Total: 9 VP** (just need 1 more to win)

## Available Resources
- 4 sheep, 2 wheat, 1 ore

## Possible Actions to Consider
1. End turn
2. Buy a development card (costs 1 sheep, 1 wheat, 1 ore)
3. Trade options (various 4:1 sheep trades)

## Decision Analysis

**Option 1: Buy a Development Card**
- Cost: 1 sheep, 1 wheat, 1 ore
- Remaining resources after purchase: 3 sheep, 1 wheat, 0 ore
- Probability of getting a VP card: With 15 cards remaining, the odds are uncertain without knowing the exact distribution
- If I get a VP card, I win immediately
- If I get a knight/other special card, I maintain my resources for future turns

**Option 0: End Turn**
- Preserve my resources for future turns
- Maintain my hidden position at 9 VP
- Next dice roll could give me resources needed for a settlement or city
- Risk: RED player might reach 10 VP before my next turn

## Strategic Considerations
- My hidden 9 VP position is strong
- Buying a development card risks revealing I'm collecting them if I don't win immediately
- The odds of getting exactly a VP card are unknown without the remaining deck distribution
- RED has 8 hidden resources and could be close to building something significant

<plan>
1. Buy a development card - this gives me a chance to win immediately
2. If I don't draw a VP card, continue with original plan of securing final VP on next turn
3. RED player has 8 cards and may be planning a significant build, so taking action now is better than waiting
</plan>

Since I'm at 9 VP (with 3 hidden VP cards) and I can afford a development card, buying one gives me the best chance to win immediately. If I draw a VP card, I win. Any other card still keeps my options open for next turn while using my excess sheep.

5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL SETTLEMENT PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Place settlements on high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Target at least one spot with good ore and wheat production for city development
- Try to secure at least one high-probability spot (5, 6, 8, 9) for each critical resource
- Place your second settlement to complement your first (fill resource gaps)
- Aim for access to all five resources or position near useful ports if resource diversity isn't possible
- Always consider which settlements opponents are likely to place and avoid areas that will become contested
- Place roads pointing toward valuable future expansion spots, not toward the center
- Consider the long-term impact: settlements that can't expand are less valuable

MID-GAME RESOURCE PRIORITIES:
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each possible build (cities: 1VP for 5 resources is most efficient)
- Early phase: Secure at least one good source of brick and wood for minimal expansion
- Growth phase: Prioritize ore and wheat production for city upgrades (3VP for 5 resources is optimal)
- Late phase: Focus on the fastest path to victory points, whether through buildings or development cards
- Avoid trading resources that opponents need for immediate victory point gains
- Use 4:1 trades only when necessary; prioritize port usage when possible

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and limited expansion options
- If you get an early knight, save it for defense or until you can start building toward largest army
- Time monopoly card usage for when opponents likely have accumulated specific resources
- Save year of plenty cards for completing crucial builds when you're short 1-2 specific resources
- Development cards are most valuable when:
  * You need hidden victory points to surprise opponents
  * You need knights to break up longest road or secure largest army
  * You're lacking wood/brick for expansion but have plenty of sheep/wheat/ore

EXPANSION STRATEGY:
- Build roads only with clear settlement locations in mind
- Target settlements that give you access to ports or new resources
- Block opponents' expansion paths when it gives you a strategic advantage
- Consider the timing of expansion vs. city upgrades based on your resource production
- Calculate whether longest road is achievable and worth the resource investment
- When deciding between a new settlement and a city upgrade, compare immediate vs. long-term returns

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-probability hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Save knight cards for breaking up opponent strategies or securing largest army
- Use knights defensively if you're producing valuable resources on high-probability hexes

TRADING TACTICS:
- Avoid trading resources that directly help opponents score points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades
- Trade excess resources before rolling 7 if you have more than 7 cards
- Consider bank/port trades when they enable an immediate build that advances your strategy
- When trading with players, try to receive resources that complete a build

ENDGAME STRATEGY:
- In the late game, hide your victory point potential (keep development cards hidden)
- Calculate the fastest path to 10 VP and focus exclusively on that path
- Be aware of the exact number of remaining development cards and their probabilities
- Track opponents' potential victory points, including hidden development cards
- If you're close to winning, prioritize actions that can be completed in a single turn

Before finalizing your action, check:
1. Is there a more efficient path to victory points?
2. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
3. Does this move help or hinder opponents?
4. Is there a defensive move needed to prevent an opponent from winning?
5. Are you properly diversified against dice probability?

# Game Analysis

Let me thoroughly analyze the game state to determine the optimal action.

## Current Game Status
- **Victory Points**: I have 6/10 VP (2 cities = 4 VP, Largest Army = 2 VP)
- **Hidden Victory Points**: I have 3 Victory Point cards = 3 additional VP
- **Total Real VPs**: 9/10 VP (only need 1 more to win)
- **Opponent (RED)**: Has 7/10 VP (5 settlements = 5 VP, Longest Road = 2 VP)
- **My Resources**: 2 Wood, 3 Sheep, 1 Wheat
- **My Development Cards**: 1 KNIGHT, 3 VICTORY_POINT
- **Remaining Dev Cards in Bank**: 14

## Strategic Analysis

My current position is extremely strong. With 9 actual VP (including my hidden victory point cards), I'm just 1 VP away from winning. My opponent only has 7 VP.

### Option 0: Play Knight Card
If I play my Knight card:
- I can move the robber and possibly disrupt RED's production
- I can steal a resource from RED
- However, I already have Largest Army, so playing another Knight doesn't give me any additional VP

### Option 1: Roll the Dice
If I roll the dice:
- I might get resources to buy a development card
- With 14 development cards remaining in the bank, there's a chance to draw another Victory Point card and win immediately
- Current resources: 2 Wood, 3 Sheep, 1 Wheat
- I need 1 Ore to buy a development card (costs 1 Ore, 1 Sheep, 1 Wheat)

## Decision Logic

1. I need just 1 more VP to win the game.
2. I already have Largest Army, so playing the Knight card doesn't give me any VP advantage.
3. Rolling the dice could get me Ore, which I need to buy a development card that could potentially be a Victory Point card.
4. Saving the Knight card for future strategic disruption is more valuable at this point.

Since I'm just 1 VP away from winning, and my best path to victory is getting another VP card, I should roll the dice and try to acquire the resources needed (specifically Ore) to buy a development card.

<plan>
1. Roll the dice to try to get Ore
2. If I get Ore, buy a development card hoping for a Victory Point card to win
3. If I don't get needed resources, save Knight card for defensive purposes on future turns
4. Continue working toward that final victory point through optimal resource collection

# Game Analysis

Let me assess the current game state and my options:

## Victory Point Status
- BLUE (me): 6 VP (2 cities = 4 VP + Largest Army = 2 VP + 0 visible VP from Development Cards)
- RED: 7 VP (5 settlements = 5 VP + Longest Road = 2 VP)

I actually have 3 hidden Victory Point cards, which means I actually have 9 VP total, just 1 short of winning!

## Resources
I have:
- 4 Wood
- 3 Sheep
- 1 Wheat
- 0 Brick
- 0 Ore

## Development Cards
I have 1 Knight card and 3 VP cards (hidden).

## Options
1. Play Knight card - Move robber and steal a resource
2. End turn
3-6. Maritime trades to convert Wood to other resources

## Strategic Analysis

The key insight is that I have 9 VP (6 visible + 3 hidden), so I just need 1 more VP to win. The most efficient way to get that is to buy a development card, hoping for a Victory Point card.

To buy a development card, I need:
- 1 Ore
- 1 Wheat (I have this)
- 1 Sheep (I have 3)

I don't have any Ore currently. My options:

1. **Play Knight**: This doesn't directly help me get Ore. If I play a Knight now, I get no immediate benefit toward winning.

2. **End turn**: My turn will end, and I roll the dice on my next turn. Given my building placement, I produce on 8🐑, 6🌲, 4🌾, and 9⛏️. If I roll a 9, I'll get Ore and can buy a development card.

3-6. **Maritime Trades**: I could trade Wood for Ore, but that's a 4:1 trade which is very inefficient. However, since I'm just one VP from winning, it might be worth it.

The optimal choice is clearly between option #3 (trade for Ore) and option #1 (ending my turn).

If I trade 4 Wood for 1 Ore, I can immediately buy a development card. There's about a 1/6 chance it will be a Victory Point card, which would give me the win right now.

If I end my turn, I have a chance to roll a 9 on my next turn (4/36 probability) to get the Ore I need. But RED will get a turn before me, and they're at 7 VP already.

Given that I'm at 9 VP with my hidden VP cards, and RED is at 7 VP with no remaining development cards, the optimal strategy is to trade for Ore immediately to have a chance at winning this turn.

<plan>
1. Trade 4 Wood for 1 Ore using maritime trade
2. Use my 1 Wheat, 1 Sheep, and 1 Ore to buy a development card
3. If it's a Victory Point, reveal all 4 VP cards to win
4. If not, save the Knight card for defense and continue trying to get resources for another development card
</plan>

# Game Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state thoroughly to determine the optimal action.

## Victory Point Breakdown
- BLUE (me): 6 VPs (2 Cities = 4 VP, Largest Army = 2 VP)
- RED: 7 VPs (5 Settlements = 5 VP, Longest Road = 2 VP)

## Current Resources
- I have: 3 Sheep, 1 Wheat, 1 Ore
- I need 4 more VPs to win

## Development Card Potential
- I already have 3 Victory Point cards (hidden)
- I have the exact resources needed to buy another development card (1 Sheep, 1 Wheat, 1 Ore)
- Bank has 14 development cards remaining
- If I draw another Victory Point card, I would immediately have 10 VPs and win the game

## Available Actions Review
- [0] Play Knight card - This doesn't advance my position toward victory
- [1] End turn - This gives up my opportunity to potentially win this turn
- [2] Buy a development card - This gives me a chance to win immediately if I draw a Victory Point card

## Victory Probability Calculation
Let's estimate the probability of drawing a Victory Point card:
- There are 5 Victory Point cards in the standard game
- I already have 3 VP cards
- With 14 cards remaining, and assuming a standard distribution, there should be approximately 2 VP cards left
- Probability of drawing a VP card ≈ 2/14 ≈ 14.3%

## Strategic Decision
Since I'm at 6 VPs (plus 3 hidden VP cards), drawing another VP card would immediately give me 10 VPs and win the game. While the probability isn't high (about 14.3%), it's my best chance to win on this turn. Even if I don't draw a VP card, getting another Knight or other development card strengthens my position for future turns.

<plan>
1. Buy a development card now with my 1 Sheep, 1 Wheat, and 1 Ore
2. If it's a Victory Point card, reveal all 4 VP cards to win immediately with 10 VPs
3. If not, continue building my strategy around development cards, looking to increase my Largest Army lead or finding another path to victory
</plan>

I should buy a development card for the chance to win immediately, or strengthen my position if I don't win.

PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL SETTLEMENT PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Place settlements on high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Target at least one spot with good ore and wheat production for city development
- Try to secure at least one high-probability spot (5, 6, 8, 9) for each critical resource
- Place your second settlement to complement your first (fill resource gaps)
- Aim for access to all five resources or position near useful ports if resource diversity isn't possible
- Always consider which settlements opponents are likely to place and avoid areas that will become contested
- Place roads pointing toward valuable future expansion spots, not toward the center
- Consider the long-term impact: settlements that can't expand are less valuable

MID-GAME RESOURCE PRIORITIES:
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each possible build (cities: 1VP for 5 resources is most efficient)
- Early phase: Secure at least one good source of brick and wood for minimal expansion
- Growth phase: Prioritize ore and wheat production for city upgrades (3VP for 5 resources is optimal)
- Late phase: Focus on the fastest path to victory points, whether through buildings or development cards
- Avoid trading resources that opponents need for immediate victory point gains
- Use 4:1 trades only when necessary; prioritize port usage when possible

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and limited expansion options
- If you get an early knight, save it for defense or until you can start building toward largest army
- Time monopoly card usage for when opponents likely have accumulated specific resources
- Save year of plenty cards for completing crucial builds when you're short 1-2 specific resources
- Development cards are most valuable when:
  * You need hidden victory points to surprise opponents
  * You need knights to break up longest road or secure largest army
  * You're lacking wood/brick for expansion but have plenty of sheep/wheat/ore

EXPANSION STRATEGY:
- Build roads only with clear settlement locations in mind
- Target settlements that give you access to ports or new resources
- Block opponents' expansion paths when it gives you a strategic advantage
- Consider the timing of expansion vs. city upgrades based on your resource production
- Calculate whether longest road is achievable and worth the resource investment
- When deciding between a new settlement and a city upgrade, compare immediate vs. long-term returns

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-probability hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Save knight cards for breaking up opponent strategies or securing largest army
- Use knights defensively if you're producing valuable resources on high-probability hexes

TRADING TACTICS:
- Avoid trading resources that directly help opponents score points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades
- Trade excess resources before rolling 7 if you have more than 7 cards
- Consider bank/port trades when they enable an immediate build that advances your strategy
- When trading with players, try to receive resources that complete a build

ENDGAME STRATEGY:
- In the late game, hide your victory point potential (keep development cards hidden)
- Calculate the fastest path to 10 VP and focus exclusively on that path
- Be aware of the exact number of remaining development cards and their probabilities
- Track opponents' potential victory points, including hidden development cards
- If you're close to winning, prioritize actions that can be completed in a single turn

Before finalizing your action, check:
1. Is there a more efficient path to victory points?
2. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
3. Does this move help or hinder opponents?
4. Is there a defensive move needed to prevent an opponent from winning?
5. Are you properly diversified against dice probability?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.

# Game Analysis

Let me analyze the current state of the game and determine the optimal action.

## Victory Point Status:
- BLUE (me): 6 VP (2 cities = 4 VP + largest army = 2 VP)
- RED: 7 VP (5 settlements = 5 VP + longest road = 2 VP)

## Resources:
- I have: 2 🐑SHEEP
- I need: 1 ORE and 1 WHEAT to buy a development card

## Development Cards:
- I already have 3 VICTORY_POINT cards in hand (hidden from opponents)
- If I draw 1 more VP card, I would have 10 VP total and win

## Available Actions:
- [0] Play Knight card - Move the robber and steal a resource
- [1] End turn

## Strategic Evaluation:

The current plan is to buy a development card, but I don't have the required resources (1 Sheep, 1 Wheat, 1 Ore) - I only have 2 Sheep. I need to adjust this plan.

Playing a Knight card would allow me to:
1. Move the robber to a hex that might hurt RED's production
2. Potentially steal a Wheat or Ore from RED, which I need
3. Further secure my Largest Army bonus

Since I can't currently execute the development card strategy without getting more resources, and RED is ahead with 7 VP, playing a Knight to potentially get a useful resource seems to be the optimal move.

<plan>
1. Play a Knight card to move the robber to a hex producing resources I need (Wheat/Ore)
2. Target RED player to steal a resource, hoping for Wheat or Ore
3. Next turn, try to gather the necessary resources to buy a development card
4. If I get a VP card, I'll have 10 VP and win immediately
5. If not, continue building my strategy around largest army and development cards
</plan>

Since I need resources and can potentially disrupt RED's production, playing the Knight card is clearly the better option over simply ending my turn.

# Analyzing Game State and Action Options

Let me analyze the current game state and options for moving the robber:

## Victory Point Status
- BLUE (me): 6/10 VP (3 VP cards + 2 cities (4 VP) + Largest Army (2 VP))
- RED: 7/10 VP (5 settlements (5 VP) + Longest Road (2 VP))
- RED is ahead by 1 VP and needs only 3 more to win

## Resource Analysis
Looking at the hexes and production:
- Sheep: Hex (0,0,0) with value 8 (high probability) - Both my cities produce from this
- Wheat: Hex (0,-1,1) with value 4 (low probability) - One of my cities produces from this
- Wheat: Hex (0,1,-1) with value 10 (medium probability) - RED has 2 settlements here
- Wood: Hex (1,-1,0) with value 6 (high probability) - I have 1 city and RED has 2 settlements here
- Ore: Hex (-1,0,1) with value 9 (medium-high probability) - One of my cities produces from this
- Brick: Hex (1,0,-1) with value 3 (low probability) - RED has 2 settlements here

## Strategic Options Analysis
1. I need 4 more VP to win
2. I have 3 VP development cards and need just 1 more VP
3. To get another VP, I need either:
   - Another VP card (requires ore+wheat+sheep)
   - Another knight to strengthen my Largest Army bonus (ore+wheat+sheep)

## Robber Placement Options
- [0] Hex (0,0,0): Sheep 8 - Blocks both my cities (major production loss)
- [1] Hex (1,-1,0): Wood 6 - Blocks one of my cities but also two RED settlements
- [2] Hex (-1,0,1): Ore 9 - Blocks one of my cities (bad choice)
- [3] Hex (-1,1,0): Desert - No effect (waste of a move)
- [4] Hex (0,1,-1): Wheat 10 - Blocks two RED settlements
- [5] Hex (1,0,-1): Brick 3 - Blocks two RED settlements

## Decision Process
1. I need to protect my resource production (especially ore/wheat) for buying development cards
2. I want to hamper RED's production to slow them down
3. I want to steal a potentially useful resource from RED

Option [4] is best because:
- Blocks 10-value wheat hex, affecting two RED settlements
- Doesn't affect my production at all
- Steals from RED who has 7 cards, increasing chance to get something valuable
- Wheat is critical for development cards which I need for my victory strategy

<plan>
1. Play knight to move robber to wheat hex (0,1,-1) to block RED's production
2. Steal a resource from RED, hopefully ore or wheat
3. Next turn, aim to buy another development card (hoping for VP or knight)
4. If I get a VP card, I win immediately (would have 10 VP)
5. Otherwise continue strengthening largest army while protecting my production
</plan>

PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL SETTLEMENT PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Place settlements on high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Target at least one spot with good ore and wheat production for city development
- Try to secure at least one high-probability spot (5, 6, 8, 9) for each critical resource
- Place your second settlement to complement your first (fill resource gaps)
- Aim for access to all five resources or position near useful ports if resource diversity isn't possible
- Always consider which settlements opponents are likely to place and avoid areas that will become contested
- Place roads pointing toward valuable future expansion spots, not toward the center
- Consider the long-term impact: settlements that can't expand are less valuable

MID-GAME RESOURCE PRIORITIES:
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each possible build (cities: 1VP for 5 resources is most efficient)
- Early phase: Secure at least one good source of brick and wood for minimal expansion
- Growth phase: Prioritize ore and wheat production for city upgrades (3VP for 5 resources is optimal)
- Late phase: Focus on the fastest path to victory points, whether through buildings or development cards
- Avoid trading resources that opponents need for immediate victory point gains
- Use 4:1 trades only when necessary; prioritize port usage when possible

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and limited expansion options
- If you get an early knight, save it for defense or until you can start building toward largest army
- Time monopoly card usage for when opponents likely have accumulated specific resources
- Save year of plenty cards for completing crucial builds when you're short 1-2 specific resources
- Development cards are most valuable when:
  * You need hidden victory points to surprise opponents
  * You need knights to break up longest road or secure largest army
  * You're lacking wood/brick for expansion but have plenty of sheep/wheat/ore

EXPANSION STRATEGY:
- Build roads only with clear settlement locations in mind
- Target settlements that give you access to ports or new resources
- Block opponents' expansion paths when it gives you a strategic advantage
- Consider the timing of expansion vs. city upgrades based on your resource production
- Calculate whether longest road is achievable and worth the resource investment
- When deciding between a new settlement and a city upgrade, compare immediate vs. long-term returns

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-probability hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Save knight cards for breaking up opponent strategies or securing largest army
- Use knights defensively if you're producing valuable resources on high-probability hexes

TRADING TACTICS:
- Avoid trading resources that directly help opponents score points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades
- Trade excess resources before rolling 7 if you have more than 7 cards
- Consider bank/port trades when they enable an immediate build that advances your strategy
- When trading with players, try to receive resources that complete a build

ENDGAME STRATEGY:
- In the late game, hide your victory point potential (keep development cards hidden)
- Calculate the fastest path to 10 VP and focus exclusively on that path
- Be aware of the exact number of remaining development cards and their probabilities
- Track opponents' potential victory points, including hidden development cards
- If you're close to winning, prioritize actions that can be completed in a single turn

Before finalizing your action, check:
1. Is there a more efficient path to victory points?
2. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
3. Does this move help or hinder opponents?
4. Is there a defensive move needed to prevent an opponent from winning?
5. Are you properly diversified against dice probability?

# Game Analysis: Turn 156

## Current Game State
- I have 6 VP (2 cities + largest army bonus) + 3 hidden VP cards = 9 VP total
- RED has 7 VP (5 settlements + longest road bonus)
- I need 1 more VP to win
- I have 1 knight card that I can play
- The robber is currently on the sheep hex (0,0,0) where both my cities produce

## Action Options
Looking at my available actions:

**[0] Play Knight card** - This would allow me to:
- Move the robber away from my productive 8-sheep hex
- Place it on an opponent's productive hex
- Steal a resource from RED

**[1] Roll the dice** - This would:
- Potentially give me resources based on the roll
- Risk a 7, which would force me to discard if I have >7 cards
- Not address the robber currently blocking my sheep production

## Strategic Analysis

Playing the knight card is clearly advantageous because:
1. I'll move the robber off my productive sheep hex (8)
2. I can place it on RED's wheat hex (0,1,-1) which has a 10 value and affects 2 settlements
3. I can steal a resource from RED, potentially getting something useful
4. This strengthens my largest army advantage, making it harder for RED to catch up
5. I'm following my established plan, which seems optimal

Rolling the dice leaves the robber on my sheep hex, which hampers my production. With only 2 sheep currently in hand, I need to maximize my resource generation.

<plan>
1. Play knight to move robber to wheat hex (0,1,-1) to block RED's production
2. Steal a resource from RED, hopefully ore or wheat
3. Next turn, roll and hope for good production
4. Buy another development card if possible (hoping for VP)
5. If I get a VP card, I win immediately (would have 10 VP)
6. Otherwise continue strengthening largest army while protecting my production
</plan>

The knight card gives me immediate tactical advantage and follows my optimal path to victory. Since I already have 3 VP cards, I'm just 1 VP away from winning, and keeping pressure on RED is critical.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL SETTLEMENT PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Place settlements on high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Target at least one spot with good ore and wheat production for city development
- Try to secure at least one high-probability spot (5, 6, 8, 9) for each critical resource
- Place your second settlement to complement your first (fill resource gaps)
- Aim for access to all five resources or position near useful ports if resource diversity isn't possible
- Always consider which settlements opponents are likely to place and avoid areas that will become contested
- Place roads pointing toward valuable future expansion spots, not toward the center
- Consider the long-term impact: settlements that can't expand are less valuable

MID-GAME RESOURCE PRIORITIES:
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each possible build (cities: 1VP for 5 resources is most efficient)
- Early phase: Secure at least one good source of brick and wood for minimal expansion
- Growth phase: Prioritize ore and wheat production for city upgrades (3VP for 5 resources is optimal)
- Late phase: Focus on the fastest path to victory points, whether through buildings or development cards
- Avoid trading resources that opponents need for immediate victory point gains
- Use 4:1 trades only when necessary; prioritize port usage when possible

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and limited expansion options
- If you get an early knight, save it for defense or until you can start building toward largest army
- Time monopoly card usage for when opponents likely have accumulated specific resources
- Save year of plenty cards for completing crucial builds when you're short 1-2 specific resources
- Development cards are most valuable when:
  * You need hidden victory points to surprise opponents
  * You need knights to break up longest road or secure largest army
  * You're lacking wood/brick for expansion but have plenty of sheep/wheat/ore

EXPANSION STRATEGY:
- Build roads only with clear settlement locations in mind
- Target settlements that give you access to ports or new resources
- Block opponents' expansion paths when it gives you a strategic advantage
- Consider the timing of expansion vs. city upgrades based on your resource production
- Calculate whether longest road is achievable and worth the resource investment
- When deciding between a new settlement and a city upgrade, compare immediate vs. long-term returns

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-probability hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Save knight cards for breaking up opponent strategies or securing largest army
- Use knights defensively if you're producing valuable resources on high-probability hexes

TRADING TACTICS:
- Avoid trading resources that directly help opponents score points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades
- Trade excess resources before rolling 7 if you have more than 7 cards
- Consider bank/port trades when they enable an immediate build that advances your strategy
- When trading with players, try to receive resources that complete a build

ENDGAME STRATEGY:

# Analyzing the Game State and Robber Placement Options

Let me assess the current game state and available robber placement options to make the optimal move:

## Game Status
- I (BLUE) have 6 VP: 2 cities (4 VP) + largest army (2 VP)
- RED has 7 VP: 5 settlements (5 VP) + longest road (2 VP)
- I have 3 hidden victory point cards, which means I actually have 9 VP total and need just 1 more to win
- RED needs 3 more VP to win

## Robber Placement Options:
0. Move to (1, -1, 0) - Wood/6 hex - Currently produces for RED's settlement at node 6 and 8, and MY city at node 2
1. Move to (0, -1, 1) - Wheat/4 hex - Produces for MY city at node 2
2. Move to (-1, 0, 1) - Ore/9 hex - Produces for MY city at node 4
3. Move to (-1, 1, 0) - Desert hex - No production impact
4. Move to (0, 1, -1) - Wheat/10 hex - Produces for RED's settlements at nodes 0, 16, and 19
5. Move to (1, 0, -1) - Brick/3 hex - Produces for RED's settlements at nodes 0 and 6

## Strategic Analysis:

RED is at 7 VP and could potentially be close to victory. They have 4 hidden resources.

The most effective robber placements would:
1. Block RED's production on their most valuable hexes
2. Allow me to steal a resource from RED
3. Minimize impact on my own production

Looking at RED's production:
- Wheat/10 (hex 0,1,-1) produces for THREE settlements (nodes 0, 16, 19)
- Wood/6 (hex 1,-1,0) produces for TWO settlements (nodes 6, 8)
- Other hexes produce for only one settlement each

Option 4: Placing the robber on the Wheat/10 hex would block production for THREE of RED's settlements, which seems most impactful. It would also allow me to steal from RED.

Option 0: Placing on Wood/6 would block production for TWO of RED's settlements, but would also block my own city at node 2.

Option 5: Targeting Brick/3 would only block two of RED's settlements but doesn't impact my production.

Since I'm so close to winning (just need 1 more VP), my priority should be to slow down RED while I try to secure that last VP through development cards or building. Blocking RED's wheat production at the 10 hex seems most effective for this.

<plan>
1. Move robber to wheat hex (0,1,-1) to block RED's production at three settlements
2. Steal a resource from RED, hoping for ore or wheat
3. Next turn, aim to buy another development card (hoping for VP)
4. If I get a VP card, I win immediately (would have 10 VP)
5. Otherwise focus on protecting my production while continuing to block RED's key resources
</plan>

# Game Analysis

Let me evaluate the current game state and available options:

## Victory Point Analysis
- **My VPs**: 6 (2 cities = 4 VP, Largest Army = 2 VP, 3 VP cards = 3 VP) = 9 VP total!
- **Red's VPs**: 7 (5 settlements = 5 VP, Longest Road = 2 VP)

I actually have 9 victory points, not 6 as stated in the player summary. This means I'm just 1 point away from winning!

## Resources
I have: 2 Wood, 1 Brick, 2 Sheep
This is exactly enough to build one road (1 Wood, 1 Brick).

## Strategic Considerations

1. I'm at 9 VP and need only 1 more to win
2. My options for gaining that last VP:
   - Buy a development card and hope for a Victory Point card (not possible this turn with my resources)
   - Build a settlement (requires 1 Wood, 1 Brick, 1 Wheat, 1 Sheep - don't have enough)
   - Build another city (requires 3 Ore, 2 Wheat - don't have these)

3. The robber is already on the wheat hex (0,1,-1) blocking Red's production, as per my current plan.

4. Building a road doesn't directly get me a VP, but may position me to:
   - Break Red's longest road (if strategically placed)
   - Position for a future settlement

<plan>
1. Build a road to position for breaking Red's longest road in future turns
2. Continue to block Red's wheat production with the robber
3. Next turn, aim to collect resources to either build a settlement or buy a development card
4. If I get a VP card, I win immediately (would have 10 VP)
5. If I can position to break Red's longest road, that would drop them to 5 VP and increase my winning chances
</plan>

Looking at the road options, I need to determine which one might help me break Red's longest road or position for a new settlement. Since the full connectivity of all roads isn't listed, I can't be certain which road placement would be most strategic for breaking Red's road network.

However, since I already have 9 VP (not 6 as listed in the player summary), my priority should be to protect my position and prepare for the win next turn. Building any road is better than ending turn with resources that could be lost to a "7" roll.

Without more details on the exact road connections, I'll choose the first road option:

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL SETTLEMENT PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Place settlements on high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Target at least one spot with good ore and wheat production for city development
- Try to secure at least one high-probability spot (5, 6, 8, 9) for each critical resource
- Place your second settlement to complement your first (fill resource gaps)
- Aim for access to all five resources or position near useful ports if resource diversity isn't possible
- Always consider which settlements opponents are likely to place and avoid areas that will become contested
- Place roads pointing toward valuable future expansion spots, not toward the center
- Consider the long-term impact: settlements that can't expand are less valuable

MID-GAME RESOURCE PRIORITIES:
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each possible build (cities: 1VP for 5 resources is most efficient)
- Early phase: Secure at least one good source of brick and wood for minimal expansion
- Growth phase: Prioritize ore and wheat production for city upgrades (3VP for 5 resources is optimal)
- Late phase: Focus on the fastest path to victory points, whether through buildings or development cards
- Avoid trading resources that opponents need for immediate victory point gains
- Use 4:1 trades only when necessary; prioritize port usage when possible

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and limited expansion options
- If you get an early knight, save it for defense or until you can start building toward largest army
- Time monopoly card usage for when opponents likely have accumulated specific resources
- Save year of plenty cards for completing crucial builds when you're short 1-2 specific resources
- Development cards are most valuable when:
  * You need hidden victory points to surprise opponents
  * You need knights to break up longest road or secure largest army
  * You're lacking wood/brick for expansion but have plenty of sheep/wheat/ore

EXPANSION STRATEGY:
- Build roads only with clear settlement locations in mind
- Target settlements that give you access to ports or new resources
- Block opponents' expansion paths when it gives you a strategic advantage
- Consider the timing of expansion vs. city upgrades based on your resource production
- Calculate whether longest road is achievable and worth the resource investment
- When deciding between a new settlement and a city upgrade, compare immediate vs. long-term returns

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-probability hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Save knight cards for breaking up opponent strategies or securing largest army
- Use knights defensively if you're producing valuable resources on high-probability hexes

TRADING TACTICS:
- Avoid trading resources that directly help opponents score points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades
- Trade excess resources before rolling 7 if you have more than 7 cards
- Consider bank/port trades when they enable an immediate build that advances your strategy
- When trading with players, try to receive resources that complete a build

ENDGAME STRATEGY:
- In the late game, hide your victory point potential (keep development cards hidden)
- Calculate the fastest path to 10 VP and focus exclusively on that path
- Be aware of the exact number of remaining development cards and their probabilities
- Track opponents' potential victory points, including hidden development cards
- If you're close to winning, prioritize actions that can be completed in a single turn

Before finalizing your action, check:
1. Is there a more efficient path to victory points?
2. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
3. Does this move help or hinder opponents?
4. Is there a defensive move needed to prevent an opponent from winning?
5. Are you properly diversified against dice probability?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 164 | Player: BLUE | Action: MOVE_ROBBER

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Build a road to position for breaking Red's longest road in future turns
2. Continue to block Red's wheat production with the robber
3. Next turn, aim to collect resources to either build a settlement or buy a development card
4. If I get a VP card, I win immediately (would have 10 VP)
5. If I can position to break Red's longest road, that would drop them to 5 VP and increase my winning chances
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.

# Analyzing Robber Placement Options

Let me carefully analyze each potential robber placement to determine the optimal move.

## Current Game State Assessment
- I have 6 VP (2 cities = 4 VP + Largest Army = 2 VP + 0 settlements = 0 VP)
- I also have 3 hidden Victory Point cards, which means I effectively have 9 VP
- Red has 7 VP (5 settlements = 5 VP + Longest Road = 2 VP)
- Red is only 3 points from victory
- I need just 1 more point to win (could be from a Victory Point development card)

## Robber Placement Options Analysis:

**[0] Move robber to (0, 0, 0) 🐑8 and steal from RED**
- This blocks a very productive 8-sheep hex
- Affects both my cities (nodes 2 and 4)
- Affects Red's settlement at node 0
- IMPACT: Would significantly hurt my own production (both my cities depend on this)
- Stealing opportunity from Red

**[1] Move robber to (1, -1, 0) 🌲6 and steal from RED**
- This blocks a very productive 6-wood hex
- Affects my city at node 2
- Affects Red's settlements at nodes 6 and 8
- IMPACT: Would hurt my wood production, but also Red's wood (which they need for roads)
- Stealing opportunity from Red

**[2] Move robber to (0, -1, 1) 🌾4**
- This blocks a wheat hex with production value 4
- Affects my city at node 2
- No Red settlements affected
- IMPACT: Low impact on both players, wheat on a low-probability number
- No stealing opportunity

**[3] Move robber to (-1, 0, 1) ⛏️9**
- This blocks an ore hex with production value 9
- Affects my city at node 4
- No Red settlements affected
- IMPACT: Would hurt my ore production, which I need for development cards
- No stealing opportunity  

**[4] Move robber to (-1, 1, 0) 🏜️-**
- This blocks a desert hex which produces nothing
- IMPACT: No impact on resource production
- Stealing opportunity from Red (though this is wasteful)

**[5] Move robber to (1, 0, -1) 🧱3 and steal from RED**
- This blocks a brick hex with production value 3
- Affects Red's settlements at nodes 0 and 6
- IMPACT: Minimal impact on brick production (low probability), but does block Red
- Stealing opportunity from Red

## Strategic Considerations:
1. I should avoid blocking my own high-probability resources (sheep 8, wood 6, ore 9)
2. Red needs wheat for their next build (currently has 3 cards but likely needs specific resources)
3. The robber is currently on wheat 10 (0, 1, -1), blocking Red's settlements at nodes 16 and 19
4. I should prioritize:
   - Continuing to block Red's crucial resources
   - Stealing from Red to potentially gain a needed resource
   - Avoiding self-harm to my own production

## Decision Making:
- Option [0] would severely hurt my own production (blocks 8-sheep affecting both my cities)
- Option [1] hurts my wood production significantly while also affecting Red
- Option [2] and [3] hurt my production without affecting Red
- Option [4] wastes the robber on the desert
- Option [5] targets Red's brick production while having minimal impact on probability

With Red having Longest Road, blocking their brick (option 5) seems strategically sound, as it prevents them from expanding their road network further. Additionally, I get to steal a card from them.

<plan>
1. Block Red's brick production to limit their road building capability
2. Steal a resource from Red that might help me buy a development card
3. Continue working toward getting that final VP card to win
4. Position to potentially break Red's longest road if needed
</plan>

# Game Analysis for Robber Placement

I need to determine the optimal hex for moving the robber to maximize my chances of winning. Let me analyze the game state and available options:

## Game State Analysis
- I (BLUE) have 6 VP: 2 cities (4 VP) + Largest Army (2 VP) + 0 additional
- RED has 7 VP: 5 settlements (5 VP) + Longest Road (2 VP)
- I have 3 victory point development cards hidden, which means I actually have 9 VP
- I need just 1 more VP to win, which I could get from buying and getting a VP development card

## Resources Analysis
- I have 1 WOOD and 3 ORE
- To buy a development card, I need 1 ORE, 1 WHEAT, and 1 SHEEP (I'm missing WHEAT and SHEEP)
- RED has the longest road with 10 segments
- There are still 13 development cards remaining in the bank

## Robber Placement Options
Let's analyze each option:

[0] Move robber to (0, 0, 0) and steal from RED
- This is the SHEEP 8 hex
- This blocks a highly productive ⭐⭐⭐ hex that both RED and I use
- I have two cities that produce SHEEP from this hex
- This would hurt my production significantly

[1] Move robber to (1, -1, 0) and steal from RED
- This is the WOOD 6 hex
- This blocks a highly productive ⭐⭐⭐ hex that both RED and I use
- RED has two settlements on this hex
- I have one city on this hex

[2] Move robber to (0, -1, 1)
- This is the WHEAT 4 hex
- I have one city here, but it's only ⭐ productivity
- RED doesn't have any buildings here
- Can't steal from RED

[3] Move robber to (-1, 0, 1)
- This is the ORE 9 hex
- I have a city here with ⭐⭐ production
- RED doesn't have any buildings here
- Can't steal from RED

[4] Move robber to (-1, 1, 0) and steal from RED
- This is the DESERT hex with no production
- Not valuable to block
- RED has a settlement here

[5] Move robber to (0, 1, -1) and steal from RED
- This is the WHEAT 10 hex
- RED has three settlements here
- This is a critical resource hex for RED
- I don't have any buildings here

## Strategic Considerations
1. I need SHEEP and WHEAT to buy a development card
2. RED is at 7 VP, so slowing them down is important
3. I need to avoid hurting my own production if possible
4. I want to maximize the chance of stealing a useful resource

## Decision Process

Since I'm at 9 VP (with my hidden cards) and need just 1 more to win, my priority is:
1. Get WHEAT and SHEEP for a development card
2. Block resources that RED needs for their victory path
3. Maximize my chance of stealing a useful resource

Option [5] (move to WHEAT 10) is excellent because:
- It blocks THREE of RED's settlements, significantly hampering their WHEAT production
- It doesn't impact my production at all
- I have a good chance of stealing WHEAT from RED, which I need
- This prevents RED from using WHEAT to build more settlements or buy development cards

Option [4] (move to DESERT) is poor because it blocks nothing productive.

Options [0] and [1] hurt my own production too much.

Options [2] and [3] don't allow stealing from RED.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL SETTLEMENT PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Place settlements on high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Target at least one spot with good ore and wheat production for city development
- Try to secure at least one high-probability spot (5, 6, 8, 9) for each critical resource
- Place your second settlement to complement your first (fill resource gaps)
- Aim for access to all five resources or position near useful ports if resource diversity isn't possible
- Always consider which settlements opponents are likely to place and avoid areas that will become contested
- Place roads pointing toward valuable future expansion spots, not toward the center
- Consider the long-term impact: settlements that can't expand are less valuable

MID-GAME RESOURCE PRIORITIES:
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each possible build (cities: 1VP for 5 resources is most efficient)
- Early phase: Secure at least one good source of brick and wood for minimal expansion
- Growth phase: Prioritize ore and wheat production for city upgrades (3VP for 5 resources is optimal)
- Late phase: Focus on the fastest path to victory points, whether through buildings or development cards
- Avoid trading resources that opponents need for immediate victory point gains
- Use 4:1 trades only when necessary; prioritize port usage when possible

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and limited expansion options
- If you get an early knight, save it for defense or until you can start building toward largest army
- Time monopoly card usage for when opponents likely have accumulated specific resources
- Save year of plenty cards for completing crucial builds when you're short 1-2 specific resources
- Development cards are most valuable when:
  * You need hidden victory points to surprise opponents
  * You need knights to break up longest road or secure largest army
  * You're lacking wood/brick for expansion but have plenty of sheep/wheat/ore

EXPANSION STRATEGY:
- Build roads only with clear settlement locations in mind
- Target settlements that give you access to ports or new resources
- Block opponents' expansion paths when it gives you a strategic advantage
- Consider the timing of expansion vs. city upgrades based on your resource production
- Calculate whether longest road is achievable and worth the resource investment
- When deciding between a new settlement and a city upgrade, compare immediate vs. long-term returns

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-probability hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Save knight cards for breaking up opponent strategies or securing largest army
- Use knights defensively if you're producing valuable resources on high-probability hexes

TRADING TACTICS:
- Avoid trading resources that directly help opponents score points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades
- Trade excess resources before rolling 7 if you have more than 7 cards
- Consider bank/port trades when they enable an immediate build that advances your strategy
- When trading with players, try to receive resources that complete a build

ENDGAME STRATEGY:
- In the late game, hide your victory point potential (keep development cards hidden)
- Calculate the fastest path to 10 VP and focus exclusively on that path
- Be aware of the exact number of remaining development cards and their probabilities
- Track opponents' potential victory points, including hidden development cards
- If you're close to winning, prioritize actions that can be completed in a single turn

Before finalizing your action, check:
1. Is there a more efficient path to victory points?
2. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
3. Does this move help or hinder opponents?
4. Is there a defensive move needed to prevent an opponent from winning?
5. Are you properly diversified against dice probability?

- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex

- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game State Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state:

**Victory Points:**
- BLUE (me): 6 VP (2 cities = 4 VP + Largest Army = 2 VP + 3 hidden Victory Point cards = 3 VP) = 9 VP total
- RED: 7 VP (5 settlements = 5 VP + Longest Road = 2 VP) = 7 VP total

This means I actually have 9 VP and only need 1 more to win! This is crucial information.

**Resources:**
- I have: 1 🌲WOOD, 4 🐑SHEEP, 3 🌾WHEAT, 3 ⛏️ORE
- This is enough to buy a development card (1 🐑SHEEP, 1 🌾WHEAT, 1 ⛏️ORE)

**Available Actions:**
- End turn
- Buy a development card
- Various 4:1 port trades (which aren't very efficient)

## Strategic Considerations

Since I have 9 VP (including my 3 hidden VP cards), I only need 1 more VP to win. The quickest path would be to try and get a VP development card.

Looking at the remaining development cards:
- There are 13 cards left
- Standard distribution would mean approximately 5 knights, 4 VP cards, 2 road building, 1 monopoly, 1 year of plenty
- So there's roughly a 30% chance of drawing a VP card

Given that RED has 7 VP, they need 3 more VP to win. This would likely require building at least one more settlement plus either another settlement or a city upgrade. They only have 2 hidden resource cards, so they can't build immediately.

## Decision Analysis

Option 1: Buy a development card
- ~30% chance of drawing a VP card and winning immediately
- ~70% chance of getting another card (knight/road building/monopoly/year of plenty)
- Even if I don't get a VP card, I keep resources cycling and might strengthen my largest army

Option 0: End turn
- Save resources for future opportunities
- But this doesn't advance my position and gives RED an opportunity to advance

<plan>
1. Buy a development card with hopes of drawing the VP card I need to win
2. If I don't get a VP card, continue to work toward more development cards with my excess sheep, wheat and ore
3. Be prepared to use any knight cards to defend my largest army advantage
4. Watch for settlement opportunities if resource distribution changes
</plan>

Given that I'm at 9 VP and only need 1 more to win, and I have exactly the resources needed for a development card, buying a development card has about a 30% chance of immediately winning me the game. There's no obvious better use for these resources, and no other clear path to victory in the immediate term.

Based on this information, which action number do you choose? Think step by step about your options, then put the final action number in a box like \boxed{1}.
RESPONSE:
I'll analyze the current game state and determine the optimal action to maximize my chances of winning.

## Current Game State Analysis

1. **Victory Points**:
   - BLUE (me): 6/10 VP (2 cities = 4 VP, largest army = 2 VP)
   - RED: 7/10 VP (5 settlements = 5 VP, longest road = 2 VP)

2. **My Resources**:
   - 1 WOOD, 3 SHEEP, 2 WHEAT, 2 ORE
   - Development Cards: 1 KNIGHT, 3 VICTORY_POINT (these are worth 3 VP)

3. **Available Actions**:
   - [0] End turn
   - [1] Buy development card (costs 1 SHEEP, 1 WHEAT, 1 ORE)

## Strategic Calculation

My actual VP count is 9/10 when counting my hidden victory point cards. I only need 1 more VP to win.

Options:
- Buying a development card gives me a chance to draw a victory point card, which would immediately win me the game.
- The bank has 12 development cards remaining, so the probability is still reasonable.
- There's no way to build a settlement or city this turn with my current resources.

## Victory Probability Analysis

If I buy a development card:
- If it's a VP card → I win immediately (reaching 10 VP)
- If it's a Knight → I strengthen my largest army bonus (defensive)
- If it's another card → I'll need to wait for my next turn

If I end my turn:
- RED is at 7 VP and might be able to reach 10 VP in their turn
- I would need to wait until my next turn to try again for the win

## Decision

With RED at 7 VP, they're dangerously close to winning. I need to maximize my chance of winning immediately. 

Buying a development card is my only path to potential immediate victory, and I have exactly the resources needed. There's simply no reason to end my turn when I can take this chance.

<plan>
1. Buy a development card, hoping for the VP card I need to win
2. If I don't get a VP card, prepare to use knights to defend my largest army advantage
3. Continue to work toward more development cards with my resources
4. Watch for settlement opportunities if resource distribution changes

# Game Analysis

I'll carefully analyze my current position and options to determine the best move.

## Current Game State
- I have 6 victory points (2 cities = 4 VP, largest army = 2 VP)
- I already have 3 victory point cards which are hidden from my opponent
- Red has 7 victory points (5 settlements = 5 VP, longest road = 2 VP)
- Red is ahead by 1 VP, but they don't know about my 3 hidden VP cards
- I have resources: 1 wood, 2 sheep, 1 wheat, 1 ore

## Available Actions
My options are:
- [0] End turn
- [1] Buy a development card (costs 1 sheep, 1 wheat, 1 ore)

## Strategic Analysis
The bank has 11 development cards remaining. If I can get just one more VP card, I'll have 10 VP and win immediately. Let's examine this option:

I currently have exactly the right resources to buy a development card (1 sheep, 1 wheat, 1 ore).

If I buy a development card:
- If it's a VP card: I immediately win (would give me my 10th point)
- If it's a Knight: I strengthen my largest army bonus and can play it later if needed
- If it's Road Building/Year of Plenty/Monopoly: I get a helpful utility card

If I end my turn:
- I keep my current resources but don't advance my position
- I risk bad dice rolls or a robber

Given that I need just 1 more VP to win, and I have the exact resources needed to buy a development card, buying the card is my best chance at an immediate win or at least advancing my position.

<plan>
1. Buy a development card, hoping for the VP card I need to win
2. If I don't get a VP card, continue protecting my largest army advantage
3. Use my two remaining knight cards if needed to protect resources or strengthen largest army
4. Focus on generating more sheep, wheat and ore for additional development cards if this attempt doesn't yield a VP
</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL SETTLEMENT PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Place settlements on high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Target at least one spot with good ore and wheat production for city development
- Try to secure at least one high-probability spot (5, 6, 8, 9) for each critical resource
- Place your second settlement to complement your first (fill resource gaps)
- Aim for access to all five resources or position near useful ports if resource diversity isn't possible
- Always consider which settlements opponents are likely to place and avoid areas that will become contested
- Place roads pointing toward valuable future expansion spots, not toward the center
- Consider the long-term impact: settlements that can't expand are less valuable

MID-GAME RESOURCE PRIORITIES:
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each possible build (cities: 1VP for 5 resources is most efficient)
- Early phase: Secure at least one good source of brick and wood for minimal expansion
- Growth phase: Prioritize ore and wheat production for city upgrades (3VP for 5 resources is optimal)
- Late phase: Focus on the fastest path to victory points, whether through buildings or development cards
- Avoid trading resources that opponents need for immediate victory point gains
- Use 4:1 trades only when necessary; prioritize port usage when possible

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and limited expansion options
- If you get an early knight, save it for defense or until you can start building toward largest army
- Time monopoly card usage for when opponents likely have accumulated specific resources
- Save year of plenty cards for completing crucial builds when you're short 1-2 specific resources
- Development cards are most valuable when:
  * You need hidden victory points to surprise opponents
  * You need knights to break up longest road or secure largest army
  * You're lacking wood/brick for expansion but have plenty of sheep/wheat/ore

EXPANSION STRATEGY:
- Build roads only with clear settlement locations in mind
- Target settlements that give you access to ports or new resources
- Block opponents' expansion paths when it gives you a strategic advantage
- Consider the timing of expansion vs. city upgrades based on your resource production
- Calculate whether longest road is achievable and worth the resource investment
- When deciding between a new settlement and a city upgrade, compare immediate vs. long-term returns

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-probability hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Save knight cards for breaking up opponent strategies or securing largest army
- Use knights defensively if you're producing valuable resources on high-probability hexes

TRADING TACTICS:
- Avoid trading resources that directly help opponents score points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades
- Trade excess resources before rolling 7 if you have more than 7 cards
- Consider bank/port trades when they enable an immediate build that advances your strategy
- When trading with players, try to receive resources that complete a build

ENDGAME STRATEGY:
- In the late game, hide your victory point potential (keep development cards hidden)
- Calculate the fastest path to 10 VP and focus exclusively on that path
- Be aware of the exact number of remaining development cards and their probabilities
- Track opponents' potential victory points, including hidden development cards
- If you're close to winning, prioritize actions that can be completed in a single turn

Before finalizing your action, check:
1. Is there a more efficient path to victory points?
2. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
3. Does this move help or hinder opponents?
4. Is there a defensive move needed to prevent an opponent from winning?
5. Are you properly diversified against dice probability?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game Analysis for Settlers of Catan - Turn 170

I need to analyze my position and decide between playing a Knight card or rolling the dice.

## Current Situation Assessment:
- I have 6 VP (2 cities = 4 VP, Largest Army = 2 VP)
- RED has 7 VP (5 settlements = 5 VP, Longest Road = 2 VP)
- I hold 3 Victory Point cards, which means I actually have 9 VP! Just one more VP needed to win
- My resources: 1 wood and 5 sheep
- Development cards: 3 Knight cards
- The bank has 10 development cards remaining

## Options Analysis:

### Option 0: Play a Knight card
Pros:
- Strengthens my Largest Army lead (would have 6 knights vs 0)
- Could steal a useful resource from RED
- Could move the robber off the wheat hex where it's currently blocking production

Cons:
- Does not immediately increase my VP count
- I don't need to defend my Largest Army as RED has played 0 knights
- Uses up a Knight that could be saved for later defense

### Option 1: Roll the dice
Pros:
- Could generate resources needed to buy a development card (I need ore + wheat + sheep)
- I already have 5 sheep, so just need ore and wheat
- If I get a development card and it's a VP card, I win immediately
- Even without perfect rolls, advancing my resource position helps

Cons:
- Uncertain outcome - might not get what I need
- Risk of rolling a 7 and losing resources if RED has >7 cards

## Decision Logic:
Since I have 9 VP (including my hidden VP cards) and only need 1 more to win, my top priority should be finding a path to that 10th VP. The most direct path would be getting another VP development card.

With my current resources (1 wood, 5 sheep), I can't build any structures that give VP. I need ore and wheat to buy a development card, which could be my winning VP.

Playing a Knight card doesn't advance me toward victory this turn, while rolling has a chance to give me the resources I need. The robber is already on a wheat hex (10), which is unfortunate, but playing a Knight just to move it seems less valuable than trying to generate resources.

<plan>
1. Roll the dice to gain resources
2. If I get ore and wheat, buy a development card immediately
3. If the development card is a VP card, I win
4. If not, continue protecting my Largest Army advantage
5. Focus on generating more resources for additional development card chances
</plan>

Based on my analysis, rolling the dice offers the best chance to advance toward victory this turn.

# Game State Analysis

Let me assess the current situation and my options:

## Victory Point Count
- **Me (BLUE)**: 6 VP (2 cities = 4 VP + Largest Army = 2 VP)
- **RED**: 7 VP (5 settlements = 5 VP + Longest Road = 2 VP)
- I also have 3 hidden Victory Point cards, which means I actually have 9 VP and need just 1 more to win

## Resources & Options
- I have 1 🌲WOOD and 5 🐑SHEEP
- RED has 3 hidden cards
- There are 10 development cards remaining in the bank
- Available actions:
  - Play a knight card
  - End turn
  - Maritime trade (4:1) sheep for various resources

## Strategic Assessment

With 3 hidden VP cards and 6 visible VP, I actually have 9 VP total. I only need 1 more VP to win, which I can get through:
1. Building a settlement (need 1 wood, 1 brick, 1 sheep, 1 wheat)
2. Buying a development card (need 1 ore, 1 sheep, 1 wheat) and hoping for a VP card
3. Building a city (need 2 wheat, 3 ore)

Given my current resources (1 wood, 5 sheep), none of these options are immediately available. I would need to trade sheep at a 4:1 rate, but that's inefficient as I'd need 8 sheep for just 2 resources.

Playing a knight card doesn't directly help me get more VP, since I already have Largest Army. It would only let me move the robber and steal a resource from RED.

<plan>
1. Play a knight card to move the robber from the wheat hex to a productive hex for RED
2. Steal a resource from RED that might help me build toward victory
3. Then use maritime trade if needed to complete a build next turn
4. Focus on getting ore and wheat for a development card, which is my fastest path to victory
</plan>

Since I need just 1 more VP and have 3 knight cards available, playing a knight card now to potentially steal a useful resource from RED is the best option. This gives me a chance to get closer to building something that provides that final VP, or disrupting RED's progress since they're 3 VP away from winning.

- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and limited expansion options
- If you get an early knight, save it for defense or until you can start building toward largest army
- Time monopoly card usage for when opponents likely have accumulated specific resources
- Save year of plenty cards for completing crucial builds when you're short 1-2 specific resources
- Development cards are most valuable when:
  * You need hidden victory points to surprise opponents
  * You need knights to break up longest road or secure largest army
  * You're lacking wood/brick for expansion but have plenty of sheep/wheat/ore

EXPANSION STRATEGY:
- Build roads only with clear settlement locations in mind
- Target settlements that give you access to ports or new resources
- Block opponents' expansion paths when it gives you a strategic advantage
- Consider the timing of expansion vs. city upgrades based on your resource production
- Calculate whether longest road is achievable and worth the resource investment
- When deciding between a new settlement and a city upgrade, compare immediate vs. long-term returns

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-probability hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Save knight cards for breaking up opponent strategies or securing largest army
- Use knights defensively if you're producing valuable resources on high-probability hexes

TRADING TACTICS:
- Avoid trading resources that directly help opponents score points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades
- Trade excess resources before rolling 7 if you have more than 7 cards
- Consider bank/port trades when they enable an immediate build that advances your strategy
- When trading with players, try to receive resources that complete a build

ENDGAME STRATEGY:
- In the late game, hide your victory point potential (keep development cards hidden)
- Calculate the fastest path to 10 VP and focus exclusively on that path
- Be aware of the exact number of remaining development cards and their probabilities
- Track opponents' potential victory points, including hidden development cards
- If you're close to winning, prioritize actions that can be completed in a single turn

Before finalizing your action, check:
1. Is there a more efficient path to victory points?
2. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
3. Does this move help or hinder opponents?
4. Is there a defensive move needed to prevent an opponent from winning?
5. Are you properly diversified against dice probability?

# Game Analysis

I need to move the robber strategically to maximize my chances of winning while hindering RED, who is currently ahead with 7 VP vs my 6 VP.

## Current Game Status
- I (BLUE) have 6 VP: 4 from buildings (2 cities) + 2 from Largest Army
- RED has 7 VP: 5 from buildings (5 settlements) + 2 from Longest Road
- RED is ahead and closer to winning
- I need 4 more VP to win
- I have 3 hidden VP from development cards, so I actually only need 1 more VP

## Resource Analysis
- I have 1 🌲WOOD and 5 🐑SHEEP
- My production: Good on sheep (8) and wood (6), decent ore (9), weak on wheat (4)
- Robber is currently on a wheat hex (10), which is blocking RED's production
- RED has 3 hidden resources

## Strategic Options

Looking at robber placement options:
- [0] Move to sheep hex (0,0,0): Hits both RED and my own production. This is a key hex for both of us.
- [1] Move to wood hex (1,-1,0): Hits RED's wood production from two settlements.
- [2] Move to wheat hex (0,-1,1): Doesn't allow stealing from RED (no settlement here).
- [3] Move to ore hex (-1,0,1): Doesn't allow stealing from RED (no settlement here).
- [4] Move to desert hex (-1,1,0): Allows stealing but desert produces nothing.
- [5] Move to brick hex (1,0,-1): Hits RED's brick production from two settlements.

Since I'm only 1 VP away from winning (with my hidden VP cards), my focus should be on getting the resources I need to build either:
1. Another city (needs 3 ore, 2 wheat)
2. Another settlement + road (needs 1 brick, 1 wood, 1 wheat, 1 sheep)
3. A development card (needs 1 ore, 1 wheat, 1 sheep)

Option [1] is best - placing the robber on RED's wood hex (1,-1,0) with number 6 (high production value) lets me steal potentially useful resources while blocking RED from getting resources they need to build roads and settlements.

<plan>
1. Move robber to RED's wood hex (1,-1,0) to block their high-probability production
2. Steal a resource from RED that might help me build
3. Next turn use my sheep and any stolen resources to get a development card if possible
4. Reveal my VP cards when I can win in a single turn to surprise RED
</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL SETTLEMENT PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Place settlements on high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Target at least one spot with good ore and wheat production for city development
- Try to secure at least one high-probability spot (5, 6, 8, 9) for each critical resource
- Place your second settlement to complement your first (fill resource gaps)
- Aim for access to all five resources or position near useful ports if resource diversity isn't possible
- Always consider which settlements opponents are likely to place and avoid areas that will become contested
- Place roads pointing toward valuable future expansion spots, not toward the center
- Consider the long-term impact: settlements that can't expand are less valuable

MID-GAME RESOURCE PRIORITIES:
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each possible build (cities: 1VP for 5 resources is most efficient)
- Early phase: Secure at least one good source of brick and wood for minimal expansion
- Growth phase: Prioritize ore and wheat production for city upgrades (3VP for 5 resources is optimal)
- Late phase: Focus on the fastest path to victory points, whether through buildings or development cards
- Avoid trading resources that opponents need for immediate victory point gains
- Use 4:1 trades only when necessary; prioritize port usage when possible

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and limited expansion options
- If you get an early knight, save it for defense or until you can start building toward largest army
- Time monopoly card usage for when opponents likely have accumulated specific resources
- Save year of plenty cards for completing crucial builds when you're short 1-2 specific resources
- Development cards are most valuable when:
  * You need hidden victory points to surprise opponents
  * You need knights to break up longest road or secure largest army
  * You're lacking wood/brick for expansion but have plenty of sheep/wheat/ore

EXPANSION STRATEGY:
- Build roads only with clear settlement locations in mind
- Target settlements that give you access to ports or new resources
- Block opponents' expansion paths when it gives you a strategic advantage
- Consider the timing of expansion vs. city upgrades based on your resource production
- Calculate whether longest road is achievable and worth the resource investment
- When deciding between a new settlement and a city upgrade, compare immediate vs. long-term returns

ROBBER STRATEGY:

# Game Analysis for Turn 170

Let me carefully assess the current game state and my available options.

## Current Game State
- I (BLUE) have 6 VP: 2 cities (4 VP) + largest army (2 VP)
- I have 3 hidden VP cards, meaning my actual total is 9 VP
- RED has 7 VP: 5 settlements (5 VP) + longest road (2 VP)
- Resources: 1 wood, 5 sheep, 1 ore
- Development cards: 2 knights
- Robber is already on RED's wood hex (1,-1,0)

## Available Options
0. End turn
1-4. Maritime trades (4:1) with sheep

## Strategic Assessment

First, I need to determine my victory path. With 9 VP already (including my hidden VP cards), I need just 1 more VP to win. 

Options for gaining that 1 VP:
1. Build a settlement (1 wood + 1 brick + 1 sheep + 1 wheat needed)
2. Buy a development card, hoping for a VP card (1 ore + 1 sheep + 1 wheat needed)

I currently lack brick and wheat, making settlement building impossible this turn. For a development card, I have ore but need wheat.

Looking at my resources (1 wood, 5 sheep, 1 ore), none of the maritime trades get me what I need to complete a build this turn. I could trade 4 sheep for 1 wheat, but I'd still need another wheat for a development card.

Since I can't make a winning move right now, I should:
1. Preserve my resources for my next turn
2. End my turn and hope for good dice rolls
3. Maintain my hidden VP advantage - RED doesn't know I'm at 9 points

<plan>
1. End my turn now to preserve resources
2. On my next turn, use any wheat or brick I collect to either buy a development card or build a settlement
3. Reveal my VP cards when I can reach 10 VP in a single turn
4. Be ready to play my knights if RED gets close to winning
</plan>

None of the available maritime trades are efficient or help me win this turn. Trading would deplete my sheep resource without getting me to a complete build. The best move is to end my turn and wait for more favorable conditions.

# Game State Analysis

Let me assess the current situation:

## Victory Point Analysis
- I have 6 VP: 2 cities (4 VP) + Largest Army (2 VP)
- I also have 3 hidden VP cards, which means I actually have 9 VP total
- RED has 7 VP: 5 settlements (5 VP) + Longest Road (2 VP)

## Resources
I have:
- 1 wood
- 5 sheep
- 3 ore
- Missing brick and wheat

## Available Actions
- [0] Play Knight card - Move the robber and steal a resource
- [1] Roll the dice

## Decision Process

I'm at 9 VP (with my hidden VP cards) and need just 1 more VP to win. My options:

1. **Play a Knight card (option 0):**
   - I already have Largest Army with 6 knights
   - Playing another knight would let me move the robber and steal a resource
   - RED only has 2 hidden cards, so the chance of getting something useful is low
   - This doesn't immediately increase my victory points

2. **Roll the dice (option 1):**
   - If I roll, I could get resources needed for:
     - Settlement (1 VP): Would need wood(1) + brick(1) + wheat(1) + sheep(1)
     - Development card: Would need ore(1) + wheat(1) + sheep(1)
   - I'm missing wheat and brick, which are critical for my potential builds

I need to evaluate the best path to getting that final VP:

- With 3 ore and 5 sheep, I'm just missing 1 wheat for a development card, which has a chance to be a VP card
- For a settlement, I'd need brick + wheat, plus I'd need an available spot to build
- Since I'm at 9 VP, I'm very close to winning and should focus on maximizing my chances this turn

The robber is currently on a wood hex (🌲6), which is blocking production of wood. Wood could be useful for building a settlement or road. However, moving the robber won't guarantee I'll get what I need.

Based on this analysis, I should roll the dice first to see what resources I get. If I get wheat, I could buy a development card (with a chance for a VP card). If I get brick, I might be able to build a settlement.

<plan>
1. Roll the dice first to collect resources
2. If I get wheat, buy a development card (potential VP)
3. If I get brick, evaluate settlement options
4. If neither, play a knight card to move the robber and steal a resource
5. Be ready to reveal my VP cards when I can reach 10 VP in a single turn
</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL SETTLEMENT PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Place settlements on high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Target at least one spot with good ore and wheat production for city development
- Try to secure at least one high-probability spot (5, 6, 8, 9) for each critical resource
- Place your second settlement to complement your first (fill resource gaps)
- Aim for access to all five resources or position near useful ports if resource diversity isn't possible
- Always consider which settlements opponents are likely to place and avoid areas that will become contested
- Place roads pointing toward valuable future expansion spots, not toward the center
- Consider the long-term impact: settlements that can't expand are less valuable

MID-GAME RESOURCE PRIORITIES:
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each possible build (cities: 1VP for 5 resources is most efficient)
- Early phase: Secure at least one good source of brick and wood for minimal expansion
- Growth phase: Prioritize ore and wheat production for city upgrades (3VP for 5 resources is optimal)
- Late phase: Focus on the fastest path to victory points, whether through buildings or development cards
- Avoid trading resources that opponents need for immediate victory point gains
- Use 4:1 trades only when necessary; prioritize port usage when possible

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and limited expansion options
- If you get an early knight, save it for defense or until you can start building toward largest army
- Time monopoly card usage for when opponents likely have accumulated specific resources
- Save year of plenty cards for completing crucial builds when you're short 1-2 specific resources
- Development cards are most valuable when:
  * You need hidden victory points to surprise opponents
  * You need knights to break up longest road or secure largest army
  * You're lacking wood/brick for expansion but have plenty of sheep/wheat/ore

EXPANSION STRATEGY:
- Build roads only with clear settlement locations in mind
- Target settlements that give you access to ports or new resources
- Block opponents' expansion paths when it gives you a strategic advantage
- Consider the timing of expansion vs. city upgrades based on your resource production
- Calculate whether longest road is achievable and worth the resource investment
- When deciding between a new settlement and a city upgrade, compare immediate vs. long-term returns

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-probability hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Save knight cards for breaking up opponent strategies or securing largest army
- Use knights defensively if you're producing valuable resources on high-probability hexes

TRADING TACTICS:
- Avoid trading resources that directly help opponents score points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades
- Trade excess resources before rolling 7 if you have more than 7 cards
- Consider bank/port trades when they enable an immediate build that advances your strategy
- When trading with players, try to receive resources that complete a build

ENDGAME STRATEGY:
- In the late game, hide your victory point potential (keep development cards hidden)
- Calculate the fastest path to 10 VP and focus exclusively on that path
- Be aware of the exact number of remaining development cards and their probabilities
- Track opponents' potential victory points, including hidden development cards
- If you're close to winning, prioritize actions that can be completed in a single turn

Before finalizing your action, check:
1. Is there a more efficient path to victory points?
2. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
3. Does this move help or hinder opponents?
4. Is there a defensive move needed to prevent an opponent from winning?
5. Are you properly diversified against dice probability?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game Analysis

I'll carefully analyze my position and the available actions to determine the best strategic move.

## Current Game State
- I have 6 VP (2 cities worth 4 VP + largest army worth 2 VP)
- I have 3 hidden victory point cards
- With my hidden VP cards, I actually have 9 VP total, needing just 1 more to win
- RED player has 7 VP (5 settlements worth 5 VP + longest road worth 2 VP)
- Resources: 1 wood, 9 sheep, 3 ore (no wheat or brick)
- Development cards: 2 knight cards, 3 victory point cards

## Option Analysis

### Option 0: Play Knight Card
Playing a knight card would:
- Move the robber (currently on a wood hex)
- Allow me to steal a resource from an opponent
- Increase my knight count from 6 to 7 (I already have largest army)
- This could be useful to get a resource I need, particularly wheat

### Option 1: End Turn
- I would make no progress this turn
- This wastes the opportunity to use my abundant sheep resources

### Options 2-5: Maritime Trade (4:1)
- Option 2: Trade 4 sheep for 1 wood (would give me 2 wood total)
- Option 3: Trade 4 sheep for 1 brick (would give me 1 brick)
- Option 4: Trade 4 sheep for 1 ore (would give me 4 ore total)
- Option 5: Trade 4 sheep for 1 wheat (would give me 1 wheat)

## Strategic Considerations
1. I'm only 1 VP away from winning with my hidden VP cards
2. I need to find the fastest way to secure that 1 final VP
3. Options for getting the last VP:
   - Build a settlement (need 1 wood, 1 brick, 1 sheep, 1 wheat)
   - Buy a development card (need 1 ore, 1 sheep, 1 wheat) hoping for a VP card
   - Build a city (need 3 ore, 2 wheat)

Looking at my resources, I have plenty of sheep and some ore, but I'm lacking wheat which is needed for all building options. I also need either more wood and brick for a settlement, or more wheat for a city/dev card.

Playing a knight card gives me a chance to steal wheat or another needed resource, which could help complete a build. Given that I'm so close to winning, getting a key resource through the knight card is my best option.

<plan>
1. Play a knight card to move the robber and hopefully steal wheat or brick
2. If I get wheat, trade for the remaining resources needed for a development card
3. If I get another resource, evaluate whether I can complete any build this turn through trades
4. Save my VP cards to reveal all at once for the win when I have 10 VP total
</plan>

Therefore, I choose action 0 - Play a Knight card.

# Analyzing the Move Robber Options

I need to carefully analyze where to place the robber to maximize my strategic advantage while hindering my opponent who is closer to winning with 7 VP versus my 6 VP.

## Current Game Status Review
- I (BLUE) have 6 VP (2 cities = 4 VP + Largest Army = 2 VP + 3 hidden VP cards)
- RED has 7 VP (5 settlements = 5 VP + Longest Road = 2 VP)
- My current resources: 1 🌲WOOD, 9 🐑SHEEP, 3 ⛏️ORE
- I need to prevent RED from reaching 10 VP while advancing my position

## Robber Placement Analysis
Let me evaluate each option:

[0] Move robber to (0, 0, 0) and steal from RED
- This blocks the sheep tile with 8 (high probability)
- This would hurt my own production as my cities at nodes 2 and 4 both produce from this tile
- Not optimal as it harms my production significantly

[1] Move robber to (0, -1, 1)
- This blocks the wheat tile with number 4 (low probability)
- Affects my city at node 2, but it's a low probability number
- Doesn't allow me to steal from RED
- Not very impactful

[2] Move robber to (-1, 0, 1)
- This blocks the ore tile with number 9 (good probability)
- Affects my city at node 4
- Doesn't allow me to steal from RED
- This would hurt my ore production which I need

[3] Move robber to (-1, 1, 0) and steal from RED
- This blocks the desert tile
- No production is blocked
- I can steal from RED
- Excellent choice as it doesn't block any production and lets me steal

[4] Move robber to (0, 1, -1) and steal from RED
- This blocks the wheat tile with number 10 (medium probability)
- Affects RED's settlements at nodes 16 and 19
- I can steal from RED
- Good option to block RED's wheat production

[5] Move robber to (1, 0, -1) and steal from RED
- This blocks the brick tile with number 3 (low probability)
- Affects RED's settlements at nodes 0 and 6
- I can steal from RED
- Good option to block RED's brick production

## Strategic Decision
Looking at RED's settlements, they are producing mainly from wood (6), wheat (10), and brick (3).

Option [3] is excellent because:
1. It doesn't block any production at all (desert)
2. I still get to steal from RED
3. I preserve all my resource production

However, option [4] is even better because:
1. It blocks RED's wheat production from settlements at nodes 16 and 19
2. Wheat is crucial for settlements and development cards
3. I still get to steal from RED
4. It doesn't affect my own production

Option [5] could block RED's brick production, but brick is less critical in late-game than wheat.

<plan>
1. Move the robber to block RED's wheat production (option 4)
2. Continue saving up for development cards (possibly using sheep at port)
3. Save VP cards until I can reveal them all for a surprise win
4. Monitor RED's resources to prevent them from building additional settlements
</plan>

Based on this analysis, I'll choose option 4 to block RED's wheat production and steal a card.

- If you get an early knight, save it for defense or until you can start building toward largest army
- Time monopoly card usage for when opponents likely have accumulated specific resources
- Save year of plenty cards for completing crucial builds when you're short 1-2 specific resources
- Development cards are most valuable when:
  * You need hidden victory points to surprise opponents
  * You need knights to break up longest road or secure largest army
  * You're lacking wood/brick for expansion but have plenty of sheep/wheat/ore

EXPANSION STRATEGY:
- Build roads only with clear settlement locations in mind
- Target settlements that give you access to ports or new resources
- Block opponents' expansion paths when it gives you a strategic advantage
- Consider the timing of expansion vs. city upgrades based on your resource production
- Calculate whether longest road is achievable and worth the resource investment
- When deciding between a new settlement and a city upgrade, compare immediate vs. long-term returns

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-probability hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Save knight cards for breaking up opponent strategies or securing largest army
- Use knights defensively if you're producing valuable resources on high-probability hexes

TRADING TACTICS:
- Avoid trading resources that directly help opponents score points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades
- Trade excess resources before rolling 7 if you have more than 7 cards
- Consider bank/port trades when they enable an immediate build that advances your strategy
- When trading with players, try to receive resources that complete a build

ENDGAME STRATEGY:
- In the late game, hide your victory point potential (keep development cards hidden)
- Calculate the fastest path to 10 VP and focus exclusively on that path
- Be aware of the exact number of remaining development cards and their probabilities
- Track opponents' potential victory points, including hidden development cards
- If you're close to winning, prioritize actions that can be completed in a single turn

Before finalizing your action, check:
1. Is there a more efficient path to victory points?
2. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
3. Does this move help or hinder opponents?
4. Is there a defensive move needed to prevent an opponent from winning?
5. Are you properly diversified against dice probability?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 172 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Move the robber to block RED's wheat production (option 4)
2. Continue saving up for development cards (possibly using sheep at port)
3. Save VP cards until I can reveal them all for a surprise win
4. Monitor RED's resources to prevent them from building additional settlements

# Game State Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state:

## Victory Point Situation
- I (BLUE) have 6 VP: 2 (cities) + 2 (largest army) + 2 (cities' building value)
- RED has 7 VP: 5 (settlements) + 2 (longest road)
- I have 3 hidden VP development cards, which means I actually have 9 VP and need only 1 more to win

## Resources
- I have: 1 🌲WOOD, 10 🐑SHEEP, 3 ⛏️ORE
- The bank has 10 development cards remaining

## Strategic Assessment

The immediate observation is that I have 9 VP (with 3 VP cards hidden), so I need just 1 more VP to win. The fastest way to get that would be through another VP development card, which requires 1 SHEEP, 1 WHEAT, and 1 ORE.

I currently have SHEEP and ORE, but no WHEAT. Given my excess of SHEEP (10), the most strategic option would be to trade for the WHEAT I need to buy a development card that could potentially be a VP card.

Looking at the options:
0. End turn - Not advisable when I could improve my position
1-3. Trading for WOOD, BRICK or more ORE - Not helpful for my immediate goal
4. Trading for WHEAT - This directly advances my strategy to buy a development card

Trading 4 SHEEP for 1 WHEAT would leave me with 6 SHEEP, 1 WOOD, 3 ORE, and 1 WHEAT - exactly what I need to buy a development card.

If the development card is a Victory Point, I win immediately. If it's a Knight, I could play it to strengthen my Largest Army lead. Even other card types would give me options on my next turn.

## Decision
The optimal action is to trade 4 SHEEP for 1 WHEAT, setting up a potential win through a development card purchase.

<plan>
1. Trade 4 SHEEP for 1 WHEAT (option 4)
2. Buy a development card on my next opportunity
3. If it's a VP card, reveal all 4 VP cards for an immediate win
4. If not, play defensively and continue working toward the final VP
</plan>

\boxed{4}
========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL SETTLEMENT PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Place settlements on high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Target at least one spot with good ore and wheat production for city development
- Try to secure at least one high-probability spot (5, 6, 8, 9) for each critical resource
- Place your second settlement to complement your first (fill resource gaps)
- Aim for access to all five resources or position near useful ports if resource diversity isn't possible
- Always consider which settlements opponents are likely to place and avoid areas that will become contested
- Place roads pointing toward valuable future expansion spots, not toward the center
- Consider the long-term impact: settlements that can't expand are less valuable

MID-GAME RESOURCE PRIORITIES:
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each possible build (cities: 1VP for 5 resources is most efficient)
- Early phase: Secure at least one good source of brick and wood for minimal expansion
- Growth phase: Prioritize ore and wheat production for city upgrades (3VP for 5 resources is optimal)
- Late phase: Focus on the fastest path to victory points, whether through buildings or development cards
- Avoid trading resources that opponents need for immediate victory point gains
- Use 4:1 trades only when necessary; prioritize port usage when possible

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and limited expansion options
- If you get an early knight, save it for defense or until you can start building toward largest army
- Time monopoly card usage for when opponents likely have accumulated specific resources
- Save year of plenty cards for completing crucial builds when you're short 1-2 specific resources
- Development cards are most valuable when:
  * You need hidden victory points to surprise opponents

# Game State Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state and make a strategic decision:

## Current Points Breakdown
- I have 6 victory points: 2 cities (4 VP) + largest army (2 VP)
- Red has 7 victory points: 5 settlements (5 VP) + longest road (2 VP)
- I have 3 hidden victory point cards

## Resources
- I currently have: 1 wood, 6 sheep, 1 wheat, 3 ore
- I need resources to either:
  1. Play my remaining knight card (need nothing)
  2. Buy another development card (need 1 sheep, 1 wheat, 1 ore)
  3. Build settlements/roads (need brick and wood)

## Victory Condition Analysis
With my 3 hidden VP cards, I'm actually at 9/10 victory points. I only need 1 more point to win. The fastest way to win would be to buy one more development card and hope it's a victory point card.

For that, I need 1 sheep, 1 wheat, and 1 ore. I already have sheep and ore, but I'm short on wheat (only have 1). For a development card, I need 1 wheat.

Looking at the available actions, I can trade 4 sheep for 1 wheat (option 5). Then on my next turn, I can buy a development card (if it's a VP card, I win).

## Risk Analysis
Red has 7 points and could potentially be hiding development cards. My move should be decisive and fast.

<plan>
1. Trade 4 sheep for 1 wheat (option 5)
2. Next turn, buy a development card
3. If it's a VP card, I win immediately
4. If not, play defensively and continue working to secure the final VP
</plan>

Based on this analysis, the optimal move is to trade 4 sheep for 1 wheat:

- I have 6 Victory Points
  - 2 Cities (4 VP)
  - Largest Army bonus (2 VP)
  - 3 hidden VP cards
- I actually have 9 VP in total, just one short of winning
- My opponent RED has 7 VP and holds the Longest Road bonus (2 VP)
- I have the following resources: 1 Wood, 2 Sheep, 2 Wheat, 3 Ore
- I can buy a development card (costs 1 Sheep, 1 Wheat, 1 Ore)

## Strategic Analysis
Since I actually have 9 VP (6 visible + 3 hidden), I only need one more VP to win the game. The bank has 10 development cards remaining, and if I draw a Victory Point card, I will immediately win the game.

According to standard Catan probabilities, development cards typically include:
- 5 Victory Point cards
- 14 Knight cards
- 6 Progress cards

Since I've already played 11 development cards (7 Knights, 2 Year of Plenty, 1 Monopoly, 1 Road Building), and I have 1 Knight in hand, that means 12 cards are accounted for. If the bank has 10 cards remaining, then approximately 22 cards have been distributed in some way, meaning some Victory Point cards are still available.

## Decision Analysis
- Option [0]: End my turn
  This doesn't advance me toward victory and gives my opponent another turn.

- Option [1]: Buy a development card
  This gives me a chance to immediately win if I draw a Victory Point card. Even if I don't get a VP card, a Knight would allow me to continue building my largest army advantage, and a progress card could help me next turn.

Given that I'm at 9 VP (with hidden VP cards) and only need one more to win, buying a development card is clearly the optimal choice. This gives me the best chance to win immediately or strengthen my position for the next turn.

<plan>
1. Buy a development card (option 1)
2. If it's a VP card, I win immediately
3. If it's a Knight or Progress card, save it for strategic use next turn
4. Next turn, focus on either buying another development card or building a settlement to secure the final VP
</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL SETTLEMENT PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Place settlements on high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Target at least one spot with good ore and wheat production for city development
- Try to secure at least one high-probability spot (5, 6, 8, 9) for each critical resource
- Place your second settlement to complement your first (fill resource gaps)
- Aim for access to all five resources or position near useful ports if resource diversity isn't possible
- Always consider which settlements opponents are likely to place and avoid areas that will become contested
- Place roads pointing toward valuable future expansion spots, not toward the center
- Consider the long-term impact: settlements that can't expand are less valuable

MID-GAME RESOURCE PRIORITIES:
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each possible build (cities: 1VP for 5 resources is most efficient)
- Early phase: Secure at least one good source of brick and wood for minimal expansion
- Growth phase: Prioritize ore and wheat production for city upgrades (3VP for 5 resources is optimal)
- Late phase: Focus on the fastest path to victory points, whether through buildings or development cards
- Avoid trading resources that opponents need for immediate victory point gains
- Use 4:1 trades only when necessary; prioritize port usage when possible

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and limited expansion options
- If you get an early knight, save it for defense or until you can start building toward largest army
- Time monopoly card usage for when opponents likely have accumulated specific resources
- Save year of plenty cards for completing crucial builds when you're short 1-2 specific resources
- Development cards are most valuable when:
  * You need hidden victory points to surprise opponents
  * You need knights to break up longest road or secure largest army
  * You're lacking wood/brick for expansion but have plenty of sheep/wheat/ore

EXPANSION STRATEGY:
- Build roads only with clear settlement locations in mind
- Target settlements that give you access to ports or new resources
- Block opponents' expansion paths when it gives you a strategic advantage
- Consider the timing of expansion vs. city upgrades based on your resource production
- Calculate whether longest road is achievable and worth the resource investment
- When deciding between a new settlement and a city upgrade, compare immediate vs. long-term returns

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-probability hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Save knight cards for breaking up opponent strategies or securing largest army
- Use knights defensively if you're producing valuable resources on high-probability hexes

TRADING TACTICS:
- Avoid trading resources that directly help opponents score points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades
- Trade excess resources before rolling 7 if you have more than 7 cards
- Consider bank/port trades when they enable an immediate build that advances your strategy
- When trading with players, try to receive resources that complete a build

ENDGAME STRATEGY:
- In the late game, hide your victory point potential (keep development cards hidden)
- Calculate the fastest path to 10 VP and focus exclusively on that path
- Be aware of the exact number of remaining development cards and their probabilities
- Track opponents' potential victory points, including hidden development cards
- If you're close to winning, prioritize actions that can be completed in a single turn

Before finalizing your action, check:
1. Is there a more efficient path to victory points?
2. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
3. Does this move help or hinder opponents?
4. Is there a defensive move needed to prevent an opponent from winning?
5. Are you properly diversified against dice probability?

- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex

- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game State Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state:

- I have 6 victory points (3 from my 2 cities + largest army bonus)
- I also have 3 victory point development cards that haven't been played yet
- This means I actually have 9 victory points total, just 1 short of winning
- My opponent (RED) has 7 visible victory points (5 settlements + longest road)

## Resource Analysis
I currently have:
- 1 wood
- 1 sheep
- 1 wheat
- 2 ore

## Options Analysis

[0] End Turn: This accomplishes nothing strategic. I'm 1 VP away from winning, so I should try to win now if possible.

[1] Buy Development Card: This costs 1 sheep, 1 wheat, and 1 ore - which I have. There are 9 development cards remaining.

If I buy a development card, there are several possibilities:
- Victory Point Card: This would give me my 10th point and an immediate win
- Knight Card: Would strengthen my largest army but not give me the final point I need
- Progress Card: Would be helpful but not give me the final point I need

Let me calculate the probability of drawing a victory point card:

In standard Catan:
- 14 Knight cards
- 5 Victory Point cards
- 6 Progress cards (2 each of Monopoly, Road Building, Year of Plenty)

From the game state, I know:
- 7 Knight cards have been played
- 3 Victory Point cards are in my hand
- 4 Progress cards have been played

So from the original 25 cards:
- 7+2 = 9 Knight cards are accounted for (7 played, 2 in my hand)
- 3 Victory Point cards are accounted for (in my hand)
- 4 Progress cards are accounted for (played)
- Total accounted for: 16 cards

This means the 9 remaining cards in the development card pile could be:
- Up to 5 Knight cards
- Up to 2 Victory Point cards
- Up to 2 Progress cards

The chance of drawing a Victory Point card is therefore at most 2/9 ≈ 22%.

<plan>
1. Buy a development card (option 1)
2. If it's a VP card, I win immediately
3. If not, I'll need to plan for my next turn to either buy another development card or build a settlement
4. Next turn, I should be able to produce more resources based on my excellent cities
</plan>

While a 22% chance of winning immediately isn't guaranteed, it's clearly the superior option. Ending my turn gives me 0% chance of winning now. The development card has the potential to give me the instant win, and even if I don't get a victory point card, I'll be in good position for my next turn.

# Game Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state and available options:

## Current Status:
- I (BLUE) have 6 victory points:
  - 2 cities (4 VP)
  - Largest Army (2 VP)
  - 3 hidden victory point cards (3 VP) - these aren't counted in my displayed total yet!
- RED has 7 victory points:
  - 5 settlements (5 VP)
  - Longest Road (2 VP)
- Total for me: 6 displayed + 3 hidden = 9 VP (I'm actually just 1 VP away from winning!)
- I have resources: 1 wood, 2 wheat, 1 ore

## Available Actions:
- [0] Play Knight card - Move robber and steal a resource
- [1] Roll the dice

## Strategic Assessment:
Since I actually have 9 victory points (including my hidden VP cards), I only need 1 more VP to win. The fastest way would be to either:
1. Buy a development card hoping for a victory point card
2. Build another settlement

Looking at my resources (1 wood, 2 wheat, 1 ore), I can't build a settlement (need 1 wood, 1 brick, 1 sheep, 1 wheat) or buy a development card (need 1 ore, 1 sheep, 1 wheat) yet.

My best course of action is to roll the dice and hope to get the resources I need. If I get the right resources, I can buy a development card which has a chance of being the final VP I need.

<plan>
1. Roll the dice to gather more resources
2. If I get enough resources to buy a development card (ore + sheep + wheat), purchase one
3. If it's a VP card, I win immediately
4. If not, continue gathering resources next turn to either buy another development card or build a settlement
</plan>

I should choose option [1] to roll the dice.

# Game Analysis

Let me carefully examine the current game state and my options.

## Victory Point Analysis
- BLUE (me): 6/10 VP (2 cities = 4 VP, Largest Army = 2 VP)
- RED: 7/10 VP (5 settlements = 5 VP, Longest Road = 2 VP)
- I'm behind by 1 VP but I have 3 hidden VP cards!

## Resources
I currently have:
- 1 🌲 WOOD
- 2 🌾 WHEAT
- 1 ⛏️ ORE
- 0 🐑 SHEEP
- 0 🧱 BRICK

## Key Opportunities
I have 3 VP development cards, which means I actually have 9 VP total (6 visible + 3 hidden). I only need 1 more VP to win!

## Available Actions Assessment
1. **Play Knight Card [0]**:
   - I already have Largest Army with 7 knights played
   - Playing another knight doesn't give me any additional VP
   - Could potentially disrupt RED's production or steal a useful resource
   - But even with a perfect steal, I wouldn't have enough to build anything immediately

2. **End Turn [1]**:
   - Roll dice next turn and potentially get resources to buy another development card
   - There are 8 development cards left in the bank
   - If I get a VP card, I'll win immediately (I'll have 10 VP)

## Decision Logic
I'm actually in a very strong position with 9 VP (6 visible + 3 hidden). My current plan to buy a development card and hope for a VP card is the fastest path to victory. However, I don't currently have the resources needed (ore + sheep + wheat). Playing a knight now doesn't get me closer to my goal.

The optimal strategy is to end my turn and roll the dice next turn, hopefully getting the resources I need to buy a development card. With my settlements on high-probability numbers (6, 8, 9), I have a good chance of getting more resources next turn.

<plan>
1. End my turn now
2. On my next turn, roll the dice to gather resources
3. If I get enough resources for a development card (ore + sheep + wheat), buy one
4. If it's a VP card, reveal all VP cards and win
5. If not, continue gathering resources for another development card or prepare defensive moves if RED is close to winning
</plan>

\boxed{1}
========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL SETTLEMENT PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Place settlements on high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Target at least one spot with good ore and wheat production for city development
- Try to secure at least one high-probability spot (5, 6, 8, 9) for each critical resource
- Place your second settlement to complement your first (fill resource gaps)
- Aim for access to all five resources or position near useful ports if resource diversity isn't possible
- Always consider which settlements opponents are likely to place and avoid areas that will become contested
- Place roads pointing toward valuable future expansion spots, not toward the center
- Consider the long-term impact: settlements that can't expand are less valuable

MID-GAME RESOURCE PRIORITIES:
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each possible build (cities: 1VP for 5 resources is most efficient)
- Early phase: Secure at least one good source of brick and wood for minimal expansion
- Growth phase: Prioritize ore and wheat production for city upgrades (3VP for 5 resources is optimal)
- Late phase: Focus on the fastest path to victory points, whether through buildings or development cards
- Avoid trading resources that opponents need for immediate victory point gains
- Use 4:1 trades only when necessary; prioritize port usage when possible

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and limited expansion options
- If you get an early knight, save it for defense or until you can start building toward largest army
- Time monopoly card usage for when opponents likely have accumulated specific resources
- Save year of plenty cards for completing crucial builds when you're short 1-2 specific resources
- Development cards are most valuable when:
  * You need hidden victory points to surprise opponents
  * You need knights to break up longest road or secure largest army
  * You're lacking wood/brick for expansion but have plenty of sheep/wheat/ore

EXPANSION STRATEGY:
- Build roads only with clear settlement locations in mind
- Target settlements that give you access to ports or new resources
- Block opponents' expansion paths when it gives you a strategic advantage
- Consider the timing of expansion vs. city upgrades based on your resource production
- Calculate whether longest road is achievable and worth the resource investment
- When deciding between a new settlement and a city upgrade, compare immediate vs. long-term returns

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-probability hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Save knight cards for breaking up opponent strategies or securing largest army
- Use knights defensively if you're producing valuable resources on high-probability hexes

TRADING TACTICS:
- Avoid trading resources that directly help opponents score points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades
- Trade excess resources before rolling 7 if you have more than 7 cards
- Consider bank/port trades when they enable an immediate build that advances your strategy
- When trading with players, try to receive resources that complete a build

ENDGAME STRATEGY:
- In the late game, hide your victory point potential (keep development cards hidden)
- Calculate the fastest path to 10 VP and focus exclusively on that path
- Be aware of the exact number of remaining development cards and their probabilities
- Track opponents' potential victory points, including hidden development cards
- If you're close to winning, prioritize actions that can be completed in a single turn

Before finalizing your action, check:
1. Is there a more efficient path to victory points?
2. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
3. Does this move help or hinder opponents?
4. Is there a defensive move needed to prevent an opponent from winning?
5. Are you properly diversified against dice probability?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

5. If not, continue gathering resources for another development card or prepare defensive moves if RED is close to winning
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.

# Game State Analysis

Let me analyze the current situation carefully:

## Victory Points Status
- My points (BLUE): 6/10 (2 cities = 4 VP, Largest Army = 2 VP)
- RED points: 7/10 (5 settlements = 5 VP, Longest Road = 2 VP)
- RED is ahead by 1 point

## My Resources & Cards
- Resources: 1 Wood, 2 Wheat, 1 Ore
- Development Cards: 3 Knight cards, 3 Victory Point cards

## Key Insight
I have 3 Victory Point cards that haven't been revealed yet! These are worth 3 VP, which means my actual total is 9 VP. I only need 1 more VP to win the game.

## Options Analysis

### Option 0: Play Knight Card
- Benefits: Moves the robber from the wheat hex (not blocking any of my production), could steal a resource from RED
- Downsides: Doesn't help me reach 10 VP immediately

### Option 1: Roll Dice
- Benefits: Could gain resources to buy a development card (need 1 Sheep + have enough Wheat and Ore)
- If I get a VP card, I would win immediately (would have 10 VP)
- Bank has 8 development cards left - probability analysis suggests a good chance of drawing VP

<plan>
1. Roll the dice to gather resources
2. If I get sheep, purchase a development card
3. If that card is a VP card, reveal all VP cards and win (reaching 10 VP)
4. If not a VP card, use it strategically and prepare for next turn
</plan>

Since I only need one more victory point to win, and my best path is through development cards, I should roll the dice to try to get sheep for a development card purchase.

# Robber Placement Analysis

I need to decide where to place the robber to maximize my strategic advantage in this critical game state.

## Game State Analysis
- I (BLUE) have 6 VP: 2 cities (4 VP) + Largest Army (2 VP)
- RED has 7 VP: 5 settlements (5 VP) + Longest Road (2 VP)
- RED is closer to winning with 7/10 VP compared to my 6/10 VP
- I have 3 VP development cards that I'm holding - these will give me 9 VP total when revealed
- I need just 1 more VP to win, which could come from another VP development card

## Resource Production Analysis
- I produce primarily from 8🐑 (both cities), 6🌲 (one city), and 9⛏️ (one city)
- RED produces from multiple hexes with varying probabilities

## Robber Placement Options
Let me analyze each option:

[0] Move robber to (0, 0, 0) and steal from RED
- This is the sheep(8) hex
- This would block my own good production (both my cities produce from here!)
- Very poor option as it hurts me more than RED

[1] Move robber to (1, -1, 0) and steal from RED
- This is the wood(6) hex
- RED has settlement at node 6 and node 8 producing from this hex
- This would block RED's good wood production
- But also blocks my own city's wood production at node 2
- Not optimal as it hurts my production too

[2] Move robber to (0, -1, 1)
- This is the wheat(4) hex
- Only impacts my city at node 2, but it's a 4 (low probability)
- No RED settlements here
- Low strategic value

[3] Move robber to (-1, 0, 1)
- This is the ore(9) hex
- Blocks my city at node 4 (high probability)
- RED doesn't produce from here
- Poor option as it only hurts me

[4] Move robber to (-1, 1, 0) and steal from RED
- This is the desert hex
- No production to block
- Can still steal from RED
- Good defensive option with no production impact

[5] Move robber to (1, 0, -1) and steal from RED
- This is the brick(3) hex
- Blocks RED's settlements at nodes 0 and 6
- Low probability (3) so minimal impact
- Allows stealing from RED
- Good offensive option with minimal impact on me

## Strategic Decision
I need to:
1. Prevent RED from gaining resources (they're ahead at 7 VP)
2. Avoid blocking my own production
3. Steal a potentially useful resource from RED

Looking at my options, I should either:
- Place on the desert [4] (defensive, doesn't block production)
- Place on brick [5] (offensive, blocks RED's low-probability brick)

Between these two, option [5] is better as it blocks RED's brick production while having minimal impact on the game due to the low probability (3). This could slow RED's road-building strategy slightly. Additionally, I get to steal a card from RED which is useful.

<plan>
1. Place the robber on the brick hex to block RED's production
2. Roll the dice and gather resources on my next turn
3. If I get sheep+wheat+ore, purchase a development card
4. If that card is a VP card, reveal all VP cards and win (reaching 10 VP)
5. Otherwise, prepare for the next turn while protecting my lead
</plan>

3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL SETTLEMENT PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Place settlements on high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Target at least one spot with good ore and wheat production for city development
- Try to secure at least one high-probability spot (5, 6, 8, 9) for each critical resource
- Place your second settlement to complement your first (fill resource gaps)
- Aim for access to all five resources or position near useful ports if resource diversity isn't possible
- Always consider which settlements opponents are likely to place and avoid areas that will become contested
- Place roads pointing toward valuable future expansion spots, not toward the center
- Consider the long-term impact: settlements that can't expand are less valuable

MID-GAME RESOURCE PRIORITIES:
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each possible build (cities: 1VP for 5 resources is most efficient)
- Early phase: Secure at least one good source of brick and wood for minimal expansion
- Growth phase: Prioritize ore and wheat production for city upgrades (3VP for 5 resources is optimal)
- Late phase: Focus on the fastest path to victory points, whether through buildings or development cards
- Avoid trading resources that opponents need for immediate victory point gains
- Use 4:1 trades only when necessary; prioritize port usage when possible

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and limited expansion options
- If you get an early knight, save it for defense or until you can start building toward largest army
- Time monopoly card usage for when opponents likely have accumulated specific resources
- Save year of plenty cards for completing crucial builds when you're short 1-2 specific resources
- Development cards are most valuable when:
  * You need hidden victory points to surprise opponents
  * You need knights to break up longest road or secure largest army
  * You're lacking wood/brick for expansion but have plenty of sheep/wheat/ore

EXPANSION STRATEGY:
- Build roads only with clear settlement locations in mind
- Target settlements that give you access to ports or new resources
- Block opponents' expansion paths when it gives you a strategic advantage
- Consider the timing of expansion vs. city upgrades based on your resource production
- Calculate whether longest road is achievable and worth the resource investment
- When deciding between a new settlement and a city upgrade, compare immediate vs. long-term returns

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-probability hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Save knight cards for breaking up opponent strategies or securing largest army
- Use knights defensively if you're producing valuable resources on high-probability hexes

TRADING TACTICS:
- Avoid trading resources that directly help opponents score points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades
- Trade excess resources before rolling 7 if you have more than 7 cards
- Consider bank/port trades when they enable an immediate build that advances your strategy
- When trading with players, try to receive resources that complete a build

ENDGAME STRATEGY:
- In the late game, hide your victory point potential (keep development cards hidden)
- Calculate the fastest path to 10 VP and focus exclusively on that path
- Be aware of the exact number of remaining development cards and their probabilities
- Track opponents' potential victory points, including hidden development cards
- If you're close to winning, prioritize actions that can be completed in a single turn

Before finalizing your action, check:
1. Is there a more efficient path to victory points?
2. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
3. Does this move help or hinder opponents?
4. Is there a defensive move needed to prevent an opponent from winning?
5. Are you properly diversified against dice probability?

Board Understanding Guide:

- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 176 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Place the robber on the brick hex to block RED's production
2. Roll the dice and gather resources on my next turn
3. If I get sheep+wheat+ore, purchase a development card
4. If that card is a VP card, reveal all VP cards and win (reaching 10 VP)
5. Otherwise, prepare for the next turn while protecting my lead

# Game Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state and available options:

## Current Game State
- I (BLUE) have 6 Victory Points (2 Cities = 4 VP + Largest Army = 2 VP)
- I have 3 hidden Victory Point cards
- RED has 7 Victory Points (5 Settlements = 5 VP + Longest Road = 2 VP)
- I have resources: 1 WOOD, 1 SHEEP, 2 WHEAT, 1 ORE
- There are 8 development cards remaining in the bank

## Victory Path Analysis
If I reveal my 3 Victory Point cards, I'll have 9 VP. I need one more VP to win.

## Available Actions
[0] Play Knight - Move robber and steal a resource
[1] End turn
[2] Buy development card (costs 1 SHEEP, 1 WHEAT, 1 ORE)

## Action Analysis

### Option 0: Play Knight
- I already have Largest Army (7 knights played)
- Playing another knight doesn't increase my VP
- I could move the robber to block RED's production and possibly steal a resource
- This doesn't immediately help me win

### Option 1: End Turn
- This doesn't advance my position
- I'll have to wait for my next turn to potentially win

### Option 2: Buy Development Card
- I have the exact resources needed (1 SHEEP, 1 WHEAT, 1 ORE)
- With 8 cards remaining in the bank, there's a chance of drawing a Victory Point card
- If I draw a VP card, I'll have 10 VP and win immediately
- Even if I draw a Knight, Road Building, Year of Plenty, or Monopoly, I'll still have useful cards for future turns

## Decision Logic
Since I have 3 hidden VP cards and need just one more to win, buying a development card is the optimal move. If I get a VP card, I win immediately. The other options don't offer a path to immediate victory.

<plan>
1. Buy a development card with my SHEEP, WHEAT, and ORE
2. If it's a Victory Point card, reveal all 4 VP cards and win with 10 points
3. If not, save the card for strategic use on future turns and continue protecting my position

# Game State Analysis

First, let me assess the current game state and my options:

## Victory Point Distribution
- I (BLUE) have 6 VPs:
  - 2 Cities (4 VPs)
  - Largest Army (2 VPs)
  - 3 hidden Victory Point cards (3 VPs) - not yet revealed
- RED has 7 VPs:
  - 5 Settlements (5 VPs)
  - Longest Road (2 VPs)

## My Actual VP Count & Win Condition
- I actually have 9 VPs total (6 visible + 3 hidden)
- I need just 1 more VP to win

## Resources
- I have 1 Wood and 1 Wheat
- I need Ore and Sheep to buy a development card (which is my current plan)

## Available Actions
0. Play Knight card - Move the robber and steal a resource
1. End turn

## Strategic Assessment

Looking at my current plan and resources, I don't have enough resources to buy a development card right now (need Ore and Sheep). My plan mentions buying a development card, but I can't execute that without the required resources.

I have 3 Knight cards available to play. Playing a Knight would:
1. Allow me to move the robber from the Brick hex (which isn't particularly useful to me)
2. Let me steal a resource from RED (they have 1 card)
3. Potentially block a resource RED needs

RED is at 7 VPs and needs 3 more to win. They have the Longest Road bonus, 5 settlements, and no cities yet. With more settlements than me, they likely have better resource diversity.

<plan>
1. Play a Knight card to move the robber to a hex producing resources RED needs (likely Wheat or Wood)
2. Attempt to steal a resource from RED
3. On future turns, collect the resources needed (Sheep, Wheat, Ore) to buy a development card
4. If the development card is a Victory Point, I'll win immediately (reaching 10 VP)
5. If not, continue with defensive play while building toward victory
</plan>

Based on my analysis, playing a Knight card is the optimal move. This gives me a chance to steal a needed resource, disrupt RED's production, and maintain my position while working toward my goal of buying another development card. Since I'm at 9 VP (with hidden VP cards), I'm actually closer to winning than RED knows.

# Game Analysis for Robber Movement

Let me analyze the current game state and the available robber movement options:

## Current Standings
- Blue (me): 6 VP (includes +2 for Largest Army)
- Red: 7 VP (includes +2 for Longest Road)

I have 3 hidden Victory Point cards, which means my actual VP count is 9/10. I only need 1 more VP to win!

## Resources and Production Analysis
Let's analyze what each robber placement would block:

- Option [0]: Move to (0, 0, 0) - Sheep 8 (high production)
  * Blocks both MY cities, which produce Sheep 8
  * This would severely hurt my production

- Option [1]: Move to (1, -1, 0) - Wood 6 (high production)
  * Blocks Red's settlements at 6 and 8
  * Blocks my city at node 2
  * Would hurt both of us

- Option [2]: Move to (0, -1, 1) - Wheat 4 (low production)
  * Doesn't hurt Red much
  * Blocks my city at node 2 (minor impact due to low number)

- Option [3]: Move to (-1, 0, 1) - Ore 9 (good production)
  * Blocks my city at node 4
  * Doesn't affect Red

- Option [4]: Move to (-1, 1, 0) - Desert
  * No production impact (desert tile)
  * Can steal from Red

- Option [5]: Move to (0, 1, -1) - Wheat 10 (medium production)
  * Blocks Red's settlements at 0, 16, and 19
  * Could significantly impact Red's Wheat production

## Strategic Decision
Since I only need 1 more VP to win and I have 2 knight cards + enough resources (Sheep, Wheat, Ore) to buy a development card on my next turn, I should:

1. Block Red's production to slow them down
2. Avoid hurting my own production
3. Target resources Red needs most

Red has multiple settlements on the Wheat 10 hex, making option [5] very strong. This would block three of Red's settlements that produce Wheat while not affecting my production at all.

<plan>
1. Move robber to (0, 1, -1) to block Red's Wheat production
2. Steal a card from Red
3. On my next turn, play a Knight card or buy a development card (hoping for VP)
4. Win with 10 VP (my current 9 VP including hidden ones + 1 more)
</plan>

Therefore, my optimal move is:

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL SETTLEMENT PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Place settlements on high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Target at least one spot with good ore and wheat production for city development
- Try to secure at least one high-probability spot (5, 6, 8, 9) for each critical resource
- Place your second settlement to complement your first (fill resource gaps)
- Aim for access to all five resources or position near useful ports if resource diversity isn't possible
- Always consider which settlements opponents are likely to place and avoid areas that will become contested
- Place roads pointing toward valuable future expansion spots, not toward the center
- Consider the long-term impact: settlements that can't expand are less valuable

MID-GAME RESOURCE PRIORITIES:
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each possible build (cities: 1VP for 5 resources is most efficient)
- Early phase: Secure at least one good source of brick and wood for minimal expansion
- Growth phase: Prioritize ore and wheat production for city upgrades (3VP for 5 resources is optimal)
- Late phase: Focus on the fastest path to victory points, whether through buildings or development cards
- Avoid trading resources that opponents need for immediate victory point gains
- Use 4:1 trades only when necessary; prioritize port usage when possible

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and limited expansion options
- If you get an early knight, save it for defense or until you can start building toward largest army
- Time monopoly card usage for when opponents likely have accumulated specific resources
- Save year of plenty cards for completing crucial builds when you're short 1-2 specific resources
- Development cards are most valuable when:
  * You need hidden victory points to surprise opponents
  * You need knights to break up longest road or secure largest army
  * You're lacking wood/brick for expansion but have plenty of sheep/wheat/ore

EXPANSION STRATEGY:
- Build roads only with clear settlement locations in mind
- Target settlements that give you access to ports or new resources
- Block opponents' expansion paths when it gives you a strategic advantage
- Consider the timing of expansion vs. city upgrades based on your resource production
- Calculate whether longest road is achievable and worth the resource investment
- When deciding between a new settlement and a city upgrade, compare immediate vs. long-term returns

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-probability hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Save knight cards for breaking up opponent strategies or securing largest army
- Use knights defensively if you're producing valuable resources on high-probability hexes

TRADING TACTICS:
- Avoid trading resources that directly help opponents score points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades
- Trade excess resources before rolling 7 if you have more than 7 cards
- Consider bank/port trades when they enable an immediate build that advances your strategy
- When trading with players, try to receive resources that complete a build

ENDGAME STRATEGY:
- In the late game, hide your victory point potential (keep development cards hidden)
- Calculate the fastest path to 10 VP and focus exclusively on that path
- Be aware of the exact number of remaining development cards and their probabilities
- Track opponents' potential victory points, including hidden development cards
- If you're close to winning, prioritize actions that can be completed in a single turn

Before finalizing your action, check:
1. Is there a more efficient path to victory points?
2. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
3. Does this move help or hinder opponents?
4. Is there a defensive move needed to prevent an opponent from winning?
5. Are you properly diversified against dice probability?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state and available actions carefully:

## Current Victory Points
- I (BLUE) have 6 visible VP + 3 hidden VP from development cards = 9 VP
- RED has 7 VP (5 settlements + 2 VP for longest road)
- I need just 1 more VP to win

## Available Resources
- I have 1 Wood, 1 Sheep, 1 Wheat
- Not enough for any building (settlement, city) or development card

## Available Actions
- [0] Play Knight card (I have 2)
- [1] Play Road Building card (I have 1)
- [2] Roll the dice

## Strategy Considerations

Looking at my current position, I need to optimize my next move toward getting that final victory point.

The robber is already on (0, 1, -1), which is RED's Wheat hex. According to my current plan, I was going to move the robber to this hex, but it's already there. Since RED's resources are hidden (0 cards showing), stealing a card from them is unlikely to yield anything.

Playing a Knight card when RED has no resources visible would waste the card without benefit. I should save my Knight cards for when they can be more effective.

The Road Building card doesn't help me get closer to 10 VP since RED already has longest road with 10 segments (I only have 6).

Rolling the dice gives me a chance to gather more resources, which could potentially allow me to:
1. Build a settlement (if I get appropriate resources)
2. Upgrade to a city (if I get ore and wheat)
3. Buy a development card (if I get the right resources)

<plan>
1. Roll the dice to collect resources
2. Based on what I roll, prioritize:
   a. Buying a development card (hoping for a VP)
   b. Building a settlement if possible
   c. Upgrading to a city if possible
3. If I roll a 7, move the robber to hurt RED's production and potentially steal a useful card
4. Win with 10 VP (my current 9 VP including hidden ones + 1 more)
</plan>

Since I have no immediate path to victory with my current resources, and playing development cards wouldn't directly contribute to victory points, rolling the dice is the only reasonable option.

# Game Analysis for Turn 178

I need to carefully analyze the current game state and available options to determine the optimal move.

## Victory Point Analysis
- I have 6 visible VP + 3 hidden VP from development cards = 9 VP total
- I need 1 more VP to win
- RED has 7 VP total

## Resource Analysis
Current resources: 1 🌲WOOD, 1 🐑SHEEP, 1 🌾WHEAT, 2 ⛏️ORE

## Available Options:
0. Play Knight card: This would be my 9th knight played, which doesn't change my largest army status
1. Play Road Building card: Could build two more roads, but doesn't directly help with VP
2. End turn: Pass without taking any action
3. Buy a development card: Costs 1 🐑SHEEP, 1 🌾WHEAT, 1 ⛏️ORE - I have exactly these resources

## Strategic Assessment

Looking at option 3 (buying a development card):
- There are 7 development cards remaining in the deck
- Development cards could be: Knight, VP, Year of Plenty, Road Building, or Monopoly
- If I draw a VP card, I would immediately win (reaching 10 VP)
- If I draw any other card, I maintain my current position but lose resources

Looking at option 0 (playing Knight):
- I could move the robber from 🌾10 to another valuable RED hex
- This might give me a useful resource from RED
- Doesn't directly increase my VP count
- Provides minimal strategic advantage since I already have largest army

Looking at option 1 (playing Road Building):
- Two free roads won't directly give me VP
- I already have 9 roads, and RED has 14 with longest road (10 segments)
- Trying to obtain longest road would require significant investment beyond this card

Looking at option 2 (ending turn):
- Preserves my resources but makes no progress toward winning

## Decision Logic
The optimal strategy is to buy a development card (option 3), as it offers a chance to win immediately if I draw a VP card. Since I'm at 9 VP, any VP card ends the game in my favor.

While playing the Knight might get me an extra resource, and playing Road Building might improve my position slightly, neither gives me a direct path to victory like buying a development card does.

<plan>
Buy a development card, hoping for a victory point card to win the game. If not, save knight cards for defense and continue looking for ways to reach 10 VP, possibly by building a new settlement or upgrading to a city with new resources after my next dice roll.

- Consider the timing of expansion vs. city upgrades based on your resource production
- Calculate whether longest road is achievable and worth the resource investment
- When deciding between a new settlement and a city upgrade, compare immediate vs. long-term returns

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-probability hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Save knight cards for breaking up opponent strategies or securing largest army
- Use knights defensively if you're producing valuable resources on high-probability hexes

TRADING TACTICS:
- Avoid trading resources that directly help opponents score points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades
- Trade excess resources before rolling 7 if you have more than 7 cards
- Consider bank/port trades when they enable an immediate build that advances your strategy
- When trading with players, try to receive resources that complete a build

ENDGAME STRATEGY:
- In the late game, hide your victory point potential (keep development cards hidden)
- Calculate the fastest path to 10 VP and focus exclusively on that path
- Be aware of the exact number of remaining development cards and their probabilities
- Track opponents' potential victory points, including hidden development cards
- If you're close to winning, prioritize actions that can be completed in a single turn

Before finalizing your action, check:
1. Is there a more efficient path to victory points?
2. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
3. Does this move help or hinder opponents?
4. Is there a defensive move needed to prevent an opponent from winning?
5. Are you properly diversified against dice probability?

# Initial Settlement Placement Analysis

I'm placing my first settlement in the game. This is a crucial decision that will influence my entire game strategy. Let's analyze my options systematically.

## Analyzing the Resources and Probability Distribution
- High probability numbers: 8 (on wood) 
- Medium probability numbers: 9 (on sheep), 5 (on brick), 4 (on ore)
- Lower probability numbers: 3 (on wheat), 10 (on wheat)
- Desert hex with robber

## Node Analysis for Key Intersections:
Let me analyze nodes that connect to high-value hexes:

1. Node 15: Connects to 8 (wood) and 3 (wheat) - provides two different resources
2. Node 4: Connects to 8 (wood) and 5 (brick) - provides wood and brick (road building materials)
3. Node 16: Connects to 8 (wood) and desert - less optimal with only one resource
4. Node 1: Connects to 5 (brick), 4 (ore) and 10 (wheat) - three different resources
5. Node 0: Connects to 5 (brick) and 4 (ore) - city building materials
6. Node 9: Connects to 9 (sheep) and 10 (wheat) - development card materials

## Strategic Considerations:
1. I need to secure a good balance of resources, with priority on:
   - Getting at least one high-probability resource
   - Having access to road-building materials (wood/brick)
   - Setting up for city upgrades later (ore/wheat)

2. Node 1 stands out as particularly strong because:
   - It gives access to three resources (brick, ore, wheat)
   - Has two number tokens with decent probability (5 brick, 4 ore)
   - Provides road-building materials (brick) and city-building materials (ore, wheat)
   - Creates a diverse resource base for early game flexibility

3. Node 4 has excellent road-building materials with high probability (8 wood, 5 brick)

<plan>Start with Node 1 for my first settlement to gain access to three different resources. For my second settlement, aim for a high-probability wood location (preferably Node 4 or 15) to complement my first settlement and have all road building materials. Focus on early expansion followed by city upgrades.</plan>

Node 1 provides the best resource diversity with decent probabilities, connecting to brick (5), ore (4), and wheat (10). This gives me materials for roads, settlements, cities, and development cards all from a single settlement. Having access to brick early is particularly valuable for initial expansion.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL SETTLEMENT PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Place settlements on high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Target at least one spot with good ore and wheat production for city development
- Try to secure at least one high-probability spot (5, 6, 8, 9) for each critical resource
- Place your second settlement to complement your first (fill resource gaps)
- Aim for access to all five resources or position near useful ports if resource diversity isn't possible
- Always consider which settlements opponents are likely to place and avoid areas that will become contested
- Place roads pointing toward valuable future expansion spots, not toward the center
- Consider the long-term impact: settlements that can't expand are less valuable

MID-GAME RESOURCE PRIORITIES:
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each possible build (cities: 1VP for 5 resources is most efficient)
- Early phase: Secure at least one good source of brick and wood for minimal expansion
- Growth phase: Prioritize ore and wheat production for city upgrades (3VP for 5 resources is optimal)
- Late phase: Focus on the fastest path to victory points, whether through buildings or development cards
- Avoid trading resources that opponents need for immediate victory point gains
- Use 4:1 trades only when necessary; prioritize port usage when possible

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and limited expansion options
- If you get an early knight, save it for defense or until you can start building toward largest army
- Time monopoly card usage for when opponents likely have accumulated specific resources
- Save year of plenty cards for completing crucial builds when you're short 1-2 specific resources
- Development cards are most valuable when:
  * You need hidden victory points to surprise opponents
  * You need knights to break up longest road or secure largest army
  * You're lacking wood/brick for expansion but have plenty of sheep/wheat/ore

EXPANSION STRATEGY:
- Build roads only with clear settlement locations in mind
- Target settlements that give you access to ports or new resources
- Block opponents' expansion paths when it gives you a strategic advantage
- Consider the timing of expansion vs. city upgrades based on your resource production
- Calculate whether longest road is achievable and worth the resource investment
- When deciding between a new settlement and a city upgrade, compare immediate vs. long-term returns

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-probability hex of the player closest to winning

# Initial Road Placement Analysis

I need to place my first road after establishing my first settlement at node 1, which has access to brick (5), wheat (10), and ore (4). This is a strong first settlement with high-probability brick (5) that will be essential for early expansion.

Let me examine each road option carefully:

## Option 0: Road at edge (0, 1)
- This road goes toward node 0, which connects to:
  - Ore (4) hex
  - Brick (5) hex
  - Desert hex with the robber
- Future expansion from here would lead toward nodes 5, 20, or 22, but with limited high-value resource opportunities

## Option 1: Road at edge (1, 6)
- This road goes toward node 6, which connects to:
  - Ore (4) hex  
  - Wheat (10) hex
- Future expansion would lead toward nodes 7, 8, 20, 22, or 23
- This seems to lead toward wheat-heavy areas

## Option 2: Road at edge (1, 2)
- This road goes toward node 2, which connects to:
  - Brick (5) hex
  - Wheat (10) hex
  - Sheep (9) hex
- Future expansion would lead toward nodes 3, 8, or 9
- This direction provides access to sheep production (which I currently lack)
- Could potentially lead toward wood (8) at node 3
- Node 3 connects three high-value resources: sheep (9), wood (8), and wheat (3)

Looking at my current plan, I want to aim for a second settlement with good wood production. Since I already have brick, wheat, and ore from my first settlement, I need to prioritize access to wood and sheep to diversify my resources.

The road at edge (1, 2) moves me closer to the wood (8) hex and gives me immediate access to sheep (9) through node 3, which would be an excellent second settlement location. This aligns with my initial plan to secure all resources and have good wood production.

<plan>
Place my first road at edge (1, 2) to expand toward node 3, which provides access to sheep (9), wood (8), and wheat (3). This creates a path to target node 4 or 15 for my second settlement to secure strong wood (8) production. With this approach, I'll have access to all five resources between my two settlements.

# Strategic Analysis for Second Settlement Placement

I'm placing my second initial settlement, which is a critical decision that will shape my entire game strategy. Let me analyze my options carefully.

## Game State Assessment
- I have one settlement at node 1, producing brick (5), wheat (10), ore (4)
- RED has settlements at node 4 (brick 5, wheat 3, wood 8) and node 9 (wheat 10, sheep 9)
- RED is ahead with 2 settlements to my 1
- This is my second settlement placement, and I need to optimize for complementary resources

## Current Resource Coverage
From my settlement at node 1, I have:
- 🧱 Brick: Strong (5 is a good number)
- 🌾 Wheat: Decent (10 is moderate)
- ⛏️ Ore: Decent (4 is moderate)
- 🌲 Wood: None
- 🐑 Sheep: None

## What I Need
- Wood is my highest priority (for roads and settlements)
- Sheep would complete my resource diversity
- Ideally strong number combinations (5-9 range)
- Position for future expansion
- Avoid proximity to RED's settlements

## Settlement Options Analysis
Looking at the most promising options:

- Node 12: Connects to sheep (9★★), wheat (3★), a potential expansion path away from RED
- Node 14: Connects to wheat (3★) but no strong production spots
- Node 16: Connects to wood (8★★★) and desert - good wood but limited diversity
- Node 17: Connects to wood (8★★★) and no other resources
- Node 18: Connects only to wood (8★★★) with limited expansion potential
- Node 20: Connects to ore (4★) and desert, not great production

The standout options are Node 12 (for sheep access) and Node 16/17/18 (for strong wood production).

Node 12 gives me sheep (9) which is a strong number, plus wheat (3). It completes my resource diversity.
Node 16 gives me excellent wood (8) production, which is critical for expansion.

## Decision Making
Since wood is essential for early expansion and the node 16 gives me access to wood on an 8 (which is the strongest possible number), this seems like the optimal choice. The 8 on wood will be highly productive and complement my existing brick production to build roads and settlements.

<plan>
Place settlement at node 16 for strong wood (8★★★) production. My first settlement provides brick (5★★), wheat (10★), and ore (4★). This gives me 4/5 resources with strong brick+wood for expansion. I'll aim to build toward a sheep source next, or use ports for trading. Focus on road expansion to secure additional settlement spots with sheep access.
</plan>

After careful analysis, I choose node 16 for my second settlement to secure strong wood production on an 8, which complements my first settlement's resources.

PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL SETTLEMENT PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Place settlements on high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Target at least one spot with good ore and wheat production for city development
- Try to secure at least one high-probability spot (5, 6, 8, 9) for each critical resource
- Place your second settlement to complement your first (fill resource gaps)
- Aim for access to all five resources or position near useful ports if resource diversity isn't possible
- Always consider which settlements opponents are likely to place and avoid areas that will become contested
- Place roads pointing toward valuable future expansion spots, not toward the center
- Consider the long-term impact: settlements that can't expand are less valuable

MID-GAME RESOURCE PRIORITIES:
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each possible build (cities: 1VP for 5 resources is most efficient)
- Early phase: Secure at least one good source of brick and wood for minimal expansion
- Growth phase: Prioritize ore and wheat production for city upgrades (3VP for 5 resources is optimal)
- Late phase: Focus on the fastest path to victory points, whether through buildings or development cards
- Avoid trading resources that opponents need for immediate victory point gains
- Use 4:1 trades only when necessary; prioritize port usage when possible

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and limited expansion options
- If you get an early knight, save it for defense or until you can start building toward largest army
- Time monopoly card usage for when opponents likely have accumulated specific resources
- Save year of plenty cards for completing crucial builds when you're short 1-2 specific resources
- Development cards are most valuable when:
  * You need hidden victory points to surprise opponents
  * You need knights to break up longest road or secure largest army
  * You're lacking wood/brick for expansion but have plenty of sheep/wheat/ore

EXPANSION STRATEGY:
- Build roads only with clear settlement locations in mind
- Target settlements that give you access to ports or new resources
- Block opponents' expansion paths when it gives you a strategic advantage
- Consider the timing of expansion vs. city upgrades based on your resource production
- Calculate whether longest road is achievable and worth the resource investment
- When deciding between a new settlement and a city upgrade, compare immediate vs. long-term returns

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-probability hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Save knight cards for breaking up opponent strategies or securing largest army
- Use knights defensively if you're producing valuable resources on high-probability hexes

TRADING TACTICS:
- Avoid trading resources that directly help opponents score points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades
- Trade excess resources before rolling 7 if you have more than 7 cards
- Consider bank/port trades when they enable an immediate build that advances your strategy
- When trading with players, try to receive resources that complete a build

ENDGAME STRATEGY:
- In the late game, hide your victory point potential (keep development cards hidden)
- Calculate the fastest path to 10 VP and focus exclusively on that path
- Be aware of the exact number of remaining development cards and their probabilities
- Track opponents' potential victory points, including hidden development cards
- If you're close to winning, prioritize actions that can be completed in a single turn

Before finalizing your action, check:
1. Is there a more efficient path to victory points?
2. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
3. Does this move help or hinder opponents?
4. Is there a defensive move needed to prevent an opponent from winning?
5. Are you properly diversified against dice probability?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 2 | Player: BLUE | Action: BUILD_INITIAL_ROAD

❓ Select action by number (0-2):


Based on this information, which action number do you choose? Think step by step about your options, then put the final action number in a box like \boxed{1}.
RESPONSE:
I need to analyze the best option for my initial road placement from my settlement at node 16. This is a critical decision that will influence my future expansion options.

Let me examine each of the three options carefully:

Option [0]: Build a road at edge (5, 16)
- This would connect my settlement at node 16 to node 5
- Node 5 connects to the desert hex and the wood hex (8★★★)
- This would point me toward the center of the board

Option [1]: Build a road at edge (16, 21)
- This would connect my settlement at node 16 to node 21
- Node 21 is at the edge of the desert hex
- This direction doesn't appear to lead to any particularly valuable resources

Option [2]: Build a road at edge (16, 18)
- This would connect my settlement at node 16 to node 18
- Node 18 is part of the wood hex (8★★★)
- This direction follows the edge of the board

Looking at the board layout:
- I need to secure access to sheep, which I'm currently lacking
- I should position myself for future valuable building spots
- I need to consider where I can expand without competing directly with RED

Based on the limited view of the board, option [2] appears most promising as it allows me to continue along the board edge where there may be sheep resources or ports that aren't visible in the current view. Additionally, expanding along the edge is generally a safer strategy in the initial placement phase as it reduces potential conflicts.

Building toward node 18 gives me more flexibility and potentially keeps me away from immediate competition with RED, who seems to be developing in a different area of the board.

<plan>Build initial road toward node 18 to follow the board edge. Look to secure access to sheep production in my next moves, while maintaining strong wood (8★★★) production. This positioning should give me flexibility to reach potential ports or additional resources that aren't visible in the current view.</plan>

# Analysis of Game State

I'll carefully analyze the current state to choose the optimal move:

## Resource Assessment
I have: 2 🌲WOOD, 1 🧱BRICK, 1 ⛏️ORE
- This allows me to build exactly one road (cost: 1 🌲WOOD, 1 🧱BRICK)
- Not enough for settlements (would need sheep) or development cards

## Settlement Locations
- I have settlements at:
  - Node 1: Strong production (🧱5[⭐⭐], 🌾10[⭐], ⛏️4[⭐])
  - Node 16: Excellent wood (🌲8[⭐⭐⭐])
- Missing sheep production entirely

## Road Building Options
Looking at each option:
1. Edge (0, 1): Connects toward unknown territory
2. Edge (2, 3): Extends toward sheep (9) production
3. Edge (2, 9): Extends toward sheep (9) production
4. Edge (5, 16): Connects from my settlement toward center
5. Edge (16, 21): Extends from my wood settlement toward unknown
6. Edge (1, 6): Extends from my resource-rich settlement
7. Edge (17, 18): Parallel to my existing road at node 16

## Strategic Considerations
1. My biggest weakness is no sheep production
2. Options 2 and 3 point toward sheep resources
3. I need to anticipate future expansion opportunities
4. Roads should lead to potential settlement spots

Option 2 (edge 2, 3) seems most strategic as:
- It moves toward the sheep (9) hex
- Creates potential for settlement expansion
- Aligns with my need to diversify resources

<plan>
Focus on securing sheep production by building roads toward the 9-value sheep hex. Next, look to build a settlement that gives me sheep access. Continue to leverage my strong wood (8★★★) production for expansion, while developing my economy toward cities (need ore/wheat) in the mid-game.

- Place the robber on the highest-probability hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Save knight cards for breaking up opponent strategies or securing largest army
- Use knights defensively if you're producing valuable resources on high-probability hexes

TRADING TACTICS:
- Avoid trading resources that directly help opponents score points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades
- Trade excess resources before rolling 7 if you have more than 7 cards
- Consider bank/port trades when they enable an immediate build that advances your strategy
- When trading with players, try to receive resources that complete a build

ENDGAME STRATEGY:
- In the late game, hide your victory point potential (keep development cards hidden)
- Calculate the fastest path to 10 VP and focus exclusively on that path
- Be aware of the exact number of remaining development cards and their probabilities
- Track opponents' potential victory points, including hidden development cards
- If you're close to winning, prioritize actions that can be completed in a single turn

Before finalizing your action, check:
1. Is there a more efficient path to victory points?
2. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
3. Does this move help or hinder opponents?
4. Is there a defensive move needed to prevent an opponent from winning?
5. Are you properly diversified against dice probability?

# Robber Placement Analysis

I need to analyze where to place the robber to maximize my advantage while disrupting my opponent.

Looking at the board:

1. Resource production on the board:
   - RED has: 🧱5[⭐⭐], 🌾3[⭐], 🌲8[⭐⭐⭐], 🌾10[⭐], 🐑9[⭐⭐]
   - BLUE has: 🧱5[⭐⭐], 🌾10[⭐], ⛏️4[⭐], 🌲8[⭐⭐⭐]

2. What RED is likely missing:
   - RED has no ore production, which is crucial for city upgrades
   - RED has strong wood production (8★★★) like me

3. My current needs:
   - I need sheep for expansion (settlements/development cards)
   - I have some wood and ore, but lack sheep and wheat for further development

## Evaluating robber placement options:

**[0] Move robber to (0, 0, 0) - brick hex with 5**
- Blocks 5-value brick, a medium-high probability
- Both RED and I are affected (both have 🧱5[⭐⭐])
- This diminishes value for both of us equally, not ideal

**[1] Move robber to (1, -1, 0) - wheat hex with 10**
- Blocks 10-value wheat, lower probability hex
- Both RED and I have 🌾10[⭐], so impact is equal
- Not optimal as it limits my own wheat which I need

**[2] Move robber to (0, -1, 1) - sheep hex with 9**
- Blocks 9-value sheep, good probability number
- RED has 🐑9[⭐⭐], I have none
- This significantly impacts RED who has good sheep production
- RED likely needs sheep for expansion, like I do

**[3] Move robber to (-1, 0, 1) - wheat hex with 3**
- Blocks 3-value wheat, very low probability
- RED has 🌾3[⭐], I have none
- Minimal impact due to the low probability

**[4] Move robber to (-1, 1, 0) - wood hex with 8**
- Blocks 8-value wood, highest probability (★★★)
- RED has 🌲8[⭐⭐⭐], I have 🌲8[⭐⭐⭐]
- This is RED's best resource and mine too
- Would seriously hurt both our production

**[5] Move robber to (0, 1, -1) - desert**
- Cannot place robber on desert as it produces no resources
- This isn't a strategic option

<plan>
Focus on securing sheep production by building roads toward the 9-value sheep hex. Next, look to build a settlement that gives me sheep access. Block RED's sheep production to slow their expansion while I work on accessing sheep myself. Continue leveraging strong wood production for expansion while developing economy toward cities (need ore/wheat) in mid-game.
</plan>

Based on this analysis, option [2] is clearly the best choice:
- It blocks RED's sheep production on a good 9-value hex
- RED has 6 hidden cards and might be saving for expansion
- Sheep is a key resource RED has that I don't
- This aligns with my plan to secure sheep for myself while restricting RED's access

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL SETTLEMENT PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Place settlements on high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Target at least one spot with good ore and wheat production for city development
- Try to secure at least one high-probability spot (5, 6, 8, 9) for each critical resource
- Place your second settlement to complement your first (fill resource gaps)
- Aim for access to all five resources or position near useful ports if resource diversity isn't possible
- Always consider which settlements opponents are likely to place and avoid areas that will become contested
- Place roads pointing toward valuable future expansion spots, not toward the center
- Consider the long-term impact: settlements that can't expand are less valuable

MID-GAME RESOURCE PRIORITIES:
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each possible build (cities: 1VP for 5 resources is most efficient)
- Early phase: Secure at least one good source of brick and wood for minimal expansion
- Growth phase: Prioritize ore and wheat production for city upgrades (3VP for 5 resources is optimal)
- Late phase: Focus on the fastest path to victory points, whether through buildings or development cards
- Avoid trading resources that opponents need for immediate victory point gains
- Use 4:1 trades only when necessary; prioritize port usage when possible

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and limited expansion options
- If you get an early knight, save it for defense or until you can start building toward largest army
- Time monopoly card usage for when opponents likely have accumulated specific resources
- Save year of plenty cards for completing crucial builds when you're short 1-2 specific resources
- Development cards are most valuable when:
  * You need hidden victory points to surprise opponents
  * You need knights to break up longest road or secure largest army
  * You're lacking wood/brick for expansion but have plenty of sheep/wheat/ore

EXPANSION STRATEGY:
- Build roads only with clear settlement locations in mind
- Target settlements that give you access to ports or new resources
- Block opponents' expansion paths when it gives you a strategic advantage
- Consider the timing of expansion vs. city upgrades based on your resource production
- Calculate whether longest road is achievable and worth the resource investment
- When deciding between a new settlement and a city upgrade, compare immediate vs. long-term returns

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-probability hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Save knight cards for breaking up opponent strategies or securing largest army
- Use knights defensively if you're producing valuable resources on high-probability hexes

TRADING TACTICS:
- Avoid trading resources that directly help opponents score points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades
- Trade excess resources before rolling 7 if you have more than 7 cards
- Consider bank/port trades when they enable an immediate build that advances your strategy
- When trading with players, try to receive resources that complete a build

ENDGAME STRATEGY:
- In the late game, hide your victory point potential (keep development cards hidden)
- Calculate the fastest path to 10 VP and focus exclusively on that path
- Be aware of the exact number of remaining development cards and their probabilities
- Track opponents' potential victory points, including hidden development cards

# Game Analysis for Settlers of Catan

Let me analyze the current game state and my available actions to determine the optimal move.

## Current Situation Assessment
- I have 2 settlements: one at node 1 (produces brick, wheat, ore) and one at node 16 (produces wood)
- I have 3 wood, 1 brick, 1 wheat, 1 ore (sufficient for a road)
- I have 3 roads already built
- The robber is on the sheep (9) hex, which I'm not currently producing
- RED has 4 roads and settlements at nodes 4 and 9

## Resource Production Analysis
My strengths:
- Good wood production (8 value = very good)
- Decent brick production (5 value = good)
- Some wheat (10 value = fair) and ore (4 value = fair)

My weakness:
- No sheep production at all

## Available Actions
I can only build a road at this point (6 different placement options).

## Road Building Strategic Analysis

Let me analyze each road option:

1. Edge (0, 1): This connects from my settlement at node 1 toward the middle of the board.
2. Edge (2, 9): This extends my road network toward the sheep hex with a 9 value.
3. Edge (5, 16): This connects from my settlement at node 16 toward the desert.
4. Edge (16, 21): This extends from my settlement at node 16 in the other direction.
5. Edge (1, 6): This extends from my settlement at node 1 toward the ore hex.
6. Edge (17, 18): This extends from my existing road near node 16.

Looking at my plan, I need sheep production and should continue expanding my road network in a way that gets me closer to building a settlement with sheep access.

Option 2 (building at edge 2, 9) aligns best with my plan. This road extends toward the sheep hex with a production value of 9, helping me address my biggest resource gap. It also continues building in a direction that could potentially block RED from expanding further in that direction.

Options 5 and 1 would be expanding toward resources I already have access to, which isn't optimal.
Options 3, 4, and 6 would be expanding from my wood-producing settlement, but don't clearly lead toward sheep or other resources I need.

I should continue with my current plan, as I need sheep production to balance my resources and enable development card purchases.

<plan>Continue expanding toward the sheep hex by building roads in that direction. My next goal is to establish a settlement that gives me sheep production. After that, I'll focus on getting another settlement with good ore/wheat production to enable city upgrades.</plan>

Based on this analysis, I choose option 2:

# Game Analysis for Blue Player (Turn 20)

I'll evaluate all aspects of the current game state to decide on the optimal move.

## Current Game Status
- I have 2 VP (2 settlements)
- I have resources: 2 Wood, 1 Brick, 1 Wheat, 1 Ore
- My settlements produce:
  * Settlement at node 1: Brick(5), Wheat(10), Ore(4)
  * Settlement at node 16: Wood(8)
- The robber is on the sheep hex (0,-1,1) with number 9
- Red has 2 VP and 5 roads (longest road of 4 segments)

## Resource Production Analysis
- I have production of Brick, Wheat, Wood, and Ore
- I'm missing Sheep production completely
- My plan mentions expanding toward the sheep hex, which aligns with my resource gap

## Available Options
I can build a road with my current Wood and Brick resources. Let me evaluate each road option:

1. Road at edge (0, 1): Connects from my settlement at node 1 toward node 0
2. Road at edge (5, 16): Connects from my settlement at node 16 toward node 5
3. Road at edge (16, 21): Connects from my settlement at node 16 toward node 21
4. Road at edge (1, 6): Connects from my settlement at node 1 toward node 6
5. Road at edge (17, 18): From node 18 (already connected) to node 17

## Strategic Evaluation

Looking at the node grid, I need to analyze which road expansion gives me the best path toward:
1. Access to sheep production
2. Future settlement locations
3. Protection from being blocked by Red

Road option 1 (edge 0, 1): Builds from my settlement toward the desert/ore junction
- Doesn't advance toward sheep
- Could lead to ore access but I already have ore production

Road option 2 (edge 5, 16): Connects my settlement at node 16 to node 5
- Moves toward the desert hex
- Not aligned with reaching sheep

Road option 3 (edge 16, 21): Extends from node 16 toward node 21
- This appears to be in the direction of the desert hex
- Not helpful for sheep access

Road option 4 (edge 1, 6): Extends from my settlement at node 1 toward node 6
- Node 6 connects to the wheat(10) and ore(4) hexes
- This might create a path toward better wheat/ore production
- Could potentially lead to the sheep hex if continued

Road option 5 (edge 17, 18): Connects from my existing road at node 18 to node 17
- Node 17 borders the wood(8) hex
- Gives me a path to expand from node 16 in another direction
- Could potentially create a longer road network

Based on the node grid, I need to determine which option gives me the best path toward sheep production and future settlement potential.

<plan>
Build roads strategically to reach a settlement location with sheep production. After securing sheep access, focus on building another settlement with strong ore/wheat production to enable city upgrades. Once I have at least one good source of each resource, prioritize city development for efficient victory point gains.
</plan>

Option 4 (edge 1, 6) seems most aligned with my current plan, as it appears to build toward potential sheep access while maintaining flexibility. This builds from my strong production settlement and potentially creates paths toward multiple resources.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL SETTLEMENT PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Place settlements on high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Target at least one spot with good ore and wheat production for city development
- Try to secure at least one high-probability spot (5, 6, 8, 9) for each critical resource
- Place your second settlement to complement your first (fill resource gaps)
- Aim for access to all five resources or position near useful ports if resource diversity isn't possible
- Always consider which settlements opponents are likely to place and avoid areas that will become contested
- Place roads pointing toward valuable future expansion spots, not toward the center
- Consider the long-term impact: settlements that can't expand are less valuable

MID-GAME RESOURCE PRIORITIES:
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each possible build (cities: 1VP for 5 resources is most efficient)
- Early phase: Secure at least one good source of brick and wood for minimal expansion
- Growth phase: Prioritize ore and wheat production for city upgrades (3VP for 5 resources is optimal)
- Late phase: Focus on the fastest path to victory points, whether through buildings or development cards
- Avoid trading resources that opponents need for immediate victory point gains
- Use 4:1 trades only when necessary; prioritize port usage when possible

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and limited expansion options
- If you get an early knight, save it for defense or until you can start building toward largest army
- Time monopoly card usage for when opponents likely have accumulated specific resources
- Save year of plenty cards for completing crucial builds when you're short 1-2 specific resources
- Development cards are most valuable when:
  * You need hidden victory points to surprise opponents
  * You need knights to break up longest road or secure largest army
  * You're lacking wood/brick for expansion but have plenty of sheep/wheat/ore

EXPANSION STRATEGY:
- Build roads only with clear settlement locations in mind
- Target settlements that give you access to ports or new resources
- Block opponents' expansion paths when it gives you a strategic advantage
- Consider the timing of expansion vs. city upgrades based on your resource production
- Calculate whether longest road is achievable and worth the resource investment
- When deciding between a new settlement and a city upgrade, compare immediate vs. long-term returns

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-probability hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Save knight cards for breaking up opponent strategies or securing largest army
- Use knights defensively if you're producing valuable resources on high-probability hexes

TRADING TACTICS:
- Avoid trading resources that directly help opponents score points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades
- Trade excess resources before rolling 7 if you have more than 7 cards
- Consider bank/port trades when they enable an immediate build that advances your strategy
- When trading with players, try to receive resources that complete a build

ENDGAME STRATEGY:
- In the late game, hide your victory point potential (keep development cards hidden)
- Calculate the fastest path to 10 VP and focus exclusively on that path
- Be aware of the exact number of remaining development cards and their probabilities
- Track opponents' potential victory points, including hidden development cards
- If you're close to winning, prioritize actions that can be completed in a single turn

Before finalizing your action, check:
1. Is there a more efficient path to victory points?
2. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
3. Does this move help or hinder opponents?
4. Is there a defensive move needed to prevent an opponent from winning?
5. Are you properly diversified against dice probability?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Analyzing Robber Movement Options

I need to determine the optimal hex to place the robber based on my strategy and current game state.

## Current Game Assessment
- I have 2 VP (2 settlements)
- RED also has 2 VP (2 settlements)
- I lack SHEEP resources currently (have WOOD, WHEAT, and ORE)
- My original plan involves securing sheep access and building toward ore/wheat production

## Analysis of Robber Placement Options:
[0] Move to 🧱5 (0, 0, 0) and steal from RED
- This blocks a brick hex with value 5 (good probability)
- RED has a settlement here, so it hurts their production
- I also have a settlement here, so I'm hurting my own brick production
- Brick is valuable for road building

[1] Move to 🌾10 (1, -1, 0) and steal from RED
- This blocks a wheat hex with value 10 (lower probability)
- RED has a settlement here
- I also have a settlement here, so I'd be hurting my own wheat production
- I already have 3 wheat in my hand

[2] Move to 🌾3 (-1, 0, 1) and steal from RED
- This blocks a wheat hex with value 3 (very low probability)
- RED has a settlement here, minimal impact
- I don't have a settlement here, so no impact on me
- Low strategic value due to low probability

[3] Move to 🌲8 (-1, 1, 0) and steal from RED
- This blocks a wood hex with value 8 (high probability)
- RED has a settlement here (producing 3 stars - very valuable)
- I also have a settlement here, so I'd be hurting my own wood production
- Wood is critical for expansion

[4] Move to 🏜️- (0, 1, -1)
- This is a desert with no production value
- No impact on anyone's production
- Poor strategic choice

[5] Move to ⛏️4 (1, 0, -1)
- This blocks an ore hex with value 4 (lower probability)
- I have a settlement here, so I'd be hurting my own ore production
- RED doesn't have a settlement here, so no impact on them
- I already have 2 ore in my hand

## Strategic Considerations:
1. Looking at my plan, I need sheep resources which I currently lack
2. I should disrupt RED's strongest production without hurting myself too much
3. I should target a hex where RED has a settlement to potentially steal a useful resource

<plan>Move the robber to disrupt RED's strongest production while minimizing impact on my own production. Then focus on building roads to secure access to sheep resources. Continue developing toward a settlement with good ore/wheat production to enable city upgrades.</plan>

## Decision:
Option [3] gives me the highest strategic value - it blocks RED's highest probability resource (8-value wood) which is producing at 3-star value for them. While it also blocks my own wood production, I already have 1 wood in hand, and disrupting RED's strongest production is worth the trade-off. Additionally, stealing from RED gives me a chance to get sheep or another resource I need.

# Game Analysis for Settlers of Catan

Let me analyze the current game state and evaluate my options carefully.

## Current Status Assessment:

- I have 2 VP from my 2 settlements, tied with RED
- Resources: 1 🌲, 1 🧱, 3 🌾, 2 ⛏️ (7 total)
- I can build one road with my current wood and brick
- Primary production: Good 🧱, decent 🌾 and ⛏️, strong 🌲, but NO 🐑

## Road Building Options Analysis:

Let me evaluate each potential road placement:

1. **Edge (0, 1)**: Connects from my settlement at node 1 toward the center
2. **Edge (6, 23)**: Extends toward the right side of the board
3. **Edge (6, 7)**: Extends toward the top right
4. **Edge (5, 16)**: Connects my settlement at node 16 to node 5
5. **Edge (16, 21)**: Extends from my settlement at node 16 toward the desert
6. **Edge (17, 18)**: Extends from node 17, which appears to be connected to my network

I need to consider:
- Which road helps me build toward valuable future settlement spots
- Where I can potentially block RED or secure key areas
- My resource gaps (especially sheep)

## Strategic Priority:
I'm missing sheep production entirely, which is a significant weakness. My top priority should be gaining access to sheep through new settlements.

Looking at the board configuration, I should determine which road would help me reach a node with sheep production or near a port that helps overcome my resource deficiencies.

Based on the nodes listed, the sheep resource is at coordinates (0, -1, 1) with nodes 2,3,9,10,11,12 connected to it. I need to build roads that get me closer to unclaimed nodes among these.

Since I can't fully assess which nodes are already claimed vs. available from the data provided, I'll need to focus on extending toward areas that are most likely to give me access to sheep and complement my current production.

<plan>
Build a strategic road to extend toward areas with sheep production or ports. Focus on completing the road network needed to place a new settlement that provides sheep. Then accumulate resources for city upgrades, prioritizing ore and wheat production.
</plan>

Without being able to see the full connectivity of the board, I'll use my best judgment based on the node numbers. The edge (16, 21) connects to the desert which isn't particularly valuable for resources. The edge (0, 1) connects from my settlement but toward the center where competition is likely high.

Edge (5, 16) connects from my settlement at node 16, which already produces good wood. This seems like a strategic choice to expand my network into new territory.

Therefore, I believe the best action is to build a road at edge (5, 16), which allows me to expand from my settlement at node 16.

- Block opponents' expansion paths when it gives you a strategic advantage
- Consider the timing of expansion vs. city upgrades based on your resource production
- Calculate whether longest road is achievable and worth the resource investment
- When deciding between a new settlement and a city upgrade, compare immediate vs. long-term returns

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-probability hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Save knight cards for breaking up opponent strategies or securing largest army
- Use knights defensively if you're producing valuable resources on high-probability hexes

TRADING TACTICS:
- Avoid trading resources that directly help opponents score points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades
- Trade excess resources before rolling 7 if you have more than 7 cards
- Consider bank/port trades when they enable an immediate build that advances your strategy
- When trading with players, try to receive resources that complete a build

ENDGAME STRATEGY:
- In the late game, hide your victory point potential (keep development cards hidden)
- Calculate the fastest path to 10 VP and focus exclusively on that path
- Be aware of the exact number of remaining development cards and their probabilities
- Track opponents' potential victory points, including hidden development cards
- If you're close to winning, prioritize actions that can be completed in a single turn

Before finalizing your action, check:
1. Is there a more efficient path to victory points?
2. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
3. Does this move help or hinder opponents?
4. Is there a defensive move needed to prevent an opponent from winning?
5. Are you properly diversified against dice probability?

# Robber Placement Analysis

I need to carefully consider where to place the robber to maximize my strategic advantage while hindering my opponent.

## Resource Analysis
- My resources: 3 Wood, 3 Wheat, 1 Ore
- My production: Wood (8), Wheat (10, 3), Ore (4), Brick (5)
- Red's production: Wood (8), Wheat (10, 3), Brick (5), Sheep (9)

## Robber Placement Options

Let me analyze each option:

**[0] Move robber to (0, 0, 0) [Brick 5] and steal from RED**
- This blocks a 5 (good probability) Brick hex
- Both Red and I have settlements on this hex
- Blocking myself: Yes, but I'd also block Red's brick production
- Potential steal: Could get brick which I need

**[1] Move robber to (1, -1, 0) [Wheat 10] and steal from RED**
- This blocks a 10 (moderate probability) Wheat hex
- Both Red and I have settlements on this hex
- Blocking myself: Yes, but would block Red's wheat too
- Potential steal: Could get wheat, which I already have

**[2] Move robber to (0, -1, 1) [Sheep 9] and steal from RED**
- This blocks a 9 (good probability) Sheep hex
- Only Red has a settlement here
- Blocking myself: No, I don't produce sheep
- Potential steal: Could get sheep, which I currently lack

**[3] Move robber to (-1, 0, 1) [Wheat 3] and steal from RED**
- This blocks a 3 (poor probability) Wheat hex
- Only Red has a settlement here
- Blocking myself: No
- Potential steal: Could get wheat, which I already have

**[4] Move robber to (-1, 1, 0) [Wood 8] and steal from RED**
- This blocks an 8 (excellent probability) Wood hex
- Both Red and I have settlements here
- Blocking myself: Yes, blocks my good wood production
- Potential steal: Could get wood, which I already have

**[5] Move robber to (0, 1, -1) [Desert]**
- This is the desert hex
- No production to block
- No potential to steal (no player settlement)

## Strategic Decision

Looking at my plan, I need sheep to diversify my resources. I'm currently strong on wood, wheat, and have access to brick and ore, but have no sheep production.

Option [2] stands out as the best choice because:
1. It blocks a high-probability sheep hex (9)
2. It only affects RED's production, not mine
3. It gives me a chance to steal sheep, which is my missing resource
4. This supports my current plan of building toward sheep production

<plan>Continue working toward placing a settlement with access to sheep production. After blocking RED's sheep with the robber, I'll use my current resources to extend my road network toward viable settlement locations with sheep access or useful ports. Next priority will be upgrading to cities once I have consistent sheep production.</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL SETTLEMENT PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Place settlements on high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Target at least one spot with good ore and wheat production for city development
- Try to secure at least one high-probability spot (5, 6, 8, 9) for each critical resource
- Place your second settlement to complement your first (fill resource gaps)
- Aim for access to all five resources or position near useful ports if resource diversity isn't possible
- Always consider which settlements opponents are likely to place and avoid areas that will become contested
- Place roads pointing toward valuable future expansion spots, not toward the center
- Consider the long-term impact: settlements that can't expand are less valuable

MID-GAME RESOURCE PRIORITIES:
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each possible build (cities: 1VP for 5 resources is most efficient)
- Early phase: Secure at least one good source of brick and wood for minimal expansion
- Growth phase: Prioritize ore and wheat production for city upgrades (3VP for 5 resources is optimal)
- Late phase: Focus on the fastest path to victory points, whether through buildings or development cards
- Avoid trading resources that opponents need for immediate victory point gains
- Use 4:1 trades only when necessary; prioritize port usage when possible

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and limited expansion options
- If you get an early knight, save it for defense or until you can start building toward largest army
- Time monopoly card usage for when opponents likely have accumulated specific resources
- Save year of plenty cards for completing crucial builds when you're short 1-2 specific resources
- Development cards are most valuable when:
  * You need hidden victory points to surprise opponents
  * You need knights to break up longest road or secure largest army
  * You're lacking wood/brick for expansion but have plenty of sheep/wheat/ore

EXPANSION STRATEGY:
- Build roads only with clear settlement locations in mind
- Target settlements that give you access to ports or new resources
- Block opponents' expansion paths when it gives you a strategic advantage
- Consider the timing of expansion vs. city upgrades based on your resource production
- Calculate whether longest road is achievable and worth the resource investment
- When deciding between a new settlement and a city upgrade, compare immediate vs. long-term returns

# Game Analysis: Settlers of Catan Turn 34

Let me analyze the current game state and determine the optimal action.

## Current State Assessment
- I have 2 victory points from my 2 settlements
- Resources: 3 Wood, 4 Wheat, 1 Ore
- No development cards
- Robber is blocking a Sheep hex (9)
- No longest road or largest army bonuses currently exist

## Resource Analysis
- I have good Wood and Wheat production
- I'm lacking Brick and Sheep production
- My main settlement produces Brick(5), Wheat(10), and Ore(4)
- My second settlement only produces Wood(8)

## Available Actions
I only have 5 options this turn:
- End my turn [0]
- Trade 4 Wheat for 1 resource (Wood [1], Brick [2], Ore [3], or Sheep [4])

## Strategic Considerations
Looking at my current plan and resources:
1. I need sheep access for development cards and settlements
2. With 4 wheat, I could trade for 1 sheep via 4:1 port trade
3. However, I can't build anything with just 1 sheep
4. My wood (3) and ore (1) aren't enough for any immediate builds

<plan>
Since I can't make any productive builds this turn, I'll end my turn to conserve resources. On future turns, I'll continue extending my road network toward locations with sheep access. I'll save my wheat for future development cards (need sheep) or city upgrades (need ore). My primary goal remains finding sheep access through expansion to unoccupied nodes near sheep hexes.
</plan>

Since I don't have enough resources to build anything meaningful, and trading 4 wheat for 1 of any resource would not enable me to build anything this turn, the optimal move is to conserve my resources for future opportunities.

# Robber Placement Analysis

I need to carefully consider where to place the robber to maximize my strategic advantage while hindering my opponent.

## Current Game State
- I have 2 wood and 2 wheat, but no brick, ore, or sheep
- RED has 3 hidden resource cards
- RED's settlements produce: brick (5), wheat (3 & 10), wood (8), and sheep (9)
- My settlements produce: brick (5), wheat (10), ore (4), and wood (8)

## Robber Options Analysis

[0] Move robber to (0, 0, 0) and steal from RED
- This is the brick (5) hex
- Blocking this hurts both RED and me equally as we both have settlements on it
- Not ideal as I'm hurting my own production

[1] Move robber to (1, -1, 0) and steal from RED
- This is the wheat (10) hex
- Blocking this hurts both RED and me equally
- Not ideal as I'm hurting my own production

[2] Move robber to (-1, 0, 1) and steal from RED
- This is the wheat (3) hex
- Only RED produces from this hex (low-probability 3)
- Good option as it only affects RED, though the impact is minimal

[3] Move robber to (-1, 1, 0) and steal from RED
- This is the wood (8) hex with probability ⭐⭐⭐
- Both RED and I have settlements here
- This is a high-probability hex, but blocking it hurts me significantly as well

[4] Move robber to (0, 1, -1)
- This is the desert hex
- Has no effect on resource production
- Waste of a robber placement

[5] Move robber to (1, 0, -1)
- This is the ore (4) hex
- Only I produce from this hex
- Placing the robber here makes no strategic sense as it would only hurt me

## Best Strategic Choice
Looking at RED's production, the most impactful option would be to block their high-probability wood (8) resource, but that would equally hurt me. The wheat (3) hex only affects RED, so that's a better target, despite its lower probability. Additionally, I get to steal a card from RED which could help my resource diversity.

<plan>
I'll place the robber on the wheat (3) hex to block RED's production without affecting my own. I'll continue my expansion strategy by extending my road network toward locations with sheep access, which remains my primary missing resource. With my current wheat and wood, I'll look to build more roads and eventually settlements on nodes with sheep production.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL SETTLEMENT PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Place settlements on high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Target at least one spot with good ore and wheat production for city development
- Try to secure at least one high-probability spot (5, 6, 8, 9) for each critical resource
- Place your second settlement to complement your first (fill resource gaps)
- Aim for access to all five resources or position near useful ports if resource diversity isn't possible
- Always consider which settlements opponents are likely to place and avoid areas that will become contested
- Place roads pointing toward valuable future expansion spots, not toward the center
- Consider the long-term impact: settlements that can't expand are less valuable

MID-GAME RESOURCE PRIORITIES:
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each possible build (cities: 1VP for 5 resources is most efficient)
- Early phase: Secure at least one good source of brick and wood for minimal expansion
- Growth phase: Prioritize ore and wheat production for city upgrades (3VP for 5 resources is optimal)
- Late phase: Focus on the fastest path to victory points, whether through buildings or development cards
- Avoid trading resources that opponents need for immediate victory point gains
- Use 4:1 trades only when necessary; prioritize port usage when possible

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and limited expansion options
- If you get an early knight, save it for defense or until you can start building toward largest army
- Time monopoly card usage for when opponents likely have accumulated specific resources
- Save year of plenty cards for completing crucial builds when you're short 1-2 specific resources
- Development cards are most valuable when:
  * You need hidden victory points to surprise opponents
  * You need knights to break up longest road or secure largest army
  * You're lacking wood/brick for expansion but have plenty of sheep/wheat/ore

EXPANSION STRATEGY:
- Build roads only with clear settlement locations in mind
- Target settlements that give you access to ports or new resources
- Block opponents' expansion paths when it gives you a strategic advantage
- Consider the timing of expansion vs. city upgrades based on your resource production
- Calculate whether longest road is achievable and worth the resource investment
- When deciding between a new settlement and a city upgrade, compare immediate vs. long-term returns

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-probability hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Save knight cards for breaking up opponent strategies or securing largest army
- Use knights defensively if you're producing valuable resources on high-probability hexes

TRADING TACTICS:
- Avoid trading resources that directly help opponents score points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades
- Trade excess resources before rolling 7 if you have more than 7 cards
- Consider bank/port trades when they enable an immediate build that advances your strategy
- When trading with players, try to receive resources that complete a build

ENDGAME STRATEGY:
- In the late game, hide your victory point potential (keep development cards hidden)
- Calculate the fastest path to 10 VP and focus exclusively on that path
- Be aware of the exact number of remaining development cards and their probabilities
- Track opponents' potential victory points, including hidden development cards
- If you're close to winning, prioritize actions that can be completed in a single turn

Before finalizing your action, check:
1. Is there a more efficient path to victory points?
2. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
3. Does this move help or hinder opponents?
4. Is there a defensive move needed to prevent an opponent from winning?
5. Are you properly diversified against dice probability?

❓ Select action by number (0-7):


Based on this information, which action number do you choose? Think step by step about your options, then put the final action number in a box like \boxed{1}.
RESPONSE:
I'll analyze the current game state and available actions to determine the best move for maximizing my chances of winning.

### Game State Analysis:
- I (BLUE) have 2 VP from my 2 settlements
- I have 2 WOOD, 1 BRICK, and 3 WHEAT resources
- My settlements are at nodes 1 and 16, producing BRICK, WHEAT, WOOD, and ORE
- RED also has 2 VP and has access to SHEEP production which I lack
- The robber is currently on the WHEAT (3) hex affecting RED
- I have 6 built roads with my longest at 3 segments
- RED has 5 built roads with their longest at 4 segments

### Resource Assessment:
- My strengths: Good WHEAT production, some WOOD and ORE
- My weaknesses: No SHEEP production
- I have enough resources to build exactly one road: 1 BRICK and 2 WOOD

### Strategic Considerations:
1. Road expansion should aim toward:
   - Potential settlement locations with SHEEP access
   - Blocking RED's expansion
   - Building toward longest road bonus (need 5+ connected roads)

2. Looking at the available road options:
   - I need to understand which options lead toward sheep resources or strategic positions
   - Without full node connectivity details, I need to infer from context

<plan>
Build a road that extends my network toward sheep resources or blocks RED from expansion. Then, accumulate resources to build a settlement at a location with sheep access. Continue working toward longest road as a secondary objective while developing my resource production capabilities.
</plan>

### Action Analysis:
Based on the description of my roads as "too many to list," I need to infer which road placements make the most strategic sense:

- Options [1], [4], [5], [6] appear to be near node 0, 1, 5, or 16, which could be extending from my settlements
- Option [2] and [3] involve node 6, which connects to the ore hex
- Option [7] connects nodes 17-18, which may be extending toward unexplored territory

Without seeing the complete road network, I'm making inferences based on node proximity to my settlements.

Since my settlement at node 16 is on the WOOD (8) hex and looking at the grid, building a road at edge (16, 21) would likely extend my network toward the unexplored areas of the board, possibly toward sheep resources.

Therefore, option [5] to build a road at edge (16, 21) appears to be the most strategic choice. This extends from my settlement at node 16 and may provide options for future expansion toward sheep resources or to compete for longest road.

# Analysis of Robber Movement Options

I'll carefully evaluate each option for placing the robber to determine the optimal strategic choice:

## Option Analysis

**[0] Move robber to (0, 0, 0) and steal from RED**
- This is the brick (🧱5) hex with probability ⭐⭐
- RED has a settlement here and gets brick production
- Blocking this would deny RED a key expansion resource
- This is a high probability tile (5 = ⭐⭐)

**[1] Move robber to (1, -1, 0) and steal from RED**
- This is the wheat (🌾10) hex with probability ⭐
- RED has a settlement here
- I also have a settlement here, so I'd be hurting my own production
- Lower probability than options 0 or 3

**[2] Move robber to (0, -1, 1) and steal from RED**
- This is the sheep (🐑9) hex with probability ⭐⭐
- RED has a settlement here
- I don't have access to sheep currently, so not blocking my own production
- Good probability tile (9 = ⭐⭐)

**[3] Move robber to (-1, 1, 0) and steal from RED**
- This is the wood (🌲8) hex with probability ⭐⭐⭐
- RED has a settlement here
- I also have a settlement here, so I'd be hurting my own production significantly
- Highest probability tile (8 = ⭐⭐⭐)

**[4] Move robber to (0, 1, -1)**
- This is the desert (🏜️-) hex with no production
- Placing robber here has no effect on resource production
- Completely ineffective choice

**[5] Move robber to (1, 0, -1)**
- This is the ore (⛏️4) hex with probability ⭐
- I have a settlement here but RED doesn't
- This would only hurt my own production
- Low probability tile anyway (4 = ⭐)

## Strategic Considerations

1. RED currently has 4VP to my 2VP, so disrupting RED's production is important
2. RED has the longest road (5 segments), so limiting brick/wood would be strategic
3. I don't currently have access to sheep, which I need for development cards or settlements
4. I should avoid hurting my own production significantly

## Decision

The best choice is Option [2] - Move robber to the sheep hex (0, -1, 1):
- Blocks a good probability resource (9 = ⭐⭐) from RED
- Gives me a chance to steal sheep, which I don't currently produce
- Doesn't harm my own production
- Helps maintain my plan of getting access to sheep resources

<plan>Block RED's sheep production and try to steal sheep. Continue working toward extending my road network. Focus on getting resources for another settlement, ideally at a location that gives me sheep access. Balance expansion with development card purchases if I obtain sheep.</plan>

# Game State Analysis

Let me assess the current game state:

1. **Victory Points**: RED is leading with 4 VP (2 settlements + longest road) vs. my 2 VP (2 settlements).
2. **Resources**: I have 4 wood, 3 wheat, but no brick, ore, or sheep.
3. **Robber**: Currently on the sheep hex (0, -1, 1) which has a value of 9, blocking RED's sheep production.
4. **Production**:
   - BLUE: Brick (5), Wheat (10), Ore (4), Wood (8)
   - RED: Brick (5), Wheat (3, 10), Wood (8), Sheep (9)
5. **Available Actions**: End turn or make a 4:1 port trade using wood.

## Strategic Analysis

I need to evaluate my options:

1. **End Turn**: If I end my turn without action, I keep my 4 wood and 3 wheat.
   - Pros: Preserve resources for future builds
   - Cons: Not making progress this turn

2. **Trade Options**:
   - Trade 4 wood for brick: Would have 0 wood, 3 wheat, 1 brick - not enough for any builds
   - Trade 4 wood for ore: Would have 0 wood, 3 wheat, 1 ore - not enough for any builds
   - Trade 4 wood for sheep: Would have 0 wood, 3 wheat, 1 sheep - not enough for any builds
   - Trade 4 wood for wheat: Would have 0 wood, 4 wheat - not enough for any builds

Looking at potential builds:
- Road (1 wood, 1 brick) - I don't have brick
- Settlement (1 wood, 1 brick, 1 wheat, 1 sheep) - Missing brick and sheep
- City (2 wheat, 3 ore) - Missing ore
- Development Card (1 wheat, 1 ore, 1 sheep) - Missing ore and sheep

None of the trades will allow me to build anything immediately. Trading would leave me with just one of the needed resources and no wood, which is a resource I'm good at producing.

## Plan Revision

<plan>
Keep resources for now and aim for efficient future builds. With 7 roads already built and good wood production, focus on acquiring brick for road expansion and sheep for settlements. Continue blocking RED's sheep production. When possible, extend road network and build another settlement. Consider development cards if I get sheep, ore, and excess wheat.
</plan>

## Decision

Since none of the trades would enable me to build anything immediately, and trading 4:1 is very inefficient, the best move is to end my turn and wait for better opportunities. I'll keep my wood and wheat as they'll be useful for future builds.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL SETTLEMENT PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Place settlements on high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Target at least one spot with good ore and wheat production for city development
- Try to secure at least one high-probability spot (5, 6, 8, 9) for each critical resource
- Place your second settlement to complement your first (fill resource gaps)
- Aim for access to all five resources or position near useful ports if resource diversity isn't possible
- Always consider which settlements opponents are likely to place and avoid areas that will become contested
- Place roads pointing toward valuable future expansion spots, not toward the center
- Consider the long-term impact: settlements that can't expand are less valuable

MID-GAME RESOURCE PRIORITIES:
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each possible build (cities: 1VP for 5 resources is most efficient)
- Early phase: Secure at least one good source of brick and wood for minimal expansion
- Growth phase: Prioritize ore and wheat production for city upgrades (3VP for 5 resources is optimal)
- Late phase: Focus on the fastest path to victory points, whether through buildings or development cards
- Avoid trading resources that opponents need for immediate victory point gains
- Use 4:1 trades only when necessary; prioritize port usage when possible

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and limited expansion options
- If you get an early knight, save it for defense or until you can start building toward largest army
- Time monopoly card usage for when opponents likely have accumulated specific resources
- Save year of plenty cards for completing crucial builds when you're short 1-2 specific resources
- Development cards are most valuable when:
  * You need hidden victory points to surprise opponents
  * You need knights to break up longest road or secure largest army
  * You're lacking wood/brick for expansion but have plenty of sheep/wheat/ore

EXPANSION STRATEGY:
- Build roads only with clear settlement locations in mind
- Target settlements that give you access to ports or new resources
- Block opponents' expansion paths when it gives you a strategic advantage
- Consider the timing of expansion vs. city upgrades based on your resource production
- Calculate whether longest road is achievable and worth the resource investment
- When deciding between a new settlement and a city upgrade, compare immediate vs. long-term returns

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-probability hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Save knight cards for breaking up opponent strategies or securing largest army
- Use knights defensively if you're producing valuable resources on high-probability hexes

TRADING TACTICS:
- Avoid trading resources that directly help opponents score points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades
- Trade excess resources before rolling 7 if you have more than 7 cards
- Consider bank/port trades when they enable an immediate build that advances your strategy
- When trading with players, try to receive resources that complete a build

ENDGAME STRATEGY:
- In the late game, hide your victory point potential (keep development cards hidden)
- Calculate the fastest path to 10 VP and focus exclusively on that path
- Be aware of the exact number of remaining development cards and their probabilities
- Track opponents' potential victory points, including hidden development cards
- If you're close to winning, prioritize actions that can be completed in a single turn

Before finalizing your action, check:
1. Is there a more efficient path to victory points?
2. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
3. Does this move help or hinder opponents?
4. Is there a defensive move needed to prevent an opponent from winning?
5. Are you properly diversified against dice probability?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Analyzing Game State and Available Actions

Let me analyze the current game state and available options:

## Current Game Status
- I have 2 VP vs RED's 5 VP (3 settlements + Longest Road)
- My resources: 4 Wood, 1 Brick, 3 Wheat
- I have 7 roads built (longest: 3), RED has 6 roads built (longest: 5)
- The robber is currently on the Sheep hex (0, -1, 1) with a roll of 9

## Action Analysis

**Current Position Assessment:**
- RED is leading with 5/10 VP
- I'm behind with only 2/10 VP
- I need to accelerate my strategy to catch up

**Available Resources:**
I have enough resources (1 Brick, 4 Wood) to build exactly one road. I don't have enough resources for a settlement (need Sheep) or development card (need Sheep and Ore).

**Road Building Options (1-7):**
I need to determine which road placement would provide strategic advantage:
- Building a road should either lead to a high-value settlement spot or block RED from expansion
- I should consider which road placement helps me work toward longest road (need 6 connected roads)

**Maritime Trade Options (8-11):**
- Trading 4 Wood for 1 of another resource is inefficient (4:1 ratio)
- However, if a trade enables a critical build, it might be worth considering

## Road Building Strategy Analysis

Looking at the available road placements:
- I need to evaluate which locations allow future settlement placement with good resource diversity
- I should prioritize roads that extend my current network rather than isolated segments
- Blocking RED's expansion is also valuable

Based on the board description, it's hard to visualize the exact node positions without a detailed map. However, I can make some inferences:
- Roads leading toward unclaimed productive nodes are high priority
- Roads that could help me challenge RED for longest road are valuable

Since I don't have enough resources for a settlement (missing sheep) and only have enough for exactly one road, I should place a road that positions me well for future expansion.

<plan>
Build a road to extend my network toward valuable settlement locations. Focus on gathering sheep next to build a settlement, while continuing to develop roads toward the longest road achievement. I need to accelerate my VP acquisition since RED is at 5 VP already.
</plan>

Given the limited information about the exact node connections, I'll build a road with my current resources. Among the options, I'll choose edge (0, 5) as it appears to connect toward the center of the board based on the node numbering, potentially giving me more options for future settlement placement.

# Game Analysis for Turn 52

Let me analyze the current game state and evaluate my options carefully.

## Current Game Status:
- I have 2 VP from my 2 settlements
- RED has 5 VP (3 from settlements + 2 from longest road)
- RED is leading by 3 VP

## My Resources:
- 3 🌲WOOD
- 1 🧱BRICK
- 3 🌾WHEAT
- 1 ⛏️ORE
- No sheep

## Available Actions:
I can build a road (using 1 wood + 1 brick) in several locations or end my turn.

## Strategic Considerations:

1. **Longest Road Opportunity**:
   - RED currently has longest road with 5 segments
   - I have 8 roads built with my longest being 3 segments
   - Taking longest road would require extending to at least 6 segments

2. **Settlement Expansion**:
   - I need sheep to build a settlement (lacking this resource)
   - I should build roads toward valuable settlement locations
   - Need to check which locations offer sheep production

3. **Victory Path Analysis**:
   - RED is at 5 VP and racing ahead
   - I need efficient VP acquisition: settlement/city placements and possibly competing for longest road

## Road Placement Analysis:

Let me evaluate each road option:
- Option 1 (edge 0,1): Connects toward node 0, adjacent to ore4 and brick5
- Option 2 (edge 0,20): Connects toward ore4 and desert regions
- Option 3 (edge 6,23): Extends toward ore4
- Option 4 (edge 6,7): Extends toward wheat10
- Option 5 (edge 4,5): Extends from RED's settlement toward desert
- Option 6 (edge 17,18): Extends from my settlement at node 16 toward desert/edge
- Option 7 (edge 19,21): Toward desert area

Looking at my existing settlements and potential expansions, I need to prioritize:
1. Roads that enable me to build valuable settlements
2. Potential for sheep production (which I'm missing)
3. Paths that could eventually contest longest road

The robber is currently on sheep9, blocking that production hex.

I notice that option 4 (edge 6,7) extends my network toward the wheat10 hex and potentially toward node 9, which produces sheep9. This alignment with my resource needs makes it a strong candidate.

Option 6 (edge 17,18) extends from my settlement at node 16 and could be part of a longer-term strategy to contest longest road, but doesn't immediately lead to valuable resource locations.

<plan>
Focus on building roads toward the sheep9 hex to complement my existing resources. Work toward building settlements that provide sheep production. Continue extending my road network strategically to eventually contest longest road from RED. Monitor RED closely as they're already at 5 VP.
</plan>

After analyzing all options, I believe building a road at edge (6,7) with option 4 is optimal as it:
- Extends toward wheat10 and sheep9 production
- Aligns with my need for sheep resources
- Positions me for future settlement expansion
- Follows a logical path from my current network

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL SETTLEMENT PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Place settlements on high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Target at least one spot with good ore and wheat production for city development
- Try to secure at least one high-probability spot (5, 6, 8, 9) for each critical resource
- Place your second settlement to complement your first (fill resource gaps)
- Aim for access to all five resources or position near useful ports if resource diversity isn't possible
- Always consider which settlements opponents are likely to place and avoid areas that will become contested
- Place roads pointing toward valuable future expansion spots, not toward the center
- Consider the long-term impact: settlements that can't expand are less valuable

MID-GAME RESOURCE PRIORITIES:
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each possible build (cities: 1VP for 5 resources is most efficient)
- Early phase: Secure at least one good source of brick and wood for minimal expansion
- Growth phase: Prioritize ore and wheat production for city upgrades (3VP for 5 resources is optimal)
- Late phase: Focus on the fastest path to victory points, whether through buildings or development cards
- Avoid trading resources that opponents need for immediate victory point gains
- Use 4:1 trades only when necessary; prioritize port usage when possible

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and limited expansion options
- If you get an early knight, save it for defense or until you can start building toward largest army
- Time monopoly card usage for when opponents likely have accumulated specific resources
- Save year of plenty cards for completing crucial builds when you're short 1-2 specific resources
- Development cards are most valuable when:
  * You need hidden victory points to surprise opponents
  * You need knights to break up longest road or secure largest army
  * You're lacking wood/brick for expansion but have plenty of sheep/wheat/ore

EXPANSION STRATEGY:
- Build roads only with clear settlement locations in mind
- Target settlements that give you access to ports or new resources
- Block opponents' expansion paths when it gives you a strategic advantage
- Consider the timing of expansion vs. city upgrades based on your resource production
- Calculate whether longest road is achievable and worth the resource investment
- When deciding between a new settlement and a city upgrade, compare immediate vs. long-term returns

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-probability hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Save knight cards for breaking up opponent strategies or securing largest army
- Use knights defensively if you're producing valuable resources on high-probability hexes

TRADING TACTICS:
- Avoid trading resources that directly help opponents score points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades
- Trade excess resources before rolling 7 if you have more than 7 cards
- Consider bank/port trades when they enable an immediate build that advances your strategy
- When trading with players, try to receive resources that complete a build

ENDGAME STRATEGY:
- In the late game, hide your victory point potential (keep development cards hidden)
- Calculate the fastest path to 10 VP and focus exclusively on that path
- Be aware of the exact number of remaining development cards and their probabilities
- Track opponents' potential victory points, including hidden development cards
- If you're close to winning, prioritize actions that can be completed in a single turn

Before finalizing your action, check:
1. Is there a more efficient path to victory points?
2. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
3. Does this move help or hinder opponents?
4. Is there a defensive move needed to prevent an opponent from winning?
5. Are you properly diversified against dice probability?

- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Analyzing Robber Movement Options

Let me analyze each robber placement option strategically:

## Game State Assessment
- I have 2 VP compared to RED's 5 VP (including longest road)
- RED already has 3 settlements vs my 2, and has longest road bonus (+2 VP)
- RED has 3 hidden resource cards
- I need to slow down RED while advancing my own position

## Analyzing Robber Placement Options

[0] Move robber to (0, 0, 0) - 🧱5 hex and steal from RED
- This would block a brick production tile (5)
- RED has a settlement at node 4 producing from this hex
- I also have a settlement at node 1 producing from this hex
- Placing here hurts both RED and myself, which is suboptimal

[1] Move robber to (1, -1, 0) - 🌾10 hex and steal from RED
- This would block a wheat production tile (10) 
- RED has a settlement at node 9 producing from this hex
- I also have a settlement at node 1 producing from this hex
- Placing here hurts both RED and myself

[2] Move robber to (-1, 0, 1) - 🌾3 hex and steal from RED
- This would block a wheat production tile with low probability (3)
- RED has a settlement at node 4 producing from this hex
- Blocks a low-probability tile, not very impactful

[3] Move robber to (-1, 1, 0) - 🌲8 hex and steal from RED
- This would block a wood production tile with high probability (8)
- RED has settlements at nodes 4 and 17 producing from this hex
- This is a high-value hex for RED (two settlements on an 8)
- This would significantly impact RED's wood production
- I have a settlement at node 16 also producing from this hex, but I already have 2 wood

[4] Move robber to (0, 1, -1) - 🏜️ desert hex
- This has no productive value
- Placing here would waste the robber move

[5] Move robber to (1, 0, -1) - ⛏️4 hex
- This would block an ore production tile (4)
- I have a settlement at node 1 producing from this hex
- RED doesn't appear to have any settlements here
- Placing here would hurt only myself

## Strategic Decision

Option [3] is clearly the optimal choice. Here's why:
- It targets RED's highest-value resource production (wood from an 8 value hex)
- RED has TWO settlements on this hex, making it extremely valuable to them
- While I also have a settlement on this hex, I already have 2 wood, and slowing RED is more important
- Stealing a card from RED adds further value
- RED needs wood to extend their road network and maintain longest road

<plan>
Focus on blocking RED's key resources while building roads toward potential settlement locations. Prioritize breaking RED's longest road by building a longer road network. Continue working toward settlements that provide sheep production, but now also consider how to minimize RED's production advantage.

# Game Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state and my available options:

## Current Situation
- I have 2 VP from my 2 settlements
- RED has 5 VP (3 from settlements + 2 from longest road)
- My resources: 2 Wood, 5 Wheat, 1 Ore
- I don't have any development cards
- RED has the longest road with 5 segments

## Resource Analysis
- I have good wood production from node 16 (8 is a high probability number)
- I have wheat production from node 1 (10 is decent probability)
- I have brick and ore but in limited quantities
- I'm completely missing sheep production
- The robber is currently on the wood hex (-1, 1, 0), which affects my production at node 16

## Available Actions
My options are limited to:
- End turn [0]
- Maritime trades [1-4] (at 4:1 ratio, which is very inefficient)

## Strategic Considerations

Looking at my resources (2 Wood, 5 Wheat, 1 Ore), there's not much I can do this turn:
- I can't build a road (need Wood + Brick)
- I can't build a settlement (need Wood + Brick + Wheat + Sheep)
- I can't build a city (need 3 Ore + 2 Wheat)
- I can't buy a development card (need Ore + Wheat + Sheep)

The maritime trades at 4:1 are very inefficient, and none of them would enable me to build anything this turn. I would be trading 4 Wheat for a single resource, which wouldn't complete any buildable combination.

<plan>
Focus on acquiring brick in the next turn to build roads. Work toward breaking RED's longest road by extending my own road network. Target settlement locations that provide sheep production to diversify my resources. Consider buying development cards when I get sheep to potentially earn victory points or knights for largest army.
</plan>

Since I cannot make any efficient moves this turn with my current resources, and the maritime trades won't lead to any immediate builds, the most prudent action is to end my turn and hope for better dice rolls in the next round.

# Game Analysis for Robber Move

Let me analyze the optimal robber placement based on the current game state:

## Current Situation
- I have 2 VP vs RED's 5 VP (including 2 VP from longest road)
- I need to catch up by slowing RED's production and increasing my own
- RED has 2 hidden resource cards that I could potentially steal
- The robber is currently on a Wood hex (🌲8), which is a high-probability tile

## Strategic Priorities
1. Block RED's most productive hexes
2. Don't block my own important production
3. Target resources RED needs for their likely next moves
4. Try to steal valuable resources

## Analyzing Each Option

[0] Move robber to (0, 0, 0) 🧱5 and steal from RED
- This blocks a brick hex with a 5 (good probability)
- RED has a settlement here, so it blocks RED's brick production
- But I also have a settlement here, so it blocks my own brick production
- Brick is crucial for my road-building strategy

[1] Move robber to (1, -1, 0) 🌾10 and steal from RED
- This blocks a wheat hex with a 10 (decent probability)
- Both RED and I have settlements here
- Blocking wheat hurts both of us equally

[2] Move robber to (0, -1, 1) 🐑9 and steal from RED
- This blocks a sheep hex with a 9 (good probability)
- RED has a settlement here but I don't
- RED would lose sheep production without affecting my production

[3] Move robber to (-1, 0, 1) 🌾3 and steal from RED
- This blocks a wheat hex with a 3 (very low probability)
- RED has a settlement here but I don't
- The low probability makes this a weak robber placement

[4] Move robber to (0, 1, -1) 🏜️- 
- This is a desert hex that produces nothing
- Placing the robber here is essentially wasting the robber's blocking power
- No opportunity to steal from RED

[5] Move robber to (1, 0, -1) ⛏️4 and steal from RED (implied)
- This blocks an ore hex with a 4 (below average probability)
- I have a settlement here but RED doesn't
- This would block my own ore production without affecting RED

## Decision Process
Looking at my options, I want to:
1. Maximize disruption to RED
2. Minimize impact on my own production
3. Target high-probability hexes RED relies on

Option [2] is clearly the best choice:
- It blocks a 9 sheep hex that only RED produces from
- Sheep might be crucial for RED to buy development cards
- I get to steal from RED without hurting my own production

<plan>Continue focusing on acquiring brick to build roads. Target the sheep hex with robber to limit RED's ability to buy development cards while working toward breaking their longest road. Next priorities are building more roads and settlements at strategic locations to challenge the longest road bonus.</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL SETTLEMENT PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Place settlements on high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Target at least one spot with good ore and wheat production for city development
- Try to secure at least one high-probability spot (5, 6, 8, 9) for each critical resource
- Place your second settlement to complement your first (fill resource gaps)
- Aim for access to all five resources or position near useful ports if resource diversity isn't possible
- Always consider which settlements opponents are likely to place and avoid areas that will become contested
- Place roads pointing toward valuable future expansion spots, not toward the center
- Consider the long-term impact: settlements that can't expand are less valuable

MID-GAME RESOURCE PRIORITIES:
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each possible build (cities: 1VP for 5 resources is most efficient)
- Early phase: Secure at least one good source of brick and wood for minimal expansion
- Growth phase: Prioritize ore and wheat production for city upgrades (3VP for 5 resources is optimal)
- Late phase: Focus on the fastest path to victory points, whether through buildings or development cards
- Avoid trading resources that opponents need for immediate victory point gains
- Use 4:1 trades only when necessary; prioritize port usage when possible

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and limited expansion options
- If you get an early knight, save it for defense or until you can start building toward largest army
- Time monopoly card usage for when opponents likely have accumulated specific resources
- Save year of plenty cards for completing crucial builds when you're short 1-2 specific resources
- Development cards are most valuable when:
  * You need hidden victory points to surprise opponents
  * You need knights to break up longest road or secure largest army
  * You're lacking wood/brick for expansion but have plenty of sheep/wheat/ore

EXPANSION STRATEGY:
- Build roads only with clear settlement locations in mind
- Target settlements that give you access to ports or new resources
- Block opponents' expansion paths when it gives you a strategic advantage
- Consider the timing of expansion vs. city upgrades based on your resource production
- Calculate whether longest road is achievable and worth the resource investment
- When deciding between a new settlement and a city upgrade, compare immediate vs. long-term returns

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-probability hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Save knight cards for breaking up opponent strategies or securing largest army
- Use knights defensively if you're producing valuable resources on high-probability hexes

TRADING TACTICS:
- Avoid trading resources that directly help opponents score points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades
- Trade excess resources before rolling 7 if you have more than 7 cards
- Consider bank/port trades when they enable an immediate build that advances your strategy
- When trading with players, try to receive resources that complete a build

ENDGAME STRATEGY:
- In the late game, hide your victory point potential (keep development cards hidden)
- Calculate the fastest path to 10 VP and focus exclusively on that path
- Be aware of the exact number of remaining development cards and their probabilities
- Track opponents' potential victory points, including hidden development cards
- If you're close to winning, prioritize actions that can be completed in a single turn

Before finalizing your action, check:
1. Is there a more efficient path to victory points?
2. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
3. Does this move help or hinder opponents?
4. Is there a defensive move needed to prevent an opponent from winning?
5. Are you properly diversified against dice probability?

Board Understanding Guide:

- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state and available actions:

## Current Position
- I have 2 VP from my 2 settlements
- RED has 5 VP (3 settlements + 2 VP from longest road)
- My resources: 1 🌲WOOD, 1 🐑SHEEP, 2 🌾WHEAT, 1 ⛏️ORE

## Action Options
1. Buy a development card (1 🐑SHEEP, 1 🌾WHEAT, 1 ⛏️ORE)
0. End my turn

## Strategy Analysis

### Option 1: Buy a Development Card
- Costs my sheep, wheat and ore
- Potential outcomes:
  * Victory Point card: Immediate hidden VP boost
  * Knight: Can move robber and possibly build toward largest army
  * Road Building: Would help expand network and challenge longest road
  * Year of Plenty: Extra resources for future builds
  * Monopoly: Could be strategically valuable

### Option 0: End Turn
- I keep my resources for future turns
- Could save toward building a settlement (2 wood, 1 brick, 1 wheat, 1 sheep) or city (2 wheat, 3 ore)
- Risk losing half my resources if a 7 is rolled (unlikely with only 5 cards)

## Decision Making
I need to consider my current plan and strategic position. According to my plan, I want to challenge RED's longest road and build more settlements. However, I don't currently have brick, which is critical for my road-building strategy.

A development card could potentially help me in multiple ways:
1. Knight would let me move the robber from the sheep hex (which was my original intent) and potentially get brick from RED
2. Road Building would immediately advance my road network without needing brick
3. VP card would secretly bring me closer to winning

Looking at my resources, if I don't buy a development card now, I still can't build much on my next turn without getting lucky with dice rolls. I need brick for roads and settlements.

<plan>Buy a development card to potentially get knight (to move robber and potentially steal brick), road building (to advance without brick), or a victory point. Continue working on challenging RED's longest road while developing my own VP opportunities through settlements and possible city upgrades.</plan>

Based on this analysis, I'll buy a development card as it offers the best strategic potential with my current resources.

# Game State Analysis

I need to carefully analyze my options here to determine the best action for this turn.

## Current Situation:
- I have 2 victory points (from 2 settlements)
- I have only 1 wood and 1 wheat resource
- RED has 5 VP (3 settlements + 2 VP from longest road)
- I have a ROAD_BUILDING development card
- The robber is on the sheep hex (0, -1, 1), blocking sheep production
- I only have 4 roads built in my longest path vs RED's 5

## Option 0: Play Road Building Card
This would allow me to build two roads for free without using any resources. Given my limited resources (just 1 wood and 1 wheat), this is very valuable as I can't build roads normally right now.

Benefits:
- Can extend my road network without needing brick
- Could potentially position myself to challenge RED's longest road
- Could move toward valuable settlement spots
- Saves my limited resources for other purchases

## Option 1: Roll the Dice
If I roll, I might get more resources, but given my current resource situation and the clear value of the Road Building card, it seems less optimal than using the powerful development card I already have.

## Strategic Analysis:
RED is ahead with 5 VP to my 2 VP. One of their advantages is the longest road. Using the Road Building card could help me:
1. Extend my longest path (currently at 4 vs RED's 5)
2. Position for future settlement placements
3. Potentially challenge RED's longest road bonus

<plan>
Play the Road Building card to extend my road network. Focus on either:
1. Challenging RED for longest road by extending my longest path
2. Moving toward good settlement locations to increase my resource production
3. Specifically aim for locations that might give me access to brick, which I currently lack
After this turn, look to either secure additional resources through trades/rolls or consider buying more development cards if I get the right resources.
</plan>

The Road Building card offers guaranteed progress with my limited resources, while rolling offers uncertain returns. Given the significant VP gap between myself and RED, I need to make the most strategic move possible.

# Analyzing the Game State

Let me analyze the current game state and the available road building options:

## Current Game Status
- I have 2 VP while RED has 5 VP (including 2 VP from longest road)
- I have just played a Road Building card, allowing me to build 2 roads for free
- I have 1 wood and 1 wheat in my inventory, but no brick
- My current longest road is 4 segments, while RED has 5 segments

## Settlement Positions
- I have settlements at nodes 1 and 16
- My settlement at node 1 produces brick(5), wheat(10), and ore(4)
- My settlement at node 16 produces wood(8)
- I'm lacking good sheep production and could use more resources overall

## Road Building Options
Looking at the available options (0-6), I need to determine which roads would:
1. Help me challenge RED for longest road
2. Position me for future settlement placement
3. Access resources I'm currently lacking (sheep and more production generally)

Without a complete map view, I'll focus on extending my current road network strategically.

## Strategic Analysis
Since I need to place two roads (from the Road Building card), I should look for combinations that:
- Extend my longest contiguous road
- Lead toward promising settlement locations
- Block RED from critical expansion points

Based on the limited information, options 3 and 4 (edges 4-5 and 17-18) seem to be connected to my existing settlements and could potentially extend my road network toward new resources or settlement spots. Building near node 17 would be particularly valuable since RED has a settlement there, indicating good resource production.

<plan>
1. Build two roads to extend my longest road to at least 6 segments to take the longest road bonus from RED
2. Target my next settlement location to increase sheep production
3. Continue accumulating resources for city upgrades (focus on ore and wheat)
4. Consider buying development cards if I get excess sheep/wheat/ore
</plan>

Looking at the options, I will choose to build roads that extend my current network toward potential settlement locations. Based on the available information, my best move appears to be:

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL SETTLEMENT PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Place settlements on high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Target at least one spot with good ore and wheat production for city development
- Try to secure at least one high-probability spot (5, 6, 8, 9) for each critical resource
- Place your second settlement to complement your first (fill resource gaps)
- Aim for access to all five resources or position near useful ports if resource diversity isn't possible
- Always consider which settlements opponents are likely to place and avoid areas that will become contested
- Place roads pointing toward valuable future expansion spots, not toward the center
- Consider the long-term impact: settlements that can't expand are less valuable

MID-GAME RESOURCE PRIORITIES:
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each possible build (cities: 1VP for 5 resources is most efficient)
- Early phase: Secure at least one good source of brick and wood for minimal expansion
- Growth phase: Prioritize ore and wheat production for city upgrades (3VP for 5 resources is optimal)
- Late phase: Focus on the fastest path to victory points, whether through buildings or development cards
- Avoid trading resources that opponents need for immediate victory point gains
- Use 4:1 trades only when necessary; prioritize port usage when possible

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and limited expansion options
- If you get an early knight, save it for defense or until you can start building toward largest army
- Time monopoly card usage for when opponents likely have accumulated specific resources
- Save year of plenty cards for completing crucial builds when you're short 1-2 specific resources
- Development cards are most valuable when:
  * You need hidden victory points to surprise opponents
  * You need knights to break up longest road or secure largest army
  * You're lacking wood/brick for expansion but have plenty of sheep/wheat/ore

EXPANSION STRATEGY:
- Build roads only with clear settlement locations in mind
- Target settlements that give you access to ports or new resources
- Block opponents' expansion paths when it gives you a strategic advantage
- Consider the timing of expansion vs. city upgrades based on your resource production
- Calculate whether longest road is achievable and worth the resource investment
- When deciding between a new settlement and a city upgrade, compare immediate vs. long-term returns

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-probability hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Save knight cards for breaking up opponent strategies or securing largest army
- Use knights defensively if you're producing valuable resources on high-probability hexes

TRADING TACTICS:
- Avoid trading resources that directly help opponents score points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades
- Trade excess resources before rolling 7 if you have more than 7 cards
- Consider bank/port trades when they enable an immediate build that advances your strategy
- When trading with players, try to receive resources that complete a build

ENDGAME STRATEGY:
- In the late game, hide your victory point potential (keep development cards hidden)
- Calculate the fastest path to 10 VP and focus exclusively on that path
- Be aware of the exact number of remaining development cards and their probabilities
- Track opponents' potential victory points, including hidden development cards
- If you're close to winning, prioritize actions that can be completed in a single turn

Before finalizing your action, check:
1. Is there a more efficient path to victory points?
2. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
3. Does this move help or hinder opponents?
4. Is there a defensive move needed to prevent an opponent from winning?
5. Are you properly diversified against dice probability?

❓ Select action by number (0-5):


Based on this information, which action number do you choose? Think step by step about your options, then put the final action number in a box like \boxed{1}.
RESPONSE:
I need to analyze the current game state and determine the optimal action from the available options.

## Current State Assessment

- I have 2 VP (from 2 settlements), while RED has 5 VP (3 settlements + 2 VP for longest road)
- My resources: 1 wood, 1 wheat (not enough for a road which costs 1 wood, 1 brick)
- My settlements produce wood (8), wheat (10), brick (5), and ore (4)
- My current longest road is 4 segments, RED has 5 segments for the longest road bonus
- I have played a Road Building card previously
- No development cards in hand
- The robber is on sheep (9), but I don't have any sheep production anyway

## Strategic Considerations

My plan was to build roads to take longest road from RED, but I currently lack the resources to build any roads. None of the available actions are actually executable with my current resources (all road building options require 1 wood + 1 brick, and I only have 1 wood).

Since I can't build any roads with my current resources, I need to adjust my plan to reflect that I'll need to gather more resources first.

<plan>
1. Use my next few dice rolls to accumulate brick resources (I already have wood)
2. Once I have resources, build roads to extend my network to at least 6 segments to take longest road from RED (+2 VP)
3. Continue expanding toward valuable nodes for my next settlement with focus on sheep production
4. Save up for city upgrades (especially for my node 1 which produces multiple resources)
5. Consider development cards if I accumulate excess sheep/wheat/ore
</plan>

The issue is that none of the available options are actually valid moves with my current resources. Since I'm asked to choose one of the options 0-5, and all are road building options requiring 1 wood and 1 brick when I only have 1 wood, I need to determine which would be the best theoretical choice if I had the resources.

Looking at the road options, I should consider which would:
1. Extend my longest road most effectively
2. Position me for valuable future settlement locations
3. Block RED's expansion

Without a detailed road map, it's hard to fully assess road connectivity, but I'll analyze each option:

- Options [0], [1], [3], and [4] appear to extend from my current road network based on node numbers
- Option [2] connects nodes 6 and 23, which connects to my settlement at node 1
- Option [5] connects nodes 7 and 8, which are near my settlement at node 1

Since my goal is to increase my longest road and I currently have 4 segments, I need to add roads that extend my current longest path rather than creating isolated segments.

Based on the limited information, I believe option [1] (edge 0-20) is likely the best choice as it seems to extend from my main network and helps develop toward additional potential settlement locations. However, this is a theoretical choice since I cannot actually build this road with my current resources.

  - Node 16: Wood (8)
- No cities yet

## Opponent (RED):
- 5 VP total (3 from settlements + 2 from longest road)
- Has longest road bonus (6 segments)
- 3 settlements (nodes 4, 9, 17)
- 5 hidden resources

## Current Plan Review:
My plan correctly focuses on taking longest road from RED, which would be a 4-point swing (I gain 2, they lose 2). This is my fastest path to victory. I have the resources needed (2 wood, 1 brick) to build a road immediately, which gets me closer to this goal.

## Action Analysis:
I need to decide which road to build. Looking at the options:

Since my objective is to claim longest road, I need to carefully consider which road would help me build the longest continuous path while also positioning me for future settlement placement. I should inspect where my existing roads are and choose the edge that extends my current longest path.

Without a detailed map of all road positions, I need to make some assumptions. The best strategy would be to:
1. Build a road that extends my current longest path
2. Choose a direction that leads toward valuable expansion nodes
3. Consider blocking opponent's expansion if possible

## Decision:
Since I don't have full visibility on my current road network's exact layout, I need to make a strategic choice based on the options. At this point, I should build a road to continue working toward the longest road. Given my resource constraints (only 1 brick), I can build exactly one road now.

<plan>
1. Build one road now to extend my network toward claiming longest road
2. Continue accumulating brick and wood for additional roads (need at least 2 more roads to claim longest road)
3. Position for my next settlement with focus on sheep production (which I currently lack)
4. Save for city upgrades when possible, particularly at node 1 which has multiple resources
5. Consider development cards if I accumulate excess sheep/wheat/ore
</plan>

Without complete information about my current road network's configuration, I'll choose one of the road options that seems most likely to extend my longest path and position me for future expansion.

PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL SETTLEMENT PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Place settlements on high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Target at least one spot with good ore and wheat production for city development
- Try to secure at least one high-probability spot (5, 6, 8, 9) for each critical resource
- Place your second settlement to complement your first (fill resource gaps)
- Aim for access to all five resources or position near useful ports if resource diversity isn't possible
- Always consider which settlements opponents are likely to place and avoid areas that will become contested
- Place roads pointing toward valuable future expansion spots, not toward the center
- Consider the long-term impact: settlements that can't expand are less valuable

MID-GAME RESOURCE PRIORITIES:
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each possible build (cities: 1VP for 5 resources is most efficient)
- Early phase: Secure at least one good source of brick and wood for minimal expansion
- Growth phase: Prioritize ore and wheat production for city upgrades (3VP for 5 resources is optimal)
- Late phase: Focus on the fastest path to victory points, whether through buildings or development cards
- Avoid trading resources that opponents need for immediate victory point gains
- Use 4:1 trades only when necessary; prioritize port usage when possible

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and limited expansion options
- If you get an early knight, save it for defense or until you can start building toward largest army
- Time monopoly card usage for when opponents likely have accumulated specific resources
- Save year of plenty cards for completing crucial builds when you're short 1-2 specific resources
- Development cards are most valuable when:
  * You need hidden victory points to surprise opponents
  * You need knights to break up longest road or secure largest army
  * You're lacking wood/brick for expansion but have plenty of sheep/wheat/ore

EXPANSION STRATEGY:
- Build roads only with clear settlement locations in mind
- Target settlements that give you access to ports or new resources
- Block opponents' expansion paths when it gives you a strategic advantage
- Consider the timing of expansion vs. city upgrades based on your resource production
- Calculate whether longest road is achievable and worth the resource investment
- When deciding between a new settlement and a city upgrade, compare immediate vs. long-term returns

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-probability hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Save knight cards for breaking up opponent strategies or securing largest army
- Use knights defensively if you're producing valuable resources on high-probability hexes

TRADING TACTICS:
- Avoid trading resources that directly help opponents score points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades
- Trade excess resources before rolling 7 if you have more than 7 cards
- Consider bank/port trades when they enable an immediate build that advances your strategy
- When trading with players, try to receive resources that complete a build

ENDGAME STRATEGY:
- In the late game, hide your victory point potential (keep development cards hidden)
- Calculate the fastest path to 10 VP and focus exclusively on that path
- Be aware of the exact number of remaining development cards and their probabilities
- Track opponents' potential victory points, including hidden development cards
- If you're close to winning, prioritize actions that can be completed in a single turn

Before finalizing your action, check:
1. Is there a more efficient path to victory points?
2. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
3. Does this move help or hinder opponents?
4. Is there a defensive move needed to prevent an opponent from winning?

# Game State Analysis

Let me carefully analyze my current position and options:

**Current Resources**: 1 🌲WOOD, 4 🌾WHEAT, 2 ⛏️ORE

**Victory Points**: I have 2 VP (from 2 settlements), while RED has 5 VP (3 from settlements plus 2 from longest road)

**Build Options**:
- Road: Need 1 🌲WOOD + 1 🧱BRICK (lacking brick)
- Settlement: Need 1 🌲WOOD + 1 🧱BRICK + 1 🌾WHEAT + 1 🐑SHEEP (lacking brick and sheep)
- City: Need 2 🌾WHEAT + 3 ⛏️ORE (have 4 wheat, but only 2 ore)
- Dev Card: Need 1 🌾WHEAT + 1 ⛏️ORE + 1 🐑SHEEP (lacking sheep)

## Strategic Assessment

I'm 3 VP behind RED, which is concerning. My current plan focuses on building more roads to claim longest road (2 VP), but I need brick for that. I also need to expand my settlement network to gain access to sheep production and increase my VP.

Looking at my current options:
1. I can trade 4 wheat for 1 brick (option 2)
2. I can trade 4 wheat for 1 sheep (option 4)
3. I can end my turn (option 0)

Trading for brick would let me build one road, but that's not enough to take longest road from RED (who has a 6-segment road, while I currently have a 6-segment road).

Trading for sheep doesn't immediately help me build anything since I still lack brick.

## Decision Logic

Given my current resources and position, I need to prioritize my next steps:

1. I can't build anything meaningful this turn with the available trades
2. Trading 4:1 is extremely inefficient
3. It's better to conserve my wheat for future city upgrades (I'm close with 4 wheat, 2 ore - need 3 more ore)
4. Since I can't make meaningful progress this turn, it's best to end my turn and wait for better opportunities

<plan>
1. End turn now to conserve resources
2. Focus on acquiring brick on my next turn to continue road expansion
3. Target sheep production for my next settlement
4. Save wheat and ore for city upgrades when I get 3 more ore
5. Consider development cards if I get sheep
</plan>

Ending my turn allows me to preserve my resources for more efficient builds in future turns.

# Game Analysis: Robber Placement Decision

I need to decide where to place the robber to maximize my strategic advantage while disrupting my opponent's production.

## Current Game State
- I (BLUE) have 2 VP with 2 settlements
- RED has 5 VP (including 2 bonus VP for longest road) with 3 settlements
- I have 1 wood, 1 wheat, and 2 ore
- RED has 4 hidden cards
- RED is leading substantially with 5 VP vs my 2 VP

## Robber Placement Analysis

Let me evaluate each option:

**[0] Move robber to (0, 0, 0) and steal from RED**
- This is the brick hex with number 5 (good probability)
- RED's settlement at node 4 produces from this hex
- I also have a settlement at node 1 that produces from this hex
- Placing here would block my own brick production (which I need for roads)

**[1] Move robber to (1, -1, 0) and steal from RED**
- This is the wheat hex with number 10 (average probability)
- Both RED (node 9) and I (node 1) produce from this hex
- Placing here would block my own wheat production, which I may need for cities or development cards

**[2] Move robber to (-1, 0, 1) and steal from RED**
- This is the wheat hex with number 3 (poor probability)
- Only RED produces from this hex (node 4)
- Low impact but doesn't affect my production

**[3] Move robber to (-1, 1, 0) and steal from RED**
- This is the wood hex with number 8 (excellent probability)
- RED has 2 settlements (nodes 4 and 17) producing from this hex
- This is RED's best production hex
- Doesn't affect my own production since my wood settlement is elsewhere

**[4] Move robber to (0, 1, -1)**
- This is the desert hex which produces nothing
- Placing here has no impact on anyone's production
- This would be a wasted move

**[5] Move robber to (1, 0, -1) and steal from RED**
- This is the ore hex with number 4 (below average probability)
- I produce from this hex with my settlement at node 1
- Placing here would block my own ore production

## Decision Logic

I should target the hex that:
1. Maximizes disruption to RED's production
2. Minimizes impact on my own production
3. Ideally targets a high-probability number
4. Allows me to steal a useful resource from RED

Option [3] clearly stands out as the best choice:
- It targets RED's highest-producing hex (wood with number 8)
- It affects TWO of RED's settlements
- It does not affect my production at all
- RED is likely to have wood resources I could steal

<plan>
1. Block RED's wood production with the robber
2. Continue road expansion when I acquire brick
3. Target sheep production for my next settlement
4. Save wheat and ore for city upgrades
5. Consider development cards if I get sheep

# Game Analysis for Settlers of Catan

Let me analyze the current game state and my options carefully.

## Current Game State
- I (BLUE) have 2 VP from my 2 settlements
- RED has 5 VP (3 from settlements + 2 from longest road)
- I have 1 🌲WOOD, 1 🧱BRICK, 3 🌾WHEAT, 2 ⛏️ORE
- The robber is currently on the WOOD hex (-1, 1, 0) with value 8, which is high-probability
- This robber placement hurts both RED and me since we both have settlements there

## Available Actions
My options are:
- [0] End turn (no build)
- [1-5] Build a road in various locations (each costs 1 🌲WOOD, 1 🧱BRICK)

## Strategic Assessment

Looking at my resources, I have exactly enough WOOD and BRICK to build one road. Building a road would use all my WOOD and BRICK but might help extend my road network toward potential settlement spots or toward claiming longest road.

However, I need to consider if any of the road options lead to good expansion opportunities:

1. Edge (19, 20) - Need to understand where this expands toward
2. Edge (6, 23) - Need to understand where this expands toward
3. Edge (4, 5) - This appears to be near a settlement area
4. Edge (20, 22) - Need to understand where this expands toward
5. Edge (19, 21) - Need to understand where this expands toward

Without a clear picture of the full road network and available settlement spots, it's difficult to determine which road would be most valuable.

Looking at the longer-term strategy:
- RED is at 5 VP and already has longest road
- I need to focus on getting to 10 VP through a combination of settlements, cities, and potentially development cards
- Currently I have good WHEAT and ORE production, which is good for cities and development cards
- I'm lacking consistent SHEEP production

Given my current resources (3 WHEAT, 2 ORE), I'm close to being able to build a city (costs 2 WHEAT, 3 ORE), so I need just 1 more ORE.

Since there's no clear optimal road placement from the information provided, and I'm close to having resources for a city, the best strategy might be to save my WOOD and BRICK for when I can build another settlement after I upgrade one to a city.

<plan>
1. Save resources for city upgrade (need 1 more ORE)
2. Once I have a city, use saved WOOD/BRICK to expand toward new settlement locations
3. Focus on getting SHEEP production in next settlement placement
4. Work toward breaking RED's longest road if possible
</plan>

After careful consideration, I believe the best action is to end my turn and save resources for a city upgrade.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL SETTLEMENT PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Place settlements on high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Target at least one spot with good ore and wheat production for city development
- Try to secure at least one high-probability spot (5, 6, 8, 9) for each critical resource
- Place your second settlement to complement your first (fill resource gaps)
- Aim for access to all five resources or position near useful ports if resource diversity isn't possible
- Always consider which settlements opponents are likely to place and avoid areas that will become contested
- Place roads pointing toward valuable future expansion spots, not toward the center
- Consider the long-term impact: settlements that can't expand are less valuable

MID-GAME RESOURCE PRIORITIES:
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each possible build (cities: 1VP for 5 resources is most efficient)
- Early phase: Secure at least one good source of brick and wood for minimal expansion
- Growth phase: Prioritize ore and wheat production for city upgrades (3VP for 5 resources is optimal)
- Late phase: Focus on the fastest path to victory points, whether through buildings or development cards
- Avoid trading resources that opponents need for immediate victory point gains
- Use 4:1 trades only when necessary; prioritize port usage when possible

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and limited expansion options
- If you get an early knight, save it for defense or until you can start building toward largest army
- Time monopoly card usage for when opponents likely have accumulated specific resources
- Save year of plenty cards for completing crucial builds when you're short 1-2 specific resources
- Development cards are most valuable when:
  * You need hidden victory points to surprise opponents
  * You need knights to break up longest road or secure largest army
  * You're lacking wood/brick for expansion but have plenty of sheep/wheat/ore

EXPANSION STRATEGY:
- Build roads only with clear settlement locations in mind
- Target settlements that give you access to ports or new resources
- Block opponents' expansion paths when it gives you a strategic advantage
- Consider the timing of expansion vs. city upgrades based on your resource production
- Calculate whether longest road is achievable and worth the resource investment
- When deciding between a new settlement and a city upgrade, compare immediate vs. long-term returns

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-probability hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Save knight cards for breaking up opponent strategies or securing largest army
- Use knights defensively if you're producing valuable resources on high-probability hexes

TRADING TACTICS:
- Avoid trading resources that directly help opponents score points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades
- Trade excess resources before rolling 7 if you have more than 7 cards
- Consider bank/port trades when they enable an immediate build that advances your strategy
- When trading with players, try to receive resources that complete a build

ENDGAME STRATEGY:
- In the late game, hide your victory point potential (keep development cards hidden)
- Calculate the fastest path to 10 VP and focus exclusively on that path
- Be aware of the exact number of remaining development cards and their probabilities
- Track opponents' potential victory points, including hidden development cards
- If you're close to winning, prioritize actions that can be completed in a single turn

Before finalizing your action, check:
1. Is there a more efficient path to victory points?
2. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
3. Does this move help or hinder opponents?
4. Is there a defensive move needed to prevent an opponent from winning?
5. Are you properly diversified against dice probability?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game Analysis for Settlers of Catan

Let me analyze the current game state and my available options carefully to determine the optimal move.

## Current Situation Assessment
- I have 2 VP (from 2 settlements)
- I need 8 more VP to win
- Resource inventory: 1 WOOD, 2 BRICK, 4 WHEAT, 2 ORE
- RED has 5 VP (3 settlements + longest road bonus)

## My Production Capabilities
- Settlement at node 1: Produces BRICK(5), WHEAT(10), ORE(4)
- Settlement at node 16: Produces WOOD(8) - currently blocked by robber

## Goal Analysis
Looking at my current plan, I need 1 more ORE to build a city (need 3 ORE total, have 2). A city would give me +1 VP and double production at that location.

## Available Actions Evaluation

1. **End Turn** - Not optimal as I have resources to use.

2. **Build Road Options** (1-5) - All cost 1 WOOD + 1 BRICK
   - I have exactly enough resources (1 WOOD, 2 BRICK)
   - Building a road doesn't immediately increase my VP
   - Could potentially help me work toward longest road (currently 6 vs RED's 6)
   - Need to evaluate which location is most strategic

3. **Maritime Trade** (6-9)
   - Option 8: Trade 4 WHEAT for 1 ORE would give me enough ORE (3) to build a city
   - This would be an inefficient 4:1 trade but would enable immediate city upgrade

## Strategic Decision
If I trade 4 WHEAT for 1 ORE, I could immediately build a city next turn. This would:
- Gain 1 VP (bringing me to 3/10)
- Double production at one settlement
- Leave me with no WHEAT

However, this option isn't available in my current action list - I'd need to trade this turn and build the city next turn.

Alternatively, building a road could position me to:
- Potentially break RED's longest road in the future
- Set up for future settlement placement
- Keep resources for next turn's city build once I get more ORE

Looking at the map, I need to determine which road placement gives me the best strategic advantage for future expansion or breaking RED's road network.

Without a detailed map of all road placements, it's difficult to determine which specific road option (1-5) is best. However, I should prioritize roads that:
1. Extend toward potential settlement locations
2. Could lead to breaking RED's road network
3. Help me secure longest road

<plan>
1. Build a road this turn for future expansion
2. Build a city next turn when I get 1 more ORE
3. Continue expanding toward high-value settlement locations
4. Work toward breaking RED's longest road
5. Focus on gaining SHEEP production with next settlement
</plan>

Given the incomplete information about road connectivity, I'll select a road building action. Since I can't be certain which specific road is optimal without seeing the full road network, I'll choose option 1 as my action.

- **Red's Victory Points**: 5/10 (3 settlements + Longest Road bonus)
- **My Resources**: 1 BRICK, 4 WHEAT, 2 ORE
- **My Goal**: Need 8 more VP to win

## Resource Production Analysis
- I have decent BRICK (5), WHEAT (10), ORE (4), and WOOD (8) production
- I lack SHEEP production entirely
- RED has node 4 (BRICK 5, WHEAT 3, WOOD 8) and node 9 (WHEAT 10, SHEEP 9) and node 17 (WOOD 8)

## Current Plan & Strategic Situation
- I need to build a road for future expansion
- My plan includes building a city soon (need 1 more ORE)
- I need to break RED's longest road
- RED is ahead with 5 VP vs my 2 VP

## Available Actions
I can:
- End my turn [0]
- Trade 4 WHEAT for various resources [1-4]

## Option Analysis

I currently have 1 BRICK, 4 WHEAT, 2 ORE. For a city, I need 3 ORE and 2 WHEAT. I only need 1 more ORE.

Since my plan mentions building a city next turn when I get 1 more ORE, and I currently need 1 more ORE to build a city, trading 4 WHEAT for 1 ORE would enable me to build a city on my next turn. This aligns perfectly with my stated plan.

For building a road this turn (as mentioned in my plan), I need 1 BRICK and 1 WOOD. I have 1 BRICK but no WOOD. However, I don't see an action to build a road with my current resources.

The action list doesn't include building a road, which suggests I may have already used my building opportunities this turn or I don't have the resources.

<plan>
1. Trade 4 WHEAT for 1 ORE this turn
2. Build a city next turn with my 3 ORE and 0 WHEAT
3. Continue expanding toward high-value settlement locations, especially those with SHEEP production
4. Work toward breaking RED's longest road
5. Maintain focus on development cards if I can't expand directly
</plan>

Given the limited action options and my strategic needs, I should trade 4 WHEAT for 1 ORE (option 3) to enable building a city on my next turn.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL SETTLEMENT PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Place settlements on high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Target at least one spot with good ore and wheat production for city development
- Try to secure at least one high-probability spot (5, 6, 8, 9) for each critical resource
- Place your second settlement to complement your first (fill resource gaps)
- Aim for access to all five resources or position near useful ports if resource diversity isn't possible
- Always consider which settlements opponents are likely to place and avoid areas that will become contested
- Place roads pointing toward valuable future expansion spots, not toward the center
- Consider the long-term impact: settlements that can't expand are less valuable

MID-GAME RESOURCE PRIORITIES:
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each possible build (cities: 1VP for 5 resources is most efficient)
- Early phase: Secure at least one good source of brick and wood for minimal expansion
- Growth phase: Prioritize ore and wheat production for city upgrades (3VP for 5 resources is optimal)
- Late phase: Focus on the fastest path to victory points, whether through buildings or development cards
- Avoid trading resources that opponents need for immediate victory point gains
- Use 4:1 trades only when necessary; prioritize port usage when possible

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and limited expansion options
- If you get an early knight, save it for defense or until you can start building toward largest army
- Time monopoly card usage for when opponents likely have accumulated specific resources
- Save year of plenty cards for completing crucial builds when you're short 1-2 specific resources
- Development cards are most valuable when:
  * You need hidden victory points to surprise opponents
  * You need knights to break up longest road or secure largest army
  * You're lacking wood/brick for expansion but have plenty of sheep/wheat/ore

EXPANSION STRATEGY:
- Build roads only with clear settlement locations in mind
- Target settlements that give you access to ports or new resources
- Block opponents' expansion paths when it gives you a strategic advantage
- Consider the timing of expansion vs. city upgrades based on your resource production
- Calculate whether longest road is achievable and worth the resource investment
- When deciding between a new settlement and a city upgrade, compare immediate vs. long-term returns

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-probability hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Save knight cards for breaking up opponent strategies or securing largest army
- Use knights defensively if you're producing valuable resources on high-probability hexes

TRADING TACTICS:
- Avoid trading resources that directly help opponents score points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades
- Trade excess resources before rolling 7 if you have more than 7 cards
- Consider bank/port trades when they enable an immediate build that advances your strategy
- When trading with players, try to receive resources that complete a build

ENDGAME STRATEGY:
- In the late game, hide your victory point potential (keep development cards hidden)
- Calculate the fastest path to 10 VP and focus exclusively on that path
- Be aware of the exact number of remaining development cards and their probabilities
- Track opponents' potential victory points, including hidden development cards
- If you're close to winning, prioritize actions that can be completed in a single turn

Before finalizing your action, check:
1. Is there a more efficient path to victory points?
2. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
3. Does this move help or hinder opponents?
4. Is there a defensive move needed to prevent an opponent from winning?
5. Are you properly diversified against dice probability?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game Analysis for Robber Placement

I need to analyze the optimal robber placement based on the current game state, my resource needs, and disrupting my opponent's strategy.

## Current Game State Assessment
- I (BLUE) have 2 VP with 2 settlements
- RED has 5 VP (3 settlements + longest road bonus)
- RED is halfway to victory while I'm only at 20% progress
- I have 3 BRICK and 3 ORE, but no WHEAT, WOOD, or SHEEP
- My plan requires WHEAT for city building
- Robber is currently on the WOOD 8 hex, which is blocking both my and RED's WOOD production

## Robber Placement Analysis

Let me evaluate each option:

**[0] Move robber to (0, 0, 0) and steal from RED**
- This is the BRICK 5 hex
- Would block a valuable ⭐⭐ BRICK production for both myself and RED
- Not ideal as I already have BRICK and would hurt my own production

**[1] Move robber to (1, -1, 0) and steal from RED**
- This is the WHEAT 10 hex
- Would block ⭐ WHEAT production for both myself and RED
- I need WHEAT for my city plan, so this hurts me as much as RED

**[2] Move robber to (0, -1, 1) and steal from RED**
- This is the SHEEP 9 hex with ⭐⭐ production
- RED has a settlement here (node 9), so this targets RED's SHEEP production
- I don't have a settlement on this hex, so I don't lose production
- Good option to disrupt RED while potentially stealing SHEEP I need

**[3] Move robber to (-1, 0, 1) and steal from RED**
- This is the WHEAT 3 hex with ⭐ production
- RED has a settlement here (node 4)
- Low probability number (3) makes this less impactful

**[4] Move robber to (0, 1, -1)**
- This is the DESERT hex
- Placing robber here is wasteful as it produces nothing anyway

**[5] Move robber to (1, 0, -1) and steal from RED**
- This is the ORE 4 hex with ⭐ production
- I have a settlement here (node 1)
- Would hurt my own ORE production which I need for city building
- Not a good choice

## Strategic Considerations
- My plan involves trading for WHEAT and building a city
- RED is ahead with 5 VP, so disrupting their production is critical
- I should target RED's highest probability resource that I don't also depend on

<plan>
1. Move robber to SHEEP 9 hex to disrupt RED's production
2. Use bank/port trades to convert BRICK to WHEAT when possible
3. Build a city when I have enough resources (3 ORE + 2 WHEAT)
4. Work toward breaking RED's longest road by strategic road building
5. Consider development cards if expansion is limited
</plan>

Based on this analysis, option [2] is optimal as it blocks RED's SHEEP production on a high-probability number (9) without hurting my own production, and gives me a chance to steal a card from RED.

# Game Analysis

Let me carefully analyze the current game state and available options:

## Current Situation
- I have 2 VP from 2 settlements
- RED has 5 VP (3 settlements + longest road)
- I have 4 BRICK and 3 ORE, but lack WHEAT, WOOD, and SHEEP
- The robber is already on the SHEEP 9 hex (part of my plan)
- I cannot build anything immediately with my current resources

## Resource Analysis
To advance my strategy, I need:
- WHEAT (for cities and development cards)
- WOOD (for roads and settlements)
- SHEEP (for development cards)

## Available Actions
My options are:
0. End turn without doing anything
1-4. Trade 4 BRICK for another resource (SHEEP, WOOD, WHEAT, or ORE)

## Decision Process

First, I need to determine if making a trade is worthwhile. Since I have 4 BRICK and cannot use it directly for my next strategic moves (city building requires ORE+WHEAT), trading makes sense.

Which resource to acquire?
- WHEAT: Critical for city upgrades (need 2 for a city) and development cards
- WOOD: Needed for expansion (settlements and roads)
- SHEEP: Only needed for development cards
- ORE: I already have 3, and need 3 for a city

Based on my plan to build a city (needing 3 ORE + 2 WHEAT), and having 0 WHEAT currently, acquiring WHEAT through trade is most aligned with my strategy.

By trading for WHEAT, I'll be one step closer to upgrading a settlement to a city, which would give me an additional VP.

<plan>
1. Trade BRICK for WHEAT to work toward city building
2. Continue collecting resources for a city upgrade (need 1 more WHEAT)
3. Target upgrading the settlement at node 1 first (has high-probability numbers)
4. Look for opportunities to break RED's longest road through strategic road building
5. Consider development cards if I collect sheep
</plan>

Therefore, I choose to trade 4 BRICK for 1 WHEAT:

# Analyzing Robber Movement Options

Let me evaluate each option carefully, considering how each move impacts both my position and my opponent's position:

## Option Analysis

**[0] Move robber to (0, 0, 0) and steal from RED**
- This targets a brick hex with a '5' value (good probability)
- RED has a settlement at node 4 that produces from this hex
- I also have a settlement at node 1 that produces from this hex
- Blocking this would hurt both RED and myself, reducing my brick income which is needed for roads

**[1] Move robber to (1, -1, 0) and steal from RED**
- This targets a wheat hex with a '10' value (average probability)
- RED has a settlement at node 9 that produces from this hex
- I also have a settlement at node 1 that produces from this hex
- Blocking this would reduce both my wheat and RED's wheat production

**[2] Move robber to (0, -1, 1) and steal from RED**
- This targets a sheep hex with a '9' value (good probability)
- RED has a settlement at node 9 that produces from this hex
- I don't produce sheep currently
- Good option to block RED without affecting my own production

**[3] Move robber to (-1, 0, 1) and steal from RED**
- This targets a wheat hex with a '3' value (low probability)
- RED has a settlement at node 4 that produces from this hex
- I don't produce from this hex
- Low impact due to low probability number

**[4] Move robber to (-1, 1, 0) and steal from RED**
- This targets a wood hex with an '8' value (excellent probability)
- RED has settlements at nodes 4 and 17 producing from this hex
- I also have a settlement at node 16 that produces from this hex
- This would significantly impact both RED and myself, but especially RED who has two settlements here

**[5] Move robber to (0, 1, -1)**
- This targets a desert hex
- Has no production impact on anyone
- Doesn't allow stealing a card from RED
- Generally a wasted move

## Strategic Evaluation

Looking at RED's position:
- RED has 5 VP (including 2 from longest road)
- RED needs 5 more VP to win
- RED's main advantage is wood production with two settlements on the excellent wood hex

My current plan involves:
- Collecting resources for city upgrade (need wheat)
- Looking to break RED's longest road
- Currently have 1 wheat and 2 ore, need more wheat for city upgrade

## Decision

Option [4] is most strategically valuable because:
1. It targets RED's strongest resource production (wood on an 8)
2. RED has TWO settlements on this hex, making it a critical source of wood
3. Wood is essential for RED to extend their road network further
4. While it affects my wood production as well, the impact on RED is much greater (hits two settlements)
5. Stealing a card from RED could give me a valuable resource
6. RED has 4 cards, so good chance of getting something useful

While this does hurt my wood production, the benefit of hampering RED's strong wood income outweighs the cost to me, especially since RED is already ahead at 5 VP vs my 2 VP.

<plan>
1. Block RED's strong wood production to slow their progress
2. Continue collecting wheat and ore for city upgrade
3. Watch for opportunities to extend roads to break RED's longest road
4. Consider development cards if I collect sheep in future turns
</plan>

\boxed{4}
========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL SETTLEMENT PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Place settlements on high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Target at least one spot with good ore and wheat production for city development
- Try to secure at least one high-probability spot (5, 6, 8, 9) for each critical resource
- Place your second settlement to complement your first (fill resource gaps)
- Aim for access to all five resources or position near useful ports if resource diversity isn't possible
- Always consider which settlements opponents are likely to place and avoid areas that will become contested
- Place roads pointing toward valuable future expansion spots, not toward the center
- Consider the long-term impact: settlements that can't expand are less valuable

MID-GAME RESOURCE PRIORITIES:
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each possible build (cities: 1VP for 5 resources is most efficient)
- Early phase: Secure at least one good source of brick and wood for minimal expansion
- Growth phase: Prioritize ore and wheat production for city upgrades (3VP for 5 resources is optimal)
- Late phase: Focus on the fastest path to victory points, whether through buildings or development cards
- Avoid trading resources that opponents need for immediate victory point gains
- Use 4:1 trades only when necessary; prioritize port usage when possible

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and limited expansion options
- If you get an early knight, save it for defense or until you can start building toward largest army
- Time monopoly card usage for when opponents likely have accumulated specific resources
- Save year of plenty cards for completing crucial builds when you're short 1-2 specific resources
- Development cards are most valuable when:
  * You need hidden victory points to surprise opponents
  * You need knights to break up longest road or secure largest army
  * You're lacking wood/brick for expansion but have plenty of sheep/wheat/ore

EXPANSION STRATEGY:
- Build roads only with clear settlement locations in mind
- Target settlements that give you access to ports or new resources
- Block opponents' expansion paths when it gives you a strategic advantage
- Consider the timing of expansion vs. city upgrades based on your resource production
- Calculate whether longest road is achievable and worth the resource investment
- When deciding between a new settlement and a city upgrade, compare immediate vs. long-term returns

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-probability hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Save knight cards for breaking up opponent strategies or securing largest army
- Use knights defensively if you're producing valuable resources on high-probability hexes

TRADING TACTICS:
- Avoid trading resources that directly help opponents score points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades
- Trade excess resources before rolling 7 if you have more than 7 cards
- Consider bank/port trades when they enable an immediate build that advances your strategy
- When trading with players, try to receive resources that complete a build

ENDGAME STRATEGY:
- In the late game, hide your victory point potential (keep development cards hidden)
- Calculate the fastest path to 10 VP and focus exclusively on that path
- Be aware of the exact number of remaining development cards and their probabilities
- Track opponents' potential victory points, including hidden development cards
- If you're close to winning, prioritize actions that can be completed in a single turn

Before finalizing your action, check:
1. Is there a more efficient path to victory points?
2. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
3. Does this move help or hinder opponents?
4. Is there a defensive move needed to prevent an opponent from winning?
5. Are you properly diversified against dice probability?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 86 | Player: BLUE | Action: MOVE_ROBBER

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Block RED's strong wood production to slow their progress
2. Continue collecting wheat and ore for city upgrade
3. Watch for opportunities to extend roads to break RED's longest road
4. Consider development cards if I collect sheep in future turns
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.

# Analyzing Robber Placement Options

Let me analyze each possible robber placement option strategically:

## Current Game State Assessment
- I have 2 VP, RED has 5 VP (including 2 VP for Longest Road)
- RED is halfway to victory and currently has the advantage
- I have only 1 wheat and 2 ore, which limits my immediate building options
- RED has 4 hidden resources

## Robber Placement Options Analysis:

**[0] Move robber to (0, 0, 0) [Brick 5] and steal from RED**
- This blocks a 5 (good probability) brick hex
- Both RED and I have settlements here, so it hurts both of us
- RED has a settlement at node 4 producing this brick

**[1] Move robber to (1, -1, 0) [Wheat 10] and steal from RED**
- This blocks a 10 (moderate probability) wheat hex
- Both RED and I have settlements here, so it hurts both of us
- I need wheat for development cards and city upgrades

**[2] Move robber to (0, -1, 1) [Sheep 9] and steal from RED**
- This blocks a 9 (good probability) sheep hex
- Only RED has a settlement here (node 9), so it only hurts RED
- Sheep is useful for development cards

**[3] Move robber to (-1, 0, 1) [Wheat 3] and steal from RED**
- This blocks a 3 (low probability) wheat hex
- Only RED has a settlement here, so it only hurts RED
- But the impact is minimal due to the low probability

**[4] Move robber to (-1, 1, 0) [Wood 8] and steal from RED**
- This blocks an 8 (high probability) wood hex
- Both RED and I have settlements here
- RED has TWO settlements on this hex (nodes 4 and 17), making it their strongest production
- This would significantly impact RED's wood production (critical for road building)

**[5] Move robber to (0, 1, -1) [Desert]**
- This places the robber on the desert, which produces nothing
- This option makes no strategic sense

## Strategic Decision:
Looking at RED's position, they have 5 VP with Longest Road and 3 settlements. They're collecting wood at a high rate from the 8 wood hex with two settlements. Blocking this resource would:
1. Significantly slow RED's road and settlement expansion
2. Give me a chance to steal a wood resource
3. Align with my plan to slow RED's progress and potentially break their longest road

While option [0] affects a good probability hex (5), it hurts me too. Option [4] targets RED's strongest production with minimal impact to my own strategy.

<plan>
1. Block RED's strong wood production (8) to significantly slow their progress
2. Continue collecting wheat and ore for city upgrade 
3. Watch for opportunities to extend roads to break RED's longest road
4. Consider development cards if I collect sheep in future turns
</plan>

After careful analysis, I'll place the robber on the high-probability wood hex that RED has double production on:

Based on this information, which action number do you choose? Think step by step about your options, then put the final action number in a box like \boxed{1}.
RESPONSE:
I need to carefully analyze where to move the robber to most effectively hinder my opponent while advancing my strategy.

First, let me examine the board and each robber placement option:

Option 0: Move to (0, 0, 0) - Brick hex with value 5
- This blocks RED's settlement at node 4 (which produces 🧱5)
- Also blocks my own settlement at node 1 (which also produces 🧱5)
- Not ideal as it hurts me as much as RED

Option 1: Move to (1, -1, 0) - Wheat hex with value 10
- Blocks RED's settlement at node 9 (which produces 🌾10)
- Also blocks my settlement at node 1 (which produces 🌾10)
- Not ideal since I need wheat for city upgrades

Option 2: Move to (0, -1, 1) - Sheep hex with value 9
- Blocks RED's settlement at node 9 (which produces 🐑9)
- I don't have sheep production, so this doesn't hurt me
- Moderate impact on RED

Option 3: Move to (-1, 0, 1) - Wheat hex with value 3
- Blocks RED's settlement at node 4 (which produces 🌾3)
- Low impact since wheat 3 is a low probability
- I don't have wheat 3, so it doesn't hurt me

Option 4: Move to (0, 1, -1) - Desert hex
- This has no impact as desert produces no resources
- Completely ineffective choice

Option 5: Move to (1, 0, -1) - Ore hex with value 4
- Blocks my settlement at node 1 (which produces ⛏️4)
- Doesn't block any of RED's production
- Hurts me without hurting RED, very poor choice

Looking at the game state:
- RED has 5 VP (including 2 for Longest Road) and needs 5 more to win
- I have 2 VP and need 8 more to win
- RED is significantly ahead, so I need to slow them down
- My current plan focuses on city upgrades (need wheat and ore)
- I currently have 2 wheat and 3 ore, working toward a city

Based on my analysis, I should:
1. Avoid options that hurt my wheat or ore production (options 1 and 5)
2. Avoid the desert which has no impact (option 4)
3. Target RED's most valuable production

Option 2 (sheep hex with value 9) is reasonable but not RED's most critical resource.

Right now, RED has two settlements on the wood hex with value 8, which is an excellent production spot (high probability). According to my current plan, I want to "Block RED's strong wood production (8) to significantly slow their progress". The robber is already there at (-1, 1, 0), but since this is a MOVE_ROBBER action, I need to choose a new location.

Since I can't keep the robber where it is, I should target RED's next best production spot.

Looking at RED's settlements:
- Node 4: 🧱5, 🌾3, 🌲8
- Node 9: 🌾10, 🐑9
- Node 17: 🌲8

I can't block the wood 8 hex again (it's the current robber location), so I should consider blocking either the brick 5 (useful for roads) or the wheat 10/sheep 9 (useful for development cards and settlements).

Option 2 (sheep 9) seems strong because:
- It blocks a good probability number (9)
- Sheep is valuable to RED for development cards
- I don't have sheep production so it doesn't hurt me
- I get to steal a card from RED

PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL SETTLEMENT PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Place settlements on high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Target at least one spot with good ore and wheat production for city development
- Try to secure at least one high-probability spot (5, 6, 8, 9) for each critical resource
- Place your second settlement to complement your first (fill resource gaps)
- Aim for access to all five resources or position near useful ports if resource diversity isn't possible
- Always consider which settlements opponents are likely to place and avoid areas that will become contested
- Place roads pointing toward valuable future expansion spots, not toward the center
- Consider the long-term impact: settlements that can't expand are less valuable

MID-GAME RESOURCE PRIORITIES:
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each possible build (cities: 1VP for 5 resources is most efficient)
- Early phase: Secure at least one good source of brick and wood for minimal expansion
- Growth phase: Prioritize ore and wheat production for city upgrades (3VP for 5 resources is optimal)
- Late phase: Focus on the fastest path to victory points, whether through buildings or development cards
- Avoid trading resources that opponents need for immediate victory point gains
- Use 4:1 trades only when necessary; prioritize port usage when possible

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and limited expansion options
- If you get an early knight, save it for defense or until you can start building toward largest army
- Time monopoly card usage for when opponents likely have accumulated specific resources
- Save year of plenty cards for completing crucial builds when you're short 1-2 specific resources
- Development cards are most valuable when:
  * You need hidden victory points to surprise opponents
  * You need knights to break up longest road or secure largest army
  * You're lacking wood/brick for expansion but have plenty of sheep/wheat/ore

EXPANSION STRATEGY:
- Build roads only with clear settlement locations in mind
- Target settlements that give you access to ports or new resources
- Block opponents' expansion paths when it gives you a strategic advantage
- Consider the timing of expansion vs. city upgrades based on your resource production
- Calculate whether longest road is achievable and worth the resource investment
- When deciding between a new settlement and a city upgrade, compare immediate vs. long-term returns

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-probability hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Save knight cards for breaking up opponent strategies or securing largest army
- Use knights defensively if you're producing valuable resources on high-probability hexes

TRADING TACTICS:
- Avoid trading resources that directly help opponents score points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades
- Trade excess resources before rolling 7 if you have more than 7 cards
- Consider bank/port trades when they enable an immediate build that advances your strategy
- When trading with players, try to receive resources that complete a build

ENDGAME STRATEGY:
- In the late game, hide your victory point potential (keep development cards hidden)
- Calculate the fastest path to 10 VP and focus exclusively on that path
- Be aware of the exact number of remaining development cards and their probabilities
- Track opponents' potential victory points, including hidden development cards
- If you're close to winning, prioritize actions that can be completed in a single turn

# Game Analysis for Turn 88

I'll analyze the current game state and available options to determine the optimal move.

## Current Game State Assessment
- I (BLUE) have 2 VP from my 2 settlements
- RED has 5 VP (3 from settlements + 2 from longest road)
- My resources: 1 🧱BRICK, 2 🌾WHEAT, 3 ⛏️ORE
- The robber is currently on a sheep hex (0, -1, 1)

## Available Actions
0. End turn (no builds)
1. Upgrade settlement at node 1 to city (Cost: 2 🌾WHEAT, 3 ⛏️ORE)
2. Upgrade settlement at node 16 to city (Cost: 2 🌾WHEAT, 3 ⛏️ORE)

## Resource Analysis
I have exactly enough resources (2 🌾WHEAT, 3 ⛏️ORE) to build one city. This is a perfect opportunity to use my resources efficiently.

## Strategic Options Analysis

### Option 1: Upgrade settlement at node 1
- Node 1 produces 🧱5[⭐⭐], 🌾10[⭐], ⛏️4[⭐]
- This would double my production of brick, wheat, and ore
- Brick is useful for roads but I already have 13 roads built
- Wheat and ore are crucial for further city upgrades and development cards

### Option 2: Upgrade settlement at node 16
- Node 16 produces 🌲8[⭐⭐⭐]
- This would double my wood production on a high probability number (8)
- Wood is useful for expansion (roads and settlements)

### Victory Point Impact
Either option increases my VP from 2 to 3, still trailing RED's 5 VP.

## Decision Analysis
1. Upgrading node 1 gives me better resource diversity and doubles production of critical city-building resources (wheat and ore)
2. RED is ahead with 5 VP, so I need to accelerate my city development
3. Node 1 produces on three different numbers (4, 5, 10) which improves odds of getting resources each turn
4. Having stronger wheat and ore production aligns with mid-game strategy of city development

<plan>
1. Upgrade settlement at node 1 to a city to double wheat and ore production
2. Continue collecting resources for another city upgrade or development cards
3. Look for opportunities to break RED's longest road by strategic road building
4. Consider targeting RED's key resource production with robber on future rolls
</plan>

The optimal move is to upgrade my settlement at node 1 to a city, which will increase my resource production diversity and focus on the critical wheat and ore needed for further city upgrades.

# Game Analysis: Move Robber Decision

Let me analyze each robber placement option and determine the optimal move for my current situation.

## Current Game State
- I (BLUE) have 3 VP from 1 settlement and 1 city
- RED has 5 VP (3 settlements + 2 for longest road)
- RED is ahead of me by 2 VP
- I only have 1 brick resource

## Robber Placement Options

### Option Analysis
Let me assess each option based on:
1. Impact on RED's production
2. Strategic value of the tile
3. Probability of the number being rolled

**[0] Move robber to (0, 0, 0) and steal from RED**
- This is the brick (🧱5) hex
- RED has a settlement at node 4 producing from this hex
- Probability of 5: 4/36 (medium-high)
- This would block a key brick source for RED

**[1] Move robber to (1, -1, 0) and steal from RED**
- This is the wheat (🌾10) hex
- RED has a settlement at node 9 producing from this hex
- Probability of 10: 3/36 (medium)
- This would block wheat production for RED

**[2] Move robber to (-1, 0, 1) and steal from RED**
- This is the wheat (🌾3) hex
- RED has a settlement at node 4 producing from this hex
- Probability of 3: 2/36 (low)
- Not very impactful due to low probability

**[3] Move robber to (-1, 1, 0) and steal from RED**
- This is the wood (🌲8) hex
- RED has settlements at nodes 4 and 17 producing from this hex
- Probability of 8: 5/36 (high)
- This would significantly impact RED's wood production

**[4] Move robber to (0, 1, -1)**
- This is the desert (🏜️) hex
- No production to block
- No benefit to placing here

**[5] Move robber to (1, 0, -1)**
- This is the ore (⛏️4) hex
- I have a city at node 1 producing from this hex
- Probability of 4: 3/36 (medium)
- This would hurt my own production with no impact on RED

## Strategic Decision

RED has the longest road (6 segments) and 5 VP total. To slow RED down, I should target their high-probability resources.

Option [3] is the most impactful because:
1. It blocks a high-probability wood (8) hex
2. It affects TWO of RED's settlements
3. Wood is critical for RED to continue expanding their road network
4. The hex has 5/36 probability, the highest of all options

<plan>
1. Block RED's wood production to slow down their road expansion
2. Continue collecting resources for another city upgrade or development cards
3. Look for opportunities to break RED's longest road by strategic road building
4. Aim to secure largest army through development cards if possible

# Game Analysis for Turn 94

I'll analyze the current game state and make the optimal decision for BLUE player.

## Current Situation
- BLUE has 3 VP (1 settlement + 1 city)
- RED has 5 VP (3 settlements + longest road bonus)
- BLUE has 5 🧱, 1 🌾, 2 ⛏️ as resources
- RED is leading with 5 VP vs. BLUE's 3 VP
- Robber is already on RED's wood production (🌲8)

## Resource Assessment
My current resources (5 🧱, 1 🌾, 2 ⛏️) aren't enough to build any significant structure:
- Settlement requires 1 🧱, 1 🌾, 1 🐑, 1 🌲 (missing 🐑 and 🌲)
- City requires 2 🌾, 3 ⛏️ (missing 1 🌾, 1 ⛏️)
- Development card requires 1 🐑, 1 🌾, 1 ⛏️ (missing 🐑)

## Strategic Options
1. **End turn (option 0)**: Save resources for future builds
2. **Trade** 4 brick for another resource (options 1-4):
   - For 🐑: Could help toward a settlement
   - For 🌲: Could help toward a settlement
   - For 🌾: Would have 2 🌾, still not enough for a city
   - For ⛏️: Would have 3 ⛏️, could be combined with 🌾 later for a city

## Decision Logic
- Trading brick is inefficient at 4:1, but I have excess brick (5)
- I need to catch up to RED who has 2 VP lead
- To build a settlement, I'd need to trade for both 🐑 and 🌲
- The robber is already blocking RED's wood production, so that part of my plan is addressed
- I should conserve my resources for a more efficient build on a future turn

Looking at the available options and considering the inefficiency of a 4:1 trade when I would still be lacking resources for any build, the most strategic choice is to end my turn and wait to collect more favorable resources through dice rolls.

<plan>
1. End turn to avoid inefficient 4:1 trades
2. Continue collecting resources for a city upgrade (need more wheat and ore)
3. Consider development card strategy if I collect sheep and wheat
4. Look for opportunities to break RED's longest road with my roads
5. Continue defensive robber placement on RED's high-production hexes
</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL SETTLEMENT PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Place settlements on high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Target at least one spot with good ore and wheat production for city development
- Try to secure at least one high-probability spot (5, 6, 8, 9) for each critical resource
- Place your second settlement to complement your first (fill resource gaps)
- Aim for access to all five resources or position near useful ports if resource diversity isn't possible
- Always consider which settlements opponents are likely to place and avoid areas that will become contested
- Place roads pointing toward valuable future expansion spots, not toward the center
- Consider the long-term impact: settlements that can't expand are less valuable

MID-GAME RESOURCE PRIORITIES:
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each possible build (cities: 1VP for 5 resources is most efficient)
- Early phase: Secure at least one good source of brick and wood for minimal expansion
- Growth phase: Prioritize ore and wheat production for city upgrades (3VP for 5 resources is optimal)
- Late phase: Focus on the fastest path to victory points, whether through buildings or development cards
- Avoid trading resources that opponents need for immediate victory point gains
- Use 4:1 trades only when necessary; prioritize port usage when possible

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and limited expansion options
- If you get an early knight, save it for defense or until you can start building toward largest army
- Time monopoly card usage for when opponents likely have accumulated specific resources
- Save year of plenty cards for completing crucial builds when you're short 1-2 specific resources
- Development cards are most valuable when:
  * You need hidden victory points to surprise opponents
  * You need knights to break up longest road or secure largest army
  * You're lacking wood/brick for expansion but have plenty of sheep/wheat/ore

EXPANSION STRATEGY:
- Build roads only with clear settlement locations in mind
- Target settlements that give you access to ports or new resources
- Block opponents' expansion paths when it gives you a strategic advantage
- Consider the timing of expansion vs. city upgrades based on your resource production
- Calculate whether longest road is achievable and worth the resource investment
- When deciding between a new settlement and a city upgrade, compare immediate vs. long-term returns

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-probability hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Save knight cards for breaking up opponent strategies or securing largest army
- Use knights defensively if you're producing valuable resources on high-probability hexes

TRADING TACTICS:
- Avoid trading resources that directly help opponents score points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades
- Trade excess resources before rolling 7 if you have more than 7 cards
- Consider bank/port trades when they enable an immediate build that advances your strategy
- When trading with players, try to receive resources that complete a build

ENDGAME STRATEGY:
- In the late game, hide your victory point potential (keep development cards hidden)
- Calculate the fastest path to 10 VP and focus exclusively on that path
- Be aware of the exact number of remaining development cards and their probabilities
- Track opponents' potential victory points, including hidden development cards
- If you're close to winning, prioritize actions that can be completed in a single turn

Before finalizing your action, check:
1. Is there a more efficient path to victory points?
2. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
3. Does this move help or hinder opponents?
4. Is there a defensive move needed to prevent an opponent from winning?
5. Are you properly diversified against dice probability?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game Analysis for Settlers of Catan

Let me analyze the current game state and available options carefully.

## Current Game State
- I have 3 VP (1 city + 1 settlement)
- RED has 5 VP (3 settlements + Longest Road bonus)
- I have 7 BRICK, 1 WHEAT, 2 ORE
- RED has 5 hidden cards
- The robber is on a WOOD hex with value 8

## Resource Analysis
I'm lacking SHEEP and WOOD resources at the moment. My settlement produces WOOD on an 8, but the robber is currently blocking that production. I have a city producing BRICK (5), WHEAT (10), and ORE (4).

## Available Options
1. End turn
2. Trade 4 BRICK for 1 SHEEP
3. Trade 4 BRICK for 1 WOOD
4. Trade 4 BRICK for 1 WHEAT
5. Trade 4 BRICK for 1 ORE

## What Can I Build With My Resources?
- Currently I have 7 BRICK, 1 WHEAT, 2 ORE
- For a settlement: Need 1 BRICK, 1 WOOD, 1 WHEAT, 1 SHEEP (missing WOOD and SHEEP)
- For a city upgrade: Need 2 WHEAT, 3 ORE (missing 1 WHEAT, 1 ORE)
- For a development card: Need 1 SHEEP, 1 WHEAT, 1 ORE (missing SHEEP)
- For a road: Need 1 BRICK, 1 WOOD (missing WOOD)

## Strategic Evaluation
The most efficient path to victory points would be upgrading my remaining settlement to a city (which costs 2 WHEAT, 3 ORE). I need 1 more WHEAT and 1 more ORE to do this.

Trading 4 BRICK for 1 WHEAT would give me enough WHEAT for a city upgrade, but I'd still be short on ORE. Trading 4 BRICK for 1 ORE would give me enough ORE, but I'd still be short on WHEAT.

Since I don't need both right now, and 4:1 trades are highly inefficient, making either trade would waste resources. It's better to wait until I collect more resources naturally, especially since I can produce both WHEAT and ORE.

RED is currently at 5 VP, so they're ahead, but not immediately threatening to win. I should play defensively but also focus on my own development.

<plan>
1. End turn to avoid inefficient 4:1 trades
2. Continue collecting resources for a city upgrade (need more wheat and ore)
3. Consider development card strategy when I collect sheep
4. Look for opportunities to break RED's longest road with strategic road placements
5. Continue defensive robber placement on RED's high-production hexes when possible
</plan>

Since none of the available trades provide immediate significant advantage and would require inefficient 4:1 exchanges, the most strategic move is to end my turn and wait for better resource opportunities.

# Analysis of Robber Placement Options

Let me analyze each robber placement option carefully to determine the most strategic move:

## Game State Assessment
- I have 3 VP (1 settlement, 1 city, roads)
- RED has 5 VP (3 settlements + longest road bonus) and is ahead
- I have limited resources (2 brick, 1 ore)
- RED has 4 hidden resource cards

## Robber Placement Options Analysis:

**[0] Move robber to (0, 0, 0) - Brick hex with value 5**
- This targets RED's settlement at node 4
- Brick is fairly valuable in the early-mid game
- This is a high probability roll (5 = ⭐⭐)
- BUT: This would also block my own city at node 1, which also produces brick on this hex
- Self-blocking my own high productivity city would be counterproductive

**[1] Move robber to (0, -1, 1) - Sheep hex with value 9**
- This targets RED's settlement at node 9
- Sheep isn't typically a critical resource in the mid-game
- This is a good probability roll (9 = ⭐⭐)
- I don't have any settlements on this hex, so no self-blocking

**[2] Move robber to (-1, 0, 1) - Wheat hex with value 3**
- This targets RED's settlement at node 4
- Wheat is important for cities (which I need)
- This is a low probability roll (3 = ⭐), making it less impactful
- I don't have any settlements on this hex, so no self-blocking

**[3] Move robber to (-1, 1, 0) - Wood hex with value 8**
- This targets RED's settlements at nodes 4 AND 17
- Impacts TWO of RED's settlements
- Wood is critical for expansion
- This is a high probability roll (8 = ⭐⭐⭐)
- It blocks RED's highly productive wood resource (two ⭐⭐⭐ settlements)
- I have a settlement at node 16 that would be affected, but limiting RED's production is more important

**[4] Move robber to (0, 1, -1) - Desert hex**
- This is a desert tile with no production
- Placing robber here would have no effect on resource production
- This would be a wasted move

**[5] Move robber to (1, 0, -1) - Ore hex with value 4**
- This doesn't target any of RED's settlements
- Ore is important for cities
- This is a low probability roll (4 = ⭐)
- It would block my own city at node 1
- This would be counterproductive

## Strategic Decision:

Option [3] offers the most strategic advantage:
- Blocks a high-probability resource (8 = ⭐⭐⭐)
- Affects TWO of RED's settlements simultaneously
- Targets wood which is critical for RED to expand their road network
- Even though it impacts my settlement at node 16, limiting RED's production and expansion potential is more important strategically
- Slowing RED's road expansion is crucial as they already have longest road

<plan>
1. Place robber on hex (-1, 1, 0) to limit RED's wood production from two settlements
2. Use my brick and ore efficiently for my next builds when I get more resources

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL SETTLEMENT PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Place settlements on high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Target at least one spot with good ore and wheat production for city development
- Try to secure at least one high-probability spot (5, 6, 8, 9) for each critical resource
- Place your second settlement to complement your first (fill resource gaps)
- Aim for access to all five resources or position near useful ports if resource diversity isn't possible
- Always consider which settlements opponents are likely to place and avoid areas that will become contested
- Place roads pointing toward valuable future expansion spots, not toward the center
- Consider the long-term impact: settlements that can't expand are less valuable

MID-GAME RESOURCE PRIORITIES:
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each possible build (cities: 1VP for 5 resources is most efficient)
- Early phase: Secure at least one good source of brick and wood for minimal expansion
- Growth phase: Prioritize ore and wheat production for city upgrades (3VP for 5 resources is optimal)
- Late phase: Focus on the fastest path to victory points, whether through buildings or development cards
- Avoid trading resources that opponents need for immediate victory point gains
- Use 4:1 trades only when necessary; prioritize port usage when possible

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and limited expansion options
- If you get an early knight, save it for defense or until you can start building toward largest army
- Time monopoly card usage for when opponents likely have accumulated specific resources
- Save year of plenty cards for completing crucial builds when you're short 1-2 specific resources
- Development cards are most valuable when:
  * You need hidden victory points to surprise opponents
  * You need knights to break up longest road or secure largest army
  * You're lacking wood/brick for expansion but have plenty of sheep/wheat/ore

EXPANSION STRATEGY:
- Build roads only with clear settlement locations in mind
- Target settlements that give you access to ports or new resources
- Block opponents' expansion paths when it gives you a strategic advantage
- Consider the timing of expansion vs. city upgrades based on your resource production
- Calculate whether longest road is achievable and worth the resource investment
- When deciding between a new settlement and a city upgrade, compare immediate vs. long-term returns

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-probability hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Save knight cards for breaking up opponent strategies or securing largest army
- Use knights defensively if you're producing valuable resources on high-probability hexes

TRADING TACTICS:
- Avoid trading resources that directly help opponents score points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades
- Trade excess resources before rolling 7 if you have more than 7 cards
- Consider bank/port trades when they enable an immediate build that advances your strategy
- When trading with players, try to receive resources that complete a build

ENDGAME STRATEGY:
- In the late game, hide your victory point potential (keep development cards hidden)
- Calculate the fastest path to 10 VP and focus exclusively on that path
- Be aware of the exact number of remaining development cards and their probabilities
- Track opponents' potential victory points, including hidden development cards
- If you're close to winning, prioritize actions that can be completed in a single turn

Before finalizing your action, check:
1. Is there a more efficient path to victory points?
2. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
3. Does this move help or hinder opponents?
4. Is there a defensive move needed to prevent an opponent from winning?
5. Are you properly diversified against dice probability?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 102 | Player: BLUE | Action: MOVE_ROBBER

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Place robber on hex (-1, 1, 0) to limit RED's wood production from two settlements
2. Use my brick and ore efficiently for my next builds when I get more resources
3. Look for opportunities to break RED's longest road with strategic road placements
4. Focus on city upgrades when I collect more wheat and ore
5. Consider development card strategy when I collect sheep

# Game Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state and available options for moving the robber:

## Victory Point Status
- I (BLUE) have 3/10 VP
- RED has 5/10 VP (including +2 from Longest Road)
- RED is ahead by 2 VP and closer to winning

## My Resources
- 3 Brick, 1 Ore
- Not enough for any immediate builds

## Robber Placement Options
- [0] Move to 🧱5 (0, 0, 0) - Affects both RED and me
- [1] Move to 🌾10 (1, -1, 0) - Affects RED's settlement at node 9
- [2] Move to 🐑9 (0, -1, 1) - Affects RED's settlement at node 9
- [3] Move to 🌾3 (-1, 0, 1) - Affects RED's settlement at node 4
- [4] Move to 🏜️- (0, 1, -1) - Desert, no production to block
- [5] Move to ⛏️4 (1, 0, -1) - Affects my city at node 1

## Strategic Considerations:
1. The robber is currently on 🌲8 (-1, 1, 0), which blocks RED's settlements at nodes 4 and 17
2. Moving the robber to another high-probability resource would maximize disruption
3. I should avoid blocking my own production
4. Stealing a resource from RED is valuable

Let me evaluate each option:

- Option [0]: Blocks 🧱5, affecting RED's settlement but also my city
- Option [1]: Blocks 🌾10, affecting RED's settlement at node 9
- Option [2]: Blocks 🐑9, affecting RED's settlement at node 9
- Option [3]: Blocks 🌾3, affecting RED's settlement at node 4
- Option [4]: No production to block on desert
- Option [5]: Would block my own production at node 1, not strategic

The current robber is on 🌲8, which blocks a strong production hex for RED (two settlements produce there). Moving it would allow RED to potentially produce wood again, which isn't ideal.

However, I need to move the robber. Looking at RED's production:
- Node 4: 🧱5[⭐⭐], 🌾3[⭐], 🌲8[⭐⭐⭐]
- Node 9: 🌾10[⭐], 🐑9[⭐⭐]
- Node 17: 🌲8[⭐⭐⭐]

Option [2] blocks 🐑9, which has a good probability (⭐⭐) and only affects RED. This seems like a good choice since sheep might help RED get development cards.

<plan>
1. Move robber to 🐑9 (0, -1, 1) to limit RED's sheep production
2. Continue focusing on collecting resources for city upgrades (wheat and ore)
3. Look for opportunities to break RED's longest road
4. Use my brick resources efficiently when I get wood
5. Continue developing toward additional settlements
</plan>

I'll move the robber to the sheep hex with probability 9, which will disrupt RED's resource collection and allow me to steal a card.

# Game Analysis: Move Robber Decision

I need to decide where to place the robber to maximize my strategic advantage while hindering RED, who is leading with 5 VP.

## Game State Assessment
- I (BLUE) have 3 VP: 1 settlement (1 VP) + 1 city (2 VP)
- RED has 5 VP: 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP)
- RED is 2 VP ahead and has longest road with 6 segments (same as my longest)
- I have 1 🧱 BRICK, 2 🌾 WHEAT, 2 ⛏️ ORE

## Analyzing Robber Placement Options

Let me evaluate each option systematically:

**[0] Move robber to (0, 0, 0) and steal from RED**
- This is the 🧱5 hex
- Blocks RED's settlement at node 4
- Blocks my own city at node 1
- This would hurt my production more than RED's

**[1] Move robber to (1, -1, 0) and steal from RED**
- This is the 🌾10 hex
- Blocks RED's settlement at node 9
- Blocks my own city at node 1
- Again, would hurt my production more than RED's

**[2] Move robber to (-1, 0, 1) and steal from RED**
- This is the 🌾3 hex
- Blocks RED's settlement at node 4
- Low probability number (3), so minimal impact

**[3] Move robber to (-1, 1, 0) and steal from RED**
- This is the 🌲8 hex
- Blocks RED's settlements at nodes 4 and 17
- Also blocks my settlement at node 16
- High impact (8 is a high-probability number)
- This would severely limit both RED and my wood production

**[4] Move robber to (0, 1, -1)**
- This is the 🏜️ desert hex
- No production impact
- Wastes the robber move

**[5] Move robber to (1, 0, -1) and steal from RED**
- This is the ⛏️4 hex
- Blocks my city at node 1
- Low probability number (4), so minimal impact
- Would hurt me more than RED

## Strategic Considerations

1. RED has two settlements on the 🌲8 hex, making it their strongest production
2. I need to slow RED's progress while maintaining my own resource generation
3. Stealing from RED could give me a valuable resource
4. Wood is critical for RED to continue expanding their road network

## Optimal Decision

Option [3] provides the most strategic advantage:
- Blocks 🌲8, a high-probability hex where RED has two settlements
- Significantly limits RED's wood production needed for expansion
- While it affects my wood production too, the impact on RED is greater (2 settlements vs my 1)
- I get to steal a card from RED, potentially gaining a resource I need
- This move could slow RED's ability to extend their longest road further

<plan>
1. Move robber to 🌲8 (-1, 1, 0) to limit RED's wood production 
2. Focus on city upgrades with my wheat and ore
3. Monitor RED's resources and development
4. When I get wood, use my brick efficiently to build roads toward potential settlement locations
5. Consider buying development cards for potential knights to break RED's longest road

# Game Analysis for Settlers of Catan

Let me analyze the current game state and available options:

## Current Game State
- I (BLUE) have 3 victory points (1 city + 1 settlement)
- RED has 5 victory points (3 settlements + longest road bonus)
- RED is ahead by 2 points
- The robber is already on 🌲8, limiting RED's wood production

## My Resources
- 1 🧱 BRICK
- 1 🐑 SHEEP
- 2 🌾 WHEAT
- 2 ⛏️ ORE

## Available Actions
- [0] End turn
- [1] Buy development card (1 🐑SHEEP, 1 🌾WHEAT, 1 ⛏️ORE)

## Strategic Considerations
1. **Development Card Option**:
   - Buying a development card would use all my resources except brick
   - Potential benefits:
     - 20% chance of victory point card (immediate hidden progress)
     - 60% chance of knight (helps toward largest army bonus)
     - 20% chance of progress card (year of plenty/monopoly/road building)
   - With RED at 5 VP and me at 3 VP, I need to make progress

2. **Ending Turn Option**:
   - If I end my turn, I keep all resources
   - This preserves my ability to build a road (1 brick needed) if I get wood
   - However, I'm making no immediate progress toward victory

3. **Risk Analysis**:
   - If I buy a development card and get a knight/progress card, I don't gain immediate VP
   - If I get a VP card, I make hidden progress
   - If I don't buy anything, I risk losing resources to a "7" roll
   - RED currently has the longest road, and I need to find ways to catch up

Given RED is at 5 VP and I'm at 3 VP, I need to be aggressive in my strategy. The development card could be a victory point, which would be valuable. It could also be a knight, which helps me work toward the largest army bonus (2 VP). Even progress cards would help my position.

<plan>
1. Buy development cards to work toward largest army and potential hidden victory points
2. Continue monitoring RED's resources and development
3. Use brick efficiently when I get wood to build roads toward potential settlement locations
4. Consider breaking RED's longest road if opportunity arises
5. Focus on city upgrades when I accumulate more wheat and ore
</plan>

Based on my analysis, buying a development card is my best option to make progress toward winning, even though it's somewhat of a gamble.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL SETTLEMENT PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Place settlements on high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Target at least one spot with good ore and wheat production for city development
- Try to secure at least one high-probability spot (5, 6, 8, 9) for each critical resource
- Place your second settlement to complement your first (fill resource gaps)
- Aim for access to all five resources or position near useful ports if resource diversity isn't possible
- Always consider which settlements opponents are likely to place and avoid areas that will become contested
- Place roads pointing toward valuable future expansion spots, not toward the center
- Consider the long-term impact: settlements that can't expand are less valuable

MID-GAME RESOURCE PRIORITIES:
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each possible build (cities: 1VP for 5 resources is most efficient)
- Early phase: Secure at least one good source of brick and wood for minimal expansion
- Growth phase: Prioritize ore and wheat production for city upgrades (3VP for 5 resources is optimal)
- Late phase: Focus on the fastest path to victory points, whether through buildings or development cards
- Avoid trading resources that opponents need for immediate victory point gains
- Use 4:1 trades only when necessary; prioritize port usage when possible

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and limited expansion options
- If you get an early knight, save it for defense or until you can start building toward largest army
- Time monopoly card usage for when opponents likely have accumulated specific resources
- Save year of plenty cards for completing crucial builds when you're short 1-2 specific resources
- Development cards are most valuable when:
  * You need hidden victory points to surprise opponents
  * You need knights to break up longest road or secure largest army
  * You're lacking wood/brick for expansion but have plenty of sheep/wheat/ore

EXPANSION STRATEGY:
- Build roads only with clear settlement locations in mind
- Target settlements that give you access to ports or new resources
- Block opponents' expansion paths when it gives you a strategic advantage
- Consider the timing of expansion vs. city upgrades based on your resource production
- Calculate whether longest road is achievable and worth the resource investment
- When deciding between a new settlement and a city upgrade, compare immediate vs. long-term returns

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-probability hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Save knight cards for breaking up opponent strategies or securing largest army
- Use knights defensively if you're producing valuable resources on high-probability hexes

TRADING TACTICS:
- Avoid trading resources that directly help opponents score points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades
- Trade excess resources before rolling 7 if you have more than 7 cards
- Consider bank/port trades when they enable an immediate build that advances your strategy
- When trading with players, try to receive resources that complete a build

ENDGAME STRATEGY:
- In the late game, hide your victory point potential (keep development cards hidden)
- Calculate the fastest path to 10 VP and focus exclusively on that path
- Be aware of the exact number of remaining development cards and their probabilities
- Track opponents' potential victory points, including hidden development cards
- If you're close to winning, prioritize actions that can be completed in a single turn

Before finalizing your action, check:
1. Is there a more efficient path to victory points?
2. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
3. Does this move help or hinder opponents?
4. Is there a defensive move needed to prevent an opponent from winning?
5. Are you properly diversified against dice probability?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state and available options:

## Current Game State
- I (BLUE) have 3/10 victory points
- RED has 5/10 victory points (including +2 from longest road)
- I have 1 BRICK, 1 WHEAT, 1 ORE
- I have 1 KNIGHT development card
- RED has 3 hidden resource cards
- The robber is on the 🌲8 hex, which is a high-probability resource

## Options Analysis
I have two options:

**[0] Play Knight card**:
- Move the robber from the 8-value wood hex
- Steal a resource from RED (who has 3 cards)
- This would be the first knight played, starting my progress toward largest army (need 3)
- Would protect my own 8-value wood production at node 16
- Could strategically place robber on RED's high-value hex

**[1] Roll the dice**:
- Take my normal turn
- But the robber is currently on the 8-value wood hex, blocking my settlement's production
- With only 3 resources (brick, wheat, ore), I can't build anything significant yet
- If I roll a 7, I could move the robber anyway, but that's only a 1/6 chance

## Strategic Considerations
1. Moving the robber off the 8-value wood hex unblocks an important production source for me
2. RED is ahead with 5/10 points, so disrupting their production is valuable
3. Playing the knight now starts progress toward largest army
4. I currently can't build anything useful with my resources, so rolling has limited upside

<plan>
1. Play the knight card to move robber off the 8-value wood hex
2. Place robber on high-value hex used by RED (either 5-value brick or 10-value wheat)
3. Continue monitoring RED's development and work toward securing largest army
4. Use future wood production to build roads toward potential settlement locations
5. Consider city upgrades when I accumulate more wheat and ore
</plan>

The most strategic action is to play the knight card. This unblocks my wood production while potentially disrupting RED's resource gathering. It also starts my progress toward largest army (worth 2 VPs).

# Analyzing Robber Placement Options

Let me thoroughly analyze the game state and each robber placement option to determine the optimal move.

## Game State Assessment
- I'm BLUE with 3VP, RED has 5VP (including 2VP from longest road)
- RED is ahead and needs 5 more VPs to win
- The robber is currently on the 8-value wood hex, which is hurting both RED and myself as we both have settlements there
- I have limited resources: 1 🧱BRICK, 1 🌾WHEAT, 1 ⛏️ORE

## Robber Placement Options Analysis

**[0] Move robber to (0, 0, 0) - 🧱5 Brick hex and steal from RED**
- This targets a 5-value brick hex which RED produces from (node 4)
- This would deny brick from RED (moderate probability hex)
- I also have a city at node 1 that produces brick from this hex, so I'd be hurting my own production
- IMPACT: Hurts both RED and myself, but more critical for RED who likely needs brick for expansion

**[1] Move robber to (1, -1, 0) - 🌾10 Wheat hex and steal from RED**
- This targets a 10-value wheat hex where RED has a settlement (node 9)
- This would deny wheat from RED (good probability hex)
- I also have a city at node 1 producing from this hex, so I'd be hurting my own production
- IMPACT: Hurts both RED and myself significantly for wheat production

**[2] Move robber to (0, -1, 1) - 🐑9 Sheep hex and steal from RED**
- This targets a 9-value sheep hex where RED has a settlement (node 9)
- Sheep are important for development cards but less critical for building
- IMPACT: Hurts RED without impacting my production

**[3] Move robber to (-1, 0, 1) - 🌾3 Wheat hex and steal from RED**
- This targets a 3-value wheat hex where RED has a settlement (node 4)
- Low probability number, so minimal impact on production
- IMPACT: Minimal impact on either player due to low probability

**[4] Move robber to (0, 1, -1) - 🏜️ Desert hex**
- This is the desert hex which produces no resources
- IMPACT: No impact on production for any player, wastes the robber move

**[5] Move robber to (1, 0, -1) - ⛏️4 Ore hex**
- This targets a 4-value ore hex where I have a city (node 1)
- No RED settlements on this hex
- IMPACT: Hurts my own ore production without affecting RED

## Strategic Considerations
1. By moving the robber off the 8-value wood hex, I'll restore my own wood production at node 16
2. RED has settlements at nodes 4, 9, and 17, so attacking those production sources is optimal
3. I want to maximize harm to RED's production while minimizing impact on my own
4. Stealing a card from RED could provide a valuable resource

## Decision
Option [2] is optimal because:
- It targets a high-probability (9-value) sheep hex that RED uses
- It doesn't impact any of my own production
- Sheep are valuable for development cards, which RED might need
- I can steal a card from RED in the process

<plan>
1. Move robber to sheep hex to block RED's production without hurting my own
2. Continue monitoring RED's development and work toward largest army
3. Use my newly unblocked wood production to build roads toward potential settlement locations
4. Consider city upgrades when I accumulate more wheat and ore
</plan>

   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL SETTLEMENT PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Place settlements on high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Target at least one spot with good ore and wheat production for city development
- Try to secure at least one high-probability spot (5, 6, 8, 9) for each critical resource
- Place your second settlement to complement your first (fill resource gaps)
- Aim for access to all five resources or position near useful ports if resource diversity isn't possible
- Always consider which settlements opponents are likely to place and avoid areas that will become contested
- Place roads pointing toward valuable future expansion spots, not toward the center
- Consider the long-term impact: settlements that can't expand are less valuable

MID-GAME RESOURCE PRIORITIES:
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each possible build (cities: 1VP for 5 resources is most efficient)
- Early phase: Secure at least one good source of brick and wood for minimal expansion
- Growth phase: Prioritize ore and wheat production for city upgrades (3VP for 5 resources is optimal)
- Late phase: Focus on the fastest path to victory points, whether through buildings or development cards
- Avoid trading resources that opponents need for immediate victory point gains
- Use 4:1 trades only when necessary; prioritize port usage when possible

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and limited expansion options
- If you get an early knight, save it for defense or until you can start building toward largest army
- Time monopoly card usage for when opponents likely have accumulated specific resources
- Save year of plenty cards for completing crucial builds when you're short 1-2 specific resources
- Development cards are most valuable when:
  * You need hidden victory points to surprise opponents
  * You need knights to break up longest road or secure largest army
  * You're lacking wood/brick for expansion but have plenty of sheep/wheat/ore

EXPANSION STRATEGY:
- Build roads only with clear settlement locations in mind
- Target settlements that give you access to ports or new resources
- Block opponents' expansion paths when it gives you a strategic advantage
- Consider the timing of expansion vs. city upgrades based on your resource production
- Calculate whether longest road is achievable and worth the resource investment
- When deciding between a new settlement and a city upgrade, compare immediate vs. long-term returns

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-probability hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Save knight cards for breaking up opponent strategies or securing largest army
- Use knights defensively if you're producing valuable resources on high-probability hexes

TRADING TACTICS:
- Avoid trading resources that directly help opponents score points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades
- Trade excess resources before rolling 7 if you have more than 7 cards
- Consider bank/port trades when they enable an immediate build that advances your strategy
- When trading with players, try to receive resources that complete a build

ENDGAME STRATEGY:
- In the late game, hide your victory point potential (keep development cards hidden)
- Calculate the fastest path to 10 VP and focus exclusively on that path
- Be aware of the exact number of remaining development cards and their probabilities
- Track opponents' potential victory points, including hidden development cards
- If you're close to winning, prioritize actions that can be completed in a single turn

Before finalizing your action, check:
1. Is there a more efficient path to victory points?
2. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
3. Does this move help or hinder opponents?
4. Is there a defensive move needed to prevent an opponent from winning?
5. Are you properly diversified against dice probability?

# Game Analysis: Settlers of Catan

Let me analyze the current game state and determine the best action:

## Current Game Position
- I have 3 VP (1 city + 1 settlement)
- RED has 5 VP (3 settlements + Longest Road bonus)
- RED is 5 points ahead and halfway to winning

## Resource Assessment
I currently have:
- 1 WOOD
- 1 BRICK
- 2 WHEAT
- 3 ORE

## Available Actions
1. Build a road (costs 1 wood, 1 brick)
2. Upgrade settlement at node 16 to a city (costs 2 wheat, 3 ore)
3. End turn

## Action Analysis

### Option 5: Upgrade Settlement to City
- Costs: 2 wheat, 3 ore - I have exactly these resources
- Benefits:
  - Increases my VPs from 3 to 4
  - Increases my production on node 16 (8-value wood) from 1 to 2 resources per roll
  - Wood is valuable for further expansion
- This is the most efficient VP gain (1 VP for 5 resources)

### Options 1-4: Build Road
- Costs: 1 wood, 1 brick - I have exactly these resources
- Benefits:
  - Extends my network for future settlements
  - Could work toward breaking RED's longest road
  - However, I can't immediately place a settlement after building this road
  - Doesn't give immediate VP gain

### Option 0: End Turn
- No immediate benefit, wasting an opportunity to use resources

## Strategic Considerations
- RED is 2 points ahead (5 vs 3)
- Upgrading to a city gives immediate VP and increases production
- The wood production will be doubled on a high-probability number (8)
- With better production, I can build roads faster in future turns

<plan>
1. Upgrade my settlement at node 16 to a city to gain VP and increase production
2. Use the increased wood production in future turns to build roads and settlements
3. Look for opportunities to break RED's longest road bonus
4. Continue developing toward largest army as production allows
</plan>

The most strategic move now is to upgrade my settlement to a city. It gives immediate VP gain, increases my production capacity on a valuable resource, and represents the most efficient use of my current resources.

# Game State Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state thoroughly:

## Victory Points
- BLUE (me): 4/10 VP (2 cities = 4 VP)
- RED: 5/10 VP (3 settlements = 3 VP + Longest Road = 2 VP)
- RED is currently leading by 1 VP

## Resources
- I have: 1 WOOD, 1 BRICK
- RED has 5 hidden cards

## Current Board Position
- I have 2 cities positioned on nodes 1 and 16
- RED has 3 settlements at nodes 4, 9, and 17
- RED currently has Longest Road bonus (6 segments)
- My longest road is also 6 segments, but RED claimed the bonus first

## Available Actions
I can either:
- End my turn [0]
- Build one road in one of four possible locations [1-4]

## Strategy Assessment

First, let's assess if building a road is beneficial:
1. I have exactly 1 WOOD, 1 BRICK - just enough to build one road
2. Building a road could potentially position me to:
   - Break RED's longest road if I can make my road longer than 6 segments
   - Set up for future settlement placement

Let me examine each potential road location:
- Edge (6, 23): This appears to be extending toward the east side of the board
- Edge (4, 5): This is on the southwest part of the board
- Edge (19, 21): This is on the northwest area
- Edge (20, 22): This is on the northeast area

Without a clear view of the complete road network, I need to consider what outcomes are most strategic:

1. Can any of these roads immediately give me Longest Road? That would be +2 VP and take 2 VP from RED.
2. Do any of these roads position me for a settlement that would give me valuable resources?
3. Could any of these roads block RED's expansion?

Given my current resources (just 1 WOOD, 1 BRICK), I should use them if building a road provides immediate strategic value. If not, I should consider ending my turn to collect more resources on the next roll.

## Decision

Since I don't have enough information to determine if any road would immediately give me Longest Road or block a critical RED expansion, and I cannot build a settlement this turn, the most strategic move is to build a road that extends my longest continuous road. This increases my chance of claiming Longest Road in future turns.

Based on my 6 segments currently matching RED's 6 segments, adding one more road to my longest path would give me 7 segments and earn the Longest Road bonus, swinging the game by 4 VP total (taking 2 from RED and adding 2 to me).

Without seeing the full road network, I'll choose the option that seems most likely to extend my longest continuous road. Based on the node numbering pattern, edge (6, 23) appears to extend eastward from my existing network.

<plan>
1. Build a road to extend my longest continuous road to 7 segments to take Longest Road from RED
2. Continue developing toward more settlements and cities as resources allow
3. Consider development cards if I get excess sheep/wheat/ore
4. Continue monitoring RED's VP progress to ensure they don't reach 10

# Game Analysis

Let me carefully analyze this game state and determine the best action.

## Current Situation
- I have 4 VP (2 cities) while RED has 5 VP (3 settlements + Longest Road)
- I have 4 wood resources only
- My current plan is to build a road to take Longest Road from RED
- RED has 7 hidden cards, which is concerning - they could be close to a victory condition

## Resources and Build Options
- I only have 4 wood
- I need brick to build roads
- I do not have enough resources to build anything immediately
- I cannot buy development cards without sheep, wheat, and ore

## Action Consideration
Let me evaluate each option:

**[0] End Turn**
- If I end my turn without using my wood, I risk losing resources if a 7 is rolled
- I'd make no progress toward my goal of taking Longest Road

**[1-4] Maritime Trade Options**
- I could trade 4 wood for 1 of another resource
- Trading for brick [1] would help toward my road-building goal
- The other trades don't immediately advance my plan

## Strategic Assessment
My goal is to take Longest Road from RED. This requires:
1. Building at least 1 more road (to reach 7 segments vs RED's 6)
2. I need brick to build roads
3. I currently have 6 contiguous road segments (same as RED), so I'm in position to take Longest Road

The most direct path to advancing my strategy is to trade for brick, which would let me build a road next turn if I get any wood.

<plan>
1. Trade for brick now to prepare for road building
2. On next turn, build a road if I get any wood to take Longest Road from RED (+2 VP)
3. Consider development cards if I get sheep/wheat/ore to potentially get Victory Point cards or knights
4. Continue monitoring RED's progress and block them if needed
</plan>

The optimal action is to trade my wood for brick:

\boxed{1}
========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL SETTLEMENT PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Place settlements on high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Target at least one spot with good ore and wheat production for city development
- Try to secure at least one high-probability spot (5, 6, 8, 9) for each critical resource
- Place your second settlement to complement your first (fill resource gaps)
- Aim for access to all five resources or position near useful ports if resource diversity isn't possible
- Always consider which settlements opponents are likely to place and avoid areas that will become contested
- Place roads pointing toward valuable future expansion spots, not toward the center
- Consider the long-term impact: settlements that can't expand are less valuable

MID-GAME RESOURCE PRIORITIES:
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each possible build (cities: 1VP for 5 resources is most efficient)
- Early phase: Secure at least one good source of brick and wood for minimal expansion
- Growth phase: Prioritize ore and wheat production for city upgrades (3VP for 5 resources is optimal)
- Late phase: Focus on the fastest path to victory points, whether through buildings or development cards
- Avoid trading resources that opponents need for immediate victory point gains
- Use 4:1 trades only when necessary; prioritize port usage when possible

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and limited expansion options
- If you get an early knight, save it for defense or until you can start building toward largest army
- Time monopoly card usage for when opponents likely have accumulated specific resources
- Save year of plenty cards for completing crucial builds when you're short 1-2 specific resources
- Development cards are most valuable when:
  * You need hidden victory points to surprise opponents
  * You need knights to break up longest road or secure largest army
  * You're lacking wood/brick for expansion but have plenty of sheep/wheat/ore

EXPANSION STRATEGY:
- Build roads only with clear settlement locations in mind
- Target settlements that give you access to ports or new resources
- Block opponents' expansion paths when it gives you a strategic advantage
- Consider the timing of expansion vs. city upgrades based on your resource production
- Calculate whether longest road is achievable and worth the resource investment
- When deciding between a new settlement and a city upgrade, compare immediate vs. long-term returns

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-probability hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Save knight cards for breaking up opponent strategies or securing largest army
- Use knights defensively if you're producing valuable resources on high-probability hexes

TRADING TACTICS:
- Avoid trading resources that directly help opponents score points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades
- Trade excess resources before rolling 7 if you have more than 7 cards
- Consider bank/port trades when they enable an immediate build that advances your strategy
- When trading with players, try to receive resources that complete a build

ENDGAME STRATEGY:
- In the late game, hide your victory point potential (keep development cards hidden)
- Calculate the fastest path to 10 VP and focus exclusively on that path
- Be aware of the exact number of remaining development cards and their probabilities
- Track opponents' potential victory points, including hidden development cards
- If you're close to winning, prioritize actions that can be completed in a single turn

Before finalizing your action, check:
1. Is there a more efficient path to victory points?
2. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
3. Does this move help or hinder opponents?
4. Is there a defensive move needed to prevent an opponent from winning?
5. Are you properly diversified against dice probability?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game Analysis

Let me analyze my current situation and available options:

## Current Game State
- I have 4 VPs (2 cities = 4 VP)
- RED has 5 VPs (3 settlements = 3 VP + Longest Road = 2 VP)
- I have 2 wood and 3 brick
- I have 14 roads built with longest road of 6 segments
- RED has longest road with 7 segments

## Resource Assessment
- I currently have 2 wood and 3 brick
- This is enough to build 2 roads
- The robber is on a sheep hex, which doesn't directly affect my production

## Available Actions
I can either end my turn or build a road. Building a road would cost 1 wood and 1 brick, leaving me with 1 wood and 2 brick.

## Strategic Analysis of Building Options

First, I need to understand if any of these roads could help me take the longest road from RED. I currently have 6 contiguous road segments vs RED's 7.

Looking at the road options:
- Option 1: Edge (20, 22) - This extends my network, potentially helping toward longest road
- Option 2: Edge (4, 5) - This connects parts of my network
- Option 3: Edge (19, 21) - Similar to option 1, extends my network
- Option 4: Edge (22, 23) - This extends my network in another direction

To take longest road from RED, I need at least 8 contiguous road segments. With one road build, I can increase my longest road to 7 at most, which isn't enough yet. However, building one road now and preparing for another on my next turn would set me up to take longest road.

## Decision Logic
The optimal approach is to build one road now, keep some resources for next turn, and position myself to take longest road by building another road on my next turn.

Since I have enough resources for two roads but can only build one per turn (unless using a Road Building card, which I've already played), I should build one now and save resources for another on my next turn.

Based on my current position, I should choose the road option that:
1. Extends my longest road path
2. Sets me up for further expansion
3. Potentially blocks RED's expansion

Looking at the options, building a road at edge (20, 22) or (22, 23) seems most beneficial for extending my longest road path.

<plan>
1. Build one road now to extend my longest contiguous path toward 7 segments
2. Save remaining brick and wood to build another road next turn
3. Take longest road from RED once I reach 8 segments (+2 VP)
4. Look for opportunities to gain development cards or build settlements
5. Continue monitoring RED's progress and block them if needed
</plan>

Since I have enough resources for one more road on my next turn, I'll build at edge (20, 22) to extend my longest path.

# Game State Analysis

I need to move the robber and steal a card from RED if possible. Let's analyze each option carefully.

First, I'll review my current situation and objectives:
- I have 4 VP (2 cities)
- RED has 6 VP (4 settlements + longest road)
- My plan is to extend my road network to take longest road from RED
- I have 3 wood and 2 brick, enough to build one road now

## Robber Placement Options

Let me evaluate each robber placement option:

**[0] Move robber to (0, 0, 0) and steal from RED**
- This blocks a brick hex with number 5 (good probability)
- RED has a settlement at node 4 that produces from this hex
- I also have a city at node 1 that produces from this hex
- This would hurt me significantly as I need brick for my road-building strategy

**[1] Move robber to (1, -1, 0) and steal from RED**
- This blocks a wheat hex with number 10 (medium probability)
- RED has two settlements (nodes 7 and 9) producing from this hex
- I have a city at node 1 that produces from this hex
- This would hurt RED more than me, as they have two settlements affected

**[2] Move robber to (-1, 0, 1) and steal from RED**
- This blocks a wheat hex with number 3 (low probability)
- RED has a settlement at node 4 producing from this hex
- I don't have any buildings producing from this hex
- This would only minimally affect RED due to the low probability

**[3] Move robber to (-1, 1, 0) and steal from RED**
- This blocks a wood hex with number 8 (high probability)
- RED has two settlements (nodes 4 and 17) producing from this hex
- I have a city at node 16 producing from this hex
- This would hurt both me and RED significantly, but might hurt me more as I need wood for roads

**[4] Move robber to (0, 1, -1)**
- This blocks a desert hex which produces nothing
- This is a wasted move as it affects no resource production

**[5] Move robber to (1, 0, -1) and steal from RED**
- This blocks an ore hex with number 4 (low probability)
- I have a city at node 1 producing from this hex
- RED doesn't appear to have any buildings producing from this hex
- This would hurt me without affecting RED

## Decision Analysis

Based on my plan to build roads to take longest road from RED:
1. I need to preserve my wood and brick production
2. I want to target RED's key resources
3. I should disrupt RED's progress toward additional points

<plan>
1. Place the robber on RED's wheat production (tile 1,-1,0) with number 10
2. Build one road now to extend my longest path toward 7 segments
3. Save remaining brick and wood to build another road next turn
4. Take longest road from RED once I reach 8 segments (+2 VP)
5. Continue monitoring RED's progress and block them if needed
</plan>

Option 1 is optimal because:
- It blocks a medium-probability wheat hex that affects two of RED's settlements
- It doesn't disrupt my own wood/brick production needed for roads
- It allows me to steal from RED
- Wheat is valuable for RED to build more settlements or development cards

Therefore, I choose option 1.

- Late phase: Focus on the fastest path to victory points, whether through buildings or development cards
- Avoid trading resources that opponents need for immediate victory point gains
- Use 4:1 trades only when necessary; prioritize port usage when possible

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and limited expansion options
- If you get an early knight, save it for defense or until you can start building toward largest army
- Time monopoly card usage for when opponents likely have accumulated specific resources
- Save year of plenty cards for completing crucial builds when you're short 1-2 specific resources
- Development cards are most valuable when:
  * You need hidden victory points to surprise opponents
  * You need knights to break up longest road or secure largest army
  * You're lacking wood/brick for expansion but have plenty of sheep/wheat/ore

EXPANSION STRATEGY:
- Build roads only with clear settlement locations in mind
- Target settlements that give you access to ports or new resources
- Block opponents' expansion paths when it gives you a strategic advantage
- Consider the timing of expansion vs. city upgrades based on your resource production
- Calculate whether longest road is achievable and worth the resource investment
- When deciding between a new settlement and a city upgrade, compare immediate vs. long-term returns

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-probability hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Save knight cards for breaking up opponent strategies or securing largest army
- Use knights defensively if you're producing valuable resources on high-probability hexes

TRADING TACTICS:
- Avoid trading resources that directly help opponents score points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades
- Trade excess resources before rolling 7 if you have more than 7 cards
- Consider bank/port trades when they enable an immediate build that advances your strategy
- When trading with players, try to receive resources that complete a build

ENDGAME STRATEGY:
- In the late game, hide your victory point potential (keep development cards hidden)
- Calculate the fastest path to 10 VP and focus exclusively on that path
- Be aware of the exact number of remaining development cards and their probabilities
- Track opponents' potential victory points, including hidden development cards
- If you're close to winning, prioritize actions that can be completed in a single turn

Before finalizing your action, check:
1. Is there a more efficient path to victory points?
2. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
3. Does this move help or hinder opponents?
4. Is there a defensive move needed to prevent an opponent from winning?
5. Are you properly diversified against dice probability?

# Game Analysis: Moving the Robber

Let me analyze the situation step by step to make the optimal robber placement.

## Current Game State Analysis
- I have 4 VP (2 cities)
- RED has 6 VP (4 settlements + longest road bonus)
- I have 3 wood, 1 brick, which is not enough for significant building
- RED has 7 segments of road vs. my 6, so they have longest road
- My plan involves eventually taking longest road from RED for 2 VP

## Robber Placement Options

Let me evaluate each option by looking at what resources I'd block and what I might steal:

**[0] Move robber to (0, 0, 0) - Brick 5:**
- Blocks RED's brick production at node 4 (5 value = high production)
- Would slow RED's road building (needs brick)
- Also blocks my own brick at node 1 (counterproductive)

**[1] Move robber to (0, -1, 1) - Sheep 9:**
- Blocks RED's sheep at nodes 9 (9 value = medium production)
- Sheep is less critical for road building, so less impact

**[2] Move robber to (-1, 0, 1) - Wheat 3:**
- Blocks RED's wheat at node 4 (3 value = low production)
- Low value hex, minimal impact

**[3] Move robber to (-1, 1, 0) - Wood 8:**
- Blocks RED's high-production wood at nodes 4 and 17 (8 value = high production)
- Also blocks my high-production wood at node 16
- Would significantly slow RED's road building

**[4] Move robber to (0, 1, -1) - Desert:**
- Desert produces nothing, so this would be wasted
- Not a valid strategic option

**[5] Move robber to (1, 0, -1) - Ore 4:**
- No RED settlements here
- Would block my ore production at node 1

## Strategic Decision Making

Looking at my current plan:
- I need to extend my road network to take longest road from RED
- This requires wood and brick
- RED is ahead at 6 VP and has longest road

Since I'm trying to build roads to take longest road, I need to:
1. Prevent RED from extending their road network further
2. Protect my ability to build roads

The most critical resources for roads are wood and brick.

The best move is to block RED's high-production wood on the 8 hex. This will significantly slow their road building, even though it also hurts my wood production at node 16. However, since I already have 3 wood, I can afford this temporary setback, and it's more important to hamper RED's ability to extend their longest road.

<plan>
1. Place robber on RED's wood production (tile -1,1,0) with number 8
2. Use my 3 wood + 1 brick to build a road next turn 
3. Continue building roads strategically to reach 8 segments and take longest road
4. Monitor for opportunities to gain settlement or city resources
5. Focus on getting to 6 VP quickly and then push for 10 VP
</plan>

Therefore, I choose option [3] to move the robber to (-1,1,0) and steal from RED.

PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL SETTLEMENT PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Place settlements on high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Target at least one spot with good ore and wheat production for city development
- Try to secure at least one high-probability spot (5, 6, 8, 9) for each critical resource
- Place your second settlement to complement your first (fill resource gaps)
- Aim for access to all five resources or position near useful ports if resource diversity isn't possible
- Always consider which settlements opponents are likely to place and avoid areas that will become contested
- Place roads pointing toward valuable future expansion spots, not toward the center
- Consider the long-term impact: settlements that can't expand are less valuable

MID-GAME RESOURCE PRIORITIES:
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each possible build (cities: 1VP for 5 resources is most efficient)
- Early phase: Secure at least one good source of brick and wood for minimal expansion
- Growth phase: Prioritize ore and wheat production for city upgrades (3VP for 5 resources is optimal)
- Late phase: Focus on the fastest path to victory points, whether through buildings or development cards
- Avoid trading resources that opponents need for immediate victory point gains
- Use 4:1 trades only when necessary; prioritize port usage when possible

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and limited expansion options
- If you get an early knight, save it for defense or until you can start building toward largest army
- Time monopoly card usage for when opponents likely have accumulated specific resources
- Save year of plenty cards for completing crucial builds when you're short 1-2 specific resources

# Game State Analysis

Let me analyze this situation carefully:

## Current Victory Points
- BLUE (me): 4 VP (2 cities = 4 VP)
- RED: 6 VP (4 settlements = 4 VP + Longest Road bonus = 2 VP)

## My Resources
- 4 Wood
- 1 Brick

## Strategic Position
- The robber is already on RED's wood production (tile -1,1,0) with number 8, which is helping limit their production
- RED is ahead by 2 VP (6 VP vs my 4 VP)
- RED has Longest Road with 7 segments, while my longest road is only 6 segments
- I have 15 roads built total, with potential to expand

## Available Actions
I can either:
- [0] End my turn
- [1-4] Trade 4 wood for another resource using a 4:1 port trade

## Strategic Considerations

1. **Can I build anything immediately?** 
   - With 4 wood + 1 brick, I don't have enough resources to build a settlement (need brick, wood, sheep, wheat)
   - I don't have enough resources to build a city (need 3 ore + 2 wheat)
   - I could build 1 road (costs 1 wood + 1 brick), leaving me with 3 wood

2. **Should I trade for another resource?**
   - Trading 4 wood for 1 of any resource using the 4:1 port trade is very inefficient
   - If I traded 4 wood for 1 brick, I could build 2 roads this turn (using my current brick + new brick)
   - Building 2 roads could help me work toward breaking RED's longest road

3. **Long-term strategy:**
   - My current plan mentions building roads to reach 8 segments and take longest road
   - Building 2 roads this turn would increase my longest continuous road from 6 to 8 segments
   - This would give me longest road (+2 VP), bringing me to 6 VP, tying with RED

Let's evaluate the option of trading and building roads:
- If I trade 4 wood for 1 brick [Action 1], I'll have 0 wood + 2 brick
- I can then build 1 road (1 wood + 1 brick), using my remaining wood and 1 brick
- This leaves me with 0 wood, 0 brick, and 1 more road (rising to 16 total)
- But this won't increase my longest road to 8 segments since I'd only build 1 road

I think the best action is to simply build 1 road using my current resources (not a provided option) or end my turn to preserve resources for more strategic builds later.

<plan>
1. End turn to preserve resources (4 wood + 1 brick)
2. Continue accumulating resources for strategic road building
3. Aim to build at least 2 roads next turn to extend longest road to 8 segments
4. Work toward breaking RED's longest road to take the 2 VP bonus
5. Monitor for opportunities to gain settlement or city resources
</plan>

Since I can't build a road directly (that option isn't provided), and trading my wood inefficiently doesn't provide clear strategic value, I'll end my turn.

# Analyzing the Game State

Let me analyze the current state and my options for moving the robber:

## Victory Point Analysis
- BLUE (me): 4 VP (2 cities = 4 VP)
- RED: 6 VP (4 settlements = 4 VP, longest road = 2 VP)

RED is ahead by 2 VP, so I need to be strategic about slowing them down.

## Resource Production Analysis
Let's examine the hexes where I can place the robber:

0. (0, 0, 0) - 🧱5 (brick) - This is a good production hex (⭐⭐) that RED uses at node 4
1. (1, -1, 0) - 🌾10 (wheat) - RED has two settlements producing from this (nodes 7 and 9)
2. (0, -1, 1) - 🐑9 (sheep) - RED has one settlement producing from this (node 9)
3. (-1, 0, 1) - 🌾3 (wheat) - RED has one settlement producing from this (node 4)
4. (0, 1, -1) - 🏜️ Desert - No production to block
5. (1, 0, -1) - ⛏️4 (ore) - No RED settlements here, only affects my city at node 1

## Strategic Considerations

1. My current plan involves accumulating resources for road building to break RED's longest road.
2. RED is 4 VP ahead if we don't count longest road, so disrupting their resource collection is important.
3. I need brick and wood for roads, and already have some of both.
4. Stealing a resource from RED could directly help my road-building plan.

## Best Action Analysis

- Option 0 (brick hex): This would block a valuable brick resource that RED uses, which is perfect since brick is essential for road building. This might prevent RED from extending their longest road.
- Option 1 (wheat hex): This hits RED twice (two settlements) on a high probability number (10). Good disruption.
- Option 2 (sheep hex): Blocks a good probability (9) sheep hex for RED. Sheep isn't critical for road building though.
- Option 3 (wheat hex): Low probability (3) wheat, not very impactful.
- Options 4 and 5: Not good choices as they either affect no production or only affect me.

## Decision

I should place the robber to maximize disruption to RED while potentially stealing a resource I need. Option 0 (brick hex) or Option 1 (wheat hex) are the best choices.

Since my plan focuses on road building to break RED's longest road, and brick is critical for that, I'll choose Option 0 to block RED's brick production and potentially steal a brick from them.

<plan>
1. Move robber to brick hex (0,0,0) and steal from RED
2. Continue accumulating resources for strategic road building
3. Build roads to work toward breaking RED's longest road (need 8+ segments)
4. Consider building a settlement at a strategic location if I get additional resources
5. Monitor RED's potential paths to 10 VP and disrupt when possible

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL SETTLEMENT PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Place settlements on high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Target at least one spot with good ore and wheat production for city development
- Try to secure at least one high-probability spot (5, 6, 8, 9) for each critical resource
- Place your second settlement to complement your first (fill resource gaps)
- Aim for access to all five resources or position near useful ports if resource diversity isn't possible
- Always consider which settlements opponents are likely to place and avoid areas that will become contested
- Place roads pointing toward valuable future expansion spots, not toward the center
- Consider the long-term impact: settlements that can't expand are less valuable

MID-GAME RESOURCE PRIORITIES:
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each possible build (cities: 1VP for 5 resources is most efficient)
- Early phase: Secure at least one good source of brick and wood for minimal expansion
- Growth phase: Prioritize ore and wheat production for city upgrades (3VP for 5 resources is optimal)
- Late phase: Focus on the fastest path to victory points, whether through buildings or development cards
- Avoid trading resources that opponents need for immediate victory point gains
- Use 4:1 trades only when necessary; prioritize port usage when possible

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and limited expansion options
- If you get an early knight, save it for defense or until you can start building toward largest army
- Time monopoly card usage for when opponents likely have accumulated specific resources
- Save year of plenty cards for completing crucial builds when you're short 1-2 specific resources
- Development cards are most valuable when:
  * You need hidden victory points to surprise opponents
  * You need knights to break up longest road or secure largest army
  * You're lacking wood/brick for expansion but have plenty of sheep/wheat/ore

EXPANSION STRATEGY:
- Build roads only with clear settlement locations in mind
- Target settlements that give you access to ports or new resources
- Block opponents' expansion paths when it gives you a strategic advantage
- Consider the timing of expansion vs. city upgrades based on your resource production
- Calculate whether longest road is achievable and worth the resource investment
- When deciding between a new settlement and a city upgrade, compare immediate vs. long-term returns

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-probability hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Save knight cards for breaking up opponent strategies or securing largest army
- Use knights defensively if you're producing valuable resources on high-probability hexes

TRADING TACTICS:
- Avoid trading resources that directly help opponents score points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades
- Trade excess resources before rolling 7 if you have more than 7 cards
- Consider bank/port trades when they enable an immediate build that advances your strategy
- When trading with players, try to receive resources that complete a build

ENDGAME STRATEGY:
- In the late game, hide your victory point potential (keep development cards hidden)
- Calculate the fastest path to 10 VP and focus exclusively on that path
- Be aware of the exact number of remaining development cards and their probabilities
- Track opponents' potential victory points, including hidden development cards
- If you're close to winning, prioritize actions that can be completed in a single turn

Before finalizing your action, check:
1. Is there a more efficient path to victory points?
2. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
3. Does this move help or hinder opponents?
4. Is there a defensive move needed to prevent an opponent from winning?
5. Are you properly diversified against dice probability?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game State Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state carefully before making a decision.

## Victory Points
- BLUE (me): 4 VP (2 cities)
- RED: 6 VP (4 settlements + longest road bonus)
- RED is 4 VP away from winning, I'm 6 VP away

## Resources
- I have: 4 🌲WOOD, 4 🧱BRICK
- This is perfect for road building but not enough for settlements/cities/development cards
- RED has 3 hidden cards

## Strategic Position
- The robber is currently on brick hex (0,0,0), which affects my city at node 1
- RED has longest road (7 segments) vs. my 6 segments
- RED is closer to victory with 6 VP vs my 4 VP

## Available Actions
- End turn (0)
- Various 4:1 port trades (1-8), which are inefficient uses of resources

## Reasoning

Currently, I have 4 wood and 4 brick, which is enough to build 4 roads but not enough for a settlement (which would require wood, brick, wheat, and sheep). The robber is already on a brick hex that affects my city at node 1.

Looking at my current plan, I wanted to move the robber to the brick hex (which is already done) and continue resource accumulation for road building. RED has longest road with 7 segments while I have 6, so I need to build at least 2 more roads to break RED's longest road bonus.

However, none of the available actions let me build roads or move the robber - these must have been options in previous turns. Right now, I can only end my turn or make inefficient trades. Since I already have wood and brick (the road-building resources), trading them away doesn't align with my strategic plan of expanding my road network.

My best move is to end my turn, preserving my wood and brick resources for future road building. This lets me continue with my plan to build roads and eventually break RED's longest road bonus.

<plan>
1. End turn to preserve wood/brick resources
2. Build roads on my next opportunity to work toward breaking RED's longest road
3. Continue working toward 8+ segment road to steal longest road bonus (+2 VP)
4. Build settlements at strategic locations when possible
5. Monitor RED's potential paths to 10 VP and disrupt when possible
</plan>

# Analysis of Robber Placement Options

Let me analyze each available option for moving the robber:

**Option 0: Move to (1, -1, 0) - Wheat 10**
- This affects RED's settlements at nodes 7 and 9
- Wheat production is important for RED's potential city upgrades
- Deprives RED of a moderate probability (10) resource
- Also blocks my own city at node 1 which produces wheat on this hex

**Option 1: Move to (0, -1, 1) - Sheep 9**
- This affects RED's settlement at node 9
- Sheep is less critical for building (mainly for development cards)
- Good probability (9)
- Doesn't block any of my own production

**Option 2: Move to (-1, 0, 1) - Wheat 3**
- This affects RED's settlement at node 4
- Low probability (3) so minimal impact
- Wheat is valuable but the probability is too low to be effective

**Option 3: Move to (-1, 1, 0) - Wood 8**
- This affects RED's settlements at nodes 4 and 17
- High probability (8) resource
- Wood is critical for RED's road expansion
- However, it would also block my city at node 16 which produces wood on this hex
- This is my only source of wood and has high probability

**Option 4: Move to (0, 1, -1) - Desert**
- Desert produces nothing, so this would be wasting the robber placement
- Not a strategic choice

**Option 5: Move to (1, 0, -1) - Ore 4**
- This affects my own city at node 1
- No apparent impact on RED
- Not strategic since I'd be hurting myself without affecting RED

## Strategic Decision

RED is ahead at 6VP vs my 4VP and has longest road. My current plan is to build roads to try breaking RED's longest road, so I need to:
1. Protect my wood production
2. Disrupt RED's ability to expand their road network
3. Steal a valuable resource if possible

Looking at the options:
- Option 3 would hurt my only wood production (critical for my road strategy)
- Option 1 targets a good probability hex (9) that only affects RED and not me
- Option 0 would impact RED's wheat production but also my own
- Option 2 has minimal impact due to low probability
- Options 4 and 5 are poor choices

<plan>
1. Use robber to disrupt RED's road expansion by targeting their wood production when possible
2. Continue building roads to break RED's longest road
3. Save resources for strategic settlement placement
4. Monitor RED's path to 10VP and prioritize defensive moves
5. Focus on reaching 8+ segment road to claim longest road bonus (+2 VP)
</plan>

Based on this analysis, I'll place the robber on (0, -1, 1) - the sheep 9 hex - which affects RED's settlement at node 9 without impacting my own production. This is a good probability hex and I can potentially steal a valuable resource from RED.

- Consider the long-term impact: settlements that can't expand are less valuable

MID-GAME RESOURCE PRIORITIES:
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each possible build (cities: 1VP for 5 resources is most efficient)
- Early phase: Secure at least one good source of brick and wood for minimal expansion
- Growth phase: Prioritize ore and wheat production for city upgrades (3VP for 5 resources is optimal)
- Late phase: Focus on the fastest path to victory points, whether through buildings or development cards
- Avoid trading resources that opponents need for immediate victory point gains
- Use 4:1 trades only when necessary; prioritize port usage when possible

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and limited expansion options
- If you get an early knight, save it for defense or until you can start building toward largest army
- Time monopoly card usage for when opponents likely have accumulated specific resources
- Save year of plenty cards for completing crucial builds when you're short 1-2 specific resources
- Development cards are most valuable when:
  * You need hidden victory points to surprise opponents
  * You need knights to break up longest road or secure largest army
  * You're lacking wood/brick for expansion but have plenty of sheep/wheat/ore

EXPANSION STRATEGY:
- Build roads only with clear settlement locations in mind
- Target settlements that give you access to ports or new resources
- Block opponents' expansion paths when it gives you a strategic advantage
- Consider the timing of expansion vs. city upgrades based on your resource production
- Calculate whether longest road is achievable and worth the resource investment
- When deciding between a new settlement and a city upgrade, compare immediate vs. long-term returns

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-probability hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Save knight cards for breaking up opponent strategies or securing largest army
- Use knights defensively if you're producing valuable resources on high-probability hexes

TRADING TACTICS:
- Avoid trading resources that directly help opponents score points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades
- Trade excess resources before rolling 7 if you have more than 7 cards
- Consider bank/port trades when they enable an immediate build that advances your strategy
- When trading with players, try to receive resources that complete a build

ENDGAME STRATEGY:
- In the late game, hide your victory point potential (keep development cards hidden)
- Calculate the fastest path to 10 VP and focus exclusively on that path
- Be aware of the exact number of remaining development cards and their probabilities
- Track opponents' potential victory points, including hidden development cards
- If you're close to winning, prioritize actions that can be completed in a single turn

Before finalizing your action, check:
1. Is there a more efficient path to victory points?
2. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
3. Does this move help or hinder opponents?
4. Is there a defensive move needed to prevent an opponent from winning?
5. Are you properly diversified against dice probability?

# Game Analysis for Settlers of Catan

Let me analyze the current game state and determine the optimal action:

## Current Situation
- I have 4 VP (2 cities)
- Opponent has 6 VP (4 settlements + longest road bonus)
- My resources: 7 Wood, 2 Brick, 1 Wheat
- Opponent has longest road (7 segments) while my longest is 6 segments
- The robber is currently on a sheep hex (9)

## Strategic Assessment
Looking at my resources, I cannot build anything significant this turn:
- A settlement requires 1 Wood, 1 Brick, 1 Wheat, 1 Sheep (I lack sheep)
- A road requires 1 Wood, 1 Brick (I could build with my current resources)
- A development card requires 1 Ore, 1 Wheat, 1 Sheep (I lack ore and sheep)
- A city upgrade requires 3 Ore, 2 Wheat (I lack sufficient ore and wheat)

My current plan involves disrupting RED's expansion and building roads to break their longest road. However, I don't see a way to make significant progress toward those goals with my current resources.

## Action Analysis
Let's analyze my options:
- [0] End Turn: Conserve my resources for next turn
- [1-4] Trade port options: Trading 4 Wood for various resources

Since I have 7 Wood, I could consider trading some away, but I need to determine if that would be beneficial:

- If I trade for Brick, I'd have 3 Brick + 3 Wood, allowing me to build 3 roads
- If I trade for Ore, I'd get only 1 Ore which isn't enough for any significant build
- If I trade for Sheep, I'd get 1 Sheep but still couldn't build a settlement (need more wheat)
- If I trade for Wheat, I'd have 2 Wheat but still couldn't build a settlement or development card

Building additional roads could help me work toward breaking RED's longest road, which aligns with my current plan. I currently have 6 segments in my longest road, and RED has 7. If I can extend my road network strategically, I might be able to reach 8 segments on a future turn.

## Decision Logic
Since I'm not in immediate danger of RED winning on their next turn (they're at 6 VP), my best move is to leverage my excess wood to position myself for taking longest road. Trading for brick would allow me to build multiple roads this turn.

<plan>
1. Trade Wood for Brick to build more roads
2. Continue extending road network to reach 8+ segments and take longest road from RED
3. Save resources for settlement placement when possible
4. Monitor RED's path to 10VP and prioritize defensive moves
5. Use robber strategically when I get the chance
</plan>

Based on this analysis, I should:

PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:

INITIAL SETTLEMENT PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Place settlements on high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Target at least one spot with good ore and wheat production for city development
- Try to secure at least one high-probability spot (5, 6, 8, 9) for each critical resource
- Place your second settlement to complement your first (fill resource gaps)
- Aim for access to all five resources or position near useful ports if resource diversity isn't possible
- Always consider which settlements opponents are likely to place and avoid areas that will become contested
- Place roads pointing toward valuable future expansion spots, not toward the center
- Consider the long-term impact: settlements that can't expand are less valuable

# Game Analysis for MOVE_ROBBER Decision

I need to carefully analyze where to place the robber to maximize my strategic advantage while minimizing RED's position, who is currently ahead with 6 VP.

## Current Game State
- I have 4 VP (two cities)
- RED has 6 VP (four settlements + longest road bonus)
- RED is ahead and needs just 4 more VP to win
- I have 3 Wood, 3 Brick, 1 Wheat
- I currently have 6 roads in my longest segment vs RED's 7

## Robber Placement Analysis

Let me evaluate each option:

**[0] Move robber to (0, 0, 0) and steal from RED**
- This is the BRICK hex with a 5 number (good probability)
- Blocks RED's settlement at node 4 from producing brick
- Blocks my city at node 1 from producing brick
- Since I already have 3 brick, blocking my own production isn't ideal

**[1] Move robber to (1, -1, 0) and steal from RED**
- This is the WHEAT hex with a 10 number (medium probability)
- Blocks RED's settlements at nodes 7 and 9 from wheat production
- Blocks my city at node 1 from wheat production
- Impacts 3 RED building spots vs 1 of mine

**[2] Move robber to (-1, 0, 1) and steal from RED**
- This is the WHEAT hex with a 3 number (very low probability)
- Blocks RED's settlement at node 4 from wheat
- Low impact choice as 3 is a rare roll

**[3] Move robber to (-1, 1, 0) and steal from RED**
- This is the WOOD hex with an 8 number (high probability)
- Blocks RED's settlements at nodes 4 and 17 (both produce wood on 8)
- Also blocks my city at node 16 which produces wood on 8
- This would block significant wood production for both players, but especially RED

**[4] Move robber to (0, 1, -1)**
- This is a desert hex - no production to block
- No benefit to placing robber here

**[5] Move robber to (1, 0, -1) and steal from RED**
- This is the ORE hex with a 4 number (low-medium probability)
- Only blocks my city at node 1 from ore production
- No benefit to me as it doesn't affect RED's production

## Strategic Considerations

1. RED is 2 VP ahead and has longest road bonus
2. I need to limit RED's ability to extend roads further or build new settlements
3. Wood is critical for road building (needed to overtake longest road)
4. I already have 3 Wood and 3 Brick, so I can build roads without needing more immediately

The most strategic move is to target RED's key resource production. Looking at RED's buildings:
- RED has 2 settlements on wood hexes with number 8 (high probability)
- Wood is critical for road building, which is how RED maintains longest road advantage

<plan>
1. Block RED's wood production to slow their road building
2. Use my existing Wood/Brick to extend roads toward viable settlement locations
3. Focus on reaching 8+ road segments to take longest road from RED
4. Continue monitoring RED's path to 10VP and prioritize defensive moves
5. Consider development card purchase when I have the resources
</plan>

Based on my analysis, option [3] provides the maximum disruption to RED's strategy by blocking their high-probability wood production on TWO settlements while also stealing a card. Though it affects my wood production too, I already have 3 wood in hand to build roads.

# Game Analysis

Let me analyze the current state of the game and the available options to determine the best move.

## Game State Assessment

Current VP Breakdown:
- BLUE (me): 4 VP (2 cities = 4 VP)
- RED: 6 VP (4 settlements = 4 VP, Longest Road = 2 VP)

Resource Analysis:
- I have: 4 Wood, 3 Brick, 1 Wheat
- RED has: 2 unknown cards
- The robber is blocking the Wood (8) hex, which is one of the high-probability hexes

Available Actions:
- End turn
- Make 4:1 port trades with my Wood

## Strategic Options

I need to evaluate what I can accomplish this turn and what my priorities should be.

With my current resources (4 Wood, 3 Brick, 1 Wheat), I could:
1. Build a road (costs 1 Wood, 1 Brick) - I could build 2 roads with my current resources
2. Save resources for a settlement (costs 1 Wood, 1 Brick, 1 Wheat, 1 Sheep) - I'm missing Sheep

My current plan focuses on extending roads to claim longest road from RED and blocking RED's expansion. However, I don't have enough resources to build a settlement right now, only roads.

## Decision Analysis

Looking at the VP race:
- RED is at 6 VP, needs 4 more to win
- I'm at 4 VP, need 6 more to win

Taking the longest road (2 VP) from RED would be a 4 VP swing (RED -2, me +2), putting me at 6 VP and RED at 4 VP. This seems like the most efficient VP gain available.

Currently, RED has 7 road segments for longest road. To take it, I would need 8 or more connected road segments. I currently have 6 as my longest chain, so I need to extend by at least 2 more segments.

I have enough resources (4 Wood, 3 Brick) to build 2 roads, which would allow me to match RED's longest road at 7, but not exceed it. Trading my Wood would leave me without enough resources to build what I need.

<plan>
1. Build 2 roads to extend toward matching RED's longest road (7 segments)
2. Focus next turn on gaining 1 more road to take longest road from RED
3. Continue monitoring RED's path to 10VP and prioritize defensive moves
4. Save resources for future settlement placement at strategic locations
5. Consider development card purchase when I have the resources
</plan>

Since I can't achieve longest road this turn and making trades doesn't get me closer to any immediate builds, the most prudent action is to simply end my turn and save my resources for next turn's road building.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL SETTLEMENT PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Place settlements on high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Target at least one spot with good ore and wheat production for city development
- Try to secure at least one high-probability spot (5, 6, 8, 9) for each critical resource
- Place your second settlement to complement your first (fill resource gaps)
- Aim for access to all five resources or position near useful ports if resource diversity isn't possible
- Always consider which settlements opponents are likely to place and avoid areas that will become contested
- Place roads pointing toward valuable future expansion spots, not toward the center
- Consider the long-term impact: settlements that can't expand are less valuable

MID-GAME RESOURCE PRIORITIES:
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each possible build (cities: 1VP for 5 resources is most efficient)
- Early phase: Secure at least one good source of brick and wood for minimal expansion
- Growth phase: Prioritize ore and wheat production for city upgrades (3VP for 5 resources is optimal)
- Late phase: Focus on the fastest path to victory points, whether through buildings or development cards
- Avoid trading resources that opponents need for immediate victory point gains
- Use 4:1 trades only when necessary; prioritize port usage when possible

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and limited expansion options
- If you get an early knight, save it for defense or until you can start building toward largest army
- Time monopoly card usage for when opponents likely have accumulated specific resources
- Save year of plenty cards for completing crucial builds when you're short 1-2 specific resources
- Development cards are most valuable when:
  * You need hidden victory points to surprise opponents
  * You need knights to break up longest road or secure largest army
  * You're lacking wood/brick for expansion but have plenty of sheep/wheat/ore

EXPANSION STRATEGY:
- Build roads only with clear settlement locations in mind
- Target settlements that give you access to ports or new resources
- Block opponents' expansion paths when it gives you a strategic advantage
- Consider the timing of expansion vs. city upgrades based on your resource production
- Calculate whether longest road is achievable and worth the resource investment
- When deciding between a new settlement and a city upgrade, compare immediate vs. long-term returns

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-probability hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Save knight cards for breaking up opponent strategies or securing largest army
- Use knights defensively if you're producing valuable resources on high-probability hexes

TRADING TACTICS:
- Avoid trading resources that directly help opponents score points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades
- Trade excess resources before rolling 7 if you have more than 7 cards
- Consider bank/port trades when they enable an immediate build that advances your strategy
- When trading with players, try to receive resources that complete a build

ENDGAME STRATEGY:
- In the late game, hide your victory point potential (keep development cards hidden)
- Calculate the fastest path to 10 VP and focus exclusively on that path
- Be aware of the exact number of remaining development cards and their probabilities
- Track opponents' potential victory points, including hidden development cards
- If you're close to winning, prioritize actions that can be completed in a single turn

Before finalizing your action, check:
1. Is there a more efficient path to victory points?
2. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
3. Does this move help or hinder opponents?
4. Is there a defensive move needed to prevent an opponent from winning?
5. Are you properly diversified against dice probability?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Analyzing the Move Robber Decision

I need to analyze where to place the robber to maximize my strategic advantage while hindering RED, who is already at 6 VP compared to my 4 VP.

## Key Considerations
1. Block RED's highest production hexes
2. Target resources that RED likely needs
3. Protect my own valuable production
4. Strategic positioning for future turns

## Resource Production Analysis
- RED has strong wood production (🌲8[⭐⭐⭐] at nodes 4 & 17)
- RED has brick production (🧱5[⭐⭐] at node 4)
- RED has wheat production (🌾10[⭐] at nodes 7 & 9, 🌾3[⭐] at node 4)
- RED has sheep production (🐑9[⭐⭐] at node 9)
- RED has no ore production currently

## Analyzing Each Option

**Option [0] - Move robber to (0, 0, 0) (Brick 5) and steal from RED:**
- This blocks RED's brick production at node 4
- Brick is essential for road building, which RED needs for maintaining longest road
- This also affects my own brick production at node 1
- IMPACT: Medium-high - hurts RED's road building but affects me too

**Option [1] - Move robber to (1, -1, 0) (Wheat 10) and steal from RED:**
- This blocks RED's wheat production at nodes 7 & 9
- RED needs wheat for settlements and development cards
- This would also impact my wheat production at node 1
- IMPACT: Medium - hurts RED's building ability but also impacts me

**Option [2] - Move robber to (0, -1, 1) (Sheep 9) and steal from RED:**
- This blocks RED's sheep production at node 9
- Sheep is needed for settlements and development cards
- I don't have sheep production here
- IMPACT: Medium - limits RED's development card potential

**Option [3] - Move robber to (-1, 0, 1) (Wheat 3) and steal from RED:**
- This blocks RED's wheat production at node 4
- Wheat roll of 3 is low probability
- IMPACT: Low - not a high-impact move

**Option [4] - Move robber to (-1, 1, 0) (Wood 8) and steal from RED:**
- This blocks RED's strongest resource - Wood 8 production at nodes 4 & 17
- Wood is critical for road building (longest road)
- However, this also blocks my wood production at node 16
- IMPACT: Very high, but double-edged

**Option [5] - Move robber to (0, 1, -1) (Desert):**
- This doesn't block any production
- There's no benefit to placing the robber here
- IMPACT: None - this would be a wasted move

## Strategic Assessment

My current plan involves building roads to match RED's longest road. I need to:
1. Prevent RED from extending their road network further
2. Protect my own resource production if possible
3. Target RED's most valuable resources

RED already has the longest road with 7 segments. They are at 6 VP total, so they need 4 more to win. I'm at 4 VP, needing 6 more.

Since RED has 5 hidden cards, I want to both steal a useful card and block their most critical production.

## Decision

Looking at the options, Option [4] would block RED's strongest resource (🌲8[⭐⭐⭐]) which is vital for them to extend their road network further. However, this also blocks my own wood production, which I need for my road-building strategy.

Option [0] targets RED's brick production (🧱5[⭐⭐]) which they need along with wood to extend their roads, but it would also affect my brick production.

Since I need to prioritize blocking RED's road building ability without hurting my own production too much, the best option is either Option [2] or Option [0].

<plan>
1. Block RED's brick production to slow their road building
2. Build 2 roads to extend toward matching RED's longest road (7 segments)
3. Focus next turn on gaining 1 more road to take longest road from RED
4. Continue monitoring RED's path to 10VP and prioritize defensive moves
5. Consider development card purchase when I have the resources
</plan>

Placing the robber on (0, 0, 0) blocks RED's brick production while still allowing me to potentially get brick from other sources or through trading. This aligns with my plan to slow down RED while I catch up on road building.

# Game Analysis: Turn 146

I need to carefully evaluate the current game state and my available actions to determine the optimal move.

## Current Game State Analysis:
- I (BLUE) have 4/10 VPs (2 cities = 4 VPs)
- RED has 6/10 VPs (4 settlements = 4 VPs + 2 VPs for Longest Road)
- I have resources: 1 🌲, 4 🧱, 1 🌾
- I have built 15 roads with longest path of 6 segments
- RED has built 10 roads with longest path of 7 segments
- Robber is on the desert tile (0, 1, -1)

## Resource Analysis:
- I have plenty of brick (4), but limited wood (1) and wheat (1)
- To build more roads (my current plan), I need more wood
- I'm missing ore and sheep completely

## Strategic Options:

1. **End Turn (Action 0)**
   - This would waste my current resources and opportunity to advance
   - Not recommended given RED is at 6 VP and close to winning

2. **Trade Brick for Resources (Actions 1-4)**
   - Option 2: Trade 4 🧱 for 1 🌲 - This would give me 2 wood total, allowing me to build 2 roads
   - Option 1: Trade 4 🧱 for 1 🐑 - Not immediately useful for my plan
   - Option 3: Trade 4 🧱 for 1 🌾 - Would give me 2 wheat, not enough for development card
   - Option 4: Trade 4 🧱 for 1 ⛏️ - Not immediately useful for my plan

Looking at my current plan:
- Block RED's brick production (already achieved with robber placement)
- Build 2 roads to extend toward matching RED's longest road (need more wood)
- Focus next turn on gaining 1 more road to take longest road from RED
- Monitor RED's path to 10VP

The most strategic move would be to trade my excess brick for wood, which would allow me to build 2 roads this turn, bringing my road count to 8 segments (exceeding RED's 7). This would give me the Longest Road bonus (+2 VP), bringing me to 6 VP total and denying RED 2 VP.

<plan>
1. Trade 4 brick for 1 wood
2. Use 2 wood + 2 brick to build 2 roads strategically to extend my longest road to 8
3. Claim Longest Road bonus (+2 VP)
4. Continue monitoring RED's victory path and consider development card purchases when possible
5. Plan future settlements/cities based on available expansion paths after securing Longest Road
</plan>

The optimal action is to trade my brick for wood:

1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL SETTLEMENT PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Place settlements on high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Target at least one spot with good ore and wheat production for city development
- Try to secure at least one high-probability spot (5, 6, 8, 9) for each critical resource
- Place your second settlement to complement your first (fill resource gaps)
- Aim for access to all five resources or position near useful ports if resource diversity isn't possible
- Always consider which settlements opponents are likely to place and avoid areas that will become contested
- Place roads pointing toward valuable future expansion spots, not toward the center
- Consider the long-term impact: settlements that can't expand are less valuable

MID-GAME RESOURCE PRIORITIES:
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each possible build (cities: 1VP for 5 resources is most efficient)
- Early phase: Secure at least one good source of brick and wood for minimal expansion
- Growth phase: Prioritize ore and wheat production for city upgrades (3VP for 5 resources is optimal)
- Late phase: Focus on the fastest path to victory points, whether through buildings or development cards
- Avoid trading resources that opponents need for immediate victory point gains
- Use 4:1 trades only when necessary; prioritize port usage when possible

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and limited expansion options
- If you get an early knight, save it for defense or until you can start building toward largest army
- Time monopoly card usage for when opponents likely have accumulated specific resources
- Save year of plenty cards for completing crucial builds when you're short 1-2 specific resources
- Development cards are most valuable when:
  * You need hidden victory points to surprise opponents
  * You need knights to break up longest road or secure largest army
  * You're lacking wood/brick for expansion but have plenty of sheep/wheat/ore

EXPANSION STRATEGY:
- Build roads only with clear settlement locations in mind
- Target settlements that give you access to ports or new resources
- Block opponents' expansion paths when it gives you a strategic advantage
- Consider the timing of expansion vs. city upgrades based on your resource production
- Calculate whether longest road is achievable and worth the resource investment
- When deciding between a new settlement and a city upgrade, compare immediate vs. long-term returns

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-probability hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Save knight cards for breaking up opponent strategies or securing largest army
- Use knights defensively if you're producing valuable resources on high-probability hexes

TRADING TACTICS:
- Avoid trading resources that directly help opponents score points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades
- Trade excess resources before rolling 7 if you have more than 7 cards
- Consider bank/port trades when they enable an immediate build that advances your strategy
- When trading with players, try to receive resources that complete a build

ENDGAME STRATEGY:
- In the late game, hide your victory point potential (keep development cards hidden)
- Calculate the fastest path to 10 VP and focus exclusively on that path
- Be aware of the exact number of remaining development cards and their probabilities
- Track opponents' potential victory points, including hidden development cards
- If you're close to winning, prioritize actions that can be completed in a single turn

Before finalizing your action, check:
1. Is there a more efficient path to victory points?
2. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
3. Does this move help or hinder opponents?
4. Is there a defensive move needed to prevent an opponent from winning?
5. Are you properly diversified against dice probability?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game State Analysis

I need to analyze the game state and select the optimal hex to move the robber to maximize my chances of winning.

## Current Situation Assessment
- I have 4 VP (2 cities worth 4 VP)
- RED has 7 VP (5 settlements worth 5 VP + longest road for 2 VP)
- RED is ahead of me by 3 VP and only needs 3 more to win
- I have 2 wood, 1 wheat resources
- My current plan involves building roads to claim the longest road bonus

## Robber Placement Analysis
Let me evaluate each option:

**[0] Move robber to (0, 0, 0) and steal from RED**
- This is the brick hex with a 5 (good probability)
- RED has a settlement here, producing brick
- Brick is a road-building resource that RED needs to maintain longest road advantage
- Good option to block RED's road expansion

**[1] Move robber to (1, -1, 0) and steal from RED**
- This is the wheat hex with a 10 (low probability)
- RED has two settlements here, producing wheat
- Wheat is needed for settlements/dev cards but not for roads
- Moderate impact on RED

**[2] Move robber to (0, -1, 1) and steal from RED**
- This is the sheep hex with a 9 (good probability)
- RED has two settlements here, producing sheep
- Sheep is only needed for dev cards and settlements, not roads
- Moderate impact on RED

**[3] Move robber to (-1, 0, 1) and steal from RED**
- This is the wheat hex with a 3 (low probability)
- RED has two settlements here, producing wheat
- Not a high-value target due to low probability

**[4] Move robber to (-1, 1, 0) and steal from RED**
- This is the wood hex with an 8 (high probability)
- RED has two settlements here, producing wood
- Wood is crucial for road building
- This would significantly impair RED's ability to extend longest road
- VERY high impact on RED

**[5] Move robber to (1, 0, -1)**
- This is the ore hex with a 4 (moderate probability)
- I have a city here, but RED has no buildings
- Placing here would hurt myself and not affect RED
- Poor strategic choice

## Strategic Decision

The most impactful move would be option [4], placing the robber on the wood hex (-1, 1, 0) with number 8:
- It has high production probability (8 is rolled frequently)
- RED has two settlements producing wood from this hex
- Wood is critical for RED to maintain and extend their longest road
- By stealing from RED, I might get a valuable resource while denying them wood production

This aligns perfectly with my current plan to build roads and claim longest road. By blocking RED's wood production, I'm directly interfering with their ability to defend their longest road bonus.

<plan>
1. Place robber on wood hex (-1,1,0) to block RED's wood production
2. Trade my resources to get needed brick/wood
3. Build roads strategically to extend longest road to 8
4. Claim Longest Road bonus (+2 VP)
5. Continue monitoring RED's progress and adapt strategy as needed

# Game Analysis for Settlers of Catan

I'll analyze the current game state and determine the optimal robber placement.

## Current Situation Assessment
- I'm at 4 VP vs RED's 7 VP (including 2 VP from longest road)
- RED is 3 points ahead and quite close to winning
- I have 1 wood and 3 wheat resources
- RED has 4 hidden resources
- The robber is currently on hex (-1,1,0) which is wood with a value of 8

## Robber Placement Options Analysis

Let me examine each option and its strategic value:

**[0] Move robber to (0, 0, 0) - Brick 5**
- This blocks RED's settlements at nodes 4 (produces 🧱5)
- Medium-high probability number (5)
- RED has 2 settlements producing brick, so this hurts their expansion capability
- Stealing from RED could get me brick which I need for road building

**[1] Move robber to (1, -1, 0) - Wheat 10**
- This blocks RED's settlements at nodes 7 and 9 (produces 🌾10)
- Lower probability number (10)
- RED has 3 settlements producing wheat, which may be important for their development cards

**[2] Move robber to (0, -1, 1) - Sheep 9**
- This blocks RED's settlements at nodes 9 and 12 (produces 🐑9)
- Medium probability number (9)
- Could disrupt RED's ability to buy development cards

**[3] Move robber to (-1, 0, 1) - Wheat 3**
- This blocks RED's settlements at nodes 4 and 12 (produces 🌾3)
- Very low probability number (3)
- Not very effective as a blocking move

**[4] Move robber to (0, 1, -1) - Desert**
- This blocks no production
- Completely ineffective move

**[5] Move robber to (1, 0, -1) - Ore 4**
- This doesn't block any of RED's production
- Only affects my own production at node 1
- Counterproductive to my strategy

## Strategic Goals
1. Disrupt RED's ability to continue expanding their road network
2. Potentially gain a resource I need through stealing
3. Block high-probability production for RED
4. Preserve my path to building more roads to claim longest road

## Decision

Based on my analysis, I need to consider my primary goal: overtaking RED's longest road. To do this, I need to:
1. Slow RED's road expansion 
2. Accelerate my own road building

The most strategic move is to block RED's brick production, as brick is essential for road building. The hex (0,0,0) has a brick resource with a probability of 5, which is quite productive. Blocking this would significantly hamper RED's ability to expand further.

<plan>
1. Place robber on brick hex (0,0,0) to block RED's brick production
2. Use my wood and wheat to trade for additional resources
3. Build roads strategically to extend my longest road beyond RED's
4. Claim Longest Road bonus (+2 VP)
5. Continue monitoring RED's progress and adapt strategy as needed

Based on this information, which action number do you choose? Think step by step about your options, then put the final action number in a box like \boxed{1}.
RESPONSE:
I'll analyze this situation step by step to determine the optimal robber placement.

First, let me assess the game state:
- I (BLUE) have 4 victory points (2 cities = 4 VP)
- RED has 7 victory points (5 settlements = 5 VP + Longest Road = 2 VP)
- RED is 3 points ahead and close to winning
- I need to disrupt RED's position while improving mine
- I have 3 WOOD, 1 SHEEP, 3 WHEAT in hand

Now, let's analyze each robber placement option:

**Option 0**: Move robber to (1, -1, 0) - Wheat hex with value 10
- Blocks RED's wheat production at nodes 7 and 9 (2 settlements)
- Wheat is critical for development cards and settlements/cities

**Option 1**: Move robber to (0, -1, 1) - Sheep hex with value 9
- Blocks RED's sheep production at nodes 9 and 12 (2 settlements)
- Sheep is needed for development cards and settlements

**Option 2**: Move robber to (-1, 0, 1) - Wheat hex with value 3
- Blocks RED's wheat production at node 12 (1 settlement)
- But this is only a 3 hex (low probability)

**Option 3**: Move robber to (-1, 1, 0) - Wood hex with value 8
- Blocks RED's wood production at nodes 4 and 17 (2 settlements)
- This is a high-probability resource (8) that RED needs for roads
- Disrupts RED's ability to extend their longest road further

**Option 4**: Move robber to (0, 1, -1) - Desert hex
- This is already non-productive, so placing robber here would be wasteful

**Option 5**: Move robber to (1, 0, -1) - Ore hex with value 4
- No RED settlements here, so this doesn't disrupt RED's production

My current plan involves building roads to secure longest road. Since RED has the longest road (7 segments) and I need to catch up (I have 6 segments), I need to prevent RED from building more roads while extending my own.

Looking at RED's production, they're getting wood from the 8 hex, which is their most valuable production for road building. If I block this, I significantly hamper their ability to extend their road network.

<plan>
1. Place robber on wood hex (-1,1,0) with value 8 to block RED's wood production at two settlements
2. Use my 3 wood and 3 wheat to build roads to extend my network
3. Focus on surpassing RED's road length to claim the 2 VP bonus
4. Watch for development card opportunities if I get ore
5. Continue hampering RED's road-building capabilities
</plan>

Option 3 is clearly the best choice as it:
- Blocks a high-probability hex (8)
- Disrupts wood production which RED needs for roads
- Affects TWO of RED's settlements
- Directly supports my strategy of competing for longest road

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL SETTLEMENT PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Place settlements on high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Target at least one spot with good ore and wheat production for city development
- Try to secure at least one high-probability spot (5, 6, 8, 9) for each critical resource
- Place your second settlement to complement your first (fill resource gaps)
- Aim for access to all five resources or position near useful ports if resource diversity isn't possible
- Always consider which settlements opponents are likely to place and avoid areas that will become contested
- Place roads pointing toward valuable future expansion spots, not toward the center
- Consider the long-term impact: settlements that can't expand are less valuable

MID-GAME RESOURCE PRIORITIES:
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each possible build (cities: 1VP for 5 resources is most efficient)
- Early phase: Secure at least one good source of brick and wood for minimal expansion
- Growth phase: Prioritize ore and wheat production for city upgrades (3VP for 5 resources is optimal)
- Late phase: Focus on the fastest path to victory points, whether through buildings or development cards
- Avoid trading resources that opponents need for immediate victory point gains
- Use 4:1 trades only when necessary; prioritize port usage when possible

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and limited expansion options
- If you get an early knight, save it for defense or until you can start building toward largest army
- Time monopoly card usage for when opponents likely have accumulated specific resources
- Save year of plenty cards for completing crucial builds when you're short 1-2 specific resources
- Development cards are most valuable when:
  * You need hidden victory points to surprise opponents
  * You need knights to break up longest road or secure largest army
  * You're lacking wood/brick for expansion but have plenty of sheep/wheat/ore

EXPANSION STRATEGY:
- Build roads only with clear settlement locations in mind
- Target settlements that give you access to ports or new resources
- Block opponents' expansion paths when it gives you a strategic advantage
- Consider the timing of expansion vs. city upgrades based on your resource production
- Calculate whether longest road is achievable and worth the resource investment
- When deciding between a new settlement and a city upgrade, compare immediate vs. long-term returns

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-probability hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Save knight cards for breaking up opponent strategies or securing largest army
- Use knights defensively if you're producing valuable resources on high-probability hexes

TRADING TACTICS:
- Avoid trading resources that directly help opponents score points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades
- Trade excess resources before rolling 7 if you have more than 7 cards
- Consider bank/port trades when they enable an immediate build that advances your strategy
- When trading with players, try to receive resources that complete a build

ENDGAME STRATEGY:
- In the late game, hide your victory point potential (keep development cards hidden)
- Calculate the fastest path to 10 VP and focus exclusively on that path
- Be aware of the exact number of remaining development cards and their probabilities
- Track opponents' potential victory points, including hidden development cards
- If you're close to winning, prioritize actions that can be completed in a single turn

Before finalizing your action, check:
1. Is there a more efficient path to victory points?
2. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
3. Does this move help or hinder opponents?
4. Is there a defensive move needed to prevent an opponent from winning?
5. Are you properly diversified against dice probability?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game Analysis for Settlers of Catan

Let me thoroughly analyze my current situation and determine the optimal move.

## Current Game State
- I (BLUE) have 4 VP (2 cities = 4 VP)
- RED has 7 VP (5 settlements = 5 VP, plus longest road = 2 VP)
- RED is just 3 VP away from winning
- I have 3 wood, 1 sheep, and 4 wheat
- The robber is already on the wood hex (-1,1,0) with value 8, blocking RED's wood production
- My longest road is 6 segments vs RED's 7 segments

## Resource Analysis
With 3 wood, 1 sheep, and 4 wheat, my options are limited. I cannot:
- Build a settlement (need brick + wood + sheep + wheat)
- Build a city (need 3 ore + 2 wheat)
- Buy a development card (need ore + sheep + wheat)
- Build more than 1 road (each road costs 1 wood + 1 brick)

## Action Analysis:
1. Trade 4 wheat for 1 wood: This would give me 4 wood, but without brick I can't build roads.
2. Trade 4 wheat for 1 brick: This would allow me to build one road with my existing wood.
3. Trade 4 wheat for 1 ore: Does not enable any immediate build.
4. Trade 4 wheat for 1 sheep: Does not enable any immediate build.
0. End turn: Conserve resources for next turn.

## Strategic Considerations:
RED is at 7 VP, while I'm at only 4 VP. I'm significantly behind. My current plan focused on surpassing RED's road length, but without brick, I can't build roads.

If I trade 4 wheat for 1 brick, I would have 3 wood and 1 brick, allowing me to build only 1 road. This doesn't help me overcome RED's longest road.

The best option appears to be ending my turn and hoping for favorable dice rolls next turn. Trading away 4 wheat for limited gain doesn't seem effective - the trade ratio is too unfavorable.

<plan>
1. End my turn and conserve resources
2. Hope for brick and wood on next roll to build roads
3. Continue monitoring RED's progress - they're close to winning
4. If I get ore, consider development cards for knights to disrupt RED or for potential victory points
5. Continue targeting RED's resource production with the robber
</plan>

Without brick, I cannot effectively extend my road network. Trading at a 4:1 rate is too inefficient at this stage, especially when it doesn't enable a significant strategic advantage.

# Game Analysis

Let me analyze this Catan position carefully to determine the best action.

## Current Game State
- I (BLUE) have 4 VP: 2 cities (4 VP)
- RED has 7 VP: 5 settlements (5 VP) + Longest Road (2 VP)
- RED is closer to winning (7/10 VP vs my 4/10 VP)
- My resources: 3 🌲WOOD, 1 🐑SHEEP, 4 🌾WHEAT
- I have no development cards

## Strategic Assessment

RED is in a commanding position with 7 VP already, and they currently hold longest road. With 3 more points, they win. I need to find a way to catch up.

My current production:
- City at node 1: 🧱5, 🌾10, ⛏️4 (good mixed production)
- City at node 16: 🌲8 (excellent wood production)
- Robber is on the 🌲8 hex, blocking my best wood production

Since my only options this turn are to end my turn or make maritime trades, I need to decide if trading is beneficial.

## Trade Analysis
- I have 3 wood, 1 sheep, 4 wheat
- I can trade 4 wheat for 1 wood, brick, ore, or sheep
- If I trade wheat for brick, I could build a road next turn if I roll enough wood
- If I trade wheat for ore, I might be able to buy a development card next turn
- Keeping all my resources means I'm closer to a development card (need ore) or a settlement (need brick)

Looking at the available maritime trades, I would spend 4 wheat to get 1 resource. This is not efficient unless it enables an immediate build, which it doesn't. My wheat is valuable for future development cards or settlements, so trading it at a poor ratio doesn't make sense now.

## Conclusion
The best move is to end my turn. I should:
1. Conserve my resources for more efficient future builds
2. Hope for favorable rolls on my next turn
3. Continue targeting RED with the robber when possible
4. Look for opportunities to build roads and settlements to catch up

<plan>
1. End my turn and preserve my resources
2. If I get ore on next roll, buy a development card (hoping for VP or Knight)
3. If I get brick on next roll, build roads toward potential settlement locations
4. Continue targeting RED's best production hexes with the robber when possible
5. Look for opportunities to break RED's longest road or build my own
</plan>

Since no trade makes sense at this poor ratio, and I can't build anything this turn, I'll end my turn.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL SETTLEMENT PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Place settlements on high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Target at least one spot with good ore and wheat production for city development
- Try to secure at least one high-probability spot (5, 6, 8, 9) for each critical resource
- Place your second settlement to complement your first (fill resource gaps)
- Aim for access to all five resources or position near useful ports if resource diversity isn't possible
- Always consider which settlements opponents are likely to place and avoid areas that will become contested
- Place roads pointing toward valuable future expansion spots, not toward the center
- Consider the long-term impact: settlements that can't expand are less valuable

MID-GAME RESOURCE PRIORITIES:
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each possible build (cities: 1VP for 5 resources is most efficient)
- Early phase: Secure at least one good source of brick and wood for minimal expansion
- Growth phase: Prioritize ore and wheat production for city upgrades (3VP for 5 resources is optimal)
- Late phase: Focus on the fastest path to victory points, whether through buildings or development cards
- Avoid trading resources that opponents need for immediate victory point gains
- Use 4:1 trades only when necessary; prioritize port usage when possible

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and limited expansion options
- If you get an early knight, save it for defense or until you can start building toward largest army
- Time monopoly card usage for when opponents likely have accumulated specific resources
- Save year of plenty cards for completing crucial builds when you're short 1-2 specific resources
- Development cards are most valuable when:
  * You need hidden victory points to surprise opponents
  * You need knights to break up longest road or secure largest army
  * You're lacking wood/brick for expansion but have plenty of sheep/wheat/ore

EXPANSION STRATEGY:
- Build roads only with clear settlement locations in mind
- Target settlements that give you access to ports or new resources
- Block opponents' expansion paths when it gives you a strategic advantage
- Consider the timing of expansion vs. city upgrades based on your resource production
- Calculate whether longest road is achievable and worth the resource investment
- When deciding between a new settlement and a city upgrade, compare immediate vs. long-term returns

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-probability hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Save knight cards for breaking up opponent strategies or securing largest army
- Use knights defensively if you're producing valuable resources on high-probability hexes

TRADING TACTICS:
- Avoid trading resources that directly help opponents score points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades
- Trade excess resources before rolling 7 if you have more than 7 cards
- Consider bank/port trades when they enable an immediate build that advances your strategy
- When trading with players, try to receive resources that complete a build

ENDGAME STRATEGY:
- In the late game, hide your victory point potential (keep development cards hidden)
- Calculate the fastest path to 10 VP and focus exclusively on that path
- Be aware of the exact number of remaining development cards and their probabilities
- Track opponents' potential victory points, including hidden development cards
- If you're close to winning, prioritize actions that can be completed in a single turn

Before finalizing your action, check:
1. Is there a more efficient path to victory points?
2. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
3. Does this move help or hinder opponents?
4. Is there a defensive move needed to prevent an opponent from winning?
5. Are you properly diversified against dice probability?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game Analysis for Turn 162

Let me analyze the current game state to determine the optimal move:

## Current Victory Point Status
- BLUE (me): 4 VP (2 cities = 4 VP)
- RED: 7 VP (5 settlements = 5 VP + 2 VP for longest road)

RED is dangerously close to winning with 7/10 VP while I'm at 4/10 VP, making this a critical turn.

## Resource Analysis
I have: 3 🌲WOOD, 2 🧱BRICK, 1 🐑SHEEP, 6 🌾WHEAT, 0 ⛏️ORE
This is enough for:
- Building a settlement (1 WOOD, 1 BRICK, 1 WHEAT, 1 SHEEP)

## Available Options Review
1. End turn (action 0)
2. Build a settlement at nodes 19, 20, 22, or 23 (actions 1-4)
3. Trade wheat for other resources (actions 5-8)

## Settlement Option Analysis
Let me evaluate each potential settlement location:
- Node 19: Connected to desert (no production)
- Node 20: Connected to desert and ore (4 pip)
- Node 22: Connected to ore (4 pip)
- Node 23: Connected to ore (4 pip)

Building a settlement would give me +1 VP immediately (bringing me to 5/10 VP) and improve my resource production.

## Strategic Considerations
1. RED is 3 points ahead and could be close to victory
2. Adding ore production would diversify my resources (currently lacking ore completely)
3. Building a settlement now brings me to 5 VP, puts me in a better position
4. Building now uses my sheep, which I only have 1 of
5. Node 20 gives me access to both desert and ore, but ore is more valuable

## Decision Logic
Building a settlement is clearly better than ending my turn, as it:
1. Increases my VP count from 4 to 5
2. Improves my resource production
3. Uses resources that might otherwise be lost to a 7 roll
4. Places another building on the board that blocks RED from expansion

Among settlement options, node 20 offers the best returns by giving me access to ore (4) which I'm currently lacking completely. This will help me buy development cards later.

<plan>
1. Build settlement at node 20 to gain ore production
2. Look to break RED's longest road in future turns to remove their 2VP bonus
3. Start accumulating resources for development cards (especially victory points)
4. Continue targeting RED's best production hexes with the robber when possible
5. Work toward building my longest road

# Game State Analysis

Let me analyze my current situation and available options:

## Victory Points & Game Position
- I have 5 VP: 2 cities (4 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP)
- RED has 7 VP: 5 settlements (5 VP) + longest road (2 VP)
- RED is ahead by 2 VP and needs only 3 more VP to win

## My Resources
- 2 🌲WOOD
- 1 🧱BRICK
- 5 🌾WHEAT
- No ORE or SHEEP

## Available Actions
I only have end turn [0] or maritime trade options [1-4] with wheat at unfavorable 4:1 ratios.

## Production Analysis
I have good production of:
- Wheat (10 on city)
- Brick (5 on city)
- Wood (8 on city)
- Ore (4 on city and settlement)

## Strategic Assessment

RED is 3 VP away from winning, so I need to accelerate my own VP acquisition. Since I cannot build anything this turn with my current resources, I need to decide whether to trade or save my resources.

Looking ahead to future turns, I need to:
1. Continue expanding my road network to potentially claim longest road from RED
2. Build additional settlements at strategic locations
3. Consider development cards for potential VP or knights

With 5 wheat, I could trade for a resource I'll need for upcoming builds. Based on my current resources (2 wood, 1 brick), I'm closest to having enough for a road (1 wood + 1 brick). Getting another brick would allow me to build a road next turn if I roll more wood.

<plan>
1. Trade for a brick this turn to prepare for road building
2. Continue expanding road network toward breaking RED's longest road
3. Look to build additional settlements at strategic locations
4. Consider development cards once I secure ore production
5. Keep targeting RED's production with the robber when possible
</plan>

Therefore, I'll make a 4:1 trade with my wheat to get a brick, which will position me to build roads on my next turn.

# Game Analysis for Turn 168

Let me analyze the current game state and determine the optimal action.

## Current Status
- I (BLUE) have 5 VP with 2 cities (4 VP), 1 settlement (1 VP)
- RED has 7 VP with 5 settlements (5 VP) and longest road bonus (2 VP)
- RED is closer to winning with 7/10 VP
- I have 2 🌲WOOD, 2 🧱BRICK, 1 🌾WHEAT, 6 ⛏️ORE

## Victory Path Analysis
To win, I need 5 more VP. Options:
- Break RED's longest road (-2 VP for them) and claim it myself (+2 VP)
- Build 1-2 more settlements (+1-2 VP)
- Upgrade my settlement to a city (+1 VP)
- Buy development cards for potential VP or knights

## Resource Assessment
- I can't build a city (need 3 ore, 2 wheat; have 6 ore but only 1 wheat)
- I can't build a settlement (need 1 wood, 1 brick, 1 sheep, 1 wheat; missing sheep)
- I can't buy a development card (need 1 ore, 1 wheat, 1 sheep; missing sheep)
- I can build 1 road (need 1 wood, 1 brick; have 2 of each)

## Strategic Options
1. Build a road to extend my network toward breaking RED's longest road
2. Trade 4 ore for 1 sheep to enable settlement or development card purchase
3. End turn and wait for better resource rolls

## Action Decision
My current plan involves targeting RED's longest road. I currently have the resources to build a road (2 wood, 2 brick), which advances this strategy without needing to trade. However, building a settlement would be more valuable than just extending my road network.

If I trade 4 ore for 1 sheep, I would have the resources for either:
- A settlement (1 wood, 1 brick, 1 sheep, 1 wheat) which gives me +1 VP immediately
- A development card (1 ore, 1 wheat, 1 sheep) which could provide a knight or victory point

Since settlements provide immediate VP and future resource production, this is the optimal path.

<plan>
1. Trade 4 ore for 1 sheep this turn
2. Build a settlement to gain 1 VP and increase resource production
3. Continue working toward breaking RED's longest road
4. Consider development cards with future resources
</plan>

Therefore, I should trade 4 ore for 1 sheep:

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL SETTLEMENT PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Place settlements on high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Target at least one spot with good ore and wheat production for city development
- Try to secure at least one high-probability spot (5, 6, 8, 9) for each critical resource
- Place your second settlement to complement your first (fill resource gaps)
- Aim for access to all five resources or position near useful ports if resource diversity isn't possible
- Always consider which settlements opponents are likely to place and avoid areas that will become contested
- Place roads pointing toward valuable future expansion spots, not toward the center
- Consider the long-term impact: settlements that can't expand are less valuable

MID-GAME RESOURCE PRIORITIES:
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each possible build (cities: 1VP for 5 resources is most efficient)
- Early phase: Secure at least one good source of brick and wood for minimal expansion
- Growth phase: Prioritize ore and wheat production for city upgrades (3VP for 5 resources is optimal)
- Late phase: Focus on the fastest path to victory points, whether through buildings or development cards
- Avoid trading resources that opponents need for immediate victory point gains
- Use 4:1 trades only when necessary; prioritize port usage when possible

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and limited expansion options
- If you get an early knight, save it for defense or until you can start building toward largest army
- Time monopoly card usage for when opponents likely have accumulated specific resources
- Save year of plenty cards for completing crucial builds when you're short 1-2 specific resources
- Development cards are most valuable when:
  * You need hidden victory points to surprise opponents
  * You need knights to break up longest road or secure largest army
  * You're lacking wood/brick for expansion but have plenty of sheep/wheat/ore

EXPANSION STRATEGY:
- Build roads only with clear settlement locations in mind
- Target settlements that give you access to ports or new resources
- Block opponents' expansion paths when it gives you a strategic advantage
- Consider the timing of expansion vs. city upgrades based on your resource production
- Calculate whether longest road is achievable and worth the resource investment
- When deciding between a new settlement and a city upgrade, compare immediate vs. long-term returns

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-probability hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Save knight cards for breaking up opponent strategies or securing largest army
- Use knights defensively if you're producing valuable resources on high-probability hexes

TRADING TACTICS:
- Avoid trading resources that directly help opponents score points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades
- Trade excess resources before rolling 7 if you have more than 7 cards
- Consider bank/port trades when they enable an immediate build that advances your strategy
- When trading with players, try to receive resources that complete a build

ENDGAME STRATEGY:
- In the late game, hide your victory point potential (keep development cards hidden)
- Calculate the fastest path to 10 VP and focus exclusively on that path
- Be aware of the exact number of remaining development cards and their probabilities
- Track opponents' potential victory points, including hidden development cards
- If you're close to winning, prioritize actions that can be completed in a single turn

Before finalizing your action, check:
1. Is there a more efficient path to victory points?
2. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
3. Does this move help or hinder opponents?
4. Is there a defensive move needed to prevent an opponent from winning?
5. Are you properly diversified against dice probability?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 168 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Trade 4 ore for 1 sheep this turn
2. Build a settlement to gain 1 VP and increase resource production
3. Continue working toward breaking RED's longest road
4. Consider development cards with future resources
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.

RESPONSE:
# Game Analysis: Turn 168

Let me assess the current game state and available options:

## Victory Point Status
- BLUE (me): 5/10 VP
- RED: 7/10 VP (includes +2 VP from Longest Road)
- RED is closer to winning, only needing 3 more points

## Resource Analysis
I currently have: 2 🌲, 2 🧱, 1 🐑, 1 🌾, 2 ⛏️

## Available Actions
[0] End turn
[1] Build settlement at node 23 (costs: 1 🌲, 1 🧱, 1 🌾, 1 🐑)
[2] Buy development card (costs: 1 🐑, 1 🌾, 1 ⛏️)

## Strategic Decision Making

Option 1: Build Settlement at node 23
- Gains: +1 VP (bringing me to 6/10), additional ⛏️4 production
- Costs: Uses all my brick, wood, wheat and sheep
- Benefit: Increases my production of ore, which is valuable for cities
- Progress: Gets me closer to victory (6/10 points)

Option 2: Buy Development Card
- Potential gains: Could be Victory Point (25% chance), Knight (40% chance) or other
- If Knight: Could help toward Largest Army (+2 VP) but I only have 1 played so far
- If VP card: Immediate hidden progress toward victory
- Costs: 1 🐑, 1 🌾, 1 ⛏️
- Leaves me with: 2 🌲, 2 🧱, 1 ⛏️
- Risk: Could get a card that doesn't immediately help

Option 0: End Turn
- No direct benefit
- No progress toward victory

## Critical Analysis
1. RED is at 7 VP and could be close to winning
2. I need to make progress quickly
3. A guaranteed VP from settlement is better than a chance at a useful development card
4. The settlement also provides additional production (ore)
5. Building at node 23 increases my presence on the board

<plan>
1. Build settlement at node 23 this turn for +1 VP
2. Continue collecting resources, particularly ore and wheat for city upgrades
3. Work toward breaking RED's longest road if possible
4. Consider development cards in future turns if excess resources are available
</plan>

Given RED's lead and the guaranteed VP from a settlement, I should choose option 1 to build a settlement at node 23.

# Game Analysis for Settlers of Catan

Let me carefully analyze the current game state and make the optimal decision.

## Current Situation Assessment
- I'm BLUE with 6 VP (2 settlements + 2 cities + 1 VP from played knight)
- RED has 7 VP (5 settlements + 2 VP from longest road)
- My resources: 3 Wood, 5 Brick, 1 Ore
- The robber is on the Ore hex (1,0,-1), limiting our ore production

## Victory Path Analysis
To win, I need 4 more VP. Potential sources:
- Building 4 more settlements (unlikely with limited space)
- Upgrading 2 settlements to cities (need 6 ore + 4 wheat)
- Taking longest road from RED (+2 VP) - would need 6 more road segments
- Development cards (possibly VP cards or knights for largest army)

## Available Actions Review
My options are:
- End turn
- Trade 4 Brick for another resource (sheep, wood, wheat, or ore)

## Analysis of Trading Options
I have 5 brick, which is excessive given my current needs. Trading for a strategic resource makes sense:
- Sheep: Only useful for development cards currently
- Wood: I already have 3 wood
- Wheat: Needed for cities and development cards
- Ore: Critical for city upgrades or development cards

Looking at my current plan, I was hoping to build a settlement at node 23 this turn, but I notice I already have a settlement there. This means my plan needs revision.

Based on my resources (3 wood, 5 brick, 1 ore), I could build roads (need wood+brick) or trade for resources to work toward a city (need ore+wheat) or development cards.

## Best Trade Decision
Given that:
1. I need to catch up to RED (7 VP vs my 6 VP)
2. City upgrades are the most efficient VP gain (1 VP for 3 ore + 2 wheat)
3. I already have 1 ore, acquiring more ore would get me closer to a city upgrade

The most valuable trade would be to exchange 4 brick for 1 ore, increasing my ore count to 2. This gets me closer to upgrading one of my settlements to a city.

<plan>
1. Trade 4 brick for 1 ore this turn
2. Focus on collecting more ore and wheat for city upgrades (most efficient VP gain)
3. Consider using roads strategically to break RED's longest road if opportunity arises
4. With limited brick remaining after trade, prioritize expansion only if valuable opportunities appear
</plan>

Therefore, I'll choose action #4: Trade 4 brick for 1 ore.

5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL SETTLEMENT PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Place settlements on high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Target at least one spot with good ore and wheat production for city development
- Try to secure at least one high-probability spot (5, 6, 8, 9) for each critical resource
- Place your second settlement to complement your first (fill resource gaps)
- Aim for access to all five resources or position near useful ports if resource diversity isn't possible
- Always consider which settlements opponents are likely to place and avoid areas that will become contested
- Place roads pointing toward valuable future expansion spots, not toward the center
- Consider the long-term impact: settlements that can't expand are less valuable

MID-GAME RESOURCE PRIORITIES:
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each possible build (cities: 1VP for 5 resources is most efficient)
- Early phase: Secure at least one good source of brick and wood for minimal expansion
- Growth phase: Prioritize ore and wheat production for city upgrades (3VP for 5 resources is optimal)
- Late phase: Focus on the fastest path to victory points, whether through buildings or development cards
- Avoid trading resources that opponents need for immediate victory point gains
- Use 4:1 trades only when necessary; prioritize port usage when possible

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and limited expansion options
- If you get an early knight, save it for defense or until you can start building toward largest army
- Time monopoly card usage for when opponents likely have accumulated specific resources
- Save year of plenty cards for completing crucial builds when you're short 1-2 specific resources
- Development cards are most valuable when:
  * You need hidden victory points to surprise opponents
  * You need knights to break up longest road or secure largest army
  * You're lacking wood/brick for expansion but have plenty of sheep/wheat/ore

EXPANSION STRATEGY:
- Build roads only with clear settlement locations in mind
- Target settlements that give you access to ports or new resources
- Block opponents' expansion paths when it gives you a strategic advantage
- Consider the timing of expansion vs. city upgrades based on your resource production
- Calculate whether longest road is achievable and worth the resource investment
- When deciding between a new settlement and a city upgrade, compare immediate vs. long-term returns

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-probability hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Save knight cards for breaking up opponent strategies or securing largest army
- Use knights defensively if you're producing valuable resources on high-probability hexes

TRADING TACTICS:
- Avoid trading resources that directly help opponents score points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades
- Trade excess resources before rolling 7 if you have more than 7 cards
- Consider bank/port trades when they enable an immediate build that advances your strategy
- When trading with players, try to receive resources that complete a build

ENDGAME STRATEGY:
- In the late game, hide your victory point potential (keep development cards hidden)
- Calculate the fastest path to 10 VP and focus exclusively on that path
- Be aware of the exact number of remaining development cards and their probabilities
- Track opponents' potential victory points, including hidden development cards
- If you're close to winning, prioritize actions that can be completed in a single turn

Before finalizing your action, check:
1. Is there a more efficient path to victory points?
2. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
3. Does this move help or hinder opponents?
4. Is there a defensive move needed to prevent an opponent from winning?
5. Are you properly diversified against dice probability?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 178 | Player: BLUE | Action: MOVE_ROBBER

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Trade 4 brick for 1 ore this turn
2. Focus on collecting more ore and wheat for city upgrades (most efficient VP gain)
3. Consider using roads strategically to break RED's longest road if opportunity arises
4. With limited brick remaining after trade, prioritize expansion only if valuable opportunities appear
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.

# Analyzing Robber Placement Options

I need to place the robber strategically to maximize my chances of winning while hindering my opponent who is currently ahead with 7 VP versus my 6 VP.

Let me examine each option:

**[0] Move robber to (0, 0, 0) - Brick (5) and steal from RED**
- This is a 5-number brick hex
- RED has a settlement at node 4 producing from this hex
- Blocking this reduces RED's brick production, which could slow down road building

**[1] Move robber to (1, -1, 0) - Wheat (10) and steal from RED**
- This is a 10-number wheat hex
- RED has two settlements (nodes 7 and 9) producing from this hex
- This would block multiple settlements and a key resource for development cards and cities

**[2] Move robber to (0, -1, 1) - Sheep (9) and steal from RED**
- This is a 9-number sheep hex
- RED has two settlements (nodes 9 and 12) producing from this
- Sheep is needed for development cards

**[3] Move robber to (-1, 0, 1) - Wheat (3) and steal from RED**
- This is only a 3-number wheat hex
- RED has two settlements (nodes 4 and 12) producing from this
- Low probability number makes this less impactful

**[4] Move robber to (-1, 1, 0) - Wood (8) and steal from RED**
- This is an 8-number wood hex
- RED has two settlements (nodes 4 and 17) producing from this
- This is RED's best wood production and has high probability

**[5] Move robber to (0, 1, -1) - Desert**
- This is the desert, which produces nothing
- Placing here would be completely ineffective

## Strategic Evaluation

Looking at RED's position:
- They have 7 VP already (including 2 VP from longest road)
- They have 7 hidden resource cards
- They're likely looking to build more or purchase development cards

My priorities:
1. Block RED's most valuable production
2. Steal a useful resource
3. Protect my future strategy to reach 10 VP

Option [4] appears optimal because:
- It targets RED's highest probability resource (wood on 8)
- Wood is crucial for RED to extend longest road further
- RED has two settlements producing from this hex
- 8 is one of the highest probability numbers

<plan>
1. Move robber to wood (8) to block RED's best resource production
2. Continue with collecting ore and wheat for city upgrades
3. Watch RED's resources carefully - they're close to victory
4. Consider development cards if I get sheep
5. Focus on either breaking RED's longest road or building to 10 VP directly through cities and settlements
</plan>

RESPONSE:
I need to analyze the robber placement options to strategically block RED's key resources while potentially stealing something valuable.

Let me examine each hex where I can place the robber:

Option [0]: Move to (0, 0, 0) - Brick 5
- This is a high-probability brick hex (5 = ⭐⭐)
- RED has a settlement here (node 4)
- BLUE also has a city here (node 1)
- Blocking this would hurt my own brick production, which I need for expansion

Option [1]: Move to (1, -1, 0) - Wheat 10
- This is a wheat hex (10 = ⭐)
- RED has two settlements here (nodes 7 and 9)
- BLUE has a city here (node 1)
- This would block RED's two wheat producers but also my own wheat production

Option [2]: Move to (0, -1, 1) - Sheep 9
- This is a good sheep hex (9 = ⭐⭐)
- RED has two settlements here (nodes 9 and 12)
- BLUE has no buildings here
- This would block RED's sheep production without affecting me

Option [3]: Move to (-1, 0, 1) - Wheat 3
- This is a low-probability wheat hex (3 = ⭐)
- RED has two settlements here (nodes 4 and 12)
- BLUE has no buildings here
- This would only block RED's low-probability wheat

Option [4]: Move to (0, 1, -1) - Desert
- This is a desert hex with no production
- Placing the robber here would be ineffective

Option [5]: Move to (1, 0, -1) - Ore 4
- This is an ore hex (4 = ⭐)
- RED has no settlements here
- BLUE has a city (node 1) and two settlements (nodes 20 and 23)
- Placing here would hurt my ore production, which is crucial for cities

Strategic analysis:
1. RED is at 7 VP to my 6 VP, so slowing them down is critical
2. RED currently has the longest road (11 segments) which gives them +2 VP
3. I need to block RED's best resource production
4. Option [2] (sheep 9) seems most effective as it blocks a good RED resource without affecting my production
5. RED has multiple sheep-producing settlements, which they need for development cards

<plan>
1. Move robber to sheep (9) to block RED's best resource production without hurting my own production
2. Continue collecting ore and wheat for city upgrades
3. Watch RED's resources carefully - they're close to victory
4. Use my one brick and one wood to expand toward breaking RED's longest road
5. With my 4 wheat and 1 ore, I'm close to building another city or buying development cards
</plan>

The optimal choice is to move the robber to the sheep hex with a probability of 9, which blocks RED's sheep production without affecting my own resource generation.

# Game State Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state and options:

## Victory Point Status
- BLUE (me): 6/10 VP (2 cities at 2 VP each, 2 settlements at 1 VP each)
- RED: 7/10 VP (5 settlements at 1 VP each + 2 VP for longest road)

RED is ahead by 1 VP and will win if they get 3 more points.

## Production Analysis
My production is strong in wheat (can generate 3 wheat on a roll of 5 or 10) and fair in ore (3 production points across three settlements/cities).

## Resources on Hand
- 1 Wood
- 1 Brick
- 5 Wheat
- 1 Ore

## Available Actions
- End turn
- Trade 4 wheat for various resources

## Strategic Options

1. **Buy a Development Card**: I need 1 ore, 1 wheat, 1 sheep. I have wheat and ore but no sheep.
2. **Build a Settlement**: Need 1 wood, 1 brick, 1 wheat, 1 sheep. I have wood, brick, and wheat but no sheep.
3. **Upgrade to City**: Need 3 ore, 2 wheat. I have 1 ore and 5 wheat, so I'm short 2 ore.
4. **Maritime Trade**: I could trade 4 wheat for 1 sheep, which would let me buy a development card.

## Decision Analysis

The most pressing concern is that RED is at 7 VP and has longest road (11 segments). I'm at 6 VP with only a 6-segment road.

Looking at my options:
- Trading 4 wheat for 1 sheep would allow me to buy a development card, which has a 1/5 chance of being a victory point card.
- Trading 4 wheat for 1 ore would get me closer to a city upgrade, but I'd still need one more ore.
- If I end my turn now, I keep my resources for next turn when I might roll better combinations.

A development card could be vital - either a victory point card (immediate hidden VP), a knight (to potentially get largest army later), or a progress card that could help me build more efficiently.

<plan>
1. Trade 4 wheat for 1 sheep to buy a development card
2. Focus on breaking RED's longest road or securing largest army
3. Continue building toward city upgrades when more ore becomes available
4. Watch RED closely as they're only 3 VP away from winning
</plan>

I believe the optimal play is to trade for sheep and aim for a development card. This gives me the best chance of either gaining a hidden VP or getting knights to work toward largest army.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL SETTLEMENT PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Place settlements on high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Target at least one spot with good ore and wheat production for city development
- Try to secure at least one high-probability spot (5, 6, 8, 9) for each critical resource
- Place your second settlement to complement your first (fill resource gaps)
- Aim for access to all five resources or position near useful ports if resource diversity isn't possible
- Always consider which settlements opponents are likely to place and avoid areas that will become contested
- Place roads pointing toward valuable future expansion spots, not toward the center
- Consider the long-term impact: settlements that can't expand are less valuable

MID-GAME RESOURCE PRIORITIES:
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each possible build (cities: 1VP for 5 resources is most efficient)
- Early phase: Secure at least one good source of brick and wood for minimal expansion
- Growth phase: Prioritize ore and wheat production for city upgrades (3VP for 5 resources is optimal)
- Late phase: Focus on the fastest path to victory points, whether through buildings or development cards
- Avoid trading resources that opponents need for immediate victory point gains
- Use 4:1 trades only when necessary; prioritize port usage when possible

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and limited expansion options
- If you get an early knight, save it for defense or until you can start building toward largest army
- Time monopoly card usage for when opponents likely have accumulated specific resources
- Save year of plenty cards for completing crucial builds when you're short 1-2 specific resources
- Development cards are most valuable when:
  * You need hidden victory points to surprise opponents
  * You need knights to break up longest road or secure largest army
  * You're lacking wood/brick for expansion but have plenty of sheep/wheat/ore

EXPANSION STRATEGY:
- Build roads only with clear settlement locations in mind
- Target settlements that give you access to ports or new resources
- Block opponents' expansion paths when it gives you a strategic advantage
- Consider the timing of expansion vs. city upgrades based on your resource production
- Calculate whether longest road is achievable and worth the resource investment
- When deciding between a new settlement and a city upgrade, compare immediate vs. long-term returns

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-probability hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Save knight cards for breaking up opponent strategies or securing largest army
- Use knights defensively if you're producing valuable resources on high-probability hexes

TRADING TACTICS:
- Avoid trading resources that directly help opponents score points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades
- Trade excess resources before rolling 7 if you have more than 7 cards
- Consider bank/port trades when they enable an immediate build that advances your strategy
- When trading with players, try to receive resources that complete a build

ENDGAME STRATEGY:
- In the late game, hide your victory point potential (keep development cards hidden)
- Calculate the fastest path to 10 VP and focus exclusively on that path
- Be aware of the exact number of remaining development cards and their probabilities
- Track opponents' potential victory points, including hidden development cards
- If you're close to winning, prioritize actions that can be completed in a single turn

Before finalizing your action, check:
1. Is there a more efficient path to victory points?
2. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
3. Does this move help or hinder opponents?
4. Is there a defensive move needed to prevent an opponent from winning?
5. Are you properly diversified against dice probability?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 180 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Trade 4 wheat for 1 sheep to buy a development card
2. Focus on breaking RED's longest road or securing largest army
3. Continue building toward city upgrades when more ore becomes available
4. Watch RED closely as they're only 3 VP away from winning
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.

# Game Analysis for Settlers of Catan

Let me analyze the current game state and my options:

## Current Status Assessment:
- I (BLUE) have 6 VP: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP)
- RED has 7 VP: 5 settlements (5 VP) + Longest Road (2 VP)
- RED is 3 VP away from winning (needs to reach 10 VP)
- I have resources: 1 wood, 1 brick, 1 sheep, 1 wheat, 1 ore
- I have only two options: End Turn [0] or Buy Development Card [1]

## Development Card Analysis:
If I buy a development card for 1 sheep, 1 wheat, and 1 ore, what are the possible outcomes?
- Knight (14/25 probability): Would give me 1 knight played total, still need 2 more for Largest Army
- Victory Point (5/25 probability): Immediate hidden VP, bringing me to 7 VP
- Road Building (2/25 probability): Could help extend my road network
- Year of Plenty (2/25 probability): Get 2 resources of my choice
- Monopoly (2/25 probability): Take all resources of one type from other players

## Strategic Considerations:
1. If I end my turn, I keep my resources but make no progress
2. If I buy a development card:
   - Knight is most likely outcome (~56% chance)
   - A victory point card would be excellent (~20% chance)
   - Other cards would provide future strategic options
3. Looking at RED's position:
   - They have 7 VP and Longest Road
   - Breaking their Longest Road could reduce them to 5 VP
   - But I can't do that this turn with my current resources

## Decision Logic:
- I need to progress toward 10 VP
- Development cards offer both hidden VP potential and strategic options
- After buying a card, I'll have 0 resources left, but will roll for new resources next turn
- RED is ahead, so I need to make progress each turn when possible

<plan>
1. Buy a development card now
2. If I get a Knight, save it to potentially break RED's Longest Road or work toward Largest Army
3. If I get a VP card, keep it hidden until I can win in one turn
4. On next turn, focus on either breaking RED's Longest Road or building another settlement/city
5. Monitor RED's progress closely - they're only 3 VP away from winning
</plan>

The optimal choice is to buy a development card, as it progresses my strategy toward reaching 10 VP and potentially provides a hidden victory point or useful special ability.

RESPONSE:
I need to analyze the current game state and determine the best action between playing my Knight card or rolling the dice.

### Game State Analysis:
- I (BLUE) have 6 VP: 2 VP from settlements, 4 VP from cities
- RED has 7 VP: 5 VP from settlements, 2 VP from Longest Road
- I have 1 wood resource and 1 Knight card
- RED has 11-segment Longest Road, giving them a 2 VP bonus
- I'm 4 VP from winning, RED is 3 VP from winning

### Option 0: Play Knight Card
If I play the Knight card:
- I can move the robber from the ore hex (1,0,-1) to another location
- I can steal a card from RED (who has 4 cards)
- I would have 2 Knights played, getting closer to Largest Army (3 Knights needed)
- RED's longest road is a significant advantage (2 VP), but playing a Knight doesn't directly address this

### Option 1: Roll the Dice
If I roll the dice:
- I could potentially gain resources based on my production
- I have cities/settlements producing on 4, 5, 8, and 10
- With only 1 wood currently, I need more resources for building
- If I roll a 7, I could use the robber strategically and steal from RED

### Strategic Considerations:
- My current plan includes buying a development card, which requires 1 ore + 1 wheat + 1 sheep
- I currently only have 1 wood, so I need to acquire more resources
- Playing the Knight now doesn't align with my immediate building needs
- RED is closer to winning than I am (7 VP vs my 6 VP)
- I should save the Knight for a more strategic moment (breaking RED's road, emergency defense, etc.)

Based on my current state, rolling the dice is more valuable as I need resources to execute my plan. I'll save the Knight for a more critical moment when it can have a bigger impact on the game.

<plan>
1. Roll the dice to collect resources
2. Focus on acquiring ore, wheat, and sheep to buy development cards
3. If I get enough resources, buy a development card this turn
4. Save the Knight card to potentially break RED's Longest Road at a critical moment
5. Work toward getting Largest Army (need 1 more Knight)
6. Continue monitoring RED's progress closely as they're 3 VP from winning

1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL SETTLEMENT PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Place settlements on high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Target at least one spot with good ore and wheat production for city development
- Try to secure at least one high-probability spot (5, 6, 8, 9) for each critical resource
- Place your second settlement to complement your first (fill resource gaps)
- Aim for access to all five resources or position near useful ports if resource diversity isn't possible
- Always consider which settlements opponents are likely to place and avoid areas that will become contested
- Place roads pointing toward valuable future expansion spots, not toward the center
- Consider the long-term impact: settlements that can't expand are less valuable

MID-GAME RESOURCE PRIORITIES:
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each possible build (cities: 1VP for 5 resources is most efficient)
- Early phase: Secure at least one good source of brick and wood for minimal expansion
- Growth phase: Prioritize ore and wheat production for city upgrades (3VP for 5 resources is optimal)
- Late phase: Focus on the fastest path to victory points, whether through buildings or development cards
- Avoid trading resources that opponents need for immediate victory point gains
- Use 4:1 trades only when necessary; prioritize port usage when possible

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and limited expansion options
- If you get an early knight, save it for defense or until you can start building toward largest army
- Time monopoly card usage for when opponents likely have accumulated specific resources
- Save year of plenty cards for completing crucial builds when you're short 1-2 specific resources
- Development cards are most valuable when:
  * You need hidden victory points to surprise opponents
  * You need knights to break up longest road or secure largest army
  * You're lacking wood/brick for expansion but have plenty of sheep/wheat/ore

EXPANSION STRATEGY:
- Build roads only with clear settlement locations in mind
- Target settlements that give you access to ports or new resources
- Block opponents' expansion paths when it gives you a strategic advantage
- Consider the timing of expansion vs. city upgrades based on your resource production
- Calculate whether longest road is achievable and worth the resource investment
- When deciding between a new settlement and a city upgrade, compare immediate vs. long-term returns

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-probability hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Save knight cards for breaking up opponent strategies or securing largest army
- Use knights defensively if you're producing valuable resources on high-probability hexes

TRADING TACTICS:
- Avoid trading resources that directly help opponents score points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades
- Trade excess resources before rolling 7 if you have more than 7 cards
- Consider bank/port trades when they enable an immediate build that advances your strategy
- When trading with players, try to receive resources that complete a build

ENDGAME STRATEGY:
- In the late game, hide your victory point potential (keep development cards hidden)
- Calculate the fastest path to 10 VP and focus exclusively on that path
- Be aware of the exact number of remaining development cards and their probabilities
- Track opponents' potential victory points, including hidden development cards
- If you're close to winning, prioritize actions that can be completed in a single turn

Before finalizing your action, check:
1. Is there a more efficient path to victory points?
2. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
3. Does this move help or hinder opponents?
4. Is there a defensive move needed to prevent an opponent from winning?
5. Are you properly diversified against dice probability?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 182 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Roll the dice to collect resources
2. Focus on acquiring ore, wheat, and sheep to buy development cards
3. If I get enough resources, buy a development card this turn
4. Save the Knight card to potentially break RED's Longest Road at a critical moment
5. Work toward getting Largest Army (need 1 more Knight)
6. Continue monitoring RED's progress closely as they're 3 VP from winning
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.
  To adjust your plan, provide a NEW PLAN in your reasoning with <plan>your new plan</plan>

# Game Analysis

Let me analyze the current game situation and make a strategic decision:

## Current Situation:
- I (BLUE) have 6 VP (2 cities = 4 VP, 2 settlements = 2 VP)
- RED has 7 VP (5 settlements = 5 VP, Longest Road = 2 VP)
- I have 1 Knight card in hand and 1 already played
- RED has no development cards but has Longest Road with 11 segments
- I have only 3 resources: 1 Wood and 2 Wheat
- The robber is currently on an Ore hex (1,0,-1) with value 4, which I'm producing from two settlements

## Strategic Considerations:

1. RED is at 7 VP, only 3 away from winning
2. I need 4 more VP to win
3. RED has Longest Road (2 VP) - breaking this would reduce their VP count
4. I can potentially get Largest Army (2 VP) by playing 1 more Knight (I've played 1, need 3 total)
5. The robber is blocking one of my Ore-producing hexes, limiting my ability to get resources for development cards or cities

## Options Analysis:

**Option 0: Play Knight Card**
- Benefits:
  - Move the robber off my Ore hex, allowing me to produce Ore again
  - Steal a resource from RED, potentially disrupting their plans
  - Get closer to Largest Army (would need 1 more Knight after this)
- Downsides:
  - Uses my Knight now rather than saving it for a more strategic moment

**Option 1: End Turn**
- Benefits:
  - Save Knight card for a more critical moment
  - Potentially roll better on next turn
- Downsides:
  - Continue being blocked on Ore production
  - RED continues progress toward their victory

## Decision Logic:

I'm currently resource-poor with only 3 cards. The robber is blocking my Ore production, which is critical for buying development cards and cities. Playing the Knight will:
1. Unblock my Ore hex
2. Allow me to steal a card from RED (who has 6 resources)
3. Get me closer to Largest Army

The opportunity cost of waiting is too high, as I need resources to make progress toward 10 VP. Even if I roll well next turn, I'll still be blocked on Ore unless I move the robber now.

<plan>
1. Play Knight card to move robber off my Ore hex
2. Target RED's best producing hex (Sheep 9 or Wood 8)
3. Steal a resource from RED
4. Continue working toward Largest Army (need 1 more Knight)
5. Use restored Ore production to buy development cards
6. If I get another Knight, I'll gain Largest Army (+2 VP)
7. Consider building additional settlements if I get brick and wood
</plan>

Given my resource scarcity and the need to unblock my Ore production, I'll play my Knight card.

# Analyzing Robber Movement Options

I'll analyze each option to determine the most strategic robber placement:

## Evaluating Game State
- I'm BLUE with 6 VP, RED has 7 VP (including +2 for Longest Road)
- Robber is currently on hex (1, 0, -1) which is my Ore hex
- My goal: Remove robber from my resource and disrupt RED's production

## Analyzing Robber Options:

**[0] Move robber to (0, 0, 0) and steal from RED**
- This is the Brick 5 hex (high probability)
- RED has a settlement here producing Brick
- Stealing brick could help me expand and block RED

**[1] Move robber to (1, -1, 0) and steal from RED**
- This is the Wheat 10 hex
- RED has two settlements here (nodes 7 and 9)
- Decent disruption target

**[2] Move robber to (0, -1, 1) and steal from RED**
- This is the Sheep 9 hex (high probability)
- RED has two settlements here (nodes 9 and 12)
- Excellent disruption target as it blocks two settlements on a good number

**[3] Move robber to (-1, 0, 1) and steal from RED**
- This is the Wheat 3 hex (low probability)
- RED has settlements at nodes 4 and 12
- Low impact choice due to poor probability

**[4] Move robber to (-1, 1, 0) and steal from RED**
- This is the Wood 8 hex (high probability)
- RED has settlements at nodes 4 and 17
- Excellent disruption target since it's their best wood production

**[5] Move robber to (0, 1, -1)**
- This is the Desert hex
- No resources produced here
- Wasting the robber move

## Strategic Decision Making
- RED is ahead by 1 VP and has 6 resources
- I should target their highest-producing hexes
- Best options are the Sheep 9 hex [2] or Wood 8 hex [4]
- Wood 8 affects two of RED's settlements including their valuable Wood production
- Sheep 9 also affects two settlements with good probability

<plan>
1. Move robber to Wood 8 hex to disrupt RED's critical resource production
2. Steal a resource from RED
3. Continue working toward Largest Army (need 1 more Knight)
4. Use restored Ore production to buy development cards
5. If I get another Knight, I'll gain Largest Army (+2 VP)
6. Consider building additional settlements if I get brick and wood
</plan>

The Wood 8 hex [4] is the optimal choice as it disrupts RED's best production resource (8 is high probability). This will slow RED down while I work toward Largest Army.

# Game Analysis and Action Selection

Let me analyze the current game state and my available options to make the optimal decision.

## Current Game Status
- **Victory Points**: I have 6/10 VP vs RED's 7/10 VP
- **My Resources**: 2 Wood, 2 Wheat, 4 Ore
- **My Production**: Strong in Ore (3 sources), decent in Brick and Wheat, limited in Wood
- **Robber**: Currently on Wood 8 hex, blocking a critical resource for both RED and me
- **Development Cards**: I've played 2 Knights (need 1 more for Largest Army)
- **RED's advantage**: Has Longest Road (+2 VP) and 7 cards in hand

## Available Actions
0. End turn
1. Upgrade settlement at node 20 to city (Cost: 2 Wheat, 3 Ore)
2. Upgrade settlement at node 23 to city (Cost: 2 Wheat, 3 Ore)
3-6. Maritime trades (trading 4 Ore for other resources)

## Strategic Considerations

1. **Victory Point Path**: I need 4 more VP to win. RED needs 3 more VP.

2. **City Upgrade Analysis**:
   - I only have 2 Wheat but need 2 for a city upgrade
   - I have 4 Ore but need 3 for a city upgrade
   - Neither city upgrade is possible with current resources

3. **Trading Considerations**:
   - Trading 4 Ore for 1 Wheat would enable a city upgrade
   - This is a 4:1 trade ratio which is inefficient but may be necessary
   - City upgrade would give +1 VP and improve production

4. **Development Card Strategy**:
   - No option to buy development cards this turn
   - My previous plan focused on getting Largest Army (+2 VP)

5. **End Turn Option**:
   - Ending turn preserves resources for next turn
   - I'll produce more resources before my next decision point
   - RED is at 7/10 VP and has 7 cards, making them a threat

<plan>
1. End my turn to collect more resources
2. Continue working toward city upgrades and development cards
3. On next turn, prioritize either:
   a) Buy development card hoping for Knight (for Largest Army +2VP)
   b) Upgrade settlement to city if I get sufficient Wheat
4. Monitor RED's progress closely - they're only 3 VP from winning
</plan>

Since I cannot currently build either city (insufficient Wheat), and trading 4 Ore for 1 Wheat would be very inefficient when I might naturally produce Wheat on my next turn, the optimal action is to end my turn.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL SETTLEMENT PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Place settlements on high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Target at least one spot with good ore and wheat production for city development
- Try to secure at least one high-probability spot (5, 6, 8, 9) for each critical resource
- Place your second settlement to complement your first (fill resource gaps)
- Aim for access to all five resources or position near useful ports if resource diversity isn't possible
- Always consider which settlements opponents are likely to place and avoid areas that will become contested
- Place roads pointing toward valuable future expansion spots, not toward the center
- Consider the long-term impact: settlements that can't expand are less valuable

MID-GAME RESOURCE PRIORITIES:
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each possible build (cities: 1VP for 5 resources is most efficient)
- Early phase: Secure at least one good source of brick and wood for minimal expansion
- Growth phase: Prioritize ore and wheat production for city upgrades (3VP for 5 resources is optimal)
- Late phase: Focus on the fastest path to victory points, whether through buildings or development cards
- Avoid trading resources that opponents need for immediate victory point gains
- Use 4:1 trades only when necessary; prioritize port usage when possible

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and limited expansion options
- If you get an early knight, save it for defense or until you can start building toward largest army
- Time monopoly card usage for when opponents likely have accumulated specific resources
- Save year of plenty cards for completing crucial builds when you're short 1-2 specific resources
- Development cards are most valuable when:
  * You need hidden victory points to surprise opponents
  * You need knights to break up longest road or secure largest army
  * You're lacking wood/brick for expansion but have plenty of sheep/wheat/ore

EXPANSION STRATEGY:
- Build roads only with clear settlement locations in mind
- Target settlements that give you access to ports or new resources
- Block opponents' expansion paths when it gives you a strategic advantage
- Consider the timing of expansion vs. city upgrades based on your resource production
- Calculate whether longest road is achievable and worth the resource investment
- When deciding between a new settlement and a city upgrade, compare immediate vs. long-term returns

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-probability hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Save knight cards for breaking up opponent strategies or securing largest army
- Use knights defensively if you're producing valuable resources on high-probability hexes

TRADING TACTICS:
- Avoid trading resources that directly help opponents score points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades
- Trade excess resources before rolling 7 if you have more than 7 cards
- Consider bank/port trades when they enable an immediate build that advances your strategy
- When trading with players, try to receive resources that complete a build

ENDGAME STRATEGY:
- In the late game, hide your victory point potential (keep development cards hidden)
- Calculate the fastest path to 10 VP and focus exclusively on that path
- Be aware of the exact number of remaining development cards and their probabilities
- Track opponents' potential victory points, including hidden development cards
- If you're close to winning, prioritize actions that can be completed in a single turn

Before finalizing your action, check:
1. Is there a more efficient path to victory points?
2. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
3. Does this move help or hinder opponents?
4. Is there a defensive move needed to prevent an opponent from winning?
5. Are you properly diversified against dice probability?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game Analysis

Let me carefully analyze the current game state and available options:

## Current Game Position
- I have 6 VP from: 2 cities (4 VP) and 2 settlements (2 VP)
- RED has 7 VP from: 5 settlements (5 VP) and Longest Road (2 VP)
- RED is 3 VP from winning, making them the biggest threat

## Resource Assessment
- I have: 4 Wood and 1 Wheat
- My production: Brick(★★), Wheat(★), Ore(★★★), Wood(★★★) - decent production
- Robber is on Ore (4) hex, limiting my Ore production which impacts city upgrades

## Available Actions
- End Turn [0]
- Trade 4 Wood for other resources [1-4]

## Trading Analysis
With 4 Wood, I could trade for:
1. Brick - Not immediately useful as I'm not planning road building
2. Ore - Could help toward city upgrade (need 3 Ore + 2 Wheat)
3. Sheep - Could help toward development card (need 1 Ore + 1 Wheat + 1 Sheep)
4. Wheat - Could help toward city upgrade or development card

## Strategic Considerations
- Ending my turn gives me a chance to collect more resources based on my good production
- Trading now at 4:1 is very inefficient and limits future options
- RED has 10 cards - they might be preparing a big move
- Development cards are potentially valuable for Knights (Largest Army = 2 VP)

<plan>
1. End turn to collect resources from my good production spread
2. Next turn priorities (dependent on rolls):
   a) If I get enough Ore and Wheat, upgrade a settlement to city
   b) If I get Sheep + Ore + Wheat, buy development card for potential Knight
3. Watch RED closely - they may be holding VP cards
4. Long-term: secure Largest Army (I have 2 Knights played, need 3 total)
</plan>

Trading 4 Wood for 1 of anything is inefficient. With good production potential, ending my turn to collect resources is strategically better, especially since I don't have an immediate build that trading would enable.

RESPONSE:
I'll analyze the game state and determine the optimal action.

## Game Analysis

### Victory Point Status:
- BLUE (me): 6/10 VP (2 settlements + 2 cities + 2 knights)
- RED: 7/10 VP (5 settlements + Longest Road bonus)
- RED is ahead by 1 VP and needs 3 more to win

### My Resources:
- 3 Wood, 2 Brick, 1 Wheat, 4 Ore
- Not enough resources for any immediate build (City, Settlement, or Development Card)

### Available Actions:
- [0] End Turn
- [1-4] Maritime trades at 4:1 ratio (not efficient)

### Strategic Considerations:
1. I don't have resources for any immediate builds
2. Trading 4 Ore for 1 resource is inefficient unless it enables a critical build
3. I need to collect more resources through dice rolls
4. RED has 9 hidden cards - they could be close to a build or holding VP cards

My current resource collection per roll:
- Wood (on 8): High probability
- Brick (on 5): Medium probability
- Wheat (on 10, 3): Medium-low probability
- Ore (on 4): Low probability
- Sheep: None (only 9, which I don't have)

<plan>
1. End turn to collect resources from my good production spread
2. Next turn priorities:
   a) If I get enough Ore and Wheat, upgrade a settlement to city
   b) If I get Wood + Brick, extend road to block RED's expansion
   c) If I get Sheep + Ore + Wheat, buy development card for Knights
3. Watch RED closely - they may be holding VP cards or approaching another settlement
4. Long-term: secure Largest Army (I have 2 Knights played, need 1 more)
</plan>

The 4:1 trades aren't worth it at this point. I need to wait for better dice rolls rather than making inefficient trades. Trading 4 Ore for 1 of another resource doesn't enable any immediate builds.

The optimal action is:

3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL SETTLEMENT PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Place settlements on high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Target at least one spot with good ore and wheat production for city development
- Try to secure at least one high-probability spot (5, 6, 8, 9) for each critical resource
- Place your second settlement to complement your first (fill resource gaps)
- Aim for access to all five resources or position near useful ports if resource diversity isn't possible
- Always consider which settlements opponents are likely to place and avoid areas that will become contested
- Place roads pointing toward valuable future expansion spots, not toward the center
- Consider the long-term impact: settlements that can't expand are less valuable

MID-GAME RESOURCE PRIORITIES:
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each possible build (cities: 1VP for 5 resources is most efficient)
- Early phase: Secure at least one good source of brick and wood for minimal expansion
- Growth phase: Prioritize ore and wheat production for city upgrades (3VP for 5 resources is optimal)
- Late phase: Focus on the fastest path to victory points, whether through buildings or development cards
- Avoid trading resources that opponents need for immediate victory point gains
- Use 4:1 trades only when necessary; prioritize port usage when possible

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and limited expansion options
- If you get an early knight, save it for defense or until you can start building toward largest army
- Time monopoly card usage for when opponents likely have accumulated specific resources
- Save year of plenty cards for completing crucial builds when you're short 1-2 specific resources
- Development cards are most valuable when:
  * You need hidden victory points to surprise opponents
  * You need knights to break up longest road or secure largest army
  * You're lacking wood/brick for expansion but have plenty of sheep/wheat/ore

EXPANSION STRATEGY:
- Build roads only with clear settlement locations in mind
- Target settlements that give you access to ports or new resources
- Block opponents' expansion paths when it gives you a strategic advantage
- Consider the timing of expansion vs. city upgrades based on your resource production
- Calculate whether longest road is achievable and worth the resource investment
- When deciding between a new settlement and a city upgrade, compare immediate vs. long-term returns

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-probability hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Save knight cards for breaking up opponent strategies or securing largest army
- Use knights defensively if you're producing valuable resources on high-probability hexes

TRADING TACTICS:
- Avoid trading resources that directly help opponents score points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades
- Trade excess resources before rolling 7 if you have more than 7 cards
- Consider bank/port trades when they enable an immediate build that advances your strategy
- When trading with players, try to receive resources that complete a build

ENDGAME STRATEGY:
- In the late game, hide your victory point potential (keep development cards hidden)
- Calculate the fastest path to 10 VP and focus exclusively on that path
- Be aware of the exact number of remaining development cards and their probabilities
- Track opponents' potential victory points, including hidden development cards
- If you're close to winning, prioritize actions that can be completed in a single turn

Before finalizing your action, check:
1. Is there a more efficient path to victory points?
2. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
3. Does this move help or hinder opponents?
4. Is there a defensive move needed to prevent an opponent from winning?
5. Are you properly diversified against dice probability?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 202 | Player: BLUE | Action: MOVE_ROBBER

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. End turn to collect resources from my good production spread
2. Next turn priorities:
   a) If I get enough Ore and Wheat, upgrade a settlement to city
   b) If I get Wood + Brick, extend road to block RED's expansion
   c) If I get Sheep + Ore + Wheat, buy development card for Knights
3. Watch RED closely - they may be holding VP cards or approaching another settlement
4. Long-term: secure Largest Army (I have 2 Knights played, need 1 more)
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.

# Analyzing Robber Move Options

Let me analyze the current game state and evaluate all available robber placement options:

## Game State Assessment
- I (BLUE) have 6 VP vs RED's 7 VP (RED has longest road +2 VP)
- I have 3 🧱BRICK, 1 🌾WHEAT, 1 ⛏️ORE currently
- RED has 4 hidden resource cards
- RED has significant production with 5 settlements, including good hexes

## Robber Move Options Analysis:

**[0] Move robber to (0, 0, 0) and steal from RED**
- This is the 🧱5 hex
- Would block RED's settlement at node 4 (🧱5[⭐⭐])
- I also have a city at node 1 that produces from this hex, so I'd hurt myself too

**[1] Move robber to (1, -1, 0) and steal from RED**
- This is the 🌾10 hex
- Would block RED's settlements at nodes 7 and 9
- I have a city at node 1 that also produces from this hex (self-harm)

**[2] Move robber to (0, -1, 1) and steal from RED**
- This is the 🐑9 hex
- Would block RED's settlements at nodes 9 and 12
- I don't have any buildings that would be affected

**[3] Move robber to (-1, 0, 1) and steal from RED**
- This is the 🌾3 hex (low probability)
- Would block RED's settlements at nodes 4 and 12
- Low impact due to the low probability (3)

**[4] Move robber to (-1, 1, 0) and steal from RED**
- This is the 🌲8 hex (high probability)
- Would block RED's settlements at nodes 4 and 17 (both good production)
- However, I would be hurting my own city at node 16 which produces from this 8

**[5] Move robber to (1, 0, -1)**
- This is the ⛏️4 hex
- Would only block MY buildings (settlements at nodes 20, 23 and city at node 1)
- No option to steal from RED
- Would hurt myself significantly with no benefit

## Strategic Considerations:
1. RED is ahead with 7 VP to my 6 VP
2. I need to disrupt RED's progress while minimizing impact on my own production
3. Stealing a resource could be valuable depending on what RED has
4. RED has 5 settlements vs my 2 settlements + 2 cities

<plan>
1. Prioritize blocking RED's high-probability production without hindering my own
2. Get one more knight to secure Largest Army (+2 VP) - need resources for development cards
3. Continue expanding with my excess brick to potentially challenge for Longest Road
4. Look for city upgrade opportunities when I get more ore and wheat
</plan>

Based on this analysis, option [2] is optimal - placing the robber on the 🐑9 hex:
- Blocks two RED settlements (nodes 9 and 12)
- Good probability number (9)
- Doesn't affect any of my production
- Allows me to steal a resource from RED
- Sheep might be useful for development cards (to get that 3rd Knight)

# Game Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state and available options:

## Victory Points
- BLUE (me): 6/10 VP (2 cities = 4 VP, 2 settlements = 2 VP)
- RED: 7/10 VP (5 settlements = 5 VP, Longest Road = 2 VP)

RED is ahead by 1 VP, and only needs 3 more points to win. I need 4 more points.

## Resources
- I have: 2 Wood, 5 Brick, 2 Wheat, 5 Ore
- RED has 6 hidden cards

## Available Actions
1. End Turn
2. Upgrade settlement at node 20 to city (Cost: 2 Wheat, 3 Ore)
3. Upgrade settlement at node 23 to city (Cost: 2 Wheat, 3 Ore)
4-10. Various maritime trades

## Strategic Assessment

I need 4 more VPs to win. My options for gaining VPs:
1. City upgrades: +1 VP each (I have enough Ore but not enough Wheat)
2. Development cards: Possibility of Victory Point cards or Knights to get Largest Army (+2 VP)
3. Challenge for Longest Road (+2 VP) - RED has 11 segments, I have 6, so this is difficult
4. Build new settlements (+1 VP each)

RED has 7 VP and can win through 3 more points:
- Building 2 cities and 1 settlement 
- Getting Largest Army (+2 VP) and 1 more point
- Development card VP

## Decision Analysis

I don't have enough Wheat for city upgrades (need 2, only have 2), so neither option 1 nor 2 are viable without trading.

Looking at port trades:
- I have excess Brick (5) and Ore (5)
- I need Wheat (have 2, need more)
- Trading 4 Brick for 1 Wheat would let me upgrade a settlement to a city

If I trade 4 Brick for 1 Wheat, I'll have 3 Wheat and 5 Ore, which is enough for a city upgrade.

<plan>
1. Trade excess Brick for Wheat to enable a city upgrade
2. Upgrade a settlement to city for +1 VP
3. Continue working toward Knights to potentially get Largest Army (+2 VP)
4. Consider buying development cards with remaining resources next turn
</plan>

The most efficient move is to trade 4 Brick for 1 Wheat (option 4), then use that Wheat to upgrade one of my settlements to a city next turn. This would give me 7 VP, tying with RED.

Given my options, I choose:

❓ Select action by number (0-6):


Based on this information, which action number do you choose? Think step by step about your options, then put the final action number in a box like \boxed{1}.
RESPONSE:
I'll analyze the current game state and evaluate the available options systematically.

## Game State Analysis

- BLUE (me) has 6/10 VP
  - 2 settlements (1 VP each) = 2 VP
  - 2 cities (2 VP each) = 4 VP
  - No bonus VP cards visible
- RED has 7/10 VP (including +2 VP for Longest Road)
  - 5 settlements = 5 VP
  - Longest Road = 2 VP
  - RED is ahead by 1 VP

## Resource Analysis
I have:
- 2 🌲WOOD
- 1 🧱BRICK
- 3 🌾WHEAT
- 5 ⛏️ORE
- 0 🐑SHEEP

For city upgrades, I need 2 WHEAT + 3 ORE. I have sufficient ORE but only 3 WHEAT.

## Available Options
1. End my turn
2. Upgrade settlement at node 20 to city (need 2 WHEAT, 3 ORE)
3. Upgrade settlement at node 23 to city (need 2 WHEAT, 3 ORE)
4. Various port trades using ORE (4:1 ratio)

## Strategic Evaluation

Upgrading a settlement to a city would give me +1 VP (from 6 to 7), tying with RED. This is clearly the optimal path to victory as it's the most efficient use of resources (1 VP for 5 resources).

For the city upgrade, I need 2 WHEAT but only have 3. This is sufficient, so I can build a city without trading.

Both nodes 20 and 23 produce ORE on a 4, which is a below-average probability. However, since they are my only settlement options and both produce the same resource on the same number, there's no production advantage between them.

The strategic question is: which settlement location has better future potential? Both settlements are at node 20 and node 23, which are relatively close together. Without seeing the complete connectivity of the board, it's hard to determine which has better expansion potential. Given the limited information, either choice seems reasonable.

<plan>
1. Upgrade a settlement to city this turn for +1 VP (reaching 7 VP, tied with RED)
2. Continue working toward more city upgrades or development cards
3. Look for opportunities to break RED's longest road or secure largest army
4. Focus on wheat production for future developments
</plan>

Since I have the resources needed for a city upgrade and both options provide equal immediate benefits, I'll select node 20 for the upgrade.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL SETTLEMENT PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Place settlements on high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Target at least one spot with good ore and wheat production for city development
- Try to secure at least one high-probability spot (5, 6, 8, 9) for each critical resource
- Place your second settlement to complement your first (fill resource gaps)
- Aim for access to all five resources or position near useful ports if resource diversity isn't possible
- Always consider which settlements opponents are likely to place and avoid areas that will become contested
- Place roads pointing toward valuable future expansion spots, not toward the center
- Consider the long-term impact: settlements that can't expand are less valuable

MID-GAME RESOURCE PRIORITIES:
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each possible build (cities: 1VP for 5 resources is most efficient)
- Early phase: Secure at least one good source of brick and wood for minimal expansion
- Growth phase: Prioritize ore and wheat production for city upgrades (3VP for 5 resources is optimal)
- Late phase: Focus on the fastest path to victory points, whether through buildings or development cards
- Avoid trading resources that opponents need for immediate victory point gains
- Use 4:1 trades only when necessary; prioritize port usage when possible

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and limited expansion options
- If you get an early knight, save it for defense or until you can start building toward largest army
- Time monopoly card usage for when opponents likely have accumulated specific resources
- Save year of plenty cards for completing crucial builds when you're short 1-2 specific resources
- Development cards are most valuable when:
  * You need hidden victory points to surprise opponents
  * You need knights to break up longest road or secure largest army
  * You're lacking wood/brick for expansion but have plenty of sheep/wheat/ore

EXPANSION STRATEGY:
- Build roads only with clear settlement locations in mind
- Target settlements that give you access to ports or new resources
- Block opponents' expansion paths when it gives you a strategic advantage
- Consider the timing of expansion vs. city upgrades based on your resource production
- Calculate whether longest road is achievable and worth the resource investment
- When deciding between a new settlement and a city upgrade, compare immediate vs. long-term returns

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-probability hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Save knight cards for breaking up opponent strategies or securing largest army
- Use knights defensively if you're producing valuable resources on high-probability hexes

TRADING TACTICS:
- Avoid trading resources that directly help opponents score points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades
- Trade excess resources before rolling 7 if you have more than 7 cards
- Consider bank/port trades when they enable an immediate build that advances your strategy
- When trading with players, try to receive resources that complete a build

ENDGAME STRATEGY:
- In the late game, hide your victory point potential (keep development cards hidden)
- Calculate the fastest path to 10 VP and focus exclusively on that path
- Be aware of the exact number of remaining development cards and their probabilities
- Track opponents' potential victory points, including hidden development cards
- If you're close to winning, prioritize actions that can be completed in a single turn

Before finalizing your action, check:
1. Is there a more efficient path to victory points?
2. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
3. Does this move help or hinder opponents?
4. Is there a defensive move needed to prevent an opponent from winning?
5. Are you properly diversified against dice probability?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 210 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Upgrade a settlement to city this turn for +1 VP (reaching 7 VP, tied with RED)
2. Continue working toward more city upgrades or development cards
3. Look for opportunities to break RED's longest road or secure largest army
4. Focus on wheat production for future developments
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.

# Game State Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state for my Settlers of Catan turn:

## Victory Point Status
- I (BLUE) have 7 VP: 4 VP from buildings (3 cities × 2 VP, 1 settlement × 1 VP) + 3 VP from cards/bonuses
- RED also has 7 VP: 5 VP from buildings (5 settlements × 1 VP) + 2 VP from longest road
- We're tied, so I need to find the fastest path to 10 VP

## My Resources
- 2 🌲WOOD, 1 🧱BRICK, 5 🌾WHEAT, 2 ⛏️ORE, 0 🐑SHEEP
- With these resources, I can't build anything immediately since:
  - Settlement requires 1🌲 1🧱 1🌾 1🐑 (missing sheep)
  - City requires 3⛏️ 2🌾 (have enough wheat but only 2 ore)
  - Development card requires 1⛏️ 1🌾 1🐑 (missing sheep)

## Available Actions
- My options are to end turn [0] or make maritime trades using my wheat [1-4]
- I have 5 wheat, which is enough for a 4:1 trade

## Strategic Considerations
1. I need to upgrade my remaining settlement to a city for efficiency, but I'm short 1 ore
2. I need to counter RED's longest road advantage
3. RED has a lot of hidden resources (10 cards), which is concerning

<plan>
1. Trade wheat for ore this turn to prepare for city upgrade
2. Next turn, upgrade settlement at node 23 to a city for +1 VP (reaching 8 VP)
3. Continue working toward largest army (I already have 2 knights) or breaking RED's longest road
4. Focus on development cards for potential victory points or knights
</plan>

Given my current resources and the game state, my best option is to trade 4 wheat for 1 ore [3]. This will give me the 3 ore needed to upgrade my settlement on my next turn, which is the most efficient path to increasing my victory points.

# Game Analysis for Settlers of Catan

Let me analyze the current game state and available actions to determine the optimal move:

## Current Game State
- I have 7 VP (3 cities × 2 VP + 1 settlement × 1 VP)
- Opponent (RED) also has 7 VP (5 settlements × 1 VP + Longest Road bonus +2 VP)
- I have 2 🌲WOOD, 1 🧱BRICK, 3 🌾WHEAT, 3 ⛏️ORE
- I need to reach 10 VP to win

## Available Actions
1. [0] End turn
2. [1] Upgrade settlement at node 23 to city (Cost: 2 🌾WHEAT, 3 ⛏️ORE)

## Analysis

The settlement upgrade at node 23 would cost me 2 wheat and 3 ore, which I currently have. This would:
- Increase my VP from 7 to 8 (replacing 1 VP settlement with 2 VP city)
- Double my resource production at node 23 (more ore from the 4-value hex)
- Leave me with 1 wheat and 0 ore after building

This move aligns perfectly with my current plan. By upgrading to a city, I'll gain an immediate VP and improve my ore production, which is on a decent number (4). 

The alternative is to end my turn, keeping my resources for future development card purchases or other builds. However, since I have exactly the resources needed for a city upgrade, and cities offer the best VP-to-resource ratio in the game (1 VP for 5 resources), it makes sense to utilize these resources now rather than risking losing them to a robber roll.

Additionally, getting to 8 VP puts me closer to victory than my opponent and increases my production capabilities for the final stretch to 10 VP.

<plan>
1. Upgrade settlement at node 23 to a city this turn (reaching 8 VP)
2. Focus on development cards for potential victory points or knights to work toward largest army
3. Continue monitoring opportunities to break RED's longest road if possible
4. Look for opportunities to gain the final 2 VPs through development cards or additional building

5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL SETTLEMENT PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Place settlements on high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Target at least one spot with good ore and wheat production for city development
- Try to secure at least one high-probability spot (5, 6, 8, 9) for each critical resource
- Place your second settlement to complement your first (fill resource gaps)
- Aim for access to all five resources or position near useful ports if resource diversity isn't possible
- Always consider which settlements opponents are likely to place and avoid areas that will become contested
- Place roads pointing toward valuable future expansion spots, not toward the center
- Consider the long-term impact: settlements that can't expand are less valuable

MID-GAME RESOURCE PRIORITIES:
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each possible build (cities: 1VP for 5 resources is most efficient)
- Early phase: Secure at least one good source of brick and wood for minimal expansion
- Growth phase: Prioritize ore and wheat production for city upgrades (3VP for 5 resources is optimal)
- Late phase: Focus on the fastest path to victory points, whether through buildings or development cards
- Avoid trading resources that opponents need for immediate victory point gains
- Use 4:1 trades only when necessary; prioritize port usage when possible

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and limited expansion options
- If you get an early knight, save it for defense or until you can start building toward largest army
- Time monopoly card usage for when opponents likely have accumulated specific resources
- Save year of plenty cards for completing crucial builds when you're short 1-2 specific resources
- Development cards are most valuable when:
  * You need hidden victory points to surprise opponents
  * You need knights to break up longest road or secure largest army
  * You're lacking wood/brick for expansion but have plenty of sheep/wheat/ore

EXPANSION STRATEGY:
- Build roads only with clear settlement locations in mind
- Target settlements that give you access to ports or new resources
- Block opponents' expansion paths when it gives you a strategic advantage
- Consider the timing of expansion vs. city upgrades based on your resource production
- Calculate whether longest road is achievable and worth the resource investment
- When deciding between a new settlement and a city upgrade, compare immediate vs. long-term returns

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-probability hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Save knight cards for breaking up opponent strategies or securing largest army
- Use knights defensively if you're producing valuable resources on high-probability hexes

TRADING TACTICS:
- Avoid trading resources that directly help opponents score points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades
- Trade excess resources before rolling 7 if you have more than 7 cards
- Consider bank/port trades when they enable an immediate build that advances your strategy
- When trading with players, try to receive resources that complete a build

ENDGAME STRATEGY:
- In the late game, hide your victory point potential (keep development cards hidden)
- Calculate the fastest path to 10 VP and focus exclusively on that path
- Be aware of the exact number of remaining development cards and their probabilities
- Track opponents' potential victory points, including hidden development cards
- If you're close to winning, prioritize actions that can be completed in a single turn

Before finalizing your action, check:
1. Is there a more efficient path to victory points?
2. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
3. Does this move help or hinder opponents?
4. Is there a defensive move needed to prevent an opponent from winning?

# Game Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state and available options:

## Current Position
- I have 8 VP with 4 cities (8 VP)
- Red has 7 VP with 5 settlements (5 VP) and Longest Road (+2 VP)
- I need 2 more VP to win

## Resource Analysis
My resources: 2 Wood, 1 Brick, 1 Wheat, 6 Ore

## Available Actions
0. End turn - No immediate benefit
1-4. Trade options - Converting 4 Ore for another resource

## Strategic Assessment

According to my current plan, I was planning to upgrade a settlement at node 23 to a city for 8 VP, but I already have 8 VP and node 23 already has a city. This means my current plan is outdated.

With 8 VP already and needing 2 more VP to win, my options are:
1. Build a settlement (1 VP) - Requires 1 Wood, 1 Brick, 1 Wheat, 1 Sheep (missing Sheep)
2. Buy a development card - Requires 1 Ore, 1 Wheat, 1 Sheep (missing Sheep)
3. Work toward breaking Red's longest road - Would require building more roads strategically

Looking at my resources, I have surplus Ore (6) but lack Sheep for both settlements and development cards. The most efficient move would be to trade for Sheep, which would allow me to buy a development card that could potentially be a Victory Point card or Knight (to work toward largest army).

<plan>
1. Trade 4 Ore for 1 Sheep
2. Use 1 Ore, 1 Wheat, 1 Sheep to buy a development card (hoping for VP or Knight)
3. Continue monitoring opportunities to break RED's longest road
4. Next turns: work toward another settlement or more development cards for the final VPs needed
</plan>

Given my analysis, I should trade 4 Ore for 1 Sheep, which would allow me to purchase a development card this turn.

# Game Analysis & Decision Making

## Current Game State Assessment
- I have 8 victory points (4 cities = 8 VP)
- RED has 7 victory points (5 settlements = 5 VP + 2 VP for longest road)
- RED is holding 10 cards, which could enable significant moves on their turn
- I have limited resources: 2 wood, 1 brick, 1 sheep, 1 wheat, 2 ore
- I need 2 more VP to win

## Action Analysis
Let me analyze my options:

**Option 0: End Turn**
- This does nothing to advance my position
- It gives RED an opportunity to potentially reach 10 VP on their turn
- RED has 10 hidden cards, so they may be close to a winning move
- Not recommended when there's a viable alternative

**Option 1: Buy a Development Card (1 sheep, 1 wheat, 1 ore)**
- Development cards provide several possibilities:
  * 20% chance of Victory Point card (immediate hidden VP)
  * 30% chance of Knight (can move robber and potentially work toward Largest Army)
  * Other cards (Monopoly, Road Building, Year of Plenty) provide tactical advantages
- If I get a VP card, I'll have 9 VP (only need 1 more)
- If I get a Knight, I'll have 3 Knights and could earn Largest Army (+2 VP) for the win
- Using resources now prevents potential loss from rolling a 7

## Strategic Considerations
- RED has longest road with 11 segments, which would be very difficult to break
- I already have 2 Knights played, so getting a 3rd could be significant for Largest Army
- With RED holding 10 cards, they may be poised for a big move
- Playing defensively is critical at this stage

<plan>
1. Buy a development card now for potential VP or Knight
2. If it's a VP card, I'll have 9 VP and need just 1 more
3. If it's a Knight, I'll have 3 Knights total and can potentially earn Largest Army (+2 VP)
4. On future turns, continue buying development cards or build another settlement depending on dice rolls
5. Be prepared to play Knight cards to disrupt RED's strategy if they get close to winning
</plan>

Given the game state and our proximity to winning, buying a development card is clearly the optimal choice. It gives me a chance at an immediate hidden VP or a Knight that could lead to Largest Army bonus. Ending my turn without taking this action would be a wasted opportunity.

# Game Analysis

I need to choose between playing a Knight card or rolling the dice. Let me analyze the current game state thoroughly:

## Current Victory Point Situation
- I (BLUE) have 8 VP from my 4 cities (8 VP)
- RED has 7 VP: 5 settlements (5 VP) + Longest Road (2 VP)
- I'm leading by 1 VP, but need 2 more to win
- I currently have 1 Knight card unplayed, and have already played 2 Knights

## Resource Situation
- I have: 2 wood, 1 brick, 1 ore
- RED has 10 cards (hidden)
- The robber is currently on a sheep hex (0,-1,1) with probability 9

## Strategic Considerations

1. **Playing Knight Now**
   - Would move to 3 played Knights, giving me Largest Army (+2 VP)
   - Would get me to 10 VP immediately and win the game
   - Would allow me to relocate the robber and possibly steal a useful resource from RED
   - RED has 10 cards, so good chance of stealing something useful

2. **Rolling the Dice**
   - Could get more resources before making a move
   - But I already have enough for the win if I play the Knight
   - Risk of rolling a 7 and having to discard cards is minimal since I only have 4 cards

## Decision Logic
The decision is clear. I have 8 VP currently. Playing my Knight would give me Largest Army (2 VP), taking me to 10 VP and winning the game immediately. There's no reason to roll when I can win right now.

<plan>
Play my Knight card to achieve Largest Army (2 VP), which will give me 10 VP total and win the game immediately.
</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL SETTLEMENT PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Place settlements on high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Target at least one spot with good ore and wheat production for city development
- Try to secure at least one high-probability spot (5, 6, 8, 9) for each critical resource
- Place your second settlement to complement your first (fill resource gaps)
- Aim for access to all five resources or position near useful ports if resource diversity isn't possible
- Always consider which settlements opponents are likely to place and avoid areas that will become contested
- Place roads pointing toward valuable future expansion spots, not toward the center
- Consider the long-term impact: settlements that can't expand are less valuable

MID-GAME RESOURCE PRIORITIES:
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each possible build (cities: 1VP for 5 resources is most efficient)
- Early phase: Secure at least one good source of brick and wood for minimal expansion
- Growth phase: Prioritize ore and wheat production for city upgrades (3VP for 5 resources is optimal)
- Late phase: Focus on the fastest path to victory points, whether through buildings or development cards
- Avoid trading resources that opponents need for immediate victory point gains
- Use 4:1 trades only when necessary; prioritize port usage when possible

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and limited expansion options
- If you get an early knight, save it for defense or until you can start building toward largest army
- Time monopoly card usage for when opponents likely have accumulated specific resources
- Save year of plenty cards for completing crucial builds when you're short 1-2 specific resources
- Development cards are most valuable when:
  * You need hidden victory points to surprise opponents
  * You need knights to break up longest road or secure largest army
  * You're lacking wood/brick for expansion but have plenty of sheep/wheat/ore

EXPANSION STRATEGY:
- Build roads only with clear settlement locations in mind
- Target settlements that give you access to ports or new resources
- Block opponents' expansion paths when it gives you a strategic advantage
- Consider the timing of expansion vs. city upgrades based on your resource production
- Calculate whether longest road is achievable and worth the resource investment
- When deciding between a new settlement and a city upgrade, compare immediate vs. long-term returns

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-probability hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Save knight cards for breaking up opponent strategies or securing largest army
- Use knights defensively if you're producing valuable resources on high-probability hexes

TRADING TACTICS:
- Avoid trading resources that directly help opponents score points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades
- Trade excess resources before rolling 7 if you have more than 7 cards
- Consider bank/port trades when they enable an immediate build that advances your strategy
- When trading with players, try to receive resources that complete a build

ENDGAME STRATEGY:
- In the late game, hide your victory point potential (keep development cards hidden)
- Calculate the fastest path to 10 VP and focus exclusively on that path
- Be aware of the exact number of remaining development cards and their probabilities
- Track opponents' potential victory points, including hidden development cards
- If you're close to winning, prioritize actions that can be completed in a single turn

Before finalizing your action, check:
1. Is there a more efficient path to victory points?
2. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
3. Does this move help or hinder opponents?
4. Is there a defensive move needed to prevent an opponent from winning?
5. Are you properly diversified against dice probability?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Analysis of Initial Settlement Placement

I need to place my first settlement strategically as this is the initial settlement placement phase. Let me analyze the available nodes based on the initial settlement placement strategy.

## Resource Distribution and Probabilities
Looking at the board, I can see these resources and their probability numbers:
- 🌲Wood: 4 (low probability)
- 🏜️Desert: - (with robber)
- 🌾Wheat: 6 (high probability) and 10 (medium probability)
- ⛏️Ore: 9 (medium probability)
- 🐑Sheep: 5 (medium probability)
- 🧱Brick: 3 (low probability)

## Node Analysis
Let me examine the most promising nodes:

- Node 3: RED player already has a settlement here on the wheat-6, ore-9, and wood-4 intersection. This would have been ideal!

- Node 0: Connects to ore-9, brick-3, and sheep-5. Medium production potential with diverse resources.

- Node 1: Connects to ore-9, sheep-5, and desert (no production). Less optimal due to desert.

- Node 2: Connects to ore-9, wood-4, and desert. Less optimal due to desert.

- Node 4: Connects to wheat-6, wheat-10, and ore-9. Great resource combination and includes wheat-6 (high probability).

- Node 5: Connects to ore-9, wheat-10, and brick-3. Good resource diversity.

- Node 15: Connects to wheat-6, wheat-10, and brick-3. Access to high-probability wheat but no ore.

- Node 16: Connects to wheat-10, brick-3. Only two resources, less optimal.

## Decision Reasoning
Node 4 appears to be the best choice because:
1. It gives access to wheat-6 (high probability) and ore-9 (medium)
2. It has wheat-10 as a backup wheat resource
3. Wheat and ore are critical for city development
4. The combination enables fast city upgrades with good ore and wheat production

While it lacks brick and wood for initial expansion, the second settlement can address that gap. The ore-wheat focus aligns with mid-game strategy for city upgrades.

<plan>Place first settlement at Node 4 to secure high-probability wheat and ore production. For the second settlement, aim for a node with good wood and brick production to enable road building and expansion.</plan>

# Initial Settlement and Road Placement Analysis

I need to choose which road to build from my initial settlement at node 7.

## Current Game State Analysis
- I've placed my first settlement at node 7, which is currently on the desert hex (no production)
- Red has placed at node 3, which gives them access to ore (9), wood (4), and wheat (6) - a strong position
- This is the setup phase where I'm placing my first road, so no resources are required

## Road Placement Options
Let me examine both options:

**Option 0: Build road at edge (6, 7)**
- This road extends toward node 6, which is connected to:
  * Desert hex (1, -1, 0) - no resources
  * Sheep hex (1, 0, -1) with number 5 - decent probability

**Option 1: Build road at edge (7, 8)**
- This road extends toward node 8, which is connected to:
  * Desert hex (1, -1, 0) - no resources
  * Possibly another resource hex not fully visible in the board state

## Strategic Considerations
1. My current settlement at node 7 doesn't produce any resources, so my second settlement needs to be strong
2. Looking at the visible board:
   - There's a sheep hex with value 5
   - Red already has access to ore, wood, and wheat
   - I need to diversify my resources while securing high-probability numbers

3. The edge (6, 7) leads me toward the sheep hex with a decent probability (5)
4. The edge (7, 8) leads in a direction where the board information is incomplete

<plan>
Place first road toward node 6 to potentially access sheep resource. For the second settlement, aim for a high-probability node that gives access to multiple resources, particularly brick, wood, and ore since my first settlement doesn't produce any resources.
</plan>

Given the limited board information, edge (6, 7) leads toward a known resource (sheep) with decent probability, making it the safer choice for my first road. This sets me up to potentially expand toward more diverse resources with my second settlement.

- Use knights defensively if you're producing valuable resources on high-probability hexes

TRADING TACTICS:
- Avoid trading resources that directly help opponents score points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades
- Trade excess resources before rolling 7 if you have more than 7 cards
- Consider bank/port trades when they enable an immediate build that advances your strategy
- When trading with players, try to receive resources that complete a build

ENDGAME STRATEGY:
- In the late game, hide your victory point potential (keep development cards hidden)
- Calculate the fastest path to 10 VP and focus exclusively on that path
- Be aware of the exact number of remaining development cards and their probabilities
- Track opponents' potential victory points, including hidden development cards
- If you're close to winning, prioritize actions that can be completed in a single turn

Before finalizing your action, check:
1. Is there a more efficient path to victory points?
2. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
3. Does this move help or hinder opponents?
4. Is there a defensive move needed to prevent an opponent from winning?
5. Are you properly diversified against dice probability?

# Initial Settlement Placement Analysis

I'm placing my second settlement in the initial placement phase of Catan. My first settlement is at node 7, which currently doesn't produce any resources because it's adjacent to the desert hex (1, -1, 0) where the robber is located.

Let me analyze the available nodes for my second settlement:

## Resource Analysis by Node

Looking at each node and the resources/numbers they connect to:

Node 0: Connected to ⛏️9, 🐑5, 🧱3 (Ore, Sheep, Brick) - good mix with 9-5-3 probabilities
Node 1: Connected to ⛏️9, 🐑5, 🏜️- (Ore, Sheep, Desert) - only two productive hexes
Node 2: Connected to ⛏️9, 🌲4, 🏜️- (Ore, Wood, Desert) - only two productive hexes
Node 3: Already taken by RED
Node 5: Connected to ⛏️9, 🧱3 (Ore, Brick) - only two hexes, but important resources
Node 9: Connected to 🌲4, 🏜️- (Wood, Desert) - only one productive hex
Node 10: Connected to 🌲4 (Wood) - only one hex
Node 11: Connected to 🌲4 (Wood) - only one hex
Node 13: Connected to 🌾6, 🌾10 (Wheat x2) - two wheat hexes, one high probability
Node 14: Connected to 🌾6, 🌾10 (Wheat x2) - two wheat hexes, one high probability
Node 15: Connected to 🌾6, 🌾10 (Wheat x2) - two wheat hexes, one high probability
Node 16: Connected to 🌾10, 🧱3 (Wheat, Brick) - average productivity
Node 17: Connected to 🌾10 (Wheat) - only one hex
Node 18: Connected to 🌾10 (Wheat) - only one hex
Node 19: Connected to 🧱3 (Brick) - only one hex
Node 20: Connected to 🧱3, 🐑5 (Brick, Sheep) - two useful resources
Node 21: Connected to 🧱3 (Brick) - only one hex
Node 22: Connected to 🐑5 (Sheep) - only one hex
Node 23: Connected to 🐑5 (Sheep) - only one hex

## Strategic Considerations

Since my first settlement (node 7) doesn't provide any resources, I need a strong second settlement that:
1. Gives me access to multiple different resources
2. Has high probability numbers
3. Provides resources I don't already have (which is all of them)

The most promising nodes appear to be:
- Node 0: Provides ore (9), sheep (5), and brick (3) - three different resources with decent numbers
- Node 13/14/15: Provides wheat on both a 6 and 10 - strong wheat production
- Node 20: Provides brick (3) and sheep (5) - two different resources

Node 0 stands out because:
1. It gives me three different resources (ore, sheep, brick)
2. One of them is on a high probability number (9)
3. It provides brick which is essential for early expansion
4. It provides ore which is crucial for city upgrades
5. It diversifies my resource portfolio completely

<plan>Build my second settlement at node 0 to gain access to ore (9), sheep (5), and brick (3). This gives me three important resources with one high-probability hex. Then focus on acquiring wood to enable early expansion, and wheat to complement my brick and ore for development.</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL SETTLEMENT PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Place settlements on high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Target at least one spot with good ore and wheat production for city development
- Try to secure at least one high-probability spot (5, 6, 8, 9) for each critical resource
- Place your second settlement to complement your first (fill resource gaps)
- Aim for access to all five resources or position near useful ports if resource diversity isn't possible
- Always consider which settlements opponents are likely to place and avoid areas that will become contested
- Place roads pointing toward valuable future expansion spots, not toward the center
- Consider the long-term impact: settlements that can't expand are less valuable

MID-GAME RESOURCE PRIORITIES:
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each possible build (cities: 1VP for 5 resources is most efficient)
- Early phase: Secure at least one good source of brick and wood for minimal expansion
- Growth phase: Prioritize ore and wheat production for city upgrades (3VP for 5 resources is optimal)
- Late phase: Focus on the fastest path to victory points, whether through buildings or development cards
- Avoid trading resources that opponents need for immediate victory point gains
- Use 4:1 trades only when necessary; prioritize port usage when possible

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and limited expansion options
- If you get an early knight, save it for defense or until you can start building toward largest army
- Time monopoly card usage for when opponents likely have accumulated specific resources
- Save year of plenty cards for completing crucial builds when you're short 1-2 specific resources
- Development cards are most valuable when:
  * You need hidden victory points to surprise opponents
  * You need knights to break up longest road or secure largest army
  * You're lacking wood/brick for expansion but have plenty of sheep/wheat/ore

EXPANSION STRATEGY:
- Build roads only with clear settlement locations in mind
- Target settlements that give you access to ports or new resources
- Block opponents' expansion paths when it gives you a strategic advantage
- Consider the timing of expansion vs. city upgrades based on your resource production
- Calculate whether longest road is achievable and worth the resource investment
- When deciding between a new settlement and a city upgrade, compare immediate vs. long-term returns

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-probability hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Save knight cards for breaking up opponent strategies or securing largest army
- Use knights defensively if you're producing valuable resources on high-probability hexes

TRADING TACTICS:
- Avoid trading resources that directly help opponents score points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades

# Initial Settlement Placement Analysis

I need to place my second initial road after already having placed my two settlements. Let's analyze the current situation:

- I have settlements at nodes 7 and 0
- Node 7 is currently not producing any resources (it appears to be on the desert tile with the robber)
- Node 0 produces ore (9), brick (3), and sheep (5) - good probability mix
- I already have 1 brick, 1 sheep, and 1 ore in hand
- I'm missing wood and wheat production from my settlements

Looking at my road placement options:
- Option [0]: Build a road at edge (0, 1)
- Option [1]: Build a road at edge (0, 20)
- Option [2]: Build a road at edge (0, 5)

Let me analyze each option for future expansion potential:

## Option [0] - Road at edge (0, 1)
This connects node 0 to node 1, which is already part of my settlement at node 0. This would allow expansion toward node 6, which connects to sheep (5).

## Option [1] - Road at edge (0, 20)
This connects node 0 to node 20, which would allow me to build toward the brick (3) hex and sheep (5) hex. However, I already have access to both these resources.

## Option [2] - Road at edge (0, 5)
This connects node 0 to node 5, which would allow expansion toward the wheat (10) hex and potentially the brick (3) hex in a different direction.

## Strategic Decision

The most valuable expansion would be toward resources I don't yet have access to, particularly wood or wheat. Looking at the board layout, I notice:

- Option [2] gives me the best path toward the wheat (10) hex via nodes 5, 16, 17, etc.
- While the wheat is a lower probability (10), gaining access to all resource types is crucial

<plan>Build my road toward node 5 to enable future expansion toward wheat production. Then focus on acquiring wood (possibly through trades) to enable further expansion. Once I have access to all resources, prioritize city upgrades at my ore/wheat producing settlements.</plan>

This road placement best supports my long-term strategy of resource diversification. I currently lack wheat and wood, and this placement gives me a path toward at least one of those missing resources.

# Analyzing Game State and Robber Placement Options

Let me think through the optimal robber placement by analyzing each potential move:

## Analysis of Robber Placement Options

**[0] (0, 0, 0) - Ore Hex with roll 9:**
- This hex produces ore for both RED and me
- RED gets 2 ore production here, I get 1 ore production
- I already have 3 ore in hand, so blocking my own ore is not ideal
- Would steal from RED

**[1] (0, -1, 1) - Wood Hex with roll 4:**
- This hex produces wood for RED only (1 production)
- I don't currently have wood access, so stealing could be valuable
- Moderate probability production (roll 4)
- Would steal from RED

**[2] (-1, 0, 1) - Wheat Hex with roll 6:**
- This hex produces wheat for RED only (3 production) 
- This is RED's best wheat hex with high probability (roll 6)
- I lack wheat access, which is critical for development cards and cities
- Would steal from RED

**[3] (-1, 1, 0) - Wheat Hex with roll 10:**
- This hex produces wheat for RED only (1 production)
- Lower probability than the other wheat hex
- Would steal from RED

**[4] (0, 1, -1) - Brick Hex with roll 3:**
- This hex produces brick for both RED and me
- RED gets 1 brick production, I get 1 brick production
- I already have 1 brick, and blocking my own brick is not ideal
- Would steal from RED

**[5] (1, 0, -1) - Sheep Hex with roll 5:**
- This hex produces sheep for me only (2 production)
- I already have 2 sheep in hand
- Placing here would hurt me without affecting RED
- No stealing opportunity

## Strategic Considerations

Looking at game state:
- My robber-blocked settlement at node 7 needs to be fixed
- I need to diversify my resources - currently I lack wood and wheat
- RED appears to have strong wheat production that I should disrupt
- RED likely needs wheat for their upcoming builds

<plan>
Focus on disrupting RED's high-probability wheat production while attempting to steal critical resources. Then use my resources to build my next road toward node 2 to position for expansion toward resources I lack. Focus on acquiring wood and wheat to complement my ore and sheep for potential development cards and future expansion.
</plan>

## Decision

Option [2] is clearly the best move:
- Blocks RED's highest probability wheat hex (roll 6 with 3 production)
- Might allow me to steal wheat which I currently lack
- Disrupts RED's development path while preserving all my production
- Targets RED's strongest resource production

Therefore, I'll choose option 2: Move robber to (-1, 0, 1) and steal from RED.

PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL SETTLEMENT PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Place settlements on high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Target at least one spot with good ore and wheat production for city development
- Try to secure at least one high-probability spot (5, 6, 8, 9) for each critical resource
- Place your second settlement to complement your first (fill resource gaps)
- Aim for access to all five resources or position near useful ports if resource diversity isn't possible
- Always consider which settlements opponents are likely to place and avoid areas that will become contested
- Place roads pointing toward valuable future expansion spots, not toward the center
- Consider the long-term impact: settlements that can't expand are less valuable

MID-GAME RESOURCE PRIORITIES:
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each possible build (cities: 1VP for 5 resources is most efficient)
- Early phase: Secure at least one good source of brick and wood for minimal expansion
- Growth phase: Prioritize ore and wheat production for city upgrades (3VP for 5 resources is optimal)
- Late phase: Focus on the fastest path to victory points, whether through buildings or development cards
- Avoid trading resources that opponents need for immediate victory point gains
- Use 4:1 trades only when necessary; prioritize port usage when possible

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and limited expansion options
- If you get an early knight, save it for defense or until you can start building toward largest army
- Time monopoly card usage for when opponents likely have accumulated specific resources
- Save year of plenty cards for completing crucial builds when you're short 1-2 specific resources
- Development cards are most valuable when:
  * You need hidden victory points to surprise opponents
  * You need knights to break up longest road or secure largest army
  * You're lacking wood/brick for expansion but have plenty of sheep/wheat/ore

EXPANSION STRATEGY:
- Build roads only with clear settlement locations in mind
- Target settlements that give you access to ports or new resources
- Block opponents' expansion paths when it gives you a strategic advantage
- Consider the timing of expansion vs. city upgrades based on your resource production
- Calculate whether longest road is achievable and worth the resource investment
- When deciding between a new settlement and a city upgrade, compare immediate vs. long-term returns

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-probability hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Save knight cards for breaking up opponent strategies or securing largest army
- Use knights defensively if you're producing valuable resources on high-probability hexes

TRADING TACTICS:
- Avoid trading resources that directly help opponents score points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades
- Trade excess resources before rolling 7 if you have more than 7 cards
- Consider bank/port trades when they enable an immediate build that advances your strategy
- When trading with players, try to receive resources that complete a build

ENDGAME STRATEGY:
- In the late game, hide your victory point potential (keep development cards hidden)
- Calculate the fastest path to 10 VP and focus exclusively on that path
- Be aware of the exact number of remaining development cards and their probabilities
- Track opponents' potential victory points, including hidden development cards
- If you're close to winning, prioritize actions that can be completed in a single turn

Before finalizing your action, check:
1. Is there a more efficient path to victory points?
2. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
3. Does this move help or hinder opponents?
4. Is there a defensive move needed to prevent an opponent from winning?
5. Are you properly diversified against dice probability?

Board Understanding Guide:

- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game Analysis for Turn 9

I need to analyze the current game state and decide on the best action to take.

## Current Resources & Position Assessment
- I have: 1 BRICK, 2 SHEEP, 4 ORE
- My settlements are at nodes 7 and 0
- I produce: ORE (9), BRICK (3), SHEEP (5)
- I lack WOOD and WHEAT production
- RED has one settlement with excellent WHEAT (6) production but the robber is currently blocking it

## Possible Actions
My options are limited to:
- [0] End turn without doing anything
- [1-4] Trade 4 ORE for another resource via 4:1 port trade

## Strategic Considerations

Since I have 4 ORE, I can make a 4:1 trade. The question is whether this trade is worthwhile and which resource I should get.

Looking at potential builds:
- Road: Requires 1 WOOD + 1 BRICK (I have 1 BRICK already)
- Settlement: Requires 1 WOOD + 1 BRICK + 1 WHEAT + 1 SHEEP (I have 1 BRICK, 2 SHEEP)
- Development card: Requires 1 ORE + 1 WHEAT + 1 SHEEP (I have 4 ORE, 2 SHEEP)

The most efficient use of my resources would be to trade for WOOD or WHEAT:

1. Trading for WOOD would let me build a road immediately (with my BRICK)
2. Trading for WHEAT would position me closer to buying a development card (would still need 1 more ORE roll)

Looking at my expansion options, building a road would allow me to extend toward node 2, which could eventually connect me to the WOOD hex that I currently lack production for.

<plan>
Trade 4 ORE for 1 WOOD to build a road toward node 2. This expands my network toward the WOOD hex I currently lack. In future turns, focus on securing WHEAT production through expansion and continue building toward resources I lack. Development cards remain a good option if I can secure WHEAT.
</plan>

Since I can use the WOOD immediately with my existing BRICK to build a road and advance my position, trading for WOOD is the most strategic choice.

# Game Analysis

Let me analyze my current situation and available options:

## Current Resources:
- 1 WOOD, 1 BRICK, 2 SHEEP
- I can build exactly one road with my WOOD and BRICK

## My Production:
- Node 0: ORE (9), BRICK (3), SHEEP (5) - solid production
- Node 7: No resource production - this is a weakness

## Board Position:
- I need to expand to improve my resource diversity
- Currently lacking WHEAT production completely
- My settlement at node 7 needs to be connected to resources

## Road Options Analysis:
1. Edge (0, 1): Extends toward the desert and SHEEP
2. Edge (0, 20): Extends toward SHEEP production
3. Edge (6, 23): Extends from my non-producing settlement toward SHEEP
4. Edge (4, 5): Connect between ORE and BRICK
5. Edge (5, 16): Connect toward RED's settlement
6. Edge (1, 6): Connect toward the SHEEP hex
7. Edge (7, 8): Extend from my non-producing settlement toward potential expansion

Looking at these options, I need to prioritize connecting my non-producing settlement at node 7 to valuable resources. Option 7 (edge 7-8) seems most logical as it extends toward the WHEAT hex (1, -1, 0) which I currently lack completely.

<plan>
Build road at edge (7, 8) to extend from my non-producing settlement toward the WHEAT hex. In future turns, continue expanding from node 8 toward node 9 to access both WHEAT and WOOD production. Then build a settlement at node 9 to secure both resources I currently lack. Afterward, focus on city upgrades with my improved ORE and WHEAT production.
</plan>

This road placement is part of a clear path to a new settlement that would give me access to WHEAT and WOOD, addressing my current resource gaps. The other options don't offer such a direct path to improving my resource diversity.

- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 61 | Player: BLUE | Action: MOVE_ROBBER

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  Build road at edge (7, 8) to extend from my non-producing settlement toward the WHEAT hex. In future turns, continue expanding from node 8 toward node 9 to access both WHEAT and WOOD production. Then build a settlement at node 9 to secure both resources I currently lack. Afterward, focus on city upgrades with my improved ORE and WHEAT production.
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.

# Analyzing Game State and Robber Placement Options

Let me carefully assess the current situation:

- I'm far behind with only 2 VP compared to RED's 9 VP (they're just 1 point away from winning)
- I have limited resources - just 1 sheep card
- My current plan involves expanding toward wheat and wood resources
- I need to make a robber placement that maximizes my chances of survival and comeback

## Robber Placement Analysis:

Let me analyze each option:

**[0] Move robber to (0, 0, 0) and steal from RED**
- This is the Ore hex with a 9 value (good probability)
- This blocks RED's settlement at node 3, which produces ore
- Blocks one of my own settlements at node 0
- Not ideal since I'd be hurting my own limited production

**[1] Move robber to (0, -1, 1) and steal from RED**
- This is the Wood hex with a 4 value
- Blocks RED's production at nodes 3 and 11
- Doesn't affect my own production
- Wood is crucial for RED's road building and settlements

**[2] Move robber to (-1, 0, 1) and steal from RED**
- This is a Wheat hex with a 6 value (high probability)
- Blocks RED's settlements at nodes 3 and 15
- Wheat is critical for RED to build settlements, cities, and development cards
- High value number (6) makes this a strong blocker

**[3] Move robber to (-1, 1, 0) and steal from RED**
- This is a Wheat hex with a 10 value
- Blocks RED's settlements at nodes 15 and 16
- Lower probability number, but still blocks wheat

**[4] Move robber to (0, 1, -1) and steal from RED**
- This is a Brick hex with a 3 value
- Blocks RED's settlement at node 16
- Also blocks my settlement at node 0
- Low probability number and blocks my own production

**[5] Move robber to (1, 0, -1)**
- This is a Sheep hex with a 5 value
- Blocks my settlement at node 0
- Cannot steal from RED
- Blocks my own production

## Strategic Decision:

RED is at 9 VP and close to winning. My priority must be to disrupt their ability to reach 10 VP:

- Option [2] is optimal because:
  1. It blocks a high-probability wheat hex (6 value)
  2. It affects two of RED's buildings (including a city at node 15)
  3. Wheat is critical for RED to build settlements, cities, and development cards
  4. It doesn't block any of my own production
  5. I get to steal a card from RED, possibly getting a useful resource

<plan>
Block RED's wheat production with the robber to slow them down. Continue with my road building plan toward node 9 to secure wheat and wood production. Given RED is at 9 VP, I need to aggressively interfere with their resource production while expanding my own capabilities.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL SETTLEMENT PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Place settlements on high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Target at least one spot with good ore and wheat production for city development
- Try to secure at least one high-probability spot (5, 6, 8, 9) for each critical resource
- Place your second settlement to complement your first (fill resource gaps)
- Aim for access to all five resources or position near useful ports if resource diversity isn't possible
- Always consider which settlements opponents are likely to place and avoid areas that will become contested
- Place roads pointing toward valuable future expansion spots, not toward the center
- Consider the long-term impact: settlements that can't expand are less valuable

MID-GAME RESOURCE PRIORITIES:
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each possible build (cities: 1VP for 5 resources is most efficient)
- Early phase: Secure at least one good source of brick and wood for minimal expansion
- Growth phase: Prioritize ore and wheat production for city upgrades (3VP for 5 resources is optimal)
- Late phase: Focus on the fastest path to victory points, whether through buildings or development cards
- Avoid trading resources that opponents need for immediate victory point gains
- Use 4:1 trades only when necessary; prioritize port usage when possible

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and limited expansion options
- If you get an early knight, save it for defense or until you can start building toward largest army
- Time monopoly card usage for when opponents likely have accumulated specific resources
- Save year of plenty cards for completing crucial builds when you're short 1-2 specific resources
- Development cards are most valuable when:
  * You need hidden victory points to surprise opponents
  * You need knights to break up longest road or secure largest army
  * You're lacking wood/brick for expansion but have plenty of sheep/wheat/ore

EXPANSION STRATEGY:
- Build roads only with clear settlement locations in mind
- Target settlements that give you access to ports or new resources
- Block opponents' expansion paths when it gives you a strategic advantage
- Consider the timing of expansion vs. city upgrades based on your resource production
- Calculate whether longest road is achievable and worth the resource investment
- When deciding between a new settlement and a city upgrade, compare immediate vs. long-term returns

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-probability hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Save knight cards for breaking up opponent strategies or securing largest army
- Use knights defensively if you're producing valuable resources on high-probability hexes

TRADING TACTICS:
- Avoid trading resources that directly help opponents score points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades
- Trade excess resources before rolling 7 if you have more than 7 cards
- Consider bank/port trades when they enable an immediate build that advances your strategy
- When trading with players, try to receive resources that complete a build

ENDGAME STRATEGY:
- In the late game, hide your victory point potential (keep development cards hidden)
- Calculate the fastest path to 10 VP and focus exclusively on that path
- Be aware of the exact number of remaining development cards and their probabilities
- Track opponents' potential victory points, including hidden development cards
- If you're close to winning, prioritize actions that can be completed in a single turn

Before finalizing your action, check:
1. Is there a more efficient path to victory points?
2. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
3. Does this move help or hinder opponents?
4. Is there a defensive move needed to prevent an opponent from winning?
5. Are you properly diversified against dice probability?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 69 | Player: BLUE | Action: MOVE_ROBBER

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  Block RED's wheat production with the robber to slow them down. Continue with my road building plan toward node 9 to secure wheat and wood production. Given RED is at 9 VP, I need to aggressively interfere with their resource production while expanding my own capabilities.
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.

# Game Analysis for Robber Placement

I need to analyze the current game state and determine the optimal location to place the robber to maximize my chances of winning.

## Current Game State:
- RED has 9/10 VP (with Longest Road +2 VP)
- I (BLUE) have only 2/10 VP
- I have only 1 ORE resource
- RED is 1 point away from winning, so stopping them is critical

## Robber Placement Strategy:
Let me analyze each placement option:

### [0] Move robber to (0, 0, 0) - ORE with number 9
- This hex produces ORE on a roll of 9 (quite good probability)
- RED has a city here, producing 2 ORE per roll
- I also have a settlement here, so I would block my own production
- NOT ideal as I'd hurt my own limited production

### [1] Move robber to (0, -1, 1) - WOOD with number 4
- This hex produces WOOD on a roll of 4 (medium probability)
- RED has settlements that would be blocked
- This would limit RED's expansion capabilities
- Decent option to slow RED down

### [2] Move robber to (-1, 0, 1) - WHEAT with number 6
- This hex produces WHEAT on roll of 6 (high probability - 5/36 chance)
- RED has a city here, producing 2 WHEAT per roll
- WHEAT is critical for settlements, cities, and development cards
- This would significantly slow RED's production on a high-probability resource

### [3] Move robber to (-1, 1, 0) - WHEAT with number 10
- This hex produces WHEAT on roll of 10 (medium probability)
- RED has two cities connected to this hex
- This would block RED's wheat production
- Good option but probability is lower than option 2

### [4] Move robber to (0, 1, -1) - BRICK with number 3
- This hex produces BRICK on roll of 3 (low probability - 2/36 chance)
- RED has a city connected to this
- Low impact due to low probability number

### [5] Move robber to (1, 0, -1) - SHEEP with number 5
- This hex produces SHEEP on roll of 5 (good probability - 4/36 chance)
- I have a settlement here, so I would block my own production
- This would hurt my own development
- NOT a good choice

## Decision:
Looking at RED's production and my goal to slow them down, I should target their highest-probability resource that I don't rely on. Option [2] places the robber on a WHEAT hex with a 6 (high probability), which RED's city produces from. This is optimal because:

1. It blocks a high-probability resource (6 is rolled with 5/36 chance)
2. RED has a city on this hex, so it blocks 2 WHEAT per roll
3. WHEAT is critical for settlements, cities, and development cards
4. I don't have any production on this hex, so I won't hurt myself

<plan>
Block RED's high-probability WHEAT production with the robber. Focus on building roads toward node 9 to secure wheat and wood production. Continue to interfere with RED's resource production while I catch up in points.
</plan>
