PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Target hexes with HIGH probability numbers (6,8,5,9) - prioritize these above all else
- Go for resource DIVERSITY: secure ALL five resources between your two settlements
- Focus on ORE and WHEAT for city upgrades (numbers 5-9 preferred)
- Evaluate each potential settlement by its TOTAL PIP COUNT (sum of probability dots)
- Place your initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Avoid placing both settlements near the same resources - diversify your income!
- Always consider 3:1 ports if your initial placement gives you limited access to certain resources
- Place roads in directions that block opponents' expansion routes

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT & CITY BUILDING PRIORITY:
- FIRST PRIORITY: Build 1-2 additional settlements early to secure critical resources you lack
- SECOND PRIORITY: Upgrade to cities as quickly as possible to double resource production
- THIRD PRIORITY: Build roads only when they lead directly to valuable settlement locations
- Early game (1-5 turns): Secure key settlements at high-value locations
- Mid-game (6-15 turns): Focus heavily on upgrading to cities (2-3 cities should be your target)
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road
- When short on a key resource, use 2:1 ports if available before using 3:1 or 4:1 ports
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat to other players unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- If you have excess of a resource, use ports rather than trading with opponents

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards primarily when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber OR to reach Largest Army (3+ knights)
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city or settlement build
- Use Monopoly cards after high-probability dice rolls to collect maximum resources
- Keep track of how many VP cards you've drawn (5 in the deck total)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn
- When development cards are your path to victory, aim for: 3 cities (6 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 victory cards (2 VP)
- Consider buying development cards when you have limited build options (blocked roads, etc.)

OPTIMAL EXPANSION PATH:
- Build roads with PURPOSE - every road should lead to a viable settlement location
- Identify and secure "bottleneck" positions that cut off opponents' expansion
- Expand toward resources you LACK from initial placement - seek balance
- When choosing between multiple settlement spots, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (total pip count)
  2. Access to resources you currently lack
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, securing future expansion)
  4. Proximity to useful ports
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Longest road (2 VP) requires strategic planning - only pursue if you already have 4+ roads built

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- When someone has 8+ points, ALWAYS target them with the robber regardless of other factors
- If you're being targeted by the robber, consider using knight cards immediately to protect production

TURN-BY-TURN PLANNING:
1. Start each turn by assessing your current VP and opponents' VPs (both visible and potential hidden points)
2. Identify your build priority for this turn: settlement, city, road, or development card?
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for your priority build
4. If you can't build your priority item, determine if trading or buying a development card is better
5. Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card or trade for needed resources
6. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

WINNING PATHS:
1. CITY-FOCUSED PATH: 3-4 cities (6-8 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 9-11 VP
2. BALANCED PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 VP card = 10 VP
3. DEVELOPMENT PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP

NEVER SAY NO TO FREE VPs:
- Always account for the 2 VP from longest road and largest army in your plans
- These special cards are EASY to lose if you're not defending them
- Invest in roads/knights to maintain your lead if these VPs are part of your strategy
- Be alert for opponents trying to steal these bonus points

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Initial Settlement Placement Analysis

I need to place my first settlement optimally, focusing on high-probability numbers, resource diversity, and strategic position.

## Step 1: Identify high-value spots (hexes with 6, 8, 5, 9)
- 🐑6 (1, -1, 0) - Adjacent to nodes 1,2,6,7,8,9
- ⛏️8 (2, -2, 0) - Adjacent to nodes 7,8,24,25,26,27
- ⛏️8 (-1, 2, -1) - Adjacent to nodes 16,18,21,40,43,44
- 🌾6 (-1, 0, 1) - Adjacent to nodes 3,4,12,13,14,15
- 🌲5 (1, -2, 1) - Adjacent to nodes 8,9,10,27,28,29
- 🌲5 (2, -1, -1) - Adjacent to nodes 6,7,23,24,52,53
- 🧱9 (0, 0, 0) - Adjacent to nodes 0,1,2,3,4,5
- 🌾9 (1, 1, -2) - Adjacent to nodes 19,20,22,46,48,49

## Step 2: Evaluate intersection points with multiple high-value hexes
Node 8: connects to 🐑6[⭐⭐⭐], ⛏️8[⭐⭐⭐], 🌲5[⭐⭐] - EXCELLENT but taken by RED
Node 7: connects to 🐑6[⭐⭐⭐], ⛏️8[⭐⭐⭐], 🌲5[⭐⭐] - EXCELLENT but adjacent to RED's settlement

Looking at other high-value intersections:
- Node 1: connects to 🧱9, 🌾11, 🐑6 (strong production with brick, wheat, sheep)
- Node 3: connects to 🧱9, 🌾6, 🧱10 (good wheat and abundant brick)
- Node 20: connects to 🌾11, 🌾9, 🌾4 (triple wheat but poor diversity)
- Node 23: connects to 🌲5, 🌾4, 🌲5 (double wood with wheat but limited diversity)

## Step 3: Consider resource diversity and ports
Since this is our first settlement, we need to secure diverse resources, ideally including ore and wheat for city development.

Notable options:
- Node 1: 🧱9, 🌾11, 🐑6 (brick, wheat, sheep - high probability numbers)
- Node 3: 🧱9, 🌾6, 🧱10 (brick, wheat, another brick)
- Node 16: ⛏️8, 🧱3, Desert (ore, brick but lower total probability)
- Node 18: ⛏️8, 🌲12, ⛏️3 (ore, wood but low probability for wood)

## Step 4: Consider pip count (probability dots)
Node 1: 🧱9[⭐⭐⭐⭐], 🌾11[⭐⭐], 🐑6[⭐⭐⭐] = 9 total pips
Node 3: 🧱9[⭐⭐⭐⭐], 🌾6[⭐⭐⭐], 🧱10[⭐⭐⭐] = 10 total pips
Node 16: ⛏️8[⭐⭐⭐], ⛏️3[⭐⭐], Desert = 5 total pips

## Step 5: Consider strategic expansion options
Node 1 gives good access to the eastern side of the board with expansion opportunities
Node 3 provides strong brick production which will help with early road building

## Final Decision
Node 1 offers the best combination of:
- High probability numbers (6, 9, 11)
- Good resource diversity (brick, wheat, sheep)
- Strong position for future expansion
- Opposite side of the board from RED's settlement

<plan>
1. Place initial settlement at Node 1 to secure brick, wheat and sheep with high probability
2. For second settlement, look for ore and wood resources on the other side of the board
3. Early game focus on securing another settlement with ore access
4. Mid-game focus on city upgrades
</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Target hexes with HIGH probability numbers (6,8,5,9) - prioritize these above all else

- Evaluate each potential settlement by its TOTAL PIP COUNT (sum of probability dots)
- Place your initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Avoid placing both settlements near the same resources - diversify your income!
- Always consider 3:1 ports if your initial placement gives you limited access to certain resources
- Place roads in directions that block opponents' expansion routes

- NEVER trade away ore or wheat to other players unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- If you have excess of a resource, use ports rather than trading with opponents

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards primarily when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber OR to reach Largest Army (3+ knights)
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city or settlement build
- Use Monopoly cards after high-probability dice rolls to collect maximum resources
- Keep track of how many VP cards you've drawn (5 in the deck total)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn
- When development cards are your path to victory, aim for: 3 cities (6 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 victory cards (2 VP)
- Consider buying development cards when you have limited build options (blocked roads, etc.)

OPTIMAL EXPANSION PATH:
- Build roads with PURPOSE - every road should lead to a viable settlement location
- Identify and secure "bottleneck" positions that cut off opponents' expansion
- Expand toward resources you LACK from initial placement - seek balance
- When choosing between multiple settlement spots, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (total pip count)
  2. Access to resources you currently lack
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, securing future expansion)
  4. Proximity to useful ports
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Longest road (2 VP) requires strategic planning - only pursue if you already have 4+ roads built

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- When someone has 8+ points, ALWAYS target them with the robber regardless of other factors
- If you're being targeted by the robber, consider using knight cards immediately to protect production

TURN-BY-TURN PLANNING:
1. Start each turn by assessing your current VP and opponents' VPs (both visible and potential hidden points)
2. Identify your build priority for this turn: settlement, city, road, or development card?
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for your priority build
4. If you can't build your priority item, determine if trading or buying a development card is better
5. Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card or trade for needed resources
6. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

WINNING PATHS:
1. CITY-FOCUSED PATH: 3-4 cities (6-8 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 9-11 VP
2. BALANCED PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 VP card = 10 VP
3. DEVELOPMENT PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP

NEVER SAY NO TO FREE VPs:
- Always account for the 2 VP from longest road and largest army in your plans
- These special cards are EASY to lose if you're not defending them
- Invest in roads/knights to maintain your lead if these VPs are part of your strategy
- Be alert for opponents trying to steal these bonus points

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 1 | Player: BLUE | Action: BUILD_INITIAL_ROAD

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Place initial settlement at Node 1 to secure brick, wheat and sheep with high probability
2. For second settlement, look for ore and wood resources on the other side of the board
3. Early game focus on securing another settlement with ore access
4. Mid-game focus on city upgrades

# Initial Road Placement Analysis

I need to choose the best initial road placement from my settlement at node 1. Let me analyze each option carefully to determine the optimal path for expansion.

## Current Settlement Location
My initial settlement is at node 1, which gives me access to:
- 🧱9 (2 dots probability)
- 🐑6 (5 dots probability - very good)
- 🌾11 (2 dots probability)

This gives me brick, sheep, and wheat, but I'm missing wood and ore. According to the initial placement strategy, I need to diversify and secure all five resources between my two settlements.

## Option Analysis

**Option 0: Road at edge (0, 1)**
- Leads toward the center of the board
- Does not follow optimal strategy (roads should NEVER point toward the center in initial placement)
- Does not move toward securing missing resources (wood and ore)

**Option 1: Road at edge (1, 6)**
- Leads toward node 6, which connects to:
  - 🐑6 (already have access)
  - 🌲5 (missing resource - wood)
  - 🌲5 (second wood hex)
- Points toward expansion in the direction of wood (missing resource)
- Creates potential for future expansion toward ore hexes

**Option 2: Road at edge (1, 2)**
- Leads toward node 2, which connects to:
  - 🐑6 (already have access)
  - 🧱10 (already have brick access)
- Does not provide direct path toward missing resources

<plan>
1. Place initial road toward node 6 to set up for expansion toward wood and later ore
2. Look for second settlement with good ore and wood production on opposite side of board
3. Early game focus on building 1-2 new settlements to secure all resources
4. Mid-game focus on city upgrades (prioritize wheat/ore spots)
</plan>

Option 1 is clearly the best choice as it:
1. Points toward a resource I'm missing (wood)
2. Creates better expansion opportunities
3. Follows the principle of moving away from the center
4. Sets me up to potentially secure both wood and ore in future settlements

\boxed{1}
========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Target hexes with HIGH probability numbers (6,8,5,9) - prioritize these above all else
- Go for resource DIVERSITY: secure ALL five resources between your two settlements
- Focus on ORE and WHEAT for city upgrades (numbers 5-9 preferred)
- Evaluate each potential settlement by its TOTAL PIP COUNT (sum of probability dots)
- Place your initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Avoid placing both settlements near the same resources - diversify your income!
- Always consider 3:1 ports if your initial placement gives you limited access to certain resources
- Place roads in directions that block opponents' expansion routes

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT & CITY BUILDING PRIORITY:
- FIRST PRIORITY: Build 1-2 additional settlements early to secure critical resources you lack
- SECOND PRIORITY: Upgrade to cities as quickly as possible to double resource production
- THIRD PRIORITY: Build roads only when they lead directly to valuable settlement locations
- Early game (1-5 turns): Secure key settlements at high-value locations
- Mid-game (6-15 turns): Focus heavily on upgrading to cities (2-3 cities should be your target)
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road
- When short on a key resource, use 2:1 ports if available before using 3:1 or 4:1 ports
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat to other players unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- If you have excess of a resource, use ports rather than trading with opponents

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards primarily when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber OR to reach Largest Army (3+ knights)
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city or settlement build
- Use Monopoly cards after high-probability dice rolls to collect maximum resources
- Keep track of how many VP cards you've drawn (5 in the deck total)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn
- When development cards are your path to victory, aim for: 3 cities (6 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 victory cards (2 VP)
- Consider buying development cards when you have limited build options (blocked roads, etc.)

OPTIMAL EXPANSION PATH:
- Build roads with PURPOSE - every road should lead to a viable settlement location
- Identify and secure "bottleneck" positions that cut off opponents' expansion
- Expand toward resources you LACK from initial placement - seek balance
- When choosing between multiple settlement spots, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (total pip count)
  2. Access to resources you currently lack
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, securing future expansion)
  4. Proximity to useful ports
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Longest road (2 VP) requires strategic planning - only pursue if you already have 4+ roads built

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- When someone has 8+ points, ALWAYS target them with the robber regardless of other factors
- If you're being targeted by the robber, consider using knight cards immediately to protect production

TURN-BY-TURN PLANNING:
1. Start each turn by assessing your current VP and opponents' VPs (both visible and potential hidden points)
2. Identify your build priority for this turn: settlement, city, road, or development card?
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for your priority build
4. If you can't build your priority item, determine if trading or buying a development card is better
5. Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card or trade for needed resources
6. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

WINNING PATHS:
1. CITY-FOCUSED PATH: 3-4 cities (6-8 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 9-11 VP
2. BALANCED PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 VP card = 10 VP
3. DEVELOPMENT PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP

NEVER SAY NO TO FREE VPs:
- Always account for the 2 VP from longest road and largest army in your plans
- These special cards are EASY to lose if you're not defending them
- Invest in roads/knights to maintain your lead if these VPs are part of your strategy
- Be alert for opponents trying to steal these bonus points

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 1 | Player: BLUE | Action: BUILD_INITIAL_SETTLEMENT

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Place initial road toward node 6 to set up for expansion toward wood and later ore
2. Look for second settlement with good ore and wood production on opposite side of board
3. Early game focus on building 1-2 new settlements to secure all resources
4. Mid-game focus on city upgrades (prioritize wheat/ore spots)
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.
  To adjust your plan, provide a NEW PLAN in your reasoning with <plan>your new plan</plan>

# Analysis for Second Initial Settlement Placement

I need to carefully select my second initial settlement placement by following the initial placement strategy guidelines:

1. Target high probability numbers (6,8,5,9)
2. Secure all five resources between my two settlements
3. Focus on ore and wheat for city upgrades
4. Evaluate by total pip count
5. Place on opposite sides from my first settlement
6. Consider expansion paths, ports, and blocking opponents

## Current Resources
My first settlement is at node 1, producing:
- 🧱 Brick (9) - high value [2 pips]
- 🐑 Sheep (6) - high value [3 pips]
- 🌾 Wheat (11) - low value [1 pip]

I already have access to brick, sheep, and wheat, but I'm missing:
- 🌲 Wood
- ⛏️ Ore

## Priority Analysis
I should focus on:
1. Securing wood and ore resources
2. Finding high probability numbers (especially 5, 6, 8, 9)
3. Placing on the opposite side of the board from node 1
4. Considering proximity to useful ports

## Examining Key Options

**Node 14**: Sits on 🐑(3), 🐑(11), 🌾(6) hexes
- Pros: Good wheat number (6)
- Cons: No wood or ore, duplicates sheep which I already have

**Node 17**: Sits on 🐑(11), ⛏️(3), 🌲(12) hexes
- Pros: Provides wood and ore (completing all resources)
- Cons: Poor numbers (3, 11, 12) with low probability

**Node 24**: Sits on ⛏️(8), 🌲(5) hexes
- Pros: High-value numbers for both wood and ore (8 and 5), completes my resource diversity
- Cons: Only two resources instead of three

**Node 26**: Sits on ⛏️(8) hex and brick port
- Pros: High-value ore (8), access to brick port
- Cons: Only one resource, no wood

**Node 37**: Sits on 🐑(3), 🐑(11), ⛏️(3) hexes
- Pros: Provides ore
- Cons: Poor numbers, no wood, duplicates sheep

**Node 43**: Sits on ⛏️(8), 🌲(4) hexes
- Pros: Provides both missing resources, good ore number (8)
- Cons: Wood number is only moderate (4)

## Best Options Calculation

Looking at the most promising nodes for resource diversity and probability:

**Node 24**:
- ⛏️(8) [3 pips] + 🌲(5) [2 pips] = 5 pips
- Completes my resource diversity
- High probability numbers for both resources
- On opposite side of the board from first settlement

**Node 43**:
- ⛏️(8) [3 pips] + 🌲(4) [1 pip] = 4 pips
- Completes my resource diversity
- Good ore number but weaker wood number
- On opposite side of the board from first settlement

## Final Decision
After analyzing all options, node 24 is clearly superior. It gives me access to both missing resources (wood and ore) with high probability numbers (8 and 5). This completes my resource diversity between my two settlements and secures excellent numbers for city building (ore) and early expansion (wood).

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Target hexes with HIGH probability numbers (6,8,5,9) - prioritize these above all else
- Go for resource DIVERSITY: secure ALL five resources between your two settlements
- Focus on ORE and WHEAT for city upgrades (numbers 5-9 preferred)
- Evaluate each potential settlement by its TOTAL PIP COUNT (sum of probability dots)
- Place your initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Avoid placing both settlements near the same resources - diversify your income!
- Always consider 3:1 ports if your initial placement gives you limited access to certain resources
- Place roads in directions that block opponents' expansion routes

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT & CITY BUILDING PRIORITY:
- FIRST PRIORITY: Build 1-2 additional settlements early to secure critical resources you lack
- SECOND PRIORITY: Upgrade to cities as quickly as possible to double resource production
- THIRD PRIORITY: Build roads only when they lead directly to valuable settlement locations
- Early game (1-5 turns): Secure key settlements at high-value locations
- Mid-game (6-15 turns): Focus heavily on upgrading to cities (2-3 cities should be your target)
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road
- When short on a key resource, use 2:1 ports if available before using 3:1 or 4:1 ports
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat to other players unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- If you have excess of a resource, use ports rather than trading with opponents

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards primarily when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber OR to reach Largest Army (3+ knights)
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city or settlement build
- Use Monopoly cards after high-probability dice rolls to collect maximum resources
- Keep track of how many VP cards you've drawn (5 in the deck total)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn
- When development cards are your path to victory, aim for: 3 cities (6 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 victory cards (2 VP)
- Consider buying development cards when you have limited build options (blocked roads, etc.)

OPTIMAL EXPANSION PATH:
- Build roads with PURPOSE - every road should lead to a viable settlement location
- Identify and secure "bottleneck" positions that cut off opponents' expansion
- Expand toward resources you LACK from initial placement - seek balance
- When choosing between multiple settlement spots, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (total pip count)
  2. Access to resources you currently lack
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, securing future expansion)
  4. Proximity to useful ports
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Longest road (2 VP) requires strategic planning - only pursue if you already have 4+ roads built

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- When someone has 8+ points, ALWAYS target them with the robber regardless of other factors
- If you're being targeted by the robber, consider using knight cards immediately to protect production

TURN-BY-TURN PLANNING:
1. Start each turn by assessing your current VP and opponents' VPs (both visible and potential hidden points)
2. Identify your build priority for this turn: settlement, city, road, or development card?
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for your priority build
4. If you can't build your priority item, determine if trading or buying a development card is better
5. Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card or trade for needed resources
6. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

WINNING PATHS:
1. CITY-FOCUSED PATH: 3-4 cities (6-8 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 9-11 VP
2. BALANCED PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 VP card = 10 VP
3. DEVELOPMENT PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP

NEVER SAY NO TO FREE VPs:
- Always account for the 2 VP from longest road and largest army in your plans
- These special cards are EASY to lose if you're not defending them
- Invest in roads/knights to maintain your lead if these VPs are part of your strategy
- Be alert for opponents trying to steal these bonus points

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 1 | Player: BLUE | Action: BUILD_INITIAL_ROAD

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Place initial road toward node 6 to set up for expansion toward wood and later ore
2. Look for second settlement with good ore and wood production on opposite side of board
3. Early game focus on building 1-2 new settlements to secure all resources
4. Mid-game focus on city upgrades (prioritize wheat/ore spots)
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.
  To adjust your plan, provide a NEW PLAN in your reasoning with <plan>your new plan</plan>

# Initial Road Placement Analysis

Let me analyze my options carefully for this crucial first road placement after my initial settlements.

## Current Game State
- I have 2 settlements:
  1. Node 1: Produces 🧱9, 🐑6, 🌾11
  2. Node 24: Produces ⛏️8, 🌲5
- My current resources: 1 🌲WOOD, 1 ⛏️ORE (not enough to build anything yet)
- I need to place my second initial road (free)

## Road Placement Options
Let me examine each option:

**[0] Road at edge (24, 53)**
- Direction: Toward the coast
- This leads toward the 2:1 wood port (nodes 48, 49)
- Node 53 connects to 🌲5 (already have access)
- Limited expansion opportunities in this direction

**[1] Road at edge (24, 25)**
- Direction: Toward the brick port
- This leads to node 25 which connects to ⛏️8 (already have access)
- Could eventually reach 2:1 brick port (nodes 25, 26)
- Allows expansion toward northeast corner

**[2] Road at edge (7, 24)**
- Direction: Connecting my two settlements
- This begins building a connection between my settlements
- Node 7 connects to 🐑6, ⛏️8, 🌲5 (all resources I already have)
- Could help with longest road later

## Strategic Analysis
Looking at my current settlements:
- I'm already producing wood, ore, sheep, and wheat
- I'm missing brick which is critical for early expansion
- My settlements are on opposite sides of the board (good for expansion)

I need to prioritize:
1. Access to resources I lack (brick)
2. Setting up for promising future settlement locations
3. Blocking opponent expansion if strategic

<plan>
1. Build road toward promising settlement locations with brick production
2. Secure a settlement with brick ASAP to complete my resource diversity
3. Then focus on building 1-2 more settlements in high-value locations
4. Mid-game transition to city upgrades (prioritizing wheat/ore spots)
</plan>

## Final Decision
Option [1] (road at edge 24, 25) gives me the best strategic position:
- Points toward a brick port which will help offset my lack of brick production
- Creates expansion opportunities toward uncontested areas
- More flexible than option [0] which leads only to a port
- Better than option [2] which doesn't open new territory

# Analyzing Robber Placement Options

I need to evaluate the best hex to place the robber to maximize my strategic advantage. Let's analyze this step by step.

## Game State Assessment
- I'm playing as BLUE with 2 VP
- RED also has 2 VP with 7 resource cards (danger of losing half on a 7 roll)
- RED has settlements on nodes 3 and 8, which produce resources from multiple hexes
- I need to build my resource diversity, particularly BRICK

## Priority Targets Analysis
Let's analyze RED's production sources to determine which would hurt them most:
1. RED at node 8 produces: 🐑6[⭐⭐⭐], ⛏️8[⭐⭐⭐], 🌲5[⭐⭐]
2. RED at node 3 produces: 🧱9[⭐⭐], 🧱10[⭐], 🌾6[⭐⭐⭐]

The highest value hexes for RED are:
- 🐑6 (Sheep) [⭐⭐⭐] - hex (1,-1,0)
- ⛏️8 (Ore) [⭐⭐⭐] - hex (2,-2,0) 
- 🌾6 (Wheat) [⭐⭐⭐] - hex (-1,0,1)

## My Resource Needs
From my plan, I need to prioritize BRICK for building roads and settlements. RED has access to brick production on two hexes (9 and 10), while I have none.

## Best Options Analysis
1. Option [1] - Move to (1,-1,0) blocks RED's highest production 🐑6 [⭐⭐⭐]
   - Also blocks one of my own settlements, but sheep is less critical than brick
   
2. Option [6] - Move to (2,-2,0) blocks RED's ⛏️8 [⭐⭐⭐] production
   - But also blocks one of my own settlements at node 24 from receiving ore
   
3. Option [3] - Move to (-1,0,1) blocks RED's 🌾6 [⭐⭐⭐] production
   - Doesn't block any of my production

4. Option [2] - Move to (0,-1,1) blocks RED's 🧱10 [⭐] production
   - Targeting brick would hurt RED's ability to expand
   
5. Option [0] - Move to (0,0,0) blocks RED's 🧱9 [⭐⭐] production
   - Targeting brick would hurt RED's ability to expand
   - But also blocks my settlement at node 1 from brick production

## Final Decision
Since I need BRICK myself and don't want to block my own brick production, Options [3] is the best choice - blocking RED's wheat production without hurting my own resource generation.

Option [3] will block RED's wheat at (-1,0,1), which is a critical resource for building cities, and I'll steal a card from RED.

<plan>
1. Block RED's wheat production to slow down their city upgrades
2. Focus on acquiring brick for road building toward settlement spots
3. Target a settlement with brick production ASAP
4. Then transition to city upgrades when I have sufficient production
</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Target hexes with HIGH probability numbers (6,8,5,9) - prioritize these above all else
- Go for resource DIVERSITY: secure ALL five resources between your two settlements
- Focus on ORE and WHEAT for city upgrades (numbers 5-9 preferred)
- Evaluate each potential settlement by its TOTAL PIP COUNT (sum of probability dots)
- Place your initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Avoid placing both settlements near the same resources - diversify your income!
- Always consider 3:1 ports if your initial placement gives you limited access to certain resources
- Place roads in directions that block opponents' expansion routes

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT & CITY BUILDING PRIORITY:
- FIRST PRIORITY: Build 1-2 additional settlements early to secure critical resources you lack
- SECOND PRIORITY: Upgrade to cities as quickly as possible to double resource production
- THIRD PRIORITY: Build roads only when they lead directly to valuable settlement locations
- Early game (1-5 turns): Secure key settlements at high-value locations
- Mid-game (6-15 turns): Focus heavily on upgrading to cities (2-3 cities should be your target)
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road
- When short on a key resource, use 2:1 ports if available before using 3:1 or 4:1 ports
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat to other players unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- If you have excess of a resource, use ports rather than trading with opponents

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards primarily when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber OR to reach Largest Army (3+ knights)
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city or settlement build
- Use Monopoly cards after high-probability dice rolls to collect maximum resources
- Keep track of how many VP cards you've drawn (5 in the deck total)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn
- When development cards are your path to victory, aim for: 3 cities (6 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 victory cards (2 VP)
- Consider buying development cards when you have limited build options (blocked roads, etc.)

OPTIMAL EXPANSION PATH:
- Build roads with PURPOSE - every road should lead to a viable settlement location
- Identify and secure "bottleneck" positions that cut off opponents' expansion
- Expand toward resources you LACK from initial placement - seek balance
- When choosing between multiple settlement spots, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (total pip count)
  2. Access to resources you currently lack
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, securing future expansion)
  4. Proximity to useful ports
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Longest road (2 VP) requires strategic planning - only pursue if you already have 4+ roads built

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- When someone has 8+ points, ALWAYS target them with the robber regardless of other factors
- If you're being targeted by the robber, consider using knight cards immediately to protect production

TURN-BY-TURN PLANNING:
1. Start each turn by assessing your current VP and opponents' VPs (both visible and potential hidden points)
2. Identify your build priority for this turn: settlement, city, road, or development card?
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for your priority build
4. If you can't build your priority item, determine if trading or buying a development card is better
5. Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card or trade for needed resources
6. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

WINNING PATHS:
1. CITY-FOCUSED PATH: 3-4 cities (6-8 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 9-11 VP
2. BALANCED PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 VP card = 10 VP
3. DEVELOPMENT PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP

NEVER SAY NO TO FREE VPs:
- Always account for the 2 VP from longest road and largest army in your plans
- These special cards are EASY to lose if you're not defending them
- Invest in roads/knights to maintain your lead if these VPs are part of your strategy
- Be alert for opponents trying to steal these bonus points

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 9 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Block RED's wheat production to slow down their city upgrades
2. Focus on acquiring brick for road building toward settlement spots

# Game Analysis for Blue Player (Turn 9)

Let me assess the current game state and available options:

## Current Resources
- 2 🌲WOOD
- 1 🐑SHEEP
- 1 🌾WHEAT
- 3 ⛏️ORE

## Victory Points Status
- Blue: 2 VP (from 2 settlements)
- Red: 2 VP (from 2 settlements)
- No longest road or largest army bonuses claimed yet

## Available Actions
- [0] End turn
- [1] Buy a development card (costs 1 🐑SHEEP, 1 🌾WHEAT, 1 ⛏️ORE)

## Strategic Analysis

I have exactly the resources needed to buy a development card. Let me evaluate if this is the optimal move:

1) **Development Card Benefits**:
   - Could be a Victory Point card (immediately +1 VP, hidden from opponents)
   - Could be a Knight (helps toward largest army and can move the robber)
   - Could be a Road Building, Year of Plenty, or Monopoly card

2) **Alternative - Save Resources**:
   - If I end my turn, I'll continue accumulating resources
   - I'm currently missing brick to build roads, and need more of other resources for settlements/cities
   - The robber is currently on wheat (not on my production hexes)

3) **Resource Evaluation**:
   - My ore production (8) is strong
   - I have no brick production, which limits expansion
   - My plan mentions acquiring brick for expansion

4) **Strategic Direction**:
   - Development cards offer a path to largest army (2VP)
   - They also provide flexibility with knights to protect my production
   - Getting a VP card would be an immediate hidden advantage

Looking at my current plan, I noted that I want to block Red's wheat production and focus on acquiring brick. However, I don't currently have options to directly achieve those objectives.

<plan>
1. Invest in development cards to work toward largest army (2VP)
2. Continue seeking opportunities to acquire brick through trades or favorable dice rolls
3. Use knights strategically to protect my production and disrupt Red's wheat income
4. Once I acquire brick, expand toward settlement spots that provide brick production
5. Work toward city upgrades using my strong ore production
</plan>

Given my limited options and that I have the exact resources needed for a development card, purchasing a development card is the optimal move. This aligns with the updated plan to work toward largest army while continuing to look for brick acquisition opportunities.

# Game State Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state to make an optimal decision:

**Current Position:**
- 2 victory points (2 settlements)
- Resources: 3 Wood, 2 Ore
- Development Cards: 1 Road Building card
- Turn 11 - middle game phase

**Opponent Position:**
- 3 victory points (3 settlements)
- Resources: 3 cards (hidden)
- Slightly ahead of me

## Options Analysis

I have two options:
1. Play Road Building card - Build two roads for free
2. Roll the dice

Let's evaluate each option:

### Option 0: Play Road Building Card
- Advantages:
  - Guaranteed progress toward infrastructure
  - Can place two roads without spending resources
  - Can begin working toward Longest Road (2 VP)
  - Gives me expansion options regardless of dice roll

### Option 1: Roll the Dice
- Advantages:
  - Could get more resources to build something this turn
  - May be able to save Road Building for when I need it more desperately
- Disadvantages:
  - Uncertain outcome
  - With only 5 resource cards, I can't build much even with a good roll
  - Might lose resources on a 7 roll

## Strategic Consideration

Looking at my settlement positions:
- Settlement at node 1 produces Brick(9), Sheep(6), Wheat(11)
- Settlement at node 24 produces Ore(8), Wood(5)

I currently have 3 Wood, 2 Ore - not enough for a settlement (need Brick, Sheep, Wheat + Wood) or city (need 3 Ore + 2 Wheat). The Road Building card is valuable because:
1. It saves 2 Wood + 2 Brick resources
2. It lets me expand regardless of what resources I collect
3. It positions me for future settlement placement

<plan>
1. Use Road Building to expand from my settlement at node 24 toward the Brick port
2. Position roads for a settlement that will increase my Brick production
3. Continue working toward city upgrades with my Ore production
4. Position myself to compete for Longest Road (2 VP)
</plan>

The Road Building card provides guaranteed progress this turn, whereas rolling has uncertain outcomes. Since I'm behind in victory points, I need to make tangible progress each turn.

PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Target hexes with HIGH probability numbers (6,8,5,9) - prioritize these above all else
- Go for resource DIVERSITY: secure ALL five resources between your two settlements
- Focus on ORE and WHEAT for city upgrades (numbers 5-9 preferred)
- Evaluate each potential settlement by its TOTAL PIP COUNT (sum of probability dots)
- Place your initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Avoid placing both settlements near the same resources - diversify your income!
- Always consider 3:1 ports if your initial placement gives you limited access to certain resources
- Place roads in directions that block opponents' expansion routes

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT & CITY BUILDING PRIORITY:
- FIRST PRIORITY: Build 1-2 additional settlements early to secure critical resources you lack
- SECOND PRIORITY: Upgrade to cities as quickly as possible to double resource production
- THIRD PRIORITY: Build roads only when they lead directly to valuable settlement locations
- Early game (1-5 turns): Secure key settlements at high-value locations
- Mid-game (6-15 turns): Focus heavily on upgrading to cities (2-3 cities should be your target)
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road
- When short on a key resource, use 2:1 ports if available before using 3:1 or 4:1 ports
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat to other players unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- If you have excess of a resource, use ports rather than trading with opponents

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards primarily when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber OR to reach Largest Army (3+ knights)
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city or settlement build
- Use Monopoly cards after high-probability dice rolls to collect maximum resources
- Keep track of how many VP cards you've drawn (5 in the deck total)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn
- When development cards are your path to victory, aim for: 3 cities (6 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 victory cards (2 VP)
- Consider buying development cards when you have limited build options (blocked roads, etc.)

OPTIMAL EXPANSION PATH:
- Build roads with PURPOSE - every road should lead to a viable settlement location
- Identify and secure "bottleneck" positions that cut off opponents' expansion
- Expand toward resources you LACK from initial placement - seek balance
- When choosing between multiple settlement spots, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (total pip count)
  2. Access to resources you currently lack
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, securing future expansion)
  4. Proximity to useful ports
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Longest road (2 VP) requires strategic planning - only pursue if you already have 4+ roads built

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- When someone has 8+ points, ALWAYS target them with the robber regardless of other factors
- If you're being targeted by the robber, consider using knight cards immediately to protect production

TURN-BY-TURN PLANNING:
1. Start each turn by assessing your current VP and opponents' VPs (both visible and potential hidden points)
2. Identify your build priority for this turn: settlement, city, road, or development card?
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for your priority build
4. If you can't build your priority item, determine if trading or buying a development card is better
5. Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card or trade for needed resources
6. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

WINNING PATHS:
1. CITY-FOCUSED PATH: 3-4 cities (6-8 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 9-11 VP
2. BALANCED PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 VP card = 10 VP
3. DEVELOPMENT PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP

NEVER SAY NO TO FREE VPs:
- Always account for the 2 VP from longest road and largest army in your plans
- These special cards are EASY to lose if you're not defending them
- Invest in roads/knights to maintain your lead if these VPs are part of your strategy
- Be alert for opponents trying to steal these bonus points

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 11 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Use Road Building to expand from my settlement at node 24 toward the Brick port
2. Position roads for a settlement that will increase my Brick production
3. Continue working toward city upgrades with my Ore production
4. Position myself to compete for Longest Road (2 VP)

# Game Analysis for Blue Player

Let me analyze the current game state to determine the best road building option:

## Game State Analysis
- I'm playing as BLUE with 2 VP (2 settlements)
- I have 3 🌲WOOD and 2 ⛏️ORE resources
- I just played a Road Building development card, allowing me to place 2 roads for free
- My current settlements are at node 1 and node 24
- My current plan involves expanding toward the Brick port

## Road Building Options Assessment
Let me evaluate each available option:

**Option [0] - Road at edge (24, 53):**
- This expands from my settlement at node 24 toward node 53, which is adjacent to a 2:1 Wood port
- However, this moves away from the Brick port that was in my plan

**Option [6] - Road at edge (25, 26):**
- This connects directly to the Brick port at nodes 25 and 26
- Aligns with my current plan to reach the Brick port
- Already have a road at (24, 25), so this completes the path to the port

**Option [5] - Road at edge (7, 24):**
- This creates a connection between my settlement at node 24 and node 7
- Could eventually lead to expanding toward resources I need

**Options [1], [2], [3], [4]:**
- These expand from my settlement at node 1
- Could potentially lead to new settlement locations, but aren't aligned with my current plan

## Strategic Considerations
Since I have a Road Building card, I'll be placing TWO roads this turn. The most strategic approach would be:
1. Build the road at (25, 26) to secure access to the Brick port
2. Then either build at (24, 53) or (7, 24) to begin expansion in a new direction

Looking at the board, option [6] followed by option [0] will:
1. Complete my access to the Brick port (critical for future building)
2. Begin expanding toward the Wood port, creating a longer road network

<plan>
1. Build road to complete access to the Brick port at (25, 26)
2. Then expand toward the Wood port (24, 53) to increase my road length
3. Work toward securing a third settlement that has strong Brick production
4. Continue accumulating resources for city upgrades
5. Position for Longest Road (2 VP) as a potential victory path
</plan>

Based on this analysis, I'll choose option [6] as my first road placement.

# Game Analysis for Blue Player (Turn 11)

I'll first assess our position and resources, then evaluate our available road-building options.

## Current Position:
- 2/10 VPs (from 2 settlements)
- Resources: 3 Wood, 2 Ore
- Buildings: 2 settlements, 3 roads (longest: 2)
- Recently played a ROAD_BUILDING card
- No development cards remaining

## Resource Status:
- Have plenty of Wood (3) to build a road
- Lacking Brick to build more roads
- Have some Ore (2), starting to build up for city upgrades
- Need Wheat and Sheep for development cards or settlements

## Game State Evaluation:
- We need to better position ourselves for expansion and VP acquisition
- Red is ahead with 3 VPs (3 settlements)
- Access to Brick port (25,26) already secured with our existing roads
- Robber is on a Wheat hex (-1,0,1) with value 6 - not affecting us directly

## Road Building Options Analysis:

1. Option [1]: Build road at (24, 53)
   - Moves toward Wood port (2:1)
   - Extends in a direction with future settlement possibilities
   - Continues with our current plan
   - Could help establish longest road later

2. Option [4]: Build road at (6, 23)
   - Creates connection between our two settlements
   - Opens path to new settlement spots
   - Could help with longest road
   
3. Option [3]: Build road at (26, 27)
   - Expands toward hex with 8 Ore (valuable resource)
   - Could block Red's expansion

4. Other options (0, 2, 5, 6) seem less strategic for our current position

After analyzing all options, I believe option [1] (building road at edge 24, 53) is most strategic as it:
1. Continues our plan to expand toward the Wood port
2. Sets us up for potential settlements in resource-rich areas
3. Positions us well for longest road (2 VP) in the future
4. Aligns with our current plan of expanding toward ports

<plan>
1. Build road to Wood port (24, 53) to establish better trading capability
2. Aim to collect brick and wood for additional roads to strengthen position for Longest Road
3. Work toward settling at node 53 to secure the Wood port
4. Continue accumulating Ore and Wheat for city upgrades at existing settlements
5. Position for Longest Road (2 VP) as a potential victory path
</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Target hexes with HIGH probability numbers (6,8,5,9) - prioritize these above all else
- Go for resource DIVERSITY: secure ALL five resources between your two settlements
- Focus on ORE and WHEAT for city upgrades (numbers 5-9 preferred)
- Evaluate each potential settlement by its TOTAL PIP COUNT (sum of probability dots)
- Place your initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Avoid placing both settlements near the same resources - diversify your income!
- Always consider 3:1 ports if your initial placement gives you limited access to certain resources
- Place roads in directions that block opponents' expansion routes

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT & CITY BUILDING PRIORITY:
- FIRST PRIORITY: Build 1-2 additional settlements early to secure critical resources you lack
- SECOND PRIORITY: Upgrade to cities as quickly as possible to double resource production
- THIRD PRIORITY: Build roads only when they lead directly to valuable settlement locations
- Early game (1-5 turns): Secure key settlements at high-value locations
- Mid-game (6-15 turns): Focus heavily on upgrading to cities (2-3 cities should be your target)
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road
- When short on a key resource, use 2:1 ports if available before using 3:1 or 4:1 ports
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat to other players unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- If you have excess of a resource, use ports rather than trading with opponents

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards primarily when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber OR to reach Largest Army (3+ knights)
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city or settlement build
- Use Monopoly cards after high-probability dice rolls to collect maximum resources
- Keep track of how many VP cards you've drawn (5 in the deck total)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn
- When development cards are your path to victory, aim for: 3 cities (6 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 victory cards (2 VP)
- Consider buying development cards when you have limited build options (blocked roads, etc.)

OPTIMAL EXPANSION PATH:
- Build roads with PURPOSE - every road should lead to a viable settlement location
- Identify and secure "bottleneck" positions that cut off opponents' expansion
- Expand toward resources you LACK from initial placement - seek balance
- When choosing between multiple settlement spots, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (total pip count)
  2. Access to resources you currently lack
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, securing future expansion)
  4. Proximity to useful ports
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Longest road (2 VP) requires strategic planning - only pursue if you already have 4+ roads built

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- When someone has 8+ points, ALWAYS target them with the robber regardless of other factors
- If you're being targeted by the robber, consider using knight cards immediately to protect production

TURN-BY-TURN PLANNING:
1. Start each turn by assessing your current VP and opponents' VPs (both visible and potential hidden points)
2. Identify your build priority for this turn: settlement, city, road, or development card?
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for your priority build
4. If you can't build your priority item, determine if trading or buying a development card is better
5. Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card or trade for needed resources
6. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

WINNING PATHS:
1. CITY-FOCUSED PATH: 3-4 cities (6-8 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 9-11 VP
2. BALANCED PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 VP card = 10 VP
3. DEVELOPMENT PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP

NEVER SAY NO TO FREE VPs:
- Always account for the 2 VP from longest road and largest army in your plans
- These special cards are EASY to lose if you're not defending them
- Invest in roads/knights to maintain your lead if these VPs are part of your strategy
- Be alert for opponents trying to steal these bonus points

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Build road to Wood port (24, 53) to establish better trading capability
2. Aim to collect brick and wood for additional roads to strengthen position for Longest Road

# Game Analysis: Robber Placement Decision

I need to determine the optimal hex to place the robber based on the current game state and my strategic goals.

## Current Game State Assessment
- I'm BLUE with 2/10 victory points
- RED has 3/10 victory points (leading)
- I have 3 Wood and 2 Ore resources
- My current plan involves building toward the Wood port and positioning for Longest Road

## Analyzing Options for Robber Placement
I need to consider:
1. Blocking RED's highest-value production
2. Targeting resources I need but lack access to
3. Maximizing the chance of stealing a useful card

Let's examine RED's settlements:
- RED at node 8: produces Sheep(6), Ore(8), Wood(5)
- RED at node 3: produces Brick(9), Brick(10), Wheat(6)
- RED at node 15: produces Wheat(6), Ore(3), Sheep(11)

RED has strong Wheat production from the Wheat(6) hex at (-1,0,1), which is currently blocked by the robber.

Looking at high-value hexes that RED depends on:
- Ore(8) at (2,-2,0): ⭐⭐⭐ probability (produces for RED at node 8)
- Sheep(6) at (1,-1,0): ⭐⭐⭐ probability (produces for RED at node 8)
- Brick(9) at (0,0,0): ⭐⭐ probability (produces for RED at node 3)

## Strategic Decision
The strongest options are:
- Option [6] Move robber to (2,-2,0) - blocks RED's high-value Ore production (8)
- Option [1] Move robber to (1,-1,0) - blocks RED's high-value Sheep production (6)
- Option [0] Move robber to (0,0,0) - blocks RED's Brick production (9)

Since I have 2 Ore already but need Brick for my road-building strategy, and RED appears to be collecting Brick based on their settlement positions, the most strategic move is to block RED's Brick production at (0,0,0). This will:
1. Slow RED's expansion
2. Potentially let me steal Brick which I need for my road-building strategy
3. Disrupt a relatively high probability hex (9 is ⭐⭐)

<plan>
1. Block RED's Brick production and steal resources
2. Continue building roads toward Wood port (24, 53)
3. Work on securing additional Brick and Wood for roads
4. Aim for Longest Road (2 VP) while building toward node 53
5. Once Wood port is secured, focus on Ore and Wheat for city upgrades
</plan>

I choose to move the robber to the Brick(9) hex at (0,0,0) and steal from RED.

# Game Analysis: Catan Turn 11 (Blue)

Let me analyze the current game state and my available options carefully.

## Current Situation Assessment
- I have 2 victory points (from my 2 settlements)
- Resources: 3 Wood, 1 Brick, 2 Ore
- I've already played a Road Building development card
- My current plan involves building toward Wood port (nodes 24, 53)
- I have 4 roads built with my longest road segment being 3

## Resource Production Assessment
- My settlements produce:
  * Node 1: Brick (9), Sheep (6), Wheat (11)
  * Node 24: Ore (8), Wood (5)
- I currently lack consistent Wheat and Sheep production from my own settlements
- The robber is on the Brick (9) hex, blocking one of my Brick sources

## Available Actions Analysis
I can either end my turn or build a road using 1 Wood and 1 Brick.

### Road Building Options:
1. Edge (0, 1) - This connects near my settlement at node 1
2. Edge (52, 53) - This extends toward Wood port from node 53
3. Edge (1, 2) - Expands from settlement at node 1
4. Edge (26, 27) - Extends from my Brick port area
5. Edge (6, 23) - Creates a connection between my settlement areas
6. Edge (6, 7) - Extends from node 6
7. Edge (7, 24) - Creates a connection near my settlement at node 24

## Strategic Decision
Looking at my existing road network and current plan:

1. Road at edge (52, 53) aligns with my plan to reach the Wood port, extending my current road at (24, 53)
2. This would allow me to utilize the Wood port in the future (2:1 Wood trade)
3. It extends my road network toward a potentially valuable settlement spot
4. It continues my longest road path, moving me closer to the Longest Road bonus (2 VP)

After building this road, I'll have 2 Wood remaining and 0 Brick, so I'll need to acquire more Brick before further expansion.

<plan>
1. Build road at edge (52, 53) to continue toward Wood port
2. Work on acquiring more Brick and Wood for further road building
3. Target node 52 as a potential settlement location
4. Continue working toward Longest Road (2 VP)
5. Once I have a good road network, focus on getting resources for settlements and city upgrades
</plan>

Based on this analysis, I'll build a road at edge (52, 53).

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Target hexes with HIGH probability numbers (6,8,5,9) - prioritize these above all else
- Go for resource DIVERSITY: secure ALL five resources between your two settlements
- Focus on ORE and WHEAT for city upgrades (numbers 5-9 preferred)
- Evaluate each potential settlement by its TOTAL PIP COUNT (sum of probability dots)
- Place your initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Avoid placing both settlements near the same resources - diversify your income!
- Always consider 3:1 ports if your initial placement gives you limited access to certain resources
- Place roads in directions that block opponents' expansion routes

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT & CITY BUILDING PRIORITY:
- FIRST PRIORITY: Build 1-2 additional settlements early to secure critical resources you lack
- SECOND PRIORITY: Upgrade to cities as quickly as possible to double resource production
- THIRD PRIORITY: Build roads only when they lead directly to valuable settlement locations
- Early game (1-5 turns): Secure key settlements at high-value locations
- Mid-game (6-15 turns): Focus heavily on upgrading to cities (2-3 cities should be your target)
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road
- When short on a key resource, use 2:1 ports if available before using 3:1 or 4:1 ports
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat to other players unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- If you have excess of a resource, use ports rather than trading with opponents

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards primarily when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber OR to reach Largest Army (3+ knights)
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city or settlement build
- Use Monopoly cards after high-probability dice rolls to collect maximum resources
- Keep track of how many VP cards you've drawn (5 in the deck total)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn
- When development cards are your path to victory, aim for: 3 cities (6 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 victory cards (2 VP)
- Consider buying development cards when you have limited build options (blocked roads, etc.)

OPTIMAL EXPANSION PATH:
- Build roads with PURPOSE - every road should lead to a viable settlement location
- Identify and secure "bottleneck" positions that cut off opponents' expansion
- Expand toward resources you LACK from initial placement - seek balance
- When choosing between multiple settlement spots, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (total pip count)
  2. Access to resources you currently lack
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, securing future expansion)
  4. Proximity to useful ports
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Longest road (2 VP) requires strategic planning - only pursue if you already have 4+ roads built

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- When someone has 8+ points, ALWAYS target them with the robber regardless of other factors
- If you're being targeted by the robber, consider using knight cards immediately to protect production

TURN-BY-TURN PLANNING:
1. Start each turn by assessing your current VP and opponents' VPs (both visible and potential hidden points)
2. Identify your build priority for this turn: settlement, city, road, or development card?
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for your priority build
4. If you can't build your priority item, determine if trading or buying a development card is better
5. Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card or trade for needed resources
6. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

WINNING PATHS:
1. CITY-FOCUSED PATH: 3-4 cities (6-8 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 9-11 VP
2. BALANCED PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 VP card = 10 VP
3. DEVELOPMENT PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP

NEVER SAY NO TO FREE VPs:
- Always account for the 2 VP from longest road and largest army in your plans
- These special cards are EASY to lose if you're not defending them
- Invest in roads/knights to maintain your lead if these VPs are part of your strategy
- Be alert for opponents trying to steal these bonus points

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 21 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Build road at edge (52, 53) to continue toward Wood port
2. Work on acquiring more Brick and Wood for further road building
3. Target node 52 as a potential settlement location
4. Continue working toward Longest Road (2 VP)
5. Once I have a good road network, focus on getting resources for settlements and city upgrades
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.

# Game State Analysis

Let me analyze my current position and options:

## Current Resources
- 2 🌲WOOD
- 1 🌾WHEAT
- 4 ⛏️ORE

## Victory Points
- I have 2/10 victory points (from my 2 settlements)
- RED has 3/10 victory points (from 3 settlements)

## Current Plan
My plan was to build a road at edge (52, 53) toward the Wood port, but I don't have enough resources to do that now (need Brick and Wood).

## Available Actions
0. End turn
1-4. Trade 4 ORE for various resources using 4:1 trading with the bank

## Strategic Assessment

1. **Resources**: I have 4 ORE, which is valuable for city upgrades, but I don't have the WHEAT to complement it for city building. I also can't build roads or settlements currently.

2. **Road Building**: My plan was to build roads to secure longest road, but I need BRICK which I don't have.

3. **Trade Options**: I could trade 4 ORE for 1 BRICK, which would help me build a road, but I'd still be short on WOOD (I have 2, need 1 more).

4. **Production**: My settlements are on nodes that produce WOOD (🌲5), WHEAT (🌾11), SHEEP (🐑6), BRICK (🧱9), and ORE (⛏️8).

## Decision Logic

Given my current situation, I have limited options:
- I can't build anything with my current resources
- Making a 4:1 trade is inefficient and won't enable me to build anything this turn
- The best option is to hold onto my resources for next turn

Since I can't make progress toward my plan this turn and trading at 4:1 is inefficient, I should save my resources and end my turn.

<plan>
1. Hold resources for now and wait for better building opportunities
2. Continue toward building road at (52, 53) once I get more Brick and Wood
3. Work toward longest road (2VP)
4. Build settlement at node 52 eventually for access to 3:1 port
5. Use ORE for city upgrades once I have sufficient WHEAT
</plan>

TURN 23 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Hold resources for now and wait for better building opportunities
2. Continue toward building road at (52, 53) once I get more Brick and Wood
3. Work toward longest road (2VP)
4. Build settlement at node 52 eventually for access to 3:1 port
5. Use ORE for city upgrades once I have sufficient WHEAT

# Game Analysis for Turn 23

Let me analyze my current position and available actions carefully:

## Current Game State Assessment
- I have 2/10 victory points from my 2 settlements
- Resources: 2 Wood, 1 Sheep, 1 Wheat, 4 Ore
- My settlements produce: Wood, Sheep, Wheat, and Ore
- I'm missing Brick production in my initial settlements
- I've played a Road Building card previously
- Current longest road: 4 segments (not enough for the 5 needed for Longest Road bonus)

## Available Actions Analysis
1. End turn (conservative option)
2. Buy development card (1 Sheep, 1 Wheat, 1 Ore)
3-5. Trade Ore for other resources via 4:1 ratio

## Strategic Considerations

My current plan involves building toward node 52 for a 3:1 port and longest road. However, I lack the Brick needed for road construction. I have 4 Ore, which is valuable but not immediately useful without Wheat for city upgrades.

Let's evaluate each option:

**Option 0 (End Turn):**
- Preserves resources but doesn't advance my position
- Holding 4 Ore makes me vulnerable to the robber/7 rolls

**Option 1 (Buy Development Card):**
- Costs: 1 Sheep, 1 Wheat, 1 Ore (all resources I have)
- Benefits: Could get Knight (robber protection + largest army potential), Victory Point, Monopoly, Year of Plenty, or Road Building
- Would use my Sheep and Wheat, which I need for future development cards or settlements
- Reduces my hand size, protecting against robber
- Gives me hidden progress toward victory

**Options 2-5 (Trade Ore):**
- Very inefficient 4:1 ratio
- Option 5 (getting Brick) would help with my road-building plan, but at high cost

## Decision Logic

Given that:
1. I have excess Ore (4 cards) making me vulnerable to the robber
2. Development cards offer hidden VP potential and utility
3. The 4:1 trade ratio is very inefficient
4. My current plan requires Brick that I don't have

I should buy a development card. This reduces my hand size (protection against robber), potentially gives me victory points or useful cards like Knight or Year of Plenty, and represents the best use of my current resources.

<plan>
1. Buy development card to potentially gain VP or useful action card
2. If I get a Knight, save it for Largest Army bonus (2VP)
3. If I get Road Building, use it to expand toward node 52 once I get Brick
4. Continue trying to acquire Brick for road expansion
5. Work toward city upgrades when I get more Wheat to pair with my Ore
</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Target hexes with HIGH probability numbers (6,8,5,9) - prioritize these above all else
- Go for resource DIVERSITY: secure ALL five resources between your two settlements
- Focus on ORE and WHEAT for city upgrades (numbers 5-9 preferred)
- Evaluate each potential settlement by its TOTAL PIP COUNT (sum of probability dots)
- Place your initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Avoid placing both settlements near the same resources - diversify your income!
- Always consider 3:1 ports if your initial placement gives you limited access to certain resources
- Place roads in directions that block opponents' expansion routes

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT & CITY BUILDING PRIORITY:
- FIRST PRIORITY: Build 1-2 additional settlements early to secure critical resources you lack
- SECOND PRIORITY: Upgrade to cities as quickly as possible to double resource production
- THIRD PRIORITY: Build roads only when they lead directly to valuable settlement locations
- Early game (1-5 turns): Secure key settlements at high-value locations
- Mid-game (6-15 turns): Focus heavily on upgrading to cities (2-3 cities should be your target)
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road
- When short on a key resource, use 2:1 ports if available before using 3:1 or 4:1 ports
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat to other players unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- If you have excess of a resource, use ports rather than trading with opponents

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards primarily when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber OR to reach Largest Army (3+ knights)
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city or settlement build
- Use Monopoly cards after high-probability dice rolls to collect maximum resources
- Keep track of how many VP cards you've drawn (5 in the deck total)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn
- When development cards are your path to victory, aim for: 3 cities (6 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 victory cards (2 VP)
- Consider buying development cards when you have limited build options (blocked roads, etc.)

OPTIMAL EXPANSION PATH:
- Build roads with PURPOSE - every road should lead to a viable settlement location
- Identify and secure "bottleneck" positions that cut off opponents' expansion
- Expand toward resources you LACK from initial placement - seek balance
- When choosing between multiple settlement spots, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (total pip count)
  2. Access to resources you currently lack
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, securing future expansion)
  4. Proximity to useful ports
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Longest road (2 VP) requires strategic planning - only pursue if you already have 4+ roads built

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- When someone has 8+ points, ALWAYS target them with the robber regardless of other factors
- If you're being targeted by the robber, consider using knight cards immediately to protect production

TURN-BY-TURN PLANNING:
1. Start each turn by assessing your current VP and opponents' VPs (both visible and potential hidden points)
2. Identify your build priority for this turn: settlement, city, road, or development card?
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for your priority build
4. If you can't build your priority item, determine if trading or buying a development card is better
5. Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card or trade for needed resources
6. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

WINNING PATHS:
1. CITY-FOCUSED PATH: 3-4 cities (6-8 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 9-11 VP
2. BALANCED PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 VP card = 10 VP
3. DEVELOPMENT PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP

NEVER SAY NO TO FREE VPs:
- Always account for the 2 VP from longest road and largest army in your plans
- These special cards are EASY to lose if you're not defending them
- Invest in roads/knights to maintain your lead if these VPs are part of your strategy
- Be alert for opponents trying to steal these bonus points

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

4. Continue trying to acquire Brick for road expansion
5. Work toward city upgrades when I get more Wheat to pair with my Ore

# Game Analysis for Blue Player

I need to decide between two actions: playing a Knight card (action 0) or rolling the dice (action 1).

## Current Game State Assessment
- I have 2 victory points (2 settlements)
- Resources: 2 Wood, 3 Ore
- Cards: 1 Knight card
- The robber is on Brick (0,0,0) which blocks Brick production
- Red has 3 settlements (3 VP) and 7 hidden resource cards
- Neither of us has Longest Road or Largest Army yet

## Option 0: Play Knight Card
Benefits:
- Move the robber off the Brick hex, potentially allowing Brick production if I roll a 9
- Could steal a resource from Red, who has 7 cards
- Get closer to Largest Army bonus (2 VP) - I'd need 2 more Knights
- Clear the way for Brick production which I need for expansion

Drawbacks:
- Using Knight now means I can't use it defensively later
- No guarantee I'll roll a 9 to produce Brick

## Option 1: Roll the Dice
Benefits:
- Could produce more resources based on my settlements
- My production: ⛏️8, 🌲5, 🧱9, 🐑6, 🌾11
- Can still play Knight later after seeing what I roll

Drawbacks:
- Brick production is blocked by the robber
- High chance (1/6) of rolling a 7, causing Red to discard and moving robber

## Strategic Considerations
1. I currently lack Brick which is critical for road building and expansion
2. Moving the robber off Brick would be valuable
3. Red has many cards which makes stealing worthwhile
4. Having only 2 VP means I need to focus on expansion

<plan>
1. Move the robber off the Brick hex (9) to enable potential Brick production
2. Steal a card from Red, hoping for Brick or other needed resources
3. Roll the dice next turn, hopefully producing Brick if I roll a 9
4. Build roads toward promising settlement locations
5. Work toward city upgrades with my Ore reserves when I accumulate Wheat
6. Continue collecting Knights for potential Largest Army (2VP)
</plan>

Given these considerations, playing the Knight card now is the optimal strategic move. It unblocks the Brick hex which is critical for my expansion, gives me a chance to steal a useful resource from Red, and contributes toward the Largest Army bonus.

1. CITY-FOCUSED PATH: 3-4 cities (6-8 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 9-11 VP
2. BALANCED PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 VP card = 10 VP
3. DEVELOPMENT PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP

NEVER SAY NO TO FREE VPs:
- Always account for the 2 VP from longest road and largest army in your plans
- These special cards are EASY to lose if you're not defending them
- Invest in roads/knights to maintain your lead if these VPs are part of your strategy
- Be alert for opponents trying to steal these bonus points

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 25 | Player: BLUE | Action: MOVE_ROBBER

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Move the robber off the Brick hex (9) to enable potential Brick production
2. Steal a card from Red, hoping for Brick or other needed resources
3. Roll the dice next turn, hopefully producing Brick if I roll a 9
4. Build roads toward promising settlement locations
5. Work toward city upgrades with my Ore reserves when I accumulate Wheat
6. Continue collecting Knights for potential Largest Army (2VP)

# Robber Placement Analysis

Let me analyze this robber placement decision carefully to maximize my strategic advantage.

## Game State Analysis:
- I'm at 2 VP (2 settlements) vs. RED's 3 VP (3 settlements)
- Resources: I have 2 Wood and 3 Ore, but lack Brick, Wheat and Sheep
- Robber is currently on Brick(9), which is a relatively high-value hex (⭐⭐)
- This Brick hex produces for both me and RED, so moving the robber off is beneficial
- RED has 7 cards (hidden) which could be valuable to steal

## Robber Placement Options:

1. **Target RED's Best Production**
   - RED gets resources from 🐑6[⭐⭐⭐], ⛏️8[⭐⭐⭐], 🌾6[⭐⭐⭐]
   - These are the highest-value hexes producing for RED
   - Option [0]: Move to 🐑6 (1, -1, 0) - blocks ⭐⭐⭐ sheep production
   - Option [6]: Move to ⛏️8 (2, -2, 0) - blocks ⭐⭐⭐ ore production
   - Option [2]: Move to 🌾6 (-1, 0, 1) - blocks ⭐⭐⭐ wheat production

2. **Consider My Needs**
   - I'm lacking Brick, Wheat and Sheep
   - Moving off the Brick hex would help me potentially get Brick in future turns
   - I need Wheat to pair with my Ore to build cities

## Strategic Decision:

Moving the robber to Hex 🌾6 (-1, 0, 1) (Option [2]) is optimal because:
1. It blocks a high-value wheat hex (⭐⭐⭐) from RED
2. RED has settlements at nodes 3 and 15 both producing from this hex
3. Wheat is critical for RED's development (cities, development cards)
4. I can steal a card from RED, potentially getting wheat or another needed resource
5. Moving off the Brick hex allows me to potentially get Brick in future turns

<plan>
1. Move robber to wheat hex (-1, 0, 1) to block RED's major wheat production
2. Steal a card from RED, hoping for wheat or brick
3. Use my Ore reserves to build cities once I acquire wheat
4. Continue road expansion toward promising settlement locations once I get brick
5. Consider development cards if I get sheep + wheat + ore
</plan>

After thorough analysis, I'll move the robber to the Wheat hex (-1, 0, 1) and steal from RED.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Target hexes with HIGH probability numbers (6,8,5,9) - prioritize these above all else
- Go for resource DIVERSITY: secure ALL five resources between your two settlements
- Focus on ORE and WHEAT for city upgrades (numbers 5-9 preferred)
- Evaluate each potential settlement by its TOTAL PIP COUNT (sum of probability dots)
- Place your initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Avoid placing both settlements near the same resources - diversify your income!
- Always consider 3:1 ports if your initial placement gives you limited access to certain resources
- Place roads in directions that block opponents' expansion routes

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT & CITY BUILDING PRIORITY:
- FIRST PRIORITY: Build 1-2 additional settlements early to secure critical resources you lack
- SECOND PRIORITY: Upgrade to cities as quickly as possible to double resource production
- THIRD PRIORITY: Build roads only when they lead directly to valuable settlement locations
- Early game (1-5 turns): Secure key settlements at high-value locations
- Mid-game (6-15 turns): Focus heavily on upgrading to cities (2-3 cities should be your target)
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road
- When short on a key resource, use 2:1 ports if available before using 3:1 or 4:1 ports
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat to other players unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- If you have excess of a resource, use ports rather than trading with opponents

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards primarily when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber OR to reach Largest Army (3+ knights)
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city or settlement build
- Use Monopoly cards after high-probability dice rolls to collect maximum resources
- Keep track of how many VP cards you've drawn (5 in the deck total)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn
- When development cards are your path to victory, aim for: 3 cities (6 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 victory cards (2 VP)
- Consider buying development cards when you have limited build options (blocked roads, etc.)

OPTIMAL EXPANSION PATH:
- Build roads with PURPOSE - every road should lead to a viable settlement location
- Identify and secure "bottleneck" positions that cut off opponents' expansion
- Expand toward resources you LACK from initial placement - seek balance
- When choosing between multiple settlement spots, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (total pip count)
  2. Access to resources you currently lack
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, securing future expansion)
  4. Proximity to useful ports
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Longest road (2 VP) requires strategic planning - only pursue if you already have 4+ roads built

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- When someone has 8+ points, ALWAYS target them with the robber regardless of other factors
- If you're being targeted by the robber, consider using knight cards immediately to protect production

TURN-BY-TURN PLANNING:
1. Start each turn by assessing your current VP and opponents' VPs (both visible and potential hidden points)
2. Identify your build priority for this turn: settlement, city, road, or development card?
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for your priority build
4. If you can't build your priority item, determine if trading or buying a development card is better
5. Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card or trade for needed resources
6. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

WINNING PATHS:
1. CITY-FOCUSED PATH: 3-4 cities (6-8 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 9-11 VP
2. BALANCED PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 VP card = 10 VP
3. DEVELOPMENT PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP

NEVER SAY NO TO FREE VPs:
- Always account for the 2 VP from longest road and largest army in your plans
- These special cards are EASY to lose if you're not defending them
- Invest in roads/knights to maintain your lead if these VPs are part of your strategy
- Be alert for opponents trying to steal these bonus points

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy

❓ Select action by number (0-17):


Based on this information, which action number do you choose? Think step by step about your options, then put the final action number in a box like \boxed{1}.
RESPONSE:
I'll analyze the game state and determine the optimal move for placing the robber.

First, let's assess the current game situation:
- RED has 3 VP with 3 settlements
- I (BLUE) have 2 VP with 2 settlements
- RED has 6 cards in hand (hidden)
- I have 2 wood, 1 brick, and 3 ore
- RED's settlements produce from high-value numbers: 6, 8, 9, and other resources

Let me evaluate the robber placement options by considering:
1. Which hexes produce the most resources for RED?
2. Which resources would benefit me most to potentially steal?
3. Which resources are most crucial to block?

RED's settlements produce from:
- Node 8: Sheep(6★★★), Ore(8★★★), Wood(5★★)
- Node 3: Brick(9★★), Brick(10★), Wheat(6★★★)
- Node 15: Wheat(6★★★), Ore(3★), Sheep(11★)

Looking at the high-probability hexes that RED benefits from:
- Wheat(6★★★) at (-1,0,1) - Already has robber
- Sheep(6★★★) at (1,-1,0) - Option [1]
- Ore(8★★★) at (2,-2,0) - Option [6]

I need wheat to pair with my ore for city upgrades, and brick for expanding my road network. RED likely has these resources based on their production.

<plan>
1. Move robber to sheep hex (1,-1,0) to block RED's major sheep production
2. Steal a card from RED, hoping for wheat or brick
3. Build cities once I acquire wheat to pair with my ore
4. Continue road expansion toward promising settlement locations
5. Consider development cards if I get the right resource combination
</plan>

Since the robber is already on wheat(6★★★), moving to sheep(6★★★) at (1,-1,0) would be most impactful as:
1. It blocks a highly productive 6-value hex
2. It targets RED directly
3. It reduces RED's ability to trade sheep or get development cards
4. It gives me a chance to steal a valuable resource from RED

Therefore, option [1] to move the robber to (1,-1,0) and steal from RED is optimal.

- Place roads in directions that block opponents' expansion routes

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT & CITY BUILDING PRIORITY:
- FIRST PRIORITY: Build 1-2 additional settlements early to secure critical resources you lack
- SECOND PRIORITY: Upgrade to cities as quickly as possible to double resource production
- THIRD PRIORITY: Build roads only when they lead directly to valuable settlement locations
- Early game (1-5 turns): Secure key settlements at high-value locations
- Mid-game (6-15 turns): Focus heavily on upgrading to cities (2-3 cities should be your target)
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road
- When short on a key resource, use 2:1 ports if available before using 3:1 or 4:1 ports
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat to other players unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- If you have excess of a resource, use ports rather than trading with opponents

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards primarily when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber OR to reach Largest Army (3+ knights)
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city or settlement build
- Use Monopoly cards after high-probability dice rolls to collect maximum resources
- Keep track of how many VP cards you've drawn (5 in the deck total)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn
- When development cards are your path to victory, aim for: 3 cities (6 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 victory cards (2 VP)
- Consider buying development cards when you have limited build options (blocked roads, etc.)

OPTIMAL EXPANSION PATH:
- Build roads with PURPOSE - every road should lead to a viable settlement location
- Identify and secure "bottleneck" positions that cut off opponents' expansion
- Expand toward resources you LACK from initial placement - seek balance
- When choosing between multiple settlement spots, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (total pip count)
  2. Access to resources you currently lack
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, securing future expansion)
  4. Proximity to useful ports
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Longest road (2 VP) requires strategic planning - only pursue if you already have 4+ roads built

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- When someone has 8+ points, ALWAYS target them with the robber regardless of other factors
- If you're being targeted by the robber, consider using knight cards immediately to protect production

TURN-BY-TURN PLANNING:
1. Start each turn by assessing your current VP and opponents' VPs (both visible and potential hidden points)
2. Identify your build priority for this turn: settlement, city, road, or development card?
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for your priority build
4. If you can't build your priority item, determine if trading or buying a development card is better
5. Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card or trade for needed resources
6. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

WINNING PATHS:
1. CITY-FOCUSED PATH: 3-4 cities (6-8 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 9-11 VP
2. BALANCED PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 VP card = 10 VP
3. DEVELOPMENT PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP

NEVER SAY NO TO FREE VPs:
- Always account for the 2 VP from longest road and largest army in your plans
- These special cards are EASY to lose if you're not defending them
- Invest in roads/knights to maintain your lead if these VPs are part of your strategy
- Be alert for opponents trying to steal these bonus points

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 25 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Move robber to sheep hex (1,-1,0) to block RED's major sheep production
2. Steal a card from RED, hoping for wheat or brick
3. Build cities once I acquire wheat to pair with my ore
4. Continue road expansion toward promising settlement locations
5. Consider development cards if I get the right resource combination
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.

# Analyzing the Game State and Available Options

Let me analyze the current game state and determine the optimal next move.

## Current Game State Assessment
- I have 2/10 victory points
- I have 2 wood, 1 brick, 1 wheat, 3 ore
- Only option available is to build a road (using 1 wood, 1 brick)
- The robber is already on the sheep hex (1,-1,0)
- After building a road, I would have 1 wood, 0 brick, 1 wheat, 3 ore

## Road Building Options Evaluation
I need to analyze which road placement gives me the best strategic advantage:

1. Road at edge (0, 1) - Need to understand where this leads
2. Road at edge (1, 2) - Need to understand where this leads
3. Road at edge (23, 52) - This appears to be connecting toward the 2:1 wood port at nodes 48, 49
4. Road at edge (26, 27) - Moving toward brick port possibly
5. Road at edge (6, 23) - Expanding from current network 
6. Road at edge (6, 7) - Connecting toward my settlement at node 24
7. Road at edge (51, 52) - Moving toward a general port or resource
8. Road at edge (7, 24) - Directly connecting to my settlement at node 24

## Strategic Considerations
- I need to prioritize where I want to expand
- I need to consider which road gives me access to settlements with resources I lack
- Each road should lead to a viable settlement location
- After using my brick, I'll have no more brick to build more roads until I get more

Looking at my current resources, I'm strongest in ore (3), which is good for cities, but I'll need wheat to pair with it. I'm weak on brick (only 1), which limits my expansion ability after this road.

## Evaluation of Best Road Placement
Based on the board configuration, I should choose a road that leads toward:
1. Areas where I can build a settlement to access wheat (to pair with my ore)
2. A location that can secure a powerful resource combination
3. A position that blocks RED's expansion

Without the full visualization of the board, edge (23, 52) appears to be connecting toward the wood port, which could be valuable since wood is needed for expansion. This could be a good option if I'm planning to use the wood port in the future.

Edge (7, 24) directly connects to my settlement at node 24, which strengthens my network.

Looking at my current plan and resources, I believe the best option is to build a road that strengthens my position for a future settlement placement that gives me access to wheat.

<plan>
1. Build road toward promising settlement locations that will give me wheat access
2. Save ore for city upgrades once I acquire more wheat
3. Focus on getting brick and wood for further expansion
4. Target a path to wheat or brick port to compensate for resource shortages
</plan>

Based on the information provided, I'll build a road at edge (23, 52), as this appears to be expanding toward the wood port and potentially good settlement locations.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Target hexes with HIGH probability numbers (6,8,5,9) - prioritize these above all else
- Go for resource DIVERSITY: secure ALL five resources between your two settlements
- Focus on ORE and WHEAT for city upgrades (numbers 5-9 preferred)
- Evaluate each potential settlement by its TOTAL PIP COUNT (sum of probability dots)
- Place your initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Avoid placing both settlements near the same resources - diversify your income!
- Always consider 3:1 ports if your initial placement gives you limited access to certain resources
- Place roads in directions that block opponents' expansion routes

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT & CITY BUILDING PRIORITY:
- FIRST PRIORITY: Build 1-2 additional settlements early to secure critical resources you lack
- SECOND PRIORITY: Upgrade to cities as quickly as possible to double resource production
- THIRD PRIORITY: Build roads only when they lead directly to valuable settlement locations
- Early game (1-5 turns): Secure key settlements at high-value locations
- Mid-game (6-15 turns): Focus heavily on upgrading to cities (2-3 cities should be your target)
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road
- When short on a key resource, use 2:1 ports if available before using 3:1 or 4:1 ports
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat to other players unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- If you have excess of a resource, use ports rather than trading with opponents

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards primarily when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber OR to reach Largest Army (3+ knights)
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city or settlement build
- Use Monopoly cards after high-probability dice rolls to collect maximum resources
- Keep track of how many VP cards you've drawn (5 in the deck total)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn
- When development cards are your path to victory, aim for: 3 cities (6 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 victory cards (2 VP)
- Consider buying development cards when you have limited build options (blocked roads, etc.)

OPTIMAL EXPANSION PATH:
- Build roads with PURPOSE - every road should lead to a viable settlement location
- Identify and secure "bottleneck" positions that cut off opponents' expansion
- Expand toward resources you LACK from initial placement - seek balance
- When choosing between multiple settlement spots, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (total pip count)
  2. Access to resources you currently lack
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, securing future expansion)
  4. Proximity to useful ports
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Longest road (2 VP) requires strategic planning - only pursue if you already have 4+ roads built

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- When someone has 8+ points, ALWAYS target them with the robber regardless of other factors
- If you're being targeted by the robber, consider using knight cards immediately to protect production

TURN-BY-TURN PLANNING:
1. Start each turn by assessing your current VP and opponents' VPs (both visible and potential hidden points)
2. Identify your build priority for this turn: settlement, city, road, or development card?
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for your priority build
4. If you can't build your priority item, determine if trading or buying a development card is better
5. Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card or trade for needed resources
6. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

WINNING PATHS:
1. CITY-FOCUSED PATH: 3-4 cities (6-8 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 9-11 VP
2. BALANCED PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 VP card = 10 VP
3. DEVELOPMENT PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP

NEVER SAY NO TO FREE VPs:
- Always account for the 2 VP from longest road and largest army in your plans
- These special cards are EASY to lose if you're not defending them
- Invest in roads/knights to maintain your lead if these VPs are part of your strategy
- Be alert for opponents trying to steal these bonus points

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section

# Robber Movement Analysis

I need to analyze where to place the robber to maximize my chances of winning. Let me consider several factors:

1. **Impact on opponents' production**: Target high-value hexes that RED depends on
2. **Resource value to steal**: Which resources would help my current situation?
3. **Strategic disruption**: Block resources that RED likely needs

## Analyzing RED's Production

RED has settlements at:
- Node 8 (produces: 🐑6[⭐⭐⭐], ⛏️8[⭐⭐⭐], 🌲5[⭐⭐])
- Node 3 (produces: 🧱9[⭐⭐], 🧱10[⭐], 🌾6[⭐⭐⭐])
- Node 15 (produces: 🌾6[⭐⭐⭐], ⛏️3[⭐], 🐑11[⭐])

The highest value hexes RED relies on:
- 🌾6 (touches two RED settlements - nodes 3 and 15)
- ⛏️8 (high probability number at node 8)
- 🐑6 (high probability number at node 8)

## My Resource Needs

Looking at my hand:
- I have 1 🌲WOOD, 1 🌾WHEAT, 3 ⛏️ORE
- I need more WOOD, BRICK, and WHEAT for expansion
- Since I have many ORE already, I should focus on getting other resources

## Strategic Priority Targets

1. 🌾6 (-1, 0, 1) - This is RED's most valuable hex as it touches TWO of their settlements. This would significantly impact RED's wheat production.

2. ⛏️8 (2, -2, 0) - High probability hex that RED relies on, but I also use this hex myself at node 24.

3. 🧱9 (0, 0, 0) - RED has a settlement on this, and I need brick for expansion.

<plan>
1. Block RED's wheat production by placing the robber on the 🌾6 hex
2. Continue working toward settlement that gives wheat access
3. Use ore for city upgrades once I have wheat
4. Target 3:1 port for better trading if needed
</plan>

Based on this analysis, I should target RED's most productive hex (the 🌾6 at (-1, 0, 1)) and steal a resource from them. This corresponds to action option [2].

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Target hexes with HIGH probability numbers (6,8,5,9) - prioritize these above all else
- Go for resource DIVERSITY: secure ALL five resources between your two settlements
- Focus on ORE and WHEAT for city upgrades (numbers 5-9 preferred)
- Evaluate each potential settlement by its TOTAL PIP COUNT (sum of probability dots)
- Place your initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Avoid placing both settlements near the same resources - diversify your income!
- Always consider 3:1 ports if your initial placement gives you limited access to certain resources
- Place roads in directions that block opponents' expansion routes

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT & CITY BUILDING PRIORITY:
- FIRST PRIORITY: Build 1-2 additional settlements early to secure critical resources you lack
- SECOND PRIORITY: Upgrade to cities as quickly as possible to double resource production
- THIRD PRIORITY: Build roads only when they lead directly to valuable settlement locations
- Early game (1-5 turns): Secure key settlements at high-value locations
- Mid-game (6-15 turns): Focus heavily on upgrading to cities (2-3 cities should be your target)
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road
- When short on a key resource, use 2:1 ports if available before using 3:1 or 4:1 ports
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat to other players unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- If you have excess of a resource, use ports rather than trading with opponents

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards primarily when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber OR to reach Largest Army (3+ knights)
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city or settlement build
- Use Monopoly cards after high-probability dice rolls to collect maximum resources
- Keep track of how many VP cards you've drawn (5 in the deck total)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn
- When development cards are your path to victory, aim for: 3 cities (6 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 victory cards (2 VP)
- Consider buying development cards when you have limited build options (blocked roads, etc.)

OPTIMAL EXPANSION PATH:
- Build roads with PURPOSE - every road should lead to a viable settlement location
- Identify and secure "bottleneck" positions that cut off opponents' expansion
- Expand toward resources you LACK from initial placement - seek balance
- When choosing between multiple settlement spots, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (total pip count)
  2. Access to resources you currently lack
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, securing future expansion)
  4. Proximity to useful ports
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Longest road (2 VP) requires strategic planning - only pursue if you already have 4+ roads built

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- When someone has 8+ points, ALWAYS target them with the robber regardless of other factors
- If you're being targeted by the robber, consider using knight cards immediately to protect production

TURN-BY-TURN PLANNING:
1. Start each turn by assessing your current VP and opponents' VPs (both visible and potential hidden points)
2. Identify your build priority for this turn: settlement, city, road, or development card?
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for your priority build
4. If you can't build your priority item, determine if trading or buying a development card is better
5. Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card or trade for needed resources
6. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

WINNING PATHS:
1. CITY-FOCUSED PATH: 3-4 cities (6-8 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 9-11 VP
2. BALANCED PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 VP card = 10 VP
3. DEVELOPMENT PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP

NEVER SAY NO TO FREE VPs:
- Always account for the 2 VP from longest road and largest army in your plans
- These special cards are EASY to lose if you're not defending them
- Invest in roads/knights to maintain your lead if these VPs are part of your strategy
- Be alert for opponents trying to steal these bonus points

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 27 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Block RED's wheat production by placing the robber on the 🌾6 hex
2. Continue working toward settlement that gives wheat access
3. Use ore for city upgrades once I have wheat
4. Target 3:1 port for better trading if needed

# Game Analysis and Decision Making

## Current Game State Assessment
- I have 4 VP (2 settlements + 2 VP from longest road)
- Resources: 1 🌲WOOD, 1 🌾WHEAT, 4 ⛏️ORE
- RED has 3 VP (3 settlements) and 6 hidden cards
- The robber is currently on the wheat hex (-1, 0, 1), which is producing for RED at nodes 3 and 15

## Resource Analysis
I'm resource poor at the moment with just 1 wood, 1 wheat and 4 ore. I need to consider what I can build next and what resources I need to get there.

## Available Actions
My options are:
- End my turn [0]
- Trade 4 ore for 1 sheep [1]
- Trade 4 ore for 1 wheat [2]
- Trade 4 ore for 1 wood [3]
- Trade 4 ore for 1 brick [4]

## Strategic Analysis
Looking at my current position:
- I have longest road (2 VP) and need 6 more VP to win
- I don't have access to brick production, which limits my road and settlement expansion
- I have strong ore production (8 pips) which is good for city upgrades
- I need wheat for cities and development cards

For my next building steps, I have a few choices:
1. Upgrade a settlement to a city (need 3 ore, 2 wheat) - I have 4 ore but only 1 wheat
2. Build another settlement (need 1 wood, 1 brick, 1 wheat, 1 sheep) - I have wood and wheat but no brick or sheep
3. Buy a development card (need 1 ore, 1 wheat, 1 sheep) - I have ore and wheat but no sheep

Looking at my current plan, I want to continue working toward settlements that give wheat access and use ore for city upgrades. Trading 4 ore for 1 brick would let me build another road, potentially leading to a new settlement location.

## Decision
Given my current resources and strategic needs, trading ore for brick makes the most sense. This will allow me to continue expanding my road network toward potential settlement spots. Since I already have some wheat and wood but no brick, and I need brick for both roads and settlements, I'll trade for brick.

<plan>
1. Trade 4 ore for 1 brick to enable road building
2. Use the brick to expand road network toward resource-rich areas, particularly targeting wheat
3. Focus on securing one more settlement with wheat production
4. Once wheat access is secured, use ore for city upgrades
5. Target 3:1 port for better trading efficiency in future turns
</plan>

# Game State Analysis

Let me carefully analyze the current game state and determine the optimal action:

## Current Position
- I have 4 VP (2 settlements + 2 VP for longest road)
- Resources: 1 wood, 1 brick, 1 wheat
- I can build exactly one road with my current resources
- I need 6 more VP to win
- I appear to have an established road network but lack the resources to build settlements

## Resource Production Assessment
- My settlements produce: 
  - Node 1: Brick (9🎲), Sheep (6🎲), Wheat (11🎲)
  - Node 24: Ore (8🎲), Wood (5🎲)
- I have decent ore and wood access, but limited brick
- The robber is currently on a wheat hex (-1,0,1) with a value of 6

## Strategic Analysis of Road Options
Looking at all possible road placements:

1. Edge (0,1) - Need to analyze where this leads
2. Edge (1,2) - Need to analyze where this leads
3. Edge (26,27) - Appears to extend toward the brick port or potential settlement
4. Edge (22,23) - Connects toward node 23, potentially reaching the wood port area
5. Edge (6,23) - Connects node 6 and 23, extending toward a wheat hex potentially
6. Edge (6,7) - Connects nodes 6 and 7
7. Edge (51,52) - Appears to be near the wood port
8. Edge (7,24) - Connects an existing settlement at node 24 to node 7

Without a clear view of the node locations visually, I'm analyzing based on the board description.

## Priority Assessment
The current plan involves:
1. Getting more brick (which I now have)
2. Expanding toward wheat-producing areas
3. Securing another settlement with wheat production
4. Using ore for cities later

The most important criteria are:
- Extending toward a potential settlement location (preferably with wheat)
- Maintaining longest road
- Moving toward strategic resources or ports

## Decision Making
Based on the nodes mentioned, road options #4 (22,23) and #5 (6,23) appear to extend toward node 23, which may be near wheat production areas according to the grid layout. The road options involving node 6 or 22 seem to lead toward the wheat hex (1,0,-1) with a value of 11.

Option #7 (51,52) appears to connect toward a wood port, which isn't our priority now.

Without a visual map, I'm making my best assessment based on the node connections described. Road option #5 (edge 6,23) seems most likely to advance toward a wheat-producing hex while maintaining my longest road.

<plan>
1. Build road at edge (6,23) to expand toward wheat-producing areas
2. Continue saving resources for a settlement at a strategic location with wheat access
3. Once stable wheat production is secured, focus on city upgrades using ore
4. Maintain longest road advantage while expanding strategically
5. Consider development card strategy if settlement expansion becomes limited
</plan>

I'll select option #5, building a road at edge (6,23).

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Target hexes with HIGH probability numbers (6,8,5,9) - prioritize these above all else
- Go for resource DIVERSITY: secure ALL five resources between your two settlements
- Focus on ORE and WHEAT for city upgrades (numbers 5-9 preferred)
- Evaluate each potential settlement by its TOTAL PIP COUNT (sum of probability dots)
- Place your initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Avoid placing both settlements near the same resources - diversify your income!
- Always consider 3:1 ports if your initial placement gives you limited access to certain resources
- Place roads in directions that block opponents' expansion routes

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT & CITY BUILDING PRIORITY:
- FIRST PRIORITY: Build 1-2 additional settlements early to secure critical resources you lack
- SECOND PRIORITY: Upgrade to cities as quickly as possible to double resource production
- THIRD PRIORITY: Build roads only when they lead directly to valuable settlement locations
- Early game (1-5 turns): Secure key settlements at high-value locations
- Mid-game (6-15 turns): Focus heavily on upgrading to cities (2-3 cities should be your target)
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road
- When short on a key resource, use 2:1 ports if available before using 3:1 or 4:1 ports
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat to other players unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- If you have excess of a resource, use ports rather than trading with opponents

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards primarily when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber OR to reach Largest Army (3+ knights)
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city or settlement build
- Use Monopoly cards after high-probability dice rolls to collect maximum resources
- Keep track of how many VP cards you've drawn (5 in the deck total)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn
- When development cards are your path to victory, aim for: 3 cities (6 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 victory cards (2 VP)
- Consider buying development cards when you have limited build options (blocked roads, etc.)

OPTIMAL EXPANSION PATH:
- Build roads with PURPOSE - every road should lead to a viable settlement location
- Identify and secure "bottleneck" positions that cut off opponents' expansion
- Expand toward resources you LACK from initial placement - seek balance
- When choosing between multiple settlement spots, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (total pip count)
  2. Access to resources you currently lack
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, securing future expansion)
  4. Proximity to useful ports
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Longest road (2 VP) requires strategic planning - only pursue if you already have 4+ roads built

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- When someone has 8+ points, ALWAYS target them with the robber regardless of other factors
- If you're being targeted by the robber, consider using knight cards immediately to protect production

TURN-BY-TURN PLANNING:
1. Start each turn by assessing your current VP and opponents' VPs (both visible and potential hidden points)
2. Identify your build priority for this turn: settlement, city, road, or development card?
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for your priority build
4. If you can't build your priority item, determine if trading or buying a development card is better
5. Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card or trade for needed resources
6. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

WINNING PATHS:
1. CITY-FOCUSED PATH: 3-4 cities (6-8 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 9-11 VP
2. BALANCED PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 VP card = 10 VP
3. DEVELOPMENT PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP

NEVER SAY NO TO FREE VPs:
- Always account for the 2 VP from longest road and largest army in your plans
- These special cards are EASY to lose if you're not defending them
- Invest in roads/knights to maintain your lead if these VPs are part of your strategy
- Be alert for opponents trying to steal these bonus points

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 37 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Build road at edge (6,23) to expand toward wheat-producing areas
2. Continue saving resources for a settlement at a strategic location with wheat access
3. Once stable wheat production is secured, focus on city upgrades using ore
4. Maintain longest road advantage while expanding strategically
5. Consider development card strategy if settlement expansion becomes limited

# Analyzing the Current Game State

Let me assess the current game situation to make the optimal decision:

## Victory Points
- I (BLUE) currently have 4 VP: 2 settlements (2 VP) + longest road bonus (2 VP)
- RED has 5 VP: 1 settlement (1 VP) + 2 cities (4 VP)
- I need 6 more VP to win

## Resources in Hand
- 2 🧱 BRICK, 1 🐑 SHEEP, 1 🌾 WHEAT, 1 ⛏️ ORE

## Available Actions
- [0] End Turn
- [1] Buy Development Card (costs 1 🐑SHEEP, 1 🌾WHEAT, 1 ⛏️ORE)

## Strategic Analysis
With my current resources, I can afford a development card. Let's evaluate this option:

### Benefits of Buying a Development Card:
- Could get a Victory Point card (immediate hidden VP)
- Could get a Knight (helps protect against robber and build toward Largest Army bonus)
- Could get a Road Building, Year of Plenty, or Monopoly card for future advantage
- Preserves my limited resources while potentially advancing my position

### Considerations:
1. I already hold longest road (2 VP)
2. I have no cities yet, so upgrading settlements would be valuable
3. RED is ahead by 1 VP
4. The robber is currently on a wheat hex (1,0,-1), blocking production
5. I have limited resource income (only 2 settlements)

## Decision Analysis
Looking at my current resource production:
- I lack consistent 🌾 WHEAT production (only from node 1 with number 11)
- The robber is currently on my only wheat hex
- My plan noted the need to expand toward wheat-producing areas
- I have insufficient resources for a settlement (would need 1 🧱, 1 🌾, 1 🐑, 1 🌲)
- I'll need wheat for both settlements and cities in the future

If I buy a development card:
- I use all my wheat and ore (crucial city resources)
- I might get a VP card (25% chance) which would be hidden and bring me closer to winning
- I might get a Knight to move the robber off my wheat hex
- I might get a utility card that could help me in future turns

If I end my turn:
- I keep my resources for future builds
- I maintain flexibility for the next turn

<plan>
1. Preserve resources for now and aim to build a settlement as soon as possible to increase production
2. Look for opportunities to expand toward wheat-producing areas (wheat production is currently blocked by robber)
3. After securing additional resource production, focus on city upgrades
4. Continue maintaining longest road advantage
5. Consider development card strategy later when I have more reliable resource production
</plan>

Given my limited production capacity with only 2 settlements, using my precious wheat and ore for a development card is risky. I need to preserve these resources to build a settlement or city as soon as possible.

# Analyzing Robber Placement Decision

I need to decide where to place the robber to maximize my chances of winning. Let me analyze the game state and options carefully.

## Current Game State Analysis
- I (BLUE) have 4 VP: 2 settlements (2 VP) + longest road bonus (2 VP)
- RED has 5 VP: 2 cities (4 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP)
- My resources: 2 brick, 1 sheep, 1 wheat, 1 ore
- RED has 6 hidden cards
- The robber is currently on a wheat hex (1, 0, -1) which is connected to one of my settlements

## Robber Placement Strategy
My priorities should be:
1. Block RED's highest value production
2. Take the robber off my own wheat production if possible
3. Steal a valuable resource from RED
4. Set up for my next build

Looking at RED's buildings:
- RED has a city at node 8: produces sheep (6), ore (8), wood (5) - high value
- RED has a city at node 3: produces brick (9), brick (10), wheat (6) - good production
- RED has a settlement at node 15: produces wheat (6), ore (3), sheep (11) - wheat is valuable

## Evaluating Options
The most valuable targets appear to be:
- Option 1: Move to (1, -1, 0) - This is a sheep (6) hex where RED has a city. High probability number.
- Option 6: Move to (2, -2, 0) - This is an ore (8) hex where RED has a city. High probability number.
- Option 3: Move to (-1, 0, 1) - This is wheat (6) hex where RED has both a city and settlement!

Looking deeper at option 3 (hex -1, 0, 1):
- This blocks wheat (6) which is extremely valuable
- This hex is connected to TWO of RED's buildings (a city and a settlement)
- Blocking wheat production will slow RED's city building
- This is a very high impact move

<plan>
1. Move the robber to block RED's wheat production, specifically targeting their double production on the wheat hex
2. Continue saving resources for my next settlement
3. Look for opportunities to build toward wheat-producing areas 
4. After securing additional resource production, focus on city upgrades
5. Continue maintaining longest road advantage
</plan>

After analyzing all options, I'll place the robber on hex (-1, 0, 1), which has wheat with value 6 and is connected to both a city and settlement of RED player. This will significantly slow down RED's ability to build cities while stealing a potentially valuable resource.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Target hexes with HIGH probability numbers (6,8,5,9) - prioritize these above all else
- Go for resource DIVERSITY: secure ALL five resources between your two settlements
- Focus on ORE and WHEAT for city upgrades (numbers 5-9 preferred)
- Evaluate each potential settlement by its TOTAL PIP COUNT (sum of probability dots)
- Place your initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Avoid placing both settlements near the same resources - diversify your income!
- Always consider 3:1 ports if your initial placement gives you limited access to certain resources
- Place roads in directions that block opponents' expansion routes

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT & CITY BUILDING PRIORITY:
- FIRST PRIORITY: Build 1-2 additional settlements early to secure critical resources you lack
- SECOND PRIORITY: Upgrade to cities as quickly as possible to double resource production
- THIRD PRIORITY: Build roads only when they lead directly to valuable settlement locations
- Early game (1-5 turns): Secure key settlements at high-value locations
- Mid-game (6-15 turns): Focus heavily on upgrading to cities (2-3 cities should be your target)
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road
- When short on a key resource, use 2:1 ports if available before using 3:1 or 4:1 ports
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat to other players unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- If you have excess of a resource, use ports rather than trading with opponents

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards primarily when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber OR to reach Largest Army (3+ knights)
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city or settlement build
- Use Monopoly cards after high-probability dice rolls to collect maximum resources
- Keep track of how many VP cards you've drawn (5 in the deck total)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn
- When development cards are your path to victory, aim for: 3 cities (6 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 victory cards (2 VP)
- Consider buying development cards when you have limited build options (blocked roads, etc.)

OPTIMAL EXPANSION PATH:
- Build roads with PURPOSE - every road should lead to a viable settlement location
- Identify and secure "bottleneck" positions that cut off opponents' expansion
- Expand toward resources you LACK from initial placement - seek balance
- When choosing between multiple settlement spots, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (total pip count)
  2. Access to resources you currently lack
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, securing future expansion)
  4. Proximity to useful ports
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Longest road (2 VP) requires strategic planning - only pursue if you already have 4+ roads built

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- When someone has 8+ points, ALWAYS target them with the robber regardless of other factors
- If you're being targeted by the robber, consider using knight cards immediately to protect production

TURN-BY-TURN PLANNING:
1. Start each turn by assessing your current VP and opponents' VPs (both visible and potential hidden points)
2. Identify your build priority for this turn: settlement, city, road, or development card?
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for your priority build
4. If you can't build your priority item, determine if trading or buying a development card is better
5. Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card or trade for needed resources
6. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

WINNING PATHS:
1. CITY-FOCUSED PATH: 3-4 cities (6-8 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 9-11 VP
2. BALANCED PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 VP card = 10 VP
3. DEVELOPMENT PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP

NEVER SAY NO TO FREE VPs:
- Always account for the 2 VP from longest road and largest army in your plans
- These special cards are EASY to lose if you're not defending them
- Invest in roads/knights to maintain your lead if these VPs are part of your strategy
- Be alert for opponents trying to steal these bonus points

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 39 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Move the robber to block RED's wheat production, specifically targeting their double production on the wheat hex
2. Continue saving resources for my next settlement
3. Look for opportunities to build toward wheat-producing areas 
4. After securing additional resource production, focus on city upgrades
5. Continue maintaining longest road advantage
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.

# Game Analysis for Settlers of Catan - Turn 39

I'll carefully analyze the current game state and the available options to determine the best course of action.

## Game State Assessment
- I'm playing Blue with 4 VP (2 from settlements, 2 from longest road)
- My resources: 3 🧱BRICK, 1 🐑SHEEP, 1 🌾WHEAT, 1 ⛏️ORE
- Red has 5 VP (1 from settlement, 4 from cities)
- Red has 5 hidden resource cards
- Robber is currently on a wheat hex at (-1,0,1) that Red's settlement at node 15 produces from
- I have only 2 options: end turn or buy a development card

## Development Card Analysis
I can afford to buy a development card with my current resources. Let's analyze this option:
- Development cards could be: Knight (14 in deck), Victory Point (5 in deck), Road Building (2), Year of Plenty (2), or Monopoly (2)
- Knight cards would help defend against robber and work toward largest army (2 VP)
- VP card would directly increase my points
- All other cards would help resource acquisition or building

## End Turn Analysis
If I end my turn:
- I keep my current resources
- I'll continue accumulating resources toward building something more substantial
- If I'm targeting a settlement (which costs 1 brick, 1 wood, 1 wheat, 1 sheep), I'm missing wood
- If I'm targeting a city (which costs 3 ore and 2 wheat), I'm short 2 ore and 1 wheat

## Strategic Considerations
1. I have a lead in roads (7 segments) and have the longest road bonus (2 VP)
2. My settlement production is limited - I only have 2 settlements
3. I have no cities yet, which means my resource production is lower than optimal
4. Red has 5 VP with 2 cities and 1 settlement, giving them stronger production
5. My current resource collection doesn't let me build immediately next turn

<plan>
1. Buy a development card now to potentially get a VP card or Knight
2. Continue holding Longest Road advantage by protecting my road network
3. Focus on building a settlement at my next opportunity to increase resource production
4. Save for city upgrades after securing another settlement
5. Look for opportunities to block Red's expansion with my next build
</plan>

## Decision
Buying a development card gives me the best chance to progress this turn:
- It could be a direct VP card (bringing me to 5 VP)
- It could be a Knight, helping protect my resources and work toward largest army
- Other development cards would also help my resource management or building strategy
- Sitting on resources leaves me vulnerable to the robber and doesn't advance my position

Since I can't build anything else this turn and the development card offers potential advantages, I should purchase one.

# Game Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state and my available options:

## Current Situation
- I have 4 Victory Points (2 from settlements, 2 from Longest Road)
- I have 2 brick resources and 1 Knight card
- Red has 5 Victory Points and 6 hidden cards
- I need to maintain my Longest Road advantage
- I have no cities yet, while Red already has 2 cities
- The robber is on a wheat hex (1, 0, -1) with dice number 11

## My Available Actions
0. Play Knight card - Move the robber and steal a resource
1. Roll the dice

## Action Analysis

### Option 0: Play Knight Card
- **Advantages**:
  - I can move the robber from the wheat hex to target one of Red's productive hexes
  - I could potentially steal a valuable resource from Red
  - Playing a Knight contributes toward getting Largest Army (need 3 Knights)
  - Protects me from having to discard if a 7 is rolled
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Knights are best saved for when the robber is on my own hexes
  - I'll still need to roll after playing the Knight
  - Knight cards can be more valuable later in strategic moments

### Option 1: Roll the Dice
- **Advantages**:
  - Potential to gain more resources immediately
  - Preserves my Knight card for later strategic use
  - Standard game progression
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Risk of rolling a 7, which would force discards if I have >7 cards (not an issue now)

## Strategy Consideration
The robber isn't currently on any of my productive hexes, so playing the Knight now isn't defensive. Red has 6 cards, which is tempting to steal from, but I only have 2 brick currently, so I need more resources regardless.

<plan>
1. Roll the dice to collect resources
2. If I get enough resources, build a settlement to increase production
3. Save Knight card for defensive use or when Red is about to win
4. Continue focusing on maintaining Longest Road
5. Aim for city upgrades when possible
</plan>

The optimal play here is to roll the dice and collect resources. This preserves my Knight card for a more strategic moment, and I need more resources to advance my position.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Target hexes with HIGH probability numbers (6,8,5,9) - prioritize these above all else
- Go for resource DIVERSITY: secure ALL five resources between your two settlements
- Focus on ORE and WHEAT for city upgrades (numbers 5-9 preferred)
- Evaluate each potential settlement by its TOTAL PIP COUNT (sum of probability dots)
- Place your initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Avoid placing both settlements near the same resources - diversify your income!
- Always consider 3:1 ports if your initial placement gives you limited access to certain resources
- Place roads in directions that block opponents' expansion routes

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT & CITY BUILDING PRIORITY:
- FIRST PRIORITY: Build 1-2 additional settlements early to secure critical resources you lack
- SECOND PRIORITY: Upgrade to cities as quickly as possible to double resource production
- THIRD PRIORITY: Build roads only when they lead directly to valuable settlement locations
- Early game (1-5 turns): Secure key settlements at high-value locations
- Mid-game (6-15 turns): Focus heavily on upgrading to cities (2-3 cities should be your target)
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road
- When short on a key resource, use 2:1 ports if available before using 3:1 or 4:1 ports
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat to other players unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- If you have excess of a resource, use ports rather than trading with opponents

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards primarily when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber OR to reach Largest Army (3+ knights)
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city or settlement build
- Use Monopoly cards after high-probability dice rolls to collect maximum resources
- Keep track of how many VP cards you've drawn (5 in the deck total)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn
- When development cards are your path to victory, aim for: 3 cities (6 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 victory cards (2 VP)
- Consider buying development cards when you have limited build options (blocked roads, etc.)

OPTIMAL EXPANSION PATH:
- Build roads with PURPOSE - every road should lead to a viable settlement location
- Identify and secure "bottleneck" positions that cut off opponents' expansion
- Expand toward resources you LACK from initial placement - seek balance
- When choosing between multiple settlement spots, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (total pip count)
  2. Access to resources you currently lack
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, securing future expansion)
  4. Proximity to useful ports
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Longest road (2 VP) requires strategic planning - only pursue if you already have 4+ roads built

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- When someone has 8+ points, ALWAYS target them with the robber regardless of other factors
- If you're being targeted by the robber, consider using knight cards immediately to protect production

TURN-BY-TURN PLANNING:
1. Start each turn by assessing your current VP and opponents' VPs (both visible and potential hidden points)
2. Identify your build priority for this turn: settlement, city, road, or development card?
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for your priority build
4. If you can't build your priority item, determine if trading or buying a development card is better
5. Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card or trade for needed resources
6. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

WINNING PATHS:
1. CITY-FOCUSED PATH: 3-4 cities (6-8 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 9-11 VP
2. BALANCED PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 VP card = 10 VP
3. DEVELOPMENT PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP

NEVER SAY NO TO FREE VPs:
- Always account for the 2 VP from longest road and largest army in your plans
- These special cards are EASY to lose if you're not defending them
- Invest in roads/knights to maintain your lead if these VPs are part of your strategy
- Be alert for opponents trying to steal these bonus points

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 41 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Roll the dice to collect resources
2. If I get enough resources, build a settlement to increase production
3. Save Knight card for defensive use or when Red is about to win
4. Continue focusing on maintaining Longest Road
5. Aim for city upgrades when possible
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.
  To adjust your plan, provide a NEW PLAN in your reasoning with <plan>your new plan</plan>

# Game State Analysis

Let me carefully analyze this game state to determine the optimal move:

## Current Victory Points
- I (BLUE) have 4 VP total: 2 settlements (2 VP) + Longest Road (2 VP)
- RED has 5 VP total: 1 settlement (1 VP) + 2 cities (4 VP)
- RED is leading by 1 VP and has 8 hidden resource cards

## My Resources
- 2 🧱 BRICK cards
- 1 unplayed KNIGHT card

## Strategic Assessment
1. The robber is currently on a WHEAT hex (1,0,-1) with roll value 11, which is one of my production hexes at node 1
2. I cannot currently build anything with just 2 brick
3. RED has 8 cards, which means they likely have enough resources to build something significant on their next turn
4. RED is at 5 VP and could potentially be close to winning if they have development cards

## Options Analysis

**Option 0: Play Knight card**
- Benefits:
  - Move the robber off my wheat hex, potentially restoring my production
  - Place it on one of RED's productive hexes (likely either 🐑6 or ⛏️8 which are both high-value)
  - Steal a resource from RED, which could disrupt their build plan
  - Progress toward Largest Army (would need 2 more knights)
- Drawbacks:
  - Using my Knight now means I won't have it for a more critical moment

**Option 1: End Turn**
- Benefits:
  - Save Knight card for when it's more strategically valuable
  - RED might not roll well or might not have the right combination to build
- Drawbacks:
  - The robber stays on my wheat hex, limiting my production
  - I make no progress this turn
  - RED keeps all 8 cards and can execute whatever plan they have

## Decision Logic

This is a clear situation where playing the Knight card provides multiple advantages:
1. The robber is on my wheat hex, inhibiting my production
2. RED has many cards (8) indicating they're likely saving for something significant
3. Playing the Knight now could disrupt RED's plans
4. I need more resources, and stealing one is beneficial
5. Moving the robber from my hex will help my future production

<plan>
1. Play Knight card to move robber from my wheat hex to RED's high-value hex (either sheep 6 or ore 8)
2. Steal a resource from RED to potentially disrupt their build plan
3. Continue focusing on maintaining Longest Road
4. On next turn, consider settlement expansion if resources allow
5. Work toward city upgrades as resources become available
</plan>

Given these considerations, I choose:

# Game Analysis - Catan Strategic Decision

I need to move the robber and potentially steal a card from RED. Let me analyze the optimal move based on the current game state.

## Current State Assessment
- I (BLUE) have 4 VP (including 2 VP from Longest Road)
- RED has 5 VP
- RED has 8 resources while I only have 2 brick
- The robber is currently on my wheat hex (1,0,-1)
- I need to disrupt RED's production while improving my resource access

## Robber Placement Priority
I should target RED's highest production hexes, especially those with high probability numbers.

Looking at RED's buildings:
- 🏙️ at node 8: produces from 🐑6[⭐⭐⭐], ⛏️8[⭐⭐⭐], 🌲5[⭐⭐]
- 🏙️ at node 3: produces from 🧱9[⭐⭐], 🧱10[⭐], 🌾6[⭐⭐⭐]
- 🏠 at node 15: produces from 🌾6[⭐⭐⭐], ⛏️3[⭐], 🐑11[⭐]

The highest value hexes for RED are:
1. ⛏️8 (2,-2,0) - Ore 8 (high probability)
2. 🐑6 (1,-1,0) - Sheep 6 (high probability)
3. 🌾6 (-1,0,1) - Wheat 6 (high probability)

## Strategic Decision
Placing the robber on the ore 8 hex (2,-2,0) is most impactful because:
1. Ore is critical for city upgrades (RED already has 2 cities)
2. It's a very high probability number (8)
3. RED has a city adjacent to this hex (maximum disruption)
4. I don't have access to ore yet, so blocking RED's access increases my relative position

<plan>
1. Move robber to RED's ore 8 hex (2,-2,0) to block critical city-building resource
2. Steal a card from RED, hoping for ore or wheat
3. Continue maintaining Longest Road advantage
4. Work toward expanding settlement placement to gain access to ore
5. Focus on city upgrades once I secure ore access
</plan>

Therefore, the optimal action is to choose option 6: Move robber to (2, -2, 0) and steal from RED.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Target hexes with HIGH probability numbers (6,8,5,9) - prioritize these above all else
- Go for resource DIVERSITY: secure ALL five resources between your two settlements
- Focus on ORE and WHEAT for city upgrades (numbers 5-9 preferred)
- Evaluate each potential settlement by its TOTAL PIP COUNT (sum of probability dots)
- Place your initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Avoid placing both settlements near the same resources - diversify your income!
- Always consider 3:1 ports if your initial placement gives you limited access to certain resources
- Place roads in directions that block opponents' expansion routes

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT & CITY BUILDING PRIORITY:
- FIRST PRIORITY: Build 1-2 additional settlements early to secure critical resources you lack
- SECOND PRIORITY: Upgrade to cities as quickly as possible to double resource production
- THIRD PRIORITY: Build roads only when they lead directly to valuable settlement locations
- Early game (1-5 turns): Secure key settlements at high-value locations
- Mid-game (6-15 turns): Focus heavily on upgrading to cities (2-3 cities should be your target)
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road
- When short on a key resource, use 2:1 ports if available before using 3:1 or 4:1 ports
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat to other players unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- If you have excess of a resource, use ports rather than trading with opponents

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards primarily when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber OR to reach Largest Army (3+ knights)
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city or settlement build
- Use Monopoly cards after high-probability dice rolls to collect maximum resources
- Keep track of how many VP cards you've drawn (5 in the deck total)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn
- When development cards are your path to victory, aim for: 3 cities (6 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 victory cards (2 VP)
- Consider buying development cards when you have limited build options (blocked roads, etc.)

OPTIMAL EXPANSION PATH:
- Build roads with PURPOSE - every road should lead to a viable settlement location
- Identify and secure "bottleneck" positions that cut off opponents' expansion
- Expand toward resources you LACK from initial placement - seek balance
- When choosing between multiple settlement spots, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (total pip count)
  2. Access to resources you currently lack
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, securing future expansion)
  4. Proximity to useful ports
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Longest road (2 VP) requires strategic planning - only pursue if you already have 4+ roads built

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- When someone has 8+ points, ALWAYS target them with the robber regardless of other factors
- If you're being targeted by the robber, consider using knight cards immediately to protect production

TURN-BY-TURN PLANNING:
1. Start each turn by assessing your current VP and opponents' VPs (both visible and potential hidden points)
2. Identify your build priority for this turn: settlement, city, road, or development card?
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for your priority build
4. If you can't build your priority item, determine if trading or buying a development card is better
5. Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card or trade for needed resources
6. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

WINNING PATHS:
1. CITY-FOCUSED PATH: 3-4 cities (6-8 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 9-11 VP
2. BALANCED PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 VP card = 10 VP
3. DEVELOPMENT PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP

NEVER SAY NO TO FREE VPs:
- Always account for the 2 VP from longest road and largest army in your plans
- These special cards are EASY to lose if you're not defending them
- Invest in roads/knights to maintain your lead if these VPs are part of your strategy
- Be alert for opponents trying to steal these bonus points

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 43 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Move robber to RED's ore 8 hex (2,-2,0) to block critical city-building resource
2. Steal a card from RED, hoping for ore or wheat
3. Continue maintaining Longest Road advantage
4. Work toward expanding settlement placement to gain access to ore
5. Focus on city upgrades once I secure ore access
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.

# Game Analysis for Turn 43

Let me analyze my current situation and possible actions:

## Game State Analysis
- I have 4 VP: 2 from settlements + 2 from Longest Road
- I have 4 🧱BRICK and 1 🌾WHEAT resources
- RED has 5 VP: 1 from settlement + 4 from cities
- The robber is already on RED's ore hex (2,-2,0)
- I have limited resource production: no ore production, which is critical for city upgrades

## Resource Analysis
- My only options are trading 4 bricks for another resource using the standard 4:1 port rate
- I have excess brick but no immediate building opportunity
- I'm lacking ore, wood, and sheep for building settlements or cities

## Strategic Considerations
1. **Building Opportunities**: With my current resources, I can't build anything (settlement, city, or development card).
2. **Trading Evaluation**: 
   - Trading 4 brick for 1 of another resource is very inefficient
   - I should save my brick until I have other resources to build with
   - No immediate build opportunity would result from any trade
3. **End Turn**: Since I have no good trade options and can't build anything, ending my turn is the most reasonable choice
4. **Future Plan**: I should focus on getting ore access, either through new settlement placement or trading

<plan>
1. End turn and collect resources on next round
2. Look for opportunity to establish settlement with ore production
3. Once I get ore, focus on upgrading settlements to cities
4. Continue maintaining Longest Road
5. Target RED with robber when possible - they're closest to winning
</plan>

Since none of the maritime trades would lead to an immediate building opportunity, and the exchange rate is poor, the optimal move is to end my turn and wait for better opportunities in the next round.

# Game Analysis

Let me analyze my current position and available actions:

## Current Status
- I have 4 VP: 2 VP from settlements + 2 VP from Longest Road
- RED has 5 VP: 1 VP from settlement + 4 VP from cities
- I have 4 BRICK and 2 WHEAT resources
- The robber is on a critical ORE hex (8)

## Resource Assessment
- I have plenty of BRICK but lack ORE, SHEEP, and WOOD
- My settlements produce BRICK, SHEEP, WHEAT, and WOOD but no ORE
- I need to secure ORE production for city upgrades

## Options Analysis
1. End Turn [0]: I can collect resources on next round
2. Trade options [1-4]: All involve trading 4 BRICK for 1 of another resource

Let me evaluate my trading options:
- I already have WHEAT (option 1)
- I lack WOOD, SHEEP, and ORE (options 2-4)
- For city upgrades, I need ORE + WHEAT (3 ORE + 2 WHEAT per city)

## Strategic Considerations
- RED is ahead with 5 VP
- I have no viable building options this turn (can't build settlement, city, or development cards)
- I should prepare for future builds
- ORE is my most critical missing resource

<plan>
1. Trade for ORE using my excess BRICK
2. After collecting more resources next round, look to either:
   a) Build a settlement at a location with ORE production, or
   b) Upgrade an existing settlement to a city if I collect more ORE/WHEAT
3. Continue maintaining Longest Road
4. Target RED with robber when possible to slow their progress
</plan>

Since I can't build anything this turn and I need ORE for future city upgrades (my most critical need), trading BRICK for ORE makes the most strategic sense.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Target hexes with HIGH probability numbers (6,8,5,9) - prioritize these above all else
- Go for resource DIVERSITY: secure ALL five resources between your two settlements
- Focus on ORE and WHEAT for city upgrades (numbers 5-9 preferred)
- Evaluate each potential settlement by its TOTAL PIP COUNT (sum of probability dots)
- Place your initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Avoid placing both settlements near the same resources - diversify your income!
- Always consider 3:1 ports if your initial placement gives you limited access to certain resources
- Place roads in directions that block opponents' expansion routes

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT & CITY BUILDING PRIORITY:
- FIRST PRIORITY: Build 1-2 additional settlements early to secure critical resources you lack
- SECOND PRIORITY: Upgrade to cities as quickly as possible to double resource production
- THIRD PRIORITY: Build roads only when they lead directly to valuable settlement locations
- Early game (1-5 turns): Secure key settlements at high-value locations
- Mid-game (6-15 turns): Focus heavily on upgrading to cities (2-3 cities should be your target)
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road
- When short on a key resource, use 2:1 ports if available before using 3:1 or 4:1 ports
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat to other players unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- If you have excess of a resource, use ports rather than trading with opponents

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards primarily when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber OR to reach Largest Army (3+ knights)
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city or settlement build
- Use Monopoly cards after high-probability dice rolls to collect maximum resources
- Keep track of how many VP cards you've drawn (5 in the deck total)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn
- When development cards are your path to victory, aim for: 3 cities (6 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 victory cards (2 VP)
- Consider buying development cards when you have limited build options (blocked roads, etc.)

OPTIMAL EXPANSION PATH:
- Build roads with PURPOSE - every road should lead to a viable settlement location
- Identify and secure "bottleneck" positions that cut off opponents' expansion
- Expand toward resources you LACK from initial placement - seek balance
- When choosing between multiple settlement spots, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (total pip count)
  2. Access to resources you currently lack
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, securing future expansion)
  4. Proximity to useful ports
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Longest road (2 VP) requires strategic planning - only pursue if you already have 4+ roads built

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- When someone has 8+ points, ALWAYS target them with the robber regardless of other factors
- If you're being targeted by the robber, consider using knight cards immediately to protect production

TURN-BY-TURN PLANNING:
1. Start each turn by assessing your current VP and opponents' VPs (both visible and potential hidden points)
2. Identify your build priority for this turn: settlement, city, road, or development card?
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for your priority build
4. If you can't build your priority item, determine if trading or buying a development card is better
5. Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card or trade for needed resources
6. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

WINNING PATHS:
1. CITY-FOCUSED PATH: 3-4 cities (6-8 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 9-11 VP
2. BALANCED PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 VP card = 10 VP
3. DEVELOPMENT PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP

NEVER SAY NO TO FREE VPs:
- Always account for the 2 VP from longest road and largest army in your plans
- These special cards are EASY to lose if you're not defending them
- Invest in roads/knights to maintain your lead if these VPs are part of your strategy
- Be alert for opponents trying to steal these bonus points

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Analyzing Game State and Available Options

Let me assess my current situation and make the optimal strategic decision:

## Current Status
- I have 4/10 victory points (2 from settlements, 2 from longest road)
- My resources: 1 🐑SHEEP, 2 🌾WHEAT, 1 ⛏️ORE
- RED player has 5/10 victory points (city upgrades are helping them)
- I have the longest road bonus (+2 VP)
- Only two available actions: end turn or buy a development card

## Development Card Analysis
Buying a development card costs exactly what I have: 1 🐑SHEEP, 1 🌾WHEAT, 1 ⛏️ORE
Potential benefits:
- Knight card (25% chance) - Helps protect my production and work toward largest army
- Victory point card (20% chance) - Immediate hidden VP
- Road building card (12.5% chance) - Already have longest road
- Year of Plenty (12.5% chance) - Would help get specific resources next turn
- Monopoly (12.5% chance) - Could be very valuable with right timing

## End Turn Analysis
If I end my turn:
- I keep my current resources for trading/building next turn
- No immediate progress toward victory
- Risk of losing resources to a 7 roll or opponents' advancement

<plan>
1. Buy a development card to possibly increase VPs or get a useful action card
2. Next turn, focus on getting resources for a settlement or city upgrade
3. Continue maintaining Longest Road
4. Target RED with robber when possible to slow their progress
</plan>

Given that RED is already at 5 VP and pulling ahead, I need to make progress this turn. Buying a development card is my only viable option for potential advancement, and it could provide me with a victory point card, knight card (for largest army), or utility card that will help accelerate my strategy.

# Game State Analysis

Let me thoroughly analyze the current game state and our available options:

## Victory Point Status
- I (BLUE) have 4 VP (2 settlements + 2 VP for Longest Road)
- RED has 6 VP (3 cities = 6 VP)
- RED is ahead by 2 VP, which is concerning

## Resources
- I have only 2 Wheat cards
- RED has 2 hidden cards
- I have 1 unplayed Knight card and have already played 2 Knights
- The robber is currently on an 8 Ore hex, blocking a valuable resource

## Strategic Options Analysis

**Option 0: Play Knight card**
- Pros:
  - Can move the robber from the 8 Ore hex (which is actually blocking my settlement at node 24)
  - Can steal a resource from RED
  - Would give me 3 played Knights, earning Largest Army (+2 VP)
  - Would prevent RED from utilizing their resources effectively

- Cons:
  - Knight cards are more valuable late game to protect high-value resources

**Option 1: Roll the dice**
- Pros:
  - Could get more resources to potentially build
  - Keeps Knight card for future strategic use

- Cons:
  - Risk of a 7 roll forcing me to discard
  - The robber will continue blocking my ore production
  - RED will continue their progress unimpeded

## Decision Analysis

This is a clear-cut situation. Playing my Knight card (Option 0) will:
1. Move the robber from my own Ore resource (8 value) that's currently blocked
2. Give me Largest Army (2 VP), bringing me to 6 VP total (matching RED)
3. Allow me to steal a resource from RED, potentially slowing them down
4. Set me up to start developing my strategy further

<plan>
1. Play Knight now to claim Largest Army (2 VP) and unblock my ore production
2. Target RED's high-value hexes with the robber
3. Focus on upgrading to cities next to increase resource production
4. Maintain Longest Road advantage
5. Continue buying development cards when possible for potential VP cards
</plan>

The choice is straightforward - playing the Knight card provides immediate VP gain and improves my position significantly.

PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Target hexes with HIGH probability numbers (6,8,5,9) - prioritize these above all else
- Go for resource DIVERSITY: secure ALL five resources between your two settlements
- Focus on ORE and WHEAT for city upgrades (numbers 5-9 preferred)
- Evaluate each potential settlement by its TOTAL PIP COUNT (sum of probability dots)
- Place your initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Avoid placing both settlements near the same resources - diversify your income!
- Always consider 3:1 ports if your initial placement gives you limited access to certain resources
- Place roads in directions that block opponents' expansion routes

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT & CITY BUILDING PRIORITY:
- FIRST PRIORITY: Build 1-2 additional settlements early to secure critical resources you lack
- SECOND PRIORITY: Upgrade to cities as quickly as possible to double resource production
- THIRD PRIORITY: Build roads only when they lead directly to valuable settlement locations
- Early game (1-5 turns): Secure key settlements at high-value locations
- Mid-game (6-15 turns): Focus heavily on upgrading to cities (2-3 cities should be your target)
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road
- When short on a key resource, use 2:1 ports if available before using 3:1 or 4:1 ports
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat to other players unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- If you have excess of a resource, use ports rather than trading with opponents

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards primarily when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber OR to reach Largest Army (3+ knights)
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city or settlement build
- Use Monopoly cards after high-probability dice rolls to collect maximum resources
- Keep track of how many VP cards you've drawn (5 in the deck total)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn
- When development cards are your path to victory, aim for: 3 cities (6 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 victory cards (2 VP)
- Consider buying development cards when you have limited build options (blocked roads, etc.)

OPTIMAL EXPANSION PATH:
- Build roads with PURPOSE - every road should lead to a viable settlement location
- Identify and secure "bottleneck" positions that cut off opponents' expansion
- Expand toward resources you LACK from initial placement - seek balance
- When choosing between multiple settlement spots, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (total pip count)
  2. Access to resources you currently lack
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, securing future expansion)
  4. Proximity to useful ports
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Longest road (2 VP) requires strategic planning - only pursue if you already have 4+ roads built

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- When someone has 8+ points, ALWAYS target them with the robber regardless of other factors
- If you're being targeted by the robber, consider using knight cards immediately to protect production

TURN-BY-TURN PLANNING:
1. Start each turn by assessing your current VP and opponents' VPs (both visible and potential hidden points)
2. Identify your build priority for this turn: settlement, city, road, or development card?
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for your priority build
4. If you can't build your priority item, determine if trading or buying a development card is better
5. Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card or trade for needed resources
6. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

WINNING PATHS:
1. CITY-FOCUSED PATH: 3-4 cities (6-8 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 9-11 VP
2. BALANCED PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 VP card = 10 VP
3. DEVELOPMENT PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP

NEVER SAY NO TO FREE VPs:
- Always account for the 2 VP from longest road and largest army in your plans
- These special cards are EASY to lose if you're not defending them
- Invest in roads/knights to maintain your lead if these VPs are part of your strategy
- Be alert for opponents trying to steal these bonus points

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game Analysis for Settlers of Catan

I need to determine the best location to move the robber to maximize my chances of winning.

## Current Game State Assessment
- I (BLUE) have 6 VP: 2 settlements (2 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP)
- RED has 6 VP: 3 cities (6 VP)
- RED is a serious threat with 3 cities already, which provide strong resource production
- I only have 2 wheat resources currently and no development cards

## Robber Placement Strategy

The optimal robber placement should:
1. Target RED's most valuable resource production
2. Ideally block a high-probability number (8, 6, or 9)
3. Target a resource RED likely needs for their next build

Looking at RED's cities:
- City at node 8: produces sheep(6), ore(8), wood(5)
- City at node 3: produces brick(9), brick(10), wheat(6)
- City at node 15: produces wheat(6), ore(3), sheep(11)

RED's strongest production is:
- Wheat on 6 (appears twice for RED's cities)
- Ore on 8
- Sheep on 6

For my victory path, I need to:
- Build more cities (need ore and wheat)
- Maintain longest road
- Potentially buy more development cards

## Available Options Analysis

Looking at the high-impact options:
- [0] Move to (0,0,0) - This is brick 9, which RED produces at city 3
- [1] Move to (1,-1,0) - This is sheep 6, which RED produces at city 8 (high probability)
- [3] Move to (-1,0,1) - This is wheat 6, which RED produces at two cities (3 and 15)
- [7] Move to (1,-2,1) - This is wood 5, which RED produces at city 8

Option [3] is particularly strong because:
1. It blocks wheat 6 - a high probability number
2. It affects TWO of RED's cities (more impact than other options)
3. Wheat is crucial for both settlements and cities, limiting RED's expansion

<plan>
1. Move robber to wheat 6 hex to block RED's double production
2. Focus on upgrading to cities next to increase resource production
3. Maintain Longest Road advantage
4. Continue buying development cards when possible for potential VP cards
5. Consider settlement expansion only if strategic locations become available
</plan>

Based on this analysis, I should move the robber to the wheat 6 hex at (-1,0,1), which affects two of RED's cities and blocks their most important resource.

2. BALANCED PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 VP card = 10 VP
3. DEVELOPMENT PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP

NEVER SAY NO TO FREE VPs:
- Always account for the 2 VP from longest road and largest army in your plans
- These special cards are EASY to lose if you're not defending them
- Invest in roads/knights to maintain your lead if these VPs are part of your strategy
- Be alert for opponents trying to steal these bonus points

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 1 | Player: BLUE | Action: BUILD_INITIAL_SETTLEMENT

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Move robber to wheat 6 hex to block RED's double production
2. Focus on upgrading to cities next to increase resource production
3. Maintain Longest Road advantage
4. Continue buying development cards when possible for potential VP cards
5. Consider settlement expansion only if strategic locations become available

# Initial Settlement Placement Analysis

I'm playing as the BLUE player and need to choose my first settlement location. This is a crucial decision that will impact my entire game strategy. Let me analyze the options systematically:

## Analyzing High-Value Locations (High Probability Numbers: 6, 8, 5, 9)

Looking at the board hexes with these high-probability numbers:
- 🧱6 (1, -1, 0) - Adjacent nodes: 1, 2, 6, 7, 8, 9
- 🌲6 (-2, 1, 1) - Adjacent nodes: 14, 15, 17, 37, 38, 39
- 🐑8 (2, -2, 0) - Adjacent nodes: 7, 8, 24, 25, 26, 27
- 🌲8 (-1, 1, 0) - Adjacent nodes: 4, 5, 15, 16, 17, 18
- ⛏️5 (-2, 2, 0) - Adjacent nodes: 17, 18, 39, 40, 41, 42
- 🌾5 (2, 0, -2) - Adjacent nodes: 22, 23, 49, 50, 51, 52
- 🌲9 (-1, -1, 2) - Adjacent nodes: 11, 12, 13, 32, 33, 34
- 🐑9 (1, -2, 1) - Adjacent nodes: 8, 9, 10, 27, 28, 29

## Evaluating Best Intersections

Looking for nodes that touch 3 hexes with good probabilities and resource diversity.

The most attractive intersections appear to be:
- Node 17: At junction of 🌲8, 🌲6, and ⛏️5 (high value, but lacks diversity)
- Node 8: At junction of 🧱6, 🐑8, and 🐑9 (good numbers, but only 2 resource types)
- Node 23: Near 🌾5, 🧱10, 🐑4 (decent diversity, not optimal probabilities)

## Best Overall Choices

1. **Node 17** (option 13): Offers access to 🌲8 + 🌲6 + ⛏️5 (excellent production value with 13 pips total)
   - Great for wood and ore production
   - Near ore port (nodes 40, 44)
   - Multiple expansion routes 
   - However, too much wood, need diversity

2. **Node 8** (option 4): Offers access to 🧱6 + 🐑8 + 🐑9 (excellent production with 17 pips total)
   - Great brick and sheep production
   - Allows expansion toward more resources
   - Near 3:1 port
   - However, lacks resource diversity

3. **Node 22** (option 18): Offers access to 🌾5 + 🧱10 + 🐑4 (moderate production with decent diversity)
   - Good wheat, brick, and sheep balance
   - Access to wheat port
   - Expansion potential

4. **Node 15** (option 11): Located at 🌲8 + 🌲6 + 🐑10 junction (good production value)
   - Great wood production
   - Some diversification with sheep
   - But too much wood concentration

## Strategic Considerations
- RED has already placed at node 1 with access to 🌲4, 🧱6, 🐑4
- I want to secure high probability numbers that RED doesn't already have
- Need to ensure I get resource diversity
- Should avoid being too close to RED's position
- Want to secure at least one high-value number for ore or wheat (for city upgrades)

## Final Decision
Node 17 (option 13) gives me the best overall position with high productivity (13 pips), access to wood and ore (critical for development), and strategic expansion options. While it lacks some diversity, it secures excellent high-probability numbers, and I can get diversity with my second settlement.

<plan>
1. Place first settlement at node 17 to secure 🌲8, 🌲6, and ⛏️5 for strong wood and ore production
2. Place second settlement to secure wheat, sheep, and possibly brick resources
3. Focus on early city upgrades with the strong ore production
4. Use ports to supplement resources I lack
</plan>

\boxed{13}
========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Target hexes with HIGH probability numbers (6,8,5,9) - prioritize these above all else
- Go for resource DIVERSITY: secure ALL five resources between your two settlements
- Focus on ORE and WHEAT for city upgrades (numbers 5-9 preferred)
- Evaluate each potential settlement by its TOTAL PIP COUNT (sum of probability dots)
- Place your initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Avoid placing both settlements near the same resources - diversify your income!
- Always consider 3:1 ports if your initial placement gives you limited access to certain resources
- Place roads in directions that block opponents' expansion routes

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT & CITY BUILDING PRIORITY:
- FIRST PRIORITY: Build 1-2 additional settlements early to secure critical resources you lack
- SECOND PRIORITY: Upgrade to cities as quickly as possible to double resource production
- THIRD PRIORITY: Build roads only when they lead directly to valuable settlement locations
- Early game (1-5 turns): Secure key settlements at high-value locations
- Mid-game (6-15 turns): Focus heavily on upgrading to cities (2-3 cities should be your target)
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road
- When short on a key resource, use 2:1 ports if available before using 3:1 or 4:1 ports
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat to other players unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- If you have excess of a resource, use ports rather than trading with opponents

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards primarily when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber OR to reach Largest Army (3+ knights)
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city or settlement build
- Use Monopoly cards after high-probability dice rolls to collect maximum resources
- Keep track of how many VP cards you've drawn (5 in the deck total)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn
- When development cards are your path to victory, aim for: 3 cities (6 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 victory cards (2 VP)
- Consider buying development cards when you have limited build options (blocked roads, etc.)

OPTIMAL EXPANSION PATH:
- Build roads with PURPOSE - every road should lead to a viable settlement location
- Identify and secure "bottleneck" positions that cut off opponents' expansion
- Expand toward resources you LACK from initial placement - seek balance
- When choosing between multiple settlement spots, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (total pip count)
  2. Access to resources you currently lack
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, securing future expansion)
  4. Proximity to useful ports
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Longest road (2 VP) requires strategic planning - only pursue if you already have 4+ roads built

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- When someone has 8+ points, ALWAYS target them with the robber regardless of other factors
- If you're being targeted by the robber, consider using knight cards immediately to protect production

TURN-BY-TURN PLANNING:
1. Start each turn by assessing your current VP and opponents' VPs (both visible and potential hidden points)
2. Identify your build priority for this turn: settlement, city, road, or development card?
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for your priority build
4. If you can't build your priority item, determine if trading or buying a development card is better
5. Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card or trade for needed resources
6. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

WINNING PATHS:
1. CITY-FOCUSED PATH: 3-4 cities (6-8 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 9-11 VP
2. BALANCED PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 VP card = 10 VP
3. DEVELOPMENT PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP

NEVER SAY NO TO FREE VPs:
- Always account for the 2 VP from longest road and largest army in your plans
- These special cards are EASY to lose if you're not defending them
- Invest in roads/knights to maintain your lead if these VPs are part of your strategy
- Be alert for opponents trying to steal these bonus points

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 1 | Player: BLUE | Action: BUILD_INITIAL_ROAD

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Place first settlement at node 17 to secure 🌲8, 🌲6, and ⛏️5 for strong wood and ore production
2. Place second settlement to secure wheat, sheep, and possibly brick resources
3. Focus on early city upgrades with the strong ore production
4. Use ports to supplement resources I lack
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.

# Analysis of Initial Road Placement Options

I need to determine the best direction for my first road during initial placement. Since I've already placed my first settlement at node 17, which gives me access to strong wood (🌲8, 🌲6) and ore (⛏️5) production, I need to plan my expansion path strategically.

Let me examine each option:

## Option 0: Build a road at edge (17, 39)
- Direction: Toward node 39
- This leads toward the 3:1 General Port (nodes 38, 39)
- Node 39 connects to 🌲6 and could eventually lead to wheat resources

## Option 1: Build a road at edge (15, 17) 
- Direction: Toward node 15
- Node 15 connects to 🌲8 and 🐑10
- This leads toward potential sheep resources that I currently lack

## Option 2: Build a road at edge (17, 18)
- Direction: Toward node 18
- Node 18 connects to ⛏️5 and would lead toward 🧱11 (brick)
- This potentially leads toward the 2:1 Ore Port (nodes 40, 44)

## Strategic Considerations:
1. I need to expand toward resources I currently lack: wheat, sheep, and brick
2. Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports
3. I should avoid placing roads toward the center when possible

Looking at the board layout, option 1 (toward node 15) gives me the best path toward sheep resources I currently lack. It also keeps my options open for further expansion toward other needed resources like wheat.

Option 2 would lead me toward more ore (which I already have) and brick, but may limit my expansion options.

Option 0 leads toward a port but doesn't immediately help me secure additional resource types.

<plan>
1. Place first settlement at node 17 to secure 🌲8, 🌲6, and ⛏️5 for strong wood and ore production
2. Build initial road toward node 15 to enable expansion toward sheep resources
3. Place second settlement to secure wheat, sheep, and possibly brick resources
4. Focus on early city upgrades with the strong ore production
5. Use ports to supplement resources I lack
</plan>

Given this analysis, I'll choose option 1 to build a road toward node 15, as it best supports my plan to diversify my resources.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Target hexes with HIGH probability numbers (6,8,5,9) - prioritize these above all else
- Go for resource DIVERSITY: secure ALL five resources between your two settlements
- Focus on ORE and WHEAT for city upgrades (numbers 5-9 preferred)
- Evaluate each potential settlement by its TOTAL PIP COUNT (sum of probability dots)
- Place your initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Avoid placing both settlements near the same resources - diversify your income!
- Always consider 3:1 ports if your initial placement gives you limited access to certain resources
- Place roads in directions that block opponents' expansion routes

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT & CITY BUILDING PRIORITY:
- FIRST PRIORITY: Build 1-2 additional settlements early to secure critical resources you lack
- SECOND PRIORITY: Upgrade to cities as quickly as possible to double resource production
- THIRD PRIORITY: Build roads only when they lead directly to valuable settlement locations
- Early game (1-5 turns): Secure key settlements at high-value locations
- Mid-game (6-15 turns): Focus heavily on upgrading to cities (2-3 cities should be your target)
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road
- When short on a key resource, use 2:1 ports if available before using 3:1 or 4:1 ports
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat to other players unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- If you have excess of a resource, use ports rather than trading with opponents

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards primarily when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber OR to reach Largest Army (3+ knights)
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city or settlement build
- Use Monopoly cards after high-probability dice rolls to collect maximum resources
- Keep track of how many VP cards you've drawn (5 in the deck total)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn
- When development cards are your path to victory, aim for: 3 cities (6 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 victory cards (2 VP)
- Consider buying development cards when you have limited build options (blocked roads, etc.)

OPTIMAL EXPANSION PATH:
- Build roads with PURPOSE - every road should lead to a viable settlement location
- Identify and secure "bottleneck" positions that cut off opponents' expansion
- Expand toward resources you LACK from initial placement - seek balance
- When choosing between multiple settlement spots, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (total pip count)
  2. Access to resources you currently lack
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, securing future expansion)
  4. Proximity to useful ports
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Longest road (2 VP) requires strategic planning - only pursue if you already have 4+ roads built

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- When someone has 8+ points, ALWAYS target them with the robber regardless of other factors
- If you're being targeted by the robber, consider using knight cards immediately to protect production

TURN-BY-TURN PLANNING:
1. Start each turn by assessing your current VP and opponents' VPs (both visible and potential hidden points)
2. Identify your build priority for this turn: settlement, city, road, or development card?
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for your priority build
4. If you can't build your priority item, determine if trading or buying a development card is better
5. Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card or trade for needed resources
6. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

WINNING PATHS:
1. CITY-FOCUSED PATH: 3-4 cities (6-8 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 9-11 VP
2. BALANCED PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 VP card = 10 VP
3. DEVELOPMENT PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP

NEVER SAY NO TO FREE VPs:
- Always account for the 2 VP from longest road and largest army in your plans
- These special cards are EASY to lose if you're not defending them
- Invest in roads/knights to maintain your lead if these VPs are part of your strategy
- Be alert for opponents trying to steal these bonus points

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 1 | Player: BLUE | Action: BUILD_INITIAL_SETTLEMENT

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Place first settlement at node 17 to secure 🌲8, 🌲6, and ⛏️5 for strong wood and ore production
2. Build initial road toward node 15 to enable expansion toward sheep resources
3. Place second settlement to secure wheat, sheep, and possibly brick resources
4. Focus on early city upgrades with the strong ore production
5. Use ports to supplement resources I lack

# Initial Settlement Placement Analysis

I need to choose the optimal location for my second settlement considering my initial placement strategy priorities. Let me analyze the available nodes systematically.

## Current Status
- My first settlement is at node 17, producing resources from:
  - 🌲8 (wood, high probability)
  - 🌲6 (wood, high probability)
  - ⛏️5 (ore, good probability)
- I already have strong wood and ore production
- I need to secure: wheat, sheep, and brick to have all 5 resources
- I should place my settlement on the opposite side of the board from node 17

## Key Location Analysis
Let me analyze the most promising settlement locations:

### Node 22
- Resources: 🐑4 + 🌾5 + ⛏️11
- Production value: Low (sheep) + Good (wheat) + Low (ore)
- Resource diversity: Adds wheat and sheep to my portfolio
- Location: Opposite side from my first settlement
- Pros: Access to wheat (5) and sheep, near the 2:1 wood port
- Cons: Low production value from sheep (4), already have ore

### Node 46
- Resources: ⛏️11 + 🌾3 + 🐑4
- Production value: Low (ore) + Very low (wheat) + Low (sheep)
- Resource diversity: Adds wheat and sheep
- Cons: Very poor production values overall

### Node 20
- Resources: ⛏️3 + 🐑4
- Production value: Very low (ore) + Low (sheep)
- Resource diversity: Adds sheep
- Cons: Poor production and only 2 resources

### Node 9
- Resources: 🌾2 + 🧱6 + 🐑9
- Production value: Very low (wheat) + High (brick) + Good (sheep)
- Resource diversity: Adds wheat, brick, and sheep
- Pros: Covers all my missing resources, high value brick (6)
- Location: Different area from first settlement

### Node 8
- Resources: 🧱6 + 🐑8 + 🐑9
- Production value: High (brick) + High (sheep x2)
- Resource diversity: Adds brick and sheep
- Pros: High production value, two high-probability resources
- Cons: Missing wheat

### Node 23
- Resources: 🧱10 + 🌾5 + 🐑4
- Production value: Low (brick) + Good (wheat) + Low (sheep)
- Resource diversity: Adds all three missing resources
- Pros: Complete resource diversity, good wheat number

### Node 52
- Resources: 🧱10 + 🌾5
- Production value: Low (brick) + Good (wheat)
- Resource diversity: Adds wheat and brick
- Pros: Access to 2:1 brick port
- Cons: Only 2 resources

## Decision

After analyzing all potential locations, I'm looking for:
1. Resource diversity (wheat, sheep, brick)
2. High production probability numbers
3. Positioning away from my first settlement

Node 9 stands out as the optimal choice because:
- It provides all three resources I'm missing (wheat, brick, sheep)
- It has a high-value brick hex (6) and good sheep hex (9)
- It's positioned in a different area of the board from my first settlement
- Although the wheat is only a 2, the combined value of the other resources makes this an excellent choice

<plan>
1. Place second settlement at node 9 to secure 🧱6, 🐑9, and 🌾2
2. Initial road should point toward node 2 or 10 for future expansion
3. Prioritize city upgrades at node 17 to maximize wood and ore production
4. Build third settlement to improve wheat production
5. Use wood/brick surplus from strong production to build roads
</plan>

- Evaluate each potential settlement by its TOTAL PIP COUNT (sum of probability dots)
- Place your initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Avoid placing both settlements near the same resources - diversify your income!
- Always consider 3:1 ports if your initial placement gives you limited access to certain resources
- Place roads in directions that block opponents' expansion routes

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT & CITY BUILDING PRIORITY:
- FIRST PRIORITY: Build 1-2 additional settlements early to secure critical resources you lack
- SECOND PRIORITY: Upgrade to cities as quickly as possible to double resource production
- THIRD PRIORITY: Build roads only when they lead directly to valuable settlement locations
- Early game (1-5 turns): Secure key settlements at high-value locations
- Mid-game (6-15 turns): Focus heavily on upgrading to cities (2-3 cities should be your target)
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road
- When short on a key resource, use 2:1 ports if available before using 3:1 or 4:1 ports
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat to other players unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- If you have excess of a resource, use ports rather than trading with opponents

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards primarily when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber OR to reach Largest Army (3+ knights)
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city or settlement build
- Use Monopoly cards after high-probability dice rolls to collect maximum resources
- Keep track of how many VP cards you've drawn (5 in the deck total)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn
- When development cards are your path to victory, aim for: 3 cities (6 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 victory cards (2 VP)
- Consider buying development cards when you have limited build options (blocked roads, etc.)

OPTIMAL EXPANSION PATH:
- Build roads with PURPOSE - every road should lead to a viable settlement location
- Identify and secure "bottleneck" positions that cut off opponents' expansion
- Expand toward resources you LACK from initial placement - seek balance
- When choosing between multiple settlement spots, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (total pip count)
  2. Access to resources you currently lack
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, securing future expansion)
  4. Proximity to useful ports
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Longest road (2 VP) requires strategic planning - only pursue if you already have 4+ roads built

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- When someone has 8+ points, ALWAYS target them with the robber regardless of other factors
- If you're being targeted by the robber, consider using knight cards immediately to protect production

TURN-BY-TURN PLANNING:
1. Start each turn by assessing your current VP and opponents' VPs (both visible and potential hidden points)
2. Identify your build priority for this turn: settlement, city, road, or development card?
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for your priority build
4. If you can't build your priority item, determine if trading or buying a development card is better
5. Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card or trade for needed resources
6. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

WINNING PATHS:
1. CITY-FOCUSED PATH: 3-4 cities (6-8 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 9-11 VP
2. BALANCED PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 VP card = 10 VP
3. DEVELOPMENT PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP

NEVER SAY NO TO FREE VPs:
- Always account for the 2 VP from longest road and largest army in your plans
- These special cards are EASY to lose if you're not defending them
- Invest in roads/knights to maintain your lead if these VPs are part of your strategy
- Be alert for opponents trying to steal these bonus points

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Analysis of Initial Road Placement Options

I need to decide where to build my initial road from my settlement at node 9. I have three options:
- [0] Edge (9, 10): Moving toward the center/east
- [1] Edge (2, 9): Moving toward the south
- [2] Edge (8, 9): Moving toward the west

Let me analyze each option carefully:

## Option 0: Road at edge (9, 10)
- This road heads toward node 10, which connects to:
  - Desert hex (no production)
  - Sheep 9 (already accessing from node 9)
  - Wheat 2 (already accessing from node 9)
- Limited expansion potential as it heads toward resources I already have
- This direction puts me toward the robber (currently on the desert)

## Option 1: Road at edge (2, 9)
- This road heads toward node 2, which connects to:
  - Brick 6 (already accessing from node 9)
  - Wheat 2 (already accessing from node 9) 
  - Wood 4 (new resource)
- From node 2, I could further expand to nodes 1 or 3
- This provides access to the wood 4 hex which would give me a new resource
- Creates more expansion options in the center of the board

## Option 2: Road at edge (8, 9)
- This road heads toward node 8, which connects to:
  - Brick 6 (already accessing from node 9)
  - Sheep 8 (new high-value resource spot)
  - Sheep 9 (already accessing from node 9)
- Moves toward sheep production I'm already getting
- Doesn't diversify my resource income

## Strategic Considerations
1. My current settlement at node 17 produces wood and ore
2. My settlement at node 9 produces brick, wheat, and sheep
3. I already have access to all five resources, which is excellent
4. I should expand toward valuable build spots or resource diversity

<plan>
1. Build initial road toward node 2 to access wood 4 and open expansion options
2. Focus on securing strong wheat production for city upgrades
3. Prioritize city upgrade at node 17 to maximize wood and ore production
4. Use wood/brick surplus for strategic road building
5. Target development cards when I have excess sheep/wheat/ore
</plan>

Option 1 (edge 2, 9) provides the best strategic value because:
- Opens path to wood 4 hex which complements my resources
- Creates multiple expansion routes toward the center of the board
- Avoids moving toward the robber
- Allows future access to several high-value nodes

Therefore, I choose:

\boxed{1}
========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:

RESPONSE:
# Analyzing Game State and Options

Let me analyze my current position and available actions:

## Current Resources
- 1 Wood, 1 Brick, 1 Sheep, 1 Wheat
- Just enough for a road but nothing else

## Current Settlements
1. Node 17: Produces Wood (6, 8) and Ore (5)
2. Node 9: Produces Brick (6), Wheat (2), Sheep (9)

## Victory Point Situation
- I have 2 VP (from 2 settlements)
- RED also has 2 VP
- No longest road or largest army bonus yet

## Board Analysis
- My two settlements are on opposite sides of the board
- Wood (6, 8, 9) has strong numbers
- Brick (6) is also good
- Wheat (2) is poor
- Ore (5) is decent but only from one settlement

## Available Actions
My only option is to build a road with my wood and brick, or end turn. I should build a road to expand toward valuable future settlement locations.

## Road Building Options Analysis:

1. Edge (9, 10): Extends from my settlement at node 9 toward wheat (2) and desert hexes
2. Edge (1, 2): Extends toward brick (6) and a potential new settlement location
3. Edge (17, 39): Extends from my settlement at node 17 toward the 3:1 general port
4. Edge (2, 3): Goes toward wheat (2) area
5. Edge (4, 15): Connects to my settlement at node 17 from different direction
6. Edge (8, 9): Different approach to my settlement at node 9
7. Edge (17, 18): Extends from my settlement at node 17 toward ore (5)
8. Edge (14, 15): Connects to my settlement at node 17 from different direction

## Strategic Evaluation:
- I need better wheat production (my wheat is only on a 2)
- Building toward good expansion spots is critical
- Need to think about my overall path to victory

Looking at the map and my settlements:
- Road options 3 and 7 extend from node 17 toward potentially valuable expansion spots
- Option 3 (17, 39) heads toward the 3:1 port which could be useful since I have limited wheat access
- Option 7 (17, 18) heads toward ore (5) hex and potential settlements that could give me better ore production

<plan>
1. Build road toward node 39 to access the 3:1 port
2. Focus on securing better wheat production for city upgrades
3. Continue to expand from node 17 toward resource-rich areas
4. Plan for city upgrades at my settlements with best production
5. Consider development card strategy if expansion becomes limited
</plan>

After analyzing the board carefully, building road at edge (17, 39) seems most strategic as it:
1. Heads toward the 3:1 port which will help compensate for my poor wheat production
2. Opens up expansion options in that direction
3. Provides a path toward developing a longest road possibly

The final action I choose is:

\boxed{3}
========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Target hexes with HIGH probability numbers (6,8,5,9) - prioritize these above all else
- Go for resource DIVERSITY: secure ALL five resources between your two settlements
- Focus on ORE and WHEAT for city upgrades (numbers 5-9 preferred)
- Evaluate each potential settlement by its TOTAL PIP COUNT (sum of probability dots)
- Place your initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Avoid placing both settlements near the same resources - diversify your income!
- Always consider 3:1 ports if your initial placement gives you limited access to certain resources
- Place roads in directions that block opponents' expansion routes

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT & CITY BUILDING PRIORITY:
- FIRST PRIORITY: Build 1-2 additional settlements early to secure critical resources you lack
- SECOND PRIORITY: Upgrade to cities as quickly as possible to double resource production
- THIRD PRIORITY: Build roads only when they lead directly to valuable settlement locations
- Early game (1-5 turns): Secure key settlements at high-value locations
- Mid-game (6-15 turns): Focus heavily on upgrading to cities (2-3 cities should be your target)
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road
- When short on a key resource, use 2:1 ports if available before using 3:1 or 4:1 ports
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat to other players unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- If you have excess of a resource, use ports rather than trading with opponents

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards primarily when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber OR to reach Largest Army (3+ knights)
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city or settlement build
- Use Monopoly cards after high-probability dice rolls to collect maximum resources
- Keep track of how many VP cards you've drawn (5 in the deck total)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn
- When development cards are your path to victory, aim for: 3 cities (6 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 victory cards (2 VP)
- Consider buying development cards when you have limited build options (blocked roads, etc.)

OPTIMAL EXPANSION PATH:
- Build roads with PURPOSE - every road should lead to a viable settlement location
- Identify and secure "bottleneck" positions that cut off opponents' expansion
- Expand toward resources you LACK from initial placement - seek balance
- When choosing between multiple settlement spots, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (total pip count)
  2. Access to resources you currently lack
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, securing future expansion)
  4. Proximity to useful ports
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Longest road (2 VP) requires strategic planning - only pursue if you already have 4+ roads built

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- When someone has 8+ points, ALWAYS target them with the robber regardless of other factors
- If you're being targeted by the robber, consider using knight cards immediately to protect production

TURN-BY-TURN PLANNING:
1. Start each turn by assessing your current VP and opponents' VPs (both visible and potential hidden points)
2. Identify your build priority for this turn: settlement, city, road, or development card?
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for your priority build
4. If you can't build your priority item, determine if trading or buying a development card is better
5. Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card or trade for needed resources
6. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

WINNING PATHS:
1. CITY-FOCUSED PATH: 3-4 cities (6-8 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 9-11 VP
2. BALANCED PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 VP card = 10 VP
3. DEVELOPMENT PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP

NEVER SAY NO TO FREE VPs:
- Always account for the 2 VP from longest road and largest army in your plans
- These special cards are EASY to lose if you're not defending them
- Invest in roads/knights to maintain your lead if these VPs are part of your strategy
- Be alert for opponents trying to steal these bonus points

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 7 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Build road toward node 39 to access the 3:1 port
2. Focus on securing better wheat production for city upgrades
3. Continue to expand from node 17 toward resource-rich areas
4. Plan for city upgrades at my settlements with best production
5. Consider development card strategy if expansion becomes limited
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.

# Game Analysis for Catan Turn 7

I'll carefully analyze my current position and available options to determine the optimal move.

## Current Game State Assessment:
- I have 2 victory points from 2 settlements
- I have exactly 1 of each resource: wood, brick, sheep, wheat, and ore
- My settlements are at nodes 17 (produces wood 6/8 and ore 5) and 9 (produces brick 6, wheat 2, sheep 9)
- I have 3 roads built, with a road already connecting to node 39 (3:1 port)
- The robber is on desert, so not affecting any production currently
- RED player has 9 hidden cards, which is concerning as they may be planning a major build

## Options Analysis:

1. **End Turn** - Not optimal as I can make progress this turn with my available resources.

2. **Build Road Options** (all cost wood + brick):
   - Option 1 (9, 10): Extends from my settlement at 9 toward the 3:1 port area
   - Option 2 (1, 2): Extends toward a wheat/ore area from node 9
   - Option 3 (38, 39): Would be redundant since I already have a road to node 39
   - Option 4 (2, 3): Extends toward wheat/sheep areas
   - Option 5 (4, 15): Connects toward my settlement at 17
   - Option 6 (8, 9): Would be redundant since I already have a settlement at 9
   - Option 7 (17, 18): Extends from my settlement at 17 toward ore/brick area
   - Option 8 (39, 41): Extends from the 3:1 port toward ore 5 area
   - Option 9 (14, 15): Connects toward my settlement at 17

3. **Buy Development Card** (costs sheep + wheat + ore):
   - Could be a knight (useful for defense or offense)
   - Could be a victory point (hidden advantage)
   - Could be a progress card (resource advantage)

## Strategic Considerations:
- I currently have balanced resources but need to improve production to win
- I already have a road to the 3:1 port (node 39)
- My existing plan was to build roads toward the 3:1 port, which I've accomplished
- I need to shift focus to either:
  1. Building new settlements to increase resource production
  2. Upgrading to cities (need ore + wheat)
  3. Development cards for potential points or largest army

Looking at the board, I see good settlement opportunities:
- Around node 41 which has access to ore 5
- Around node 18 which connects to brick 11 and ore 5

<plan>
1. Focus on settlement expansion toward ore-rich locations
2. Extend road from node 39 to node 41 for potential settlement with ore access
3. Save resources for city upgrades once settlement expansion is secure
4. Consider development cards if blocked from expansion
5. Work toward securing longest road once I have 4+ segments
</plan>

Based on this analysis, my optimal move is to build a road from node 39 to node 41, extending toward the ore 5 hex which will help with city upgrades later. This aligns with my updated plan to expand toward ore-rich areas.

# Game Analysis: Turn 7 as Blue Player

Let me analyze my current position:

**Current Resources:**
- 1 🐑 SHEEP
- 1 🌾 WHEAT
- 1 ⛏️ ORE

**Victory Points:** 2/10 (two settlements)

**Road Network:**
- I have 4 roads built with a longest path of 3 segments
- Extended road network from node 17 to node 41
- Positioned to potentially build a settlement at node 41 (connected to ore hex)

**Available Actions:**
1. Buy a development card (costs exactly what I have: 1 sheep, 1 wheat, 1 ore)
2. End turn (no other building options possible)

## Strategic Analysis

My current plan focuses on settlement expansion toward ore-rich locations, particularly aiming to build a settlement at node 41. However, I need more resources to build a settlement (would need brick and wood).

Looking at my development card option:
- Development cards could yield a Victory Point card (immediate hidden VP)
- Knight cards would help protect my production and work toward Largest Army (2 VP)
- Progress cards (Road Building, Year of Plenty, Monopoly) could provide strategic advantages

Given that I can't make progress on my settlement expansion this turn, buying a development card is the optimal choice. This aligns with our strategy of "NEVER SAY NO TO FREE VPs" and the advice to "Consider buying development cards when you have limited build options."

Additionally, development cards are excellent for:
1. Potentially gaining a hidden victory point
2. Building toward largest army (2 VP)
3. Getting utility cards that could accelerate my expansion plans

<plan>
1. Buy development card now to make use of available resources
2. Continue focus on extending road network toward ore-rich locations (node 41)
3. Prioritize getting resources for a settlement at node 41 in upcoming turns
4. Consider city upgrades after securing the additional settlement
5. Build toward either largest army or longest road based on development card results
</plan>

Since I can't build anything else this turn and I have exactly the resources needed for a development card, purchasing a development card is the clear optimal choice.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Target hexes with HIGH probability numbers (6,8,5,9) - prioritize these above all else
- Go for resource DIVERSITY: secure ALL five resources between your two settlements
- Focus on ORE and WHEAT for city upgrades (numbers 5-9 preferred)
- Evaluate each potential settlement by its TOTAL PIP COUNT (sum of probability dots)
- Place your initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Avoid placing both settlements near the same resources - diversify your income!
- Always consider 3:1 ports if your initial placement gives you limited access to certain resources
- Place roads in directions that block opponents' expansion routes

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT & CITY BUILDING PRIORITY:
- FIRST PRIORITY: Build 1-2 additional settlements early to secure critical resources you lack
- SECOND PRIORITY: Upgrade to cities as quickly as possible to double resource production
- THIRD PRIORITY: Build roads only when they lead directly to valuable settlement locations
- Early game (1-5 turns): Secure key settlements at high-value locations
- Mid-game (6-15 turns): Focus heavily on upgrading to cities (2-3 cities should be your target)
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road
- When short on a key resource, use 2:1 ports if available before using 3:1 or 4:1 ports
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat to other players unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- If you have excess of a resource, use ports rather than trading with opponents

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards primarily when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber OR to reach Largest Army (3+ knights)
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city or settlement build
- Use Monopoly cards after high-probability dice rolls to collect maximum resources
- Keep track of how many VP cards you've drawn (5 in the deck total)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn
- When development cards are your path to victory, aim for: 3 cities (6 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 victory cards (2 VP)
- Consider buying development cards when you have limited build options (blocked roads, etc.)

OPTIMAL EXPANSION PATH:
- Build roads with PURPOSE - every road should lead to a viable settlement location
- Identify and secure "bottleneck" positions that cut off opponents' expansion
- Expand toward resources you LACK from initial placement - seek balance
- When choosing between multiple settlement spots, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (total pip count)
  2. Access to resources you currently lack
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, securing future expansion)
  4. Proximity to useful ports
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Longest road (2 VP) requires strategic planning - only pursue if you already have 4+ roads built

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- When someone has 8+ points, ALWAYS target them with the robber regardless of other factors
- If you're being targeted by the robber, consider using knight cards immediately to protect production

TURN-BY-TURN PLANNING:
1. Start each turn by assessing your current VP and opponents' VPs (both visible and potential hidden points)
2. Identify your build priority for this turn: settlement, city, road, or development card?
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for your priority build
4. If you can't build your priority item, determine if trading or buying a development card is better
5. Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card or trade for needed resources
6. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

WINNING PATHS:
1. CITY-FOCUSED PATH: 3-4 cities (6-8 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 9-11 VP
2. BALANCED PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 VP card = 10 VP
3. DEVELOPMENT PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP

NEVER SAY NO TO FREE VPs:
- Always account for the 2 VP from longest road and largest army in your plans
- These special cards are EASY to lose if you're not defending them
- Invest in roads/knights to maintain your lead if these VPs are part of your strategy
- Be alert for opponents trying to steal these bonus points

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 9 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Buy development card now to make use of available resources
2. Continue focus on extending road network toward ore-rich locations (node 41)
3. Prioritize getting resources for a settlement at node 41 in upcoming turns
4. Consider city upgrades after securing the additional settlement
5. Build toward either largest army or longest road based on development card results
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.

# Game State Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state and my options:

1) I have 2 Victory Points (2 settlements)
2) My resources are limited: 1 Wood, 1 Brick
3) I have 1 development card: a Knight card
4) I've built 4 roads with a longest path of 3
5) I'm at the start of my turn and have two options:
   - [0] Play Knight card
   - [1] Roll the dice

## Resource Analysis:
- I have settlements on decent production spots:
  - Node 17: Wood (8), Wood (6), Ore (5)
  - Node 9: Brick (6), Wheat (2), Sheep (9)
- The robber is currently on Desert (0,-2,2) which isn't blocking any resources
- I have access to Wood, Brick, Wheat, Sheep, and Ore - all resources

## Strategic Considerations:
1. With only 1 Wood and 1 Brick, I can't build anything right now
2. Playing the Knight card before rolling:
   - Pros: Could move the robber to block RED and steal a resource
   - Cons: Limits strategic options after the roll, might need the Knight later for defense
3. Rolling first:
   - Pros: Might get resources for building, can make a more informed decision
   - Cons: If a 7 is rolled, I would need to discard if I have >7 resources

<plan>
1. Roll the dice to gather more resources before making decisions
2. If roll yields sufficient resources, prioritize extending road toward node 41 for future settlement
3. If resources are still insufficient for building, consider development card or playing Knight
4. Long-term focus remains on securing ore-rich location at node 41 and city upgrades
5. Begin working toward largest army (Knight already in hand)
</plan>

## Decision:
The optimal move is to roll the dice first to see what resources I receive. With only 2 cards in hand, I don't risk discarding on a 7. Playing the Knight now would be premature since:
1. The robber isn't blocking any of my hexes
2. I want to see my resource situation after the roll
3. I might need the Knight later for defense or to compete for largest army

Therefore, I should roll the dice to maximize information before committing to actions.

# Game State Analysis

Let me carefully analyze my current situation in Settlers of Catan and determine the optimal action.

## Current Resources
I have 1 Wood and 1 Brick - exactly enough to build one road.

## Victory Points
I have 2 VP from my 2 settlements. I need 8 more to win.

## Development Cards
I have 1 Knight card. Playing it would allow me to move the robber and steal a resource.

## Strategic Position
- I have settlements at nodes 17 (producing wood from 8&6 and ore from 5) and node 9 (brick from 6, wheat from 2, sheep from 9)
- My road network extends from node 17 toward node 41, which appears to be near the ore port
- The robber is currently on the desert hex, so not blocking any production

## Action Analysis

### Option 0: Play Knight
- Advantage: Could move the robber to a high-value hex that RED depends on and steal a resource
- Disadvantage: I would waste my road-building resources this turn
- Disadvantage: Saving Knight for largest army (need 3 total) is better long-term

### Option 1: End Turn
- This wastes my current resources and opportunity to build

### Options 2-10: Build Roads
I need to evaluate which road extension offers the most strategic value:

- Option 5: Build road at (41, 42)
  - This extends my current path toward the ore port (nodes 40, 44)
  - This puts me in position to eventually build a settlement at node 42, which could access the ore port
  - This continues my existing plan

- Option 9: Build road at (17, 18)
  - Would extend toward potentially valuable nodes, but not as immediately useful as continuing my path to the ore port

- The other road options don't align with my current strategic position or would require changing my expansion direction entirely

## Decision Logic
1. I have exactly enough resources to build one road
2. Building a road is better than ending my turn or playing a Knight card prematurely
3. Continuing my path toward the ore port (option 5) aligns with my strategic plan
4. This will position me for a future settlement at node 42 near the ore port
5. The ore port will be valuable since I only have one ore-producing hex

<plan>
1. Build road at edge (41, 42) to continue path toward ore port
2. Next priorities: gather resources for settlement at node 42
3. Continue working toward city upgrades when possible
4. Save Knight card to contribute to largest army (need 3 total)
5. Long-term goal is still city-focused path with largest army
</plan>

\boxed{5}
========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Target hexes with HIGH probability numbers (6,8,5,9) - prioritize these above all else
- Go for resource DIVERSITY: secure ALL five resources between your two settlements
- Focus on ORE and WHEAT for city upgrades (numbers 5-9 preferred)
- Evaluate each potential settlement by its TOTAL PIP COUNT (sum of probability dots)
- Place your initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Avoid placing both settlements near the same resources - diversify your income!
- Always consider 3:1 ports if your initial placement gives you limited access to certain resources
- Place roads in directions that block opponents' expansion routes

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT & CITY BUILDING PRIORITY:
- FIRST PRIORITY: Build 1-2 additional settlements early to secure critical resources you lack
- SECOND PRIORITY: Upgrade to cities as quickly as possible to double resource production
- THIRD PRIORITY: Build roads only when they lead directly to valuable settlement locations
- Early game (1-5 turns): Secure key settlements at high-value locations
- Mid-game (6-15 turns): Focus heavily on upgrading to cities (2-3 cities should be your target)
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road
- When short on a key resource, use 2:1 ports if available before using 3:1 or 4:1 ports
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat to other players unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- If you have excess of a resource, use ports rather than trading with opponents

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards primarily when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber OR to reach Largest Army (3+ knights)
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city or settlement build
- Use Monopoly cards after high-probability dice rolls to collect maximum resources
- Keep track of how many VP cards you've drawn (5 in the deck total)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn
- When development cards are your path to victory, aim for: 3 cities (6 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 victory cards (2 VP)
- Consider buying development cards when you have limited build options (blocked roads, etc.)

OPTIMAL EXPANSION PATH:
- Build roads with PURPOSE - every road should lead to a viable settlement location
- Identify and secure "bottleneck" positions that cut off opponents' expansion
- Expand toward resources you LACK from initial placement - seek balance
- When choosing between multiple settlement spots, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (total pip count)
  2. Access to resources you currently lack
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, securing future expansion)
  4. Proximity to useful ports
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Longest road (2 VP) requires strategic planning - only pursue if you already have 4+ roads built

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- When someone has 8+ points, ALWAYS target them with the robber regardless of other factors
- If you're being targeted by the robber, consider using knight cards immediately to protect production

TURN-BY-TURN PLANNING:
1. Start each turn by assessing your current VP and opponents' VPs (both visible and potential hidden points)
2. Identify your build priority for this turn: settlement, city, road, or development card?
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for your priority build
4. If you can't build your priority item, determine if trading or buying a development card is better
5. Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card or trade for needed resources
6. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

WINNING PATHS:
1. CITY-FOCUSED PATH: 3-4 cities (6-8 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 9-11 VP
2. BALANCED PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 VP card = 10 VP
3. DEVELOPMENT PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP

NEVER SAY NO TO FREE VPs:
- Always account for the 2 VP from longest road and largest army in your plans
- These special cards are EASY to lose if you're not defending them
- Invest in roads/knights to maintain your lead if these VPs are part of your strategy
- Be alert for opponents trying to steal these bonus points

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 9 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Build road at edge (41, 42) to continue path toward ore port
2. Next priorities: gather resources for settlement at node 42
3. Continue working toward city upgrades when possible
4. Save Knight card to contribute to largest army (need 3 total)
5. Long-term goal is still city-focused path with largest army
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.

# Game Analysis for Turn 9

I need to carefully evaluate my options on this turn to make the most strategic decision.

## Current Game State Assessment
- I have 2 victory points (2 settlements)
- I currently have NO resources in hand
- I have 1 development card (Knight)
- Red has 11 hidden resource cards
- The robber is on a desert hex (0,-2,2) and not blocking any production
- I'm trying to build a road at (41,42) to reach the ore port

## Option Analysis

**Option 0: Play Knight Card**
- Advantages:
  - I can move the robber to a high-value hex that Red is using
  - I can potentially steal one of Red's 11 resources
  - I would be the first to play a knight card, starting progress toward largest army (need 3)
  - This prevents the knight card from being lost if a 7 is rolled and I have >7 cards later
- Disadvantages:
  - Using the knight now means I won't have it if a 7 is rolled and I need to protect my production

**Option 1: End Turn**
- Advantages:
  - I save my knight card for a potentially more strategic moment
  - No immediate benefit to playing my knight card if I can't build anything after
- Disadvantages:
  - I miss an opportunity to steal a resource from Red, who has 11 cards
  - I'm passing a turn with no progress

## Strategic Consideration
Red has 11 resources, which is a substantial amount. This suggests they may be planning a significant build on their next turn - potentially multiple builds. This many resources also makes them a prime target for the robber.

Since I have no resources currently, playing the knight card to steal a resource would give me at least something to work with. Additionally, it would disrupt Red's production on a key hex.

<plan>
1. Play knight card to move robber to Red's highest-producing hex and steal a resource
2. Continue with original plan to build toward ore port when resources become available
3. Focus on city upgrades as soon as I can gather the necessary resources (3 ore, 2 wheat)
4. Continue playing knights to work toward largest army (need 2 more after this one)
5. Long-term goal remains a city-focused victory path
</plan>

Given that Red has 11 resources and I have none, the most strategic move is to play my knight card, disrupt Red's production, and steal a resource. This gives me some progress this turn rather than doing nothing.

# Analysis of Robber Placement Options

I need to decide the best hex to place the robber after playing my knight card. My goal is to maximize my advantage while hindering my opponent's progress.

## Evaluating High-Value Targets

Red has 11 cards and 2 victory points, similar to my 2 victory points. Looking at Red's settlements:
- Red has a settlement at node 1 producing: 🌲4, 🧱6, 🐑4
- Red has a settlement at node 22 producing: 🐑4, ⛏️11, 🌾5

The highest value numbers are:
- 🧱6 (3 pips) at hex (1, -1, 0)
- ⛏️11 (2 pips) at hex (1, 1, -2)
- 🌾5 (2 pips) at hex (2, 0, -2)

## Strategic Considerations
1. Blocking the highest probability production is optimal
2. Red has 11 cards - they likely have resources I want to steal
3. Brick (🧱) is crucial for early expansion, while Ore (⛏️) is essential for city upgrades

Looking at my plan, I want to focus on city upgrades soon, which require ore and wheat.

## Decision Assessment

Option [1]: Move robber to (1, -1, 0) and steal from RED
- Blocks 🧱6 with highest probability (3 pips)
- Brick is critical for Red's expansion
- Prevents Red from building more roads

Option [15]: Move robber to (1, 1, -2) and steal from RED
- Blocks ⛏️11 production
- Ore is essential for city upgrades
- Since I want to focus on city upgrades, blocking Red's ore access is strategic

Option [16]: Move robber to (2, 0, -2) and steal from RED
- Blocks 🌾5 production
- Wheat is needed for both settlements and cities
- Also critical for development cards

Given that:
1. Brick (option 1) is most important for early expansion with highest probability
2. Red already has 11 cards, indicating they might be hoarding resources
3. Blocking the 6 (highest probability) will have the biggest impact on their production

<plan>
1. Block Red's brick production to slow their expansion
2. Continue building toward ore port when resources become available
3. Focus on city upgrades as soon as I can gather the necessary resources (3 ore, 2 wheat)
4. Continue playing knights to work toward largest army (need 2 more after this one)
5. Long-term goal remains a city-focused victory path
</plan>

Based on this analysis, I will place the robber on Red's brick (6) hex:

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Target hexes with HIGH probability numbers (6,8,5,9) - prioritize these above all else
- Go for resource DIVERSITY: secure ALL five resources between your two settlements
- Focus on ORE and WHEAT for city upgrades (numbers 5-9 preferred)
- Evaluate each potential settlement by its TOTAL PIP COUNT (sum of probability dots)
- Place your initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Avoid placing both settlements near the same resources - diversify your income!
- Always consider 3:1 ports if your initial placement gives you limited access to certain resources
- Place roads in directions that block opponents' expansion routes

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT & CITY BUILDING PRIORITY:
- FIRST PRIORITY: Build 1-2 additional settlements early to secure critical resources you lack
- SECOND PRIORITY: Upgrade to cities as quickly as possible to double resource production
- THIRD PRIORITY: Build roads only when they lead directly to valuable settlement locations
- Early game (1-5 turns): Secure key settlements at high-value locations
- Mid-game (6-15 turns): Focus heavily on upgrading to cities (2-3 cities should be your target)
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road
- When short on a key resource, use 2:1 ports if available before using 3:1 or 4:1 ports
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat to other players unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- If you have excess of a resource, use ports rather than trading with opponents

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards primarily when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber OR to reach Largest Army (3+ knights)
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city or settlement build
- Use Monopoly cards after high-probability dice rolls to collect maximum resources
- Keep track of how many VP cards you've drawn (5 in the deck total)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn
- When development cards are your path to victory, aim for: 3 cities (6 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 victory cards (2 VP)
- Consider buying development cards when you have limited build options (blocked roads, etc.)

OPTIMAL EXPANSION PATH:
- Build roads with PURPOSE - every road should lead to a viable settlement location
- Identify and secure "bottleneck" positions that cut off opponents' expansion
- Expand toward resources you LACK from initial placement - seek balance
- When choosing between multiple settlement spots, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (total pip count)
  2. Access to resources you currently lack
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, securing future expansion)
  4. Proximity to useful ports
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Longest road (2 VP) requires strategic planning - only pursue if you already have 4+ roads built

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- When someone has 8+ points, ALWAYS target them with the robber regardless of other factors
- If you're being targeted by the robber, consider using knight cards immediately to protect production

TURN-BY-TURN PLANNING:
1. Start each turn by assessing your current VP and opponents' VPs (both visible and potential hidden points)
2. Identify your build priority for this turn: settlement, city, road, or development card?
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for your priority build
4. If you can't build your priority item, determine if trading or buying a development card is better
5. Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card or trade for needed resources
6. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

WINNING PATHS:
1. CITY-FOCUSED PATH: 3-4 cities (6-8 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 9-11 VP
2. BALANCED PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 VP card = 10 VP
3. DEVELOPMENT PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP

NEVER SAY NO TO FREE VPs:
- Always account for the 2 VP from longest road and largest army in your plans
- These special cards are EASY to lose if you're not defending them
- Invest in roads/knights to maintain your lead if these VPs are part of your strategy
- Be alert for opponents trying to steal these bonus points

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 11 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

# Game State Analysis

I need to carefully analyze the current game state to make the optimal decision.

## Current Resources
I have 1 wood and 1 brick. This is exactly enough to build one road, but nothing else.

## Victory Point Assessment
- I have 2 VP (from 2 settlements)
- Red has 3 VP (from 3 settlements)
- Neither of us has longest road or largest army yet

## My Initial Plan Review
My current plan involves:
1. Blocking Red's brick production (the robber is already on brick 6)
2. Building toward ore port
3. Focusing on city upgrades (need ore/wheat)
4. Playing knights for largest army
5. City-focused victory path

## Road Building Options Analysis
Looking at the 9 road options:

1. Edge (9, 10): Extends toward wheat hex (2) - low production value but creates path toward wheat
2. Edge (1, 2): Moves toward center of board, connects to wheat (2) and ore (3)
3. Edge (38, 39): Moves toward ore port (nodes 40, 44) - aligns with my plan
4. Edge (40, 42): Direct path to ore port - excellent strategic option
5. Edge (2, 3): Alternative path through center
6. Edge (4, 15): Extends network toward northeast
7. Edge (8, 9): Connects to my settlement at node 9
8. Edge (17, 18): Extends from my settlement at 17 westward
9. Edge (14, 15): Connects road network toward northeast

Looking at resource needs, I currently have:
- Strong wood production (6, 8 - both 3 pips)
- Poor brick production (need to trade for brick)
- Mediocre sheep (9 - 2 pips)
- No wheat production (only a 2 on my settlement)
- Decent ore (5 - 2 pips)

## Strategic Decision

The ore port would be extremely valuable since I have ore production but need more. Option 4 (road at edge 40, 42) would directly connect toward the ore port and position me to build a settlement there in the future. This aligns perfectly with my city-focused victory plan, as I'll need lots of ore.

Since I can only build one road with my current resources, and I won't immediately be able to build a settlement, I should choose the option that creates the most direct path to a high-value location.

<plan>
1. Build road toward ore port (2:1) as I have ore production but need more for cities
2. Gather resources for next settlement near the ore port
3. Focus on city upgrades after securing better resource income
4. Continue playing knights when available to work toward largest army
5. Maintain city-focused victory path: 3 cities (6VP) + 2 settlements (2VP) + largest army (2VP) = 10VP
</plan>

After careful analysis, my optimal move is to build a road at edge (40, 42), which creates a direct path to the ore port. This aligns with my strategy to improve ore access for city upgrades.

# Game Analysis for Settlers of Catan

Let me analyze my current game state and available options:

## Current Game State
- I have 4 VP (2 from settlements + 2 from longest road)
- I have 5 wood, 3 sheep, 1 ore, and no wheat or brick
- My settlements produce wood (6, 8), sheep (9), brick (6), ore (5), and wheat (2)
- I have played 1 knight card toward largest army

## Resource Production Assessment
- Strong wood production (2 good numbers: 6, 8)
- Decent sheep production (number 9)
- Decent brick production (number 6)
- Decent ore production (number 5) 
- Weak wheat production (number 2)
- Current limitation: wheat access is poor (only from a 2)

## Available Actions
I can only trade or end my turn, as I don't have the right resources for building.

## Trading Options
- Option [2]: Trade 4 wood for 1 ore - Would give me 2 ore total
- Option [3]: Trade 4 wood for 1 wheat - Would give me 1 wheat
- Option [4]: Trade 4 wood for 1 brick - Would give me 1 brick

## Strategic Analysis

Looking at my current plan, I want to build a road toward the ore port and then build a settlement. However, I need to assess what resources I need most right now:

- For a city: Need 3 ore + 2 wheat (have 1 ore, 0 wheat)
- For a road: Need 1 wood + 1 brick (have 5 wood, 0 brick)
- For a settlement: Need 1 wood + 1 brick + 1 sheep + 1 wheat (have 5 wood, 3 sheep, 0 brick, 0 wheat)

Since I have a lot of wood but limited brick, getting a brick would allow me to build a road immediately. This aligns with my plan to expand toward the ore port. Then I can focus on gathering other resources for settlements and cities.

Having the longest road (2 VP) is valuable, and continuing to expand will protect this advantage. Additionally, expanding toward the ore port will improve my resource production for cities later.

<plan>
1. Trade for brick to build roads toward ore port (2:1)
2. Expand road network to secure a settlement location near the ore port
3. Gather resources for new settlement (needs wheat next)
4. Focus on city upgrades once expansion is secured
5. Continue playing knights when available to work toward largest army
6. Victory path: 3 cities (6VP) + 2 settlements (2VP) + largest army (2VP) = 10VP
</plan>

Given my current resources and plan, I'll trade for brick to continue my road expansion.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Target hexes with HIGH probability numbers (6,8,5,9) - prioritize these above all else
- Go for resource DIVERSITY: secure ALL five resources between your two settlements
- Focus on ORE and WHEAT for city upgrades (numbers 5-9 preferred)
- Evaluate each potential settlement by its TOTAL PIP COUNT (sum of probability dots)
- Place your initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Avoid placing both settlements near the same resources - diversify your income!
- Always consider 3:1 ports if your initial placement gives you limited access to certain resources
- Place roads in directions that block opponents' expansion routes

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT & CITY BUILDING PRIORITY:
- FIRST PRIORITY: Build 1-2 additional settlements early to secure critical resources you lack
- SECOND PRIORITY: Upgrade to cities as quickly as possible to double resource production
- THIRD PRIORITY: Build roads only when they lead directly to valuable settlement locations
- Early game (1-5 turns): Secure key settlements at high-value locations
- Mid-game (6-15 turns): Focus heavily on upgrading to cities (2-3 cities should be your target)
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road
- When short on a key resource, use 2:1 ports if available before using 3:1 or 4:1 ports
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat to other players unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- If you have excess of a resource, use ports rather than trading with opponents

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards primarily when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber OR to reach Largest Army (3+ knights)
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city or settlement build
- Use Monopoly cards after high-probability dice rolls to collect maximum resources
- Keep track of how many VP cards you've drawn (5 in the deck total)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn
- When development cards are your path to victory, aim for: 3 cities (6 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 victory cards (2 VP)
- Consider buying development cards when you have limited build options (blocked roads, etc.)

OPTIMAL EXPANSION PATH:
- Build roads with PURPOSE - every road should lead to a viable settlement location
- Identify and secure "bottleneck" positions that cut off opponents' expansion
- Expand toward resources you LACK from initial placement - seek balance
- When choosing between multiple settlement spots, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (total pip count)
  2. Access to resources you currently lack
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, securing future expansion)
  4. Proximity to useful ports
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Longest road (2 VP) requires strategic planning - only pursue if you already have 4+ roads built

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- When someone has 8+ points, ALWAYS target them with the robber regardless of other factors
- If you're being targeted by the robber, consider using knight cards immediately to protect production

TURN-BY-TURN PLANNING:
1. Start each turn by assessing your current VP and opponents' VPs (both visible and potential hidden points)
2. Identify your build priority for this turn: settlement, city, road, or development card?
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for your priority build
4. If you can't build your priority item, determine if trading or buying a development card is better
5. Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card or trade for needed resources
6. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

WINNING PATHS:
1. CITY-FOCUSED PATH: 3-4 cities (6-8 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 9-11 VP
2. BALANCED PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 VP card = 10 VP
3. DEVELOPMENT PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP

NEVER SAY NO TO FREE VPs:
- Always account for the 2 VP from longest road and largest army in your plans
- These special cards are EASY to lose if you're not defending them
- Invest in roads/knights to maintain your lead if these VPs are part of your strategy
- Be alert for opponents trying to steal these bonus points

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 23 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Trade for brick to build roads toward ore port (2:1)
2. Expand road network to secure a settlement location near the ore port
3. Gather resources for new settlement (needs wheat next)
4. Focus on city upgrades once expansion is secured
5. Continue playing knights when available to work toward largest army
6. Victory path: 3 cities (6VP) + 2 settlements (2VP) + largest army (2VP) = 10VP

# Game Analysis for Settlers of Catan - Turn 23

Let me assess the current game state and available options:

## Current Game Status
- I (BLUE) have 4 VP: 2 settlements (2 VP) + Longest Road (2 VP)
- RED has 4 VP: 2 settlements (2 VP) + 1 city (2 VP)
- We're tied at 4 VP, making this a critical juncture

## Resource Assessment
- Current resources: 1 🌲WOOD, 1 🧱BRICK, 3 🐑SHEEP, 1 ⛏️ORE
- I have exactly enough to build one more road (1 WOOD, 1 BRICK)
- I'm missing WHEAT, which is needed for settlements, cities, and development cards

## Strategic Options
1. **Build another road** to:
   - Maintain longest road (currently 5 segments, which gives me 2 VP)
   - Work toward a new settlement location
   
2. **End my turn** to save resources for future turns

## Road Building Analysis
Let me analyze each potential road location:

- **Options 7 & 10**: Roads at edges (40,44) and (18,40) would expand toward the 2:1 ORE port, which aligns with my city-building strategy
- **Option 9**: Road at (17,18) expands from my settlement toward a 3:1 port
- **Option 1**: Road at (9,10) expands from my settlement toward wheat and wood resources
- **Option 2, 5**: Roads at (1,2) and (2,3) are in areas contested with RED

The 2:1 ORE port would be extremely valuable as ORE is critical for city upgrades. Option 7 (edge 40,44) places me directly at the port, which would give me improved trading capability immediately.

## Final Decision
Building a road to the ORE port provides immediate trading benefits and continues my expansion. This aligns with my current plan of securing the ore port for efficient city building later.

<plan>
1. Build road to secure the ore port (2:1) location
2. Work toward gathering wheat (missing resource) for settlement/city building
3. Use the ore port to efficiently convert resources for city upgrades
4. Continue playing knights when possible to work toward largest army
5. Victory path: 3 cities (6VP) + 2 settlements (2VP) + largest army (2VP) = 10VP
</plan>

I will build a road at edge (40,44) to secure the ore port.

2. Identify your build priority for this turn: settlement, city, road, or development card?
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for your priority build
4. If you can't build your priority item, determine if trading or buying a development card is better
5. Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card or trade for needed resources
6. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

WINNING PATHS:
1. CITY-FOCUSED PATH: 3-4 cities (6-8 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 9-11 VP
2. BALANCED PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 VP card = 10 VP
3. DEVELOPMENT PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP

NEVER SAY NO TO FREE VPs:
- Always account for the 2 VP from longest road and largest army in your plans
- These special cards are EASY to lose if you're not defending them
- Invest in roads/knights to maintain your lead if these VPs are part of your strategy
- Be alert for opponents trying to steal these bonus points

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 25 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Build road to secure the ore port (2:1) location
2. Work toward gathering wheat (missing resource) for settlement/city building
3. Use the ore port to efficiently convert resources for city upgrades
4. Continue playing knights when possible to work toward largest army
5. Victory path: 3 cities (6VP) + 2 settlements (2VP) + largest army (2VP) = 10VP

# Game Analysis for Settlers of Catan

## Current Game State Assessment
- I have 4 VP: 2 settlements (2 VP) + Longest Road (2 VP)
- Resources: 4 sheep and 1 ore
- My settlements produce: wood, brick, sheep, and ore, but I lack wheat production
- I have the longest road (6 segments) which gives me a 2 VP advantage
- The robber is on a brick hex (1, -1, 0)

## Available Actions Analysis
My options are limited this turn:
- [0] End my turn without doing anything
- [1-4] Trade 4 sheep for another resource (wood, wheat, ore, or brick)

## Strategic Considerations

1) **Resource Assessment**:
   - I have excess sheep (4) but need other resources
   - I lack wheat completely, which is critical for settlements and cities
   - I already have 1 ore, and getting a second would give me a development card option

2) **Current Goal Analysis**:
   - Per my plan, I need to focus on city upgrades (needs ore + wheat) and securing the ore port
   - Building another settlement would require brick + wood + wheat + sheep

3) **Trade Options**:
   - Trading 4:1 is inefficient, but with excess sheep and no production of wheat, it may be necessary
   - Option 2 (getting wheat) aligns best with my needs - wheat is my missing resource
   - Option 3 (getting more ore) could set me up for a development card

## Decision Reasoning
Trading 4 sheep for 1 wheat (Option 2) is the most strategic choice because:
1. Wheat is my missing resource - I currently have no production of it
2. Wheat is required for both settlements and cities (my priority builds)
3. Having wheat enables more build options on future turns
4. While the 4:1 trade is inefficient, I have excess sheep and need to convert them to more valuable resources

<plan>
1. Use 4:1 trade to get wheat (missing resource) this turn
2. Continue working toward securing the ore port (2:1) for more efficient trading
3. Next turn focus on getting wood+brick to build roads toward expansion
4. Save for city upgrades (ore+wheat) when possible
5. Victory path: 2-3 cities (4-6VP) + 2 settlements (2VP) + longest road (2VP) = 8-10VP
</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Target hexes with HIGH probability numbers (6,8,5,9) - prioritize these above all else
- Go for resource DIVERSITY: secure ALL five resources between your two settlements
- Focus on ORE and WHEAT for city upgrades (numbers 5-9 preferred)
- Evaluate each potential settlement by its TOTAL PIP COUNT (sum of probability dots)
- Place your initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Avoid placing both settlements near the same resources - diversify your income!
- Always consider 3:1 ports if your initial placement gives you limited access to certain resources
- Place roads in directions that block opponents' expansion routes

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT & CITY BUILDING PRIORITY:
- FIRST PRIORITY: Build 1-2 additional settlements early to secure critical resources you lack
- SECOND PRIORITY: Upgrade to cities as quickly as possible to double resource production
- THIRD PRIORITY: Build roads only when they lead directly to valuable settlement locations
- Early game (1-5 turns): Secure key settlements at high-value locations
- Mid-game (6-15 turns): Focus heavily on upgrading to cities (2-3 cities should be your target)
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road
- When short on a key resource, use 2:1 ports if available before using 3:1 or 4:1 ports
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat to other players unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- If you have excess of a resource, use ports rather than trading with opponents

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards primarily when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber OR to reach Largest Army (3+ knights)
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city or settlement build
- Use Monopoly cards after high-probability dice rolls to collect maximum resources
- Keep track of how many VP cards you've drawn (5 in the deck total)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn
- When development cards are your path to victory, aim for: 3 cities (6 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 victory cards (2 VP)
- Consider buying development cards when you have limited build options (blocked roads, etc.)

OPTIMAL EXPANSION PATH:
- Build roads with PURPOSE - every road should lead to a viable settlement location
- Identify and secure "bottleneck" positions that cut off opponents' expansion
- Expand toward resources you LACK from initial placement - seek balance
- When choosing between multiple settlement spots, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (total pip count)
  2. Access to resources you currently lack
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, securing future expansion)
  4. Proximity to useful ports
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Longest road (2 VP) requires strategic planning - only pursue if you already have 4+ roads built

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- When someone has 8+ points, ALWAYS target them with the robber regardless of other factors
- If you're being targeted by the robber, consider using knight cards immediately to protect production

TURN-BY-TURN PLANNING:
1. Start each turn by assessing your current VP and opponents' VPs (both visible and potential hidden points)
2. Identify your build priority for this turn: settlement, city, road, or development card?
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for your priority build
4. If you can't build your priority item, determine if trading or buying a development card is better
5. Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card or trade for needed resources
6. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

WINNING PATHS:
1. CITY-FOCUSED PATH: 3-4 cities (6-8 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 9-11 VP
2. BALANCED PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 VP card = 10 VP
3. DEVELOPMENT PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP

NEVER SAY NO TO FREE VPs:
- Always account for the 2 VP from longest road and largest army in your plans
- These special cards are EASY to lose if you're not defending them
- Invest in roads/knights to maintain your lead if these VPs are part of your strategy
- Be alert for opponents trying to steal these bonus points

# Game Analysis for Settlers of Catan

Let me analyze the current game state and determine the best move:

## Current Game Status
- I (BLUE) have 4 victory points (2 settlements + longest road)
- RED has 4 victory points (2 settlements + 1 city)
- I have resources: 4 🌲WOOD, 1 🌾WHEAT, 1 ⛏️ORE
- The robber is on the brick hex (1, -1, 0) with value 6

## Resource Analysis
Looking at my settlements:
- Node 17: produces 🌲WOOD (6 and 8), ⛏️ORE (5)
- Node 9: produces 🧱BRICK (6 - currently blocked by robber), 🌾WHEAT (2), 🐑SHEEP (9)

I'm currently missing sheep and brick (with brick production blocked by the robber).

## Plan Assessment
My current plan involves:
1. Using 4:1 trade to get wheat (but I already have 1 wheat)
2. Working toward securing the ore port
3. Getting wood+brick for roads
4. Saving for city upgrades
5. Victory path: 2-3 cities + 2 settlements + longest road

## Possible Actions
- [0] End turn (no build)
- [1-4] Trade 4 wood for sheep/ore/wheat/brick

## Decision Making
I have 4 wood, 1 wheat, and 1 ore. With my current resources:
- I need 2 ore + 3 wheat for a city (short 1 ore, 2 wheat)
- I need 1 brick + 1 wood for a road (short 1 brick)
- I need 1 wheat + 1 sheep + 1 ore for a development card (short 1 sheep)

Since I can only make one 4:1 trade this turn, I should prioritize getting a resource I don't have and that helps me toward my immediate goals.

My best immediate build would be a road (needing brick) or a development card (needing sheep). A development card could give me a knight (helping toward largest army), a VP, or a special card that could be useful.

<plan>
1. Trade for brick this turn to build a road next turn
2. Continue expanding toward the ore port (2:1) for more efficient trading
3. Next focus on getting sheep+wheat+ore for development cards
4. Work toward city upgrades when possible (ore+wheat)
5. Victory path: 2-3 cities (4-6VP) + 2 settlements (2VP) + longest road (2VP) = 8-10VP
</plan>

The best choice is to trade for brick, enabling road building on my next turn to continue my expansion toward the ore port.

- When development cards are your path to victory, aim for: 3 cities (6 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 victory cards (2 VP)
- Consider buying development cards when you have limited build options (blocked roads, etc.)

OPTIMAL EXPANSION PATH:
- Build roads with PURPOSE - every road should lead to a viable settlement location
- Identify and secure "bottleneck" positions that cut off opponents' expansion
- Expand toward resources you LACK from initial placement - seek balance
- When choosing between multiple settlement spots, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (total pip count)
  2. Access to resources you currently lack
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, securing future expansion)
  4. Proximity to useful ports
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Longest road (2 VP) requires strategic planning - only pursue if you already have 4+ roads built

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- When someone has 8+ points, ALWAYS target them with the robber regardless of other factors
- If you're being targeted by the robber, consider using knight cards immediately to protect production

TURN-BY-TURN PLANNING:
1. Start each turn by assessing your current VP and opponents' VPs (both visible and potential hidden points)
2. Identify your build priority for this turn: settlement, city, road, or development card?
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for your priority build
4. If you can't build your priority item, determine if trading or buying a development card is better
5. Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card or trade for needed resources
6. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

WINNING PATHS:
1. CITY-FOCUSED PATH: 3-4 cities (6-8 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 9-11 VP
2. BALANCED PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 VP card = 10 VP
3. DEVELOPMENT PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP

NEVER SAY NO TO FREE VPs:
- Always account for the 2 VP from longest road and largest army in your plans
- These special cards are EASY to lose if you're not defending them
- Invest in roads/knights to maintain your lead if these VPs are part of your strategy
- Be alert for opponents trying to steal these bonus points

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 35 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Trade for brick this turn to build a road next turn
2. Continue expanding toward the ore port (2:1) for more efficient trading
3. Next focus on getting sheep+wheat+ore for development cards
4. Work toward city upgrades when possible (ore+wheat)
5. Victory path: 2-3 cities (4-6VP) + 2 settlements (2VP) + longest road (2VP) = 8-10VP

# Game Analysis for Blue Player

I need to carefully analyze the current game state and available options to choose the best action for this turn.

## Current Situation Assessment:
- I have 4/10 victory points (2 settlements + longest road bonus)
- Resources: 1 Wood, 1 Brick, 1 Sheep, 1 Wheat, 1 Ore - I have exactly one of each resource
- Red has 4 VP as well (2 settlements + 1 city)
- I have longest road (6 segments) giving me +2 VP
- I've already played 1 knight card

## Available Actions:
1. Build a road (Actions 1-10)
2. Build a settlement (Actions 11-14)
3. Buy a development card (Action 15)
4. End turn (Action 0)

## Analyzing Settlement Options:
- Node 40: Connects to ⛏️5 and 🧱11 
- Node 44: Connects to 🧱11, at the 2:1 ore port
- Nodes 41-42: Less attractive resource options

The most promising settlement location is node 44, as it would give me access to the 2:1 ore port which aligns with my current plan for efficient trading and development card/city strategy.

## Analyzing Development Card Option:
Buying a development card now would use all my remaining resources. It could give me:
- A victory point card (hidden until needed)
- Another knight (working toward largest army)
- Year of Plenty/Monopoly/Road Building (utility)

## Road Building Options:
Building a road would extend my network but wouldn't immediately increase my VP. The most strategic road would be one that leads toward my next settlement location.

## Decision Making:
Since I have exactly one of each resource, I can:
1. Build a settlement at node 44, securing the ore port and gaining 1 VP immediately
2. Buy a development card, which might be a victory point or help toward largest army
3. Build a road to maintain my longest road bonus

The settlement at node 44 is the most valuable immediate play as it:
- Increases my victory points to 5/10
- Gives me access to the crucial 2:1 ore port
- Adds another production point for brick (🧱11)
- Advances my position significantly more than just building a road

<plan>
1. Build settlement at node 44 to secure the ore port and gain 1 VP
2. Use the ore port (2:1) to efficiently trade for resources needed
3. Focus on city upgrades (ore+wheat) as my settlements now provide good resource diversity
4. Build toward largest army with development cards when I have excess resources
5. Victory path: 3 settlements (3VP) + 1-2 cities (2-4VP) + longest road (2VP) + possible VP cards/largest army = 10VP
</plan>

The optimal action is to build a settlement at node 44:

\boxed{14}
========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Target hexes with HIGH probability numbers (6,8,5,9) - prioritize these above all else
- Go for resource DIVERSITY: secure ALL five resources between your two settlements
- Focus on ORE and WHEAT for city upgrades (numbers 5-9 preferred)
- Evaluate each potential settlement by its TOTAL PIP COUNT (sum of probability dots)
- Place your initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Avoid placing both settlements near the same resources - diversify your income!
- Always consider 3:1 ports if your initial placement gives you limited access to certain resources
- Place roads in directions that block opponents' expansion routes

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT & CITY BUILDING PRIORITY:
- FIRST PRIORITY: Build 1-2 additional settlements early to secure critical resources you lack
- SECOND PRIORITY: Upgrade to cities as quickly as possible to double resource production
- THIRD PRIORITY: Build roads only when they lead directly to valuable settlement locations
- Early game (1-5 turns): Secure key settlements at high-value locations
- Mid-game (6-15 turns): Focus heavily on upgrading to cities (2-3 cities should be your target)
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road
- When short on a key resource, use 2:1 ports if available before using 3:1 or 4:1 ports
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat to other players unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- If you have excess of a resource, use ports rather than trading with opponents

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards primarily when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber OR to reach Largest Army (3+ knights)
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city or settlement build
- Use Monopoly cards after high-probability dice rolls to collect maximum resources
- Keep track of how many VP cards you've drawn (5 in the deck total)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn
- When development cards are your path to victory, aim for: 3 cities (6 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 victory cards (2 VP)
- Consider buying development cards when you have limited build options (blocked roads, etc.)

OPTIMAL EXPANSION PATH:
- Build roads with PURPOSE - every road should lead to a viable settlement location
- Identify and secure "bottleneck" positions that cut off opponents' expansion
- Expand toward resources you LACK from initial placement - seek balance
- When choosing between multiple settlement spots, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (total pip count)
  2. Access to resources you currently lack
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, securing future expansion)
  4. Proximity to useful ports
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Longest road (2 VP) requires strategic planning - only pursue if you already have 4+ roads built

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- When someone has 8+ points, ALWAYS target them with the robber regardless of other factors
- If you're being targeted by the robber, consider using knight cards immediately to protect production

TURN-BY-TURN PLANNING:
1. Start each turn by assessing your current VP and opponents' VPs (both visible and potential hidden points)
2. Identify your build priority for this turn: settlement, city, road, or development card?
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for your priority build
4. If you can't build your priority item, determine if trading or buying a development card is better
5. Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card or trade for needed resources
6. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

WINNING PATHS:
1. CITY-FOCUSED PATH: 3-4 cities (6-8 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 9-11 VP
2. BALANCED PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 VP card = 10 VP
3. DEVELOPMENT PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP

NEVER SAY NO TO FREE VPs:
- Always account for the 2 VP from longest road and largest army in your plans
- These special cards are EASY to lose if you're not defending them
- Invest in roads/knights to maintain your lead if these VPs are part of your strategy
- Be alert for opponents trying to steal these bonus points

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

4. Build toward largest army with development cards when I have excess resources
5. Victory path: 3 settlements (3VP) + 1-2 cities (2-4VP) + longest road (2VP) + possible VP cards/largest army = 10VP

# Robber Placement Analysis

I need to analyze the best location to place the robber to optimize my position while hindering RED player, who is my main opponent.

## Game State Analysis
- I have 5/10 VP (3 settlements + longest road)
- RED has 4/10 VP (2 settlements + 1 city)
- I need to optimize my resource generation while disrupting RED's production

## Strategic considerations:
1. Target RED's highest production hexes
2. Prioritize resources RED needs for their likely next moves
3. Consider protecting my key resource hexes
4. Focus on hexes with high probability numbers

## RED's Building Locations:
- RED has a settlement at node 1 (produces: 🌲4[⭐], 🧱6[⭐⭐⭐], 🐑4[⭐])
- RED has a settlement at node 22 (produces: 🐑4[⭐], ⛏️11[⭐], 🌾5[⭐⭐])
- RED has a city at node 5 (produces: 🌲4[⭐], 🌲8[⭐⭐⭐], ⛏️3[⭐])

## Analyzing High-Value Targets:
- 🧱6 (1, -1, 0): High-probability brick for RED's settlement at node 1
- 🌲8 (-1, 1, 0): High-probability wood for RED's city at node 5
- 🌾5 (2, 0, -2): Moderate-probability wheat for RED's settlement at node 22

Targeting 🌲8 (option 4) would be highly effective because:
1. It's a high-probability number (8 has 5 dots)
2. It's produced at double rate since RED has a city there
3. Wood is critical for RED to build roads for expansion
4. I would also steal a card from RED, potentially getting a valuable resource

<plan>
1. Move robber to high-value 🌲8 hex to block RED's city production
2. Continue working toward building a city at node 17 (with 🌲8, 🌲6, ⛏️5)
3. Use the ore port (2:1) to efficiently trade excess ore
4. Consider development cards when I have excess sheep+wheat+ore
5. Victory path: 3 settlements (3VP) + 1-2 cities (2-4VP) + longest road (2VP) = 10VP
</plan>

Therefore, I should choose action [4] to move the robber to (-1, 1, 0) and steal from RED.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Target hexes with HIGH probability numbers (6,8,5,9) - prioritize these above all else
- Go for resource DIVERSITY: secure ALL five resources between your two settlements
- Focus on ORE and WHEAT for city upgrades (numbers 5-9 preferred)
- Evaluate each potential settlement by its TOTAL PIP COUNT (sum of probability dots)
- Place your initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Avoid placing both settlements near the same resources - diversify your income!
- Always consider 3:1 ports if your initial placement gives you limited access to certain resources
- Place roads in directions that block opponents' expansion routes

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT & CITY BUILDING PRIORITY:
- FIRST PRIORITY: Build 1-2 additional settlements early to secure critical resources you lack
- SECOND PRIORITY: Upgrade to cities as quickly as possible to double resource production
- THIRD PRIORITY: Build roads only when they lead directly to valuable settlement locations
- Early game (1-5 turns): Secure key settlements at high-value locations
- Mid-game (6-15 turns): Focus heavily on upgrading to cities (2-3 cities should be your target)
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road
- When short on a key resource, use 2:1 ports if available before using 3:1 or 4:1 ports
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat to other players unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- If you have excess of a resource, use ports rather than trading with opponents

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards primarily when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber OR to reach Largest Army (3+ knights)
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city or settlement build
- Use Monopoly cards after high-probability dice rolls to collect maximum resources
- Keep track of how many VP cards you've drawn (5 in the deck total)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn
- When development cards are your path to victory, aim for: 3 cities (6 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 victory cards (2 VP)
- Consider buying development cards when you have limited build options (blocked roads, etc.)

OPTIMAL EXPANSION PATH:
- Build roads with PURPOSE - every road should lead to a viable settlement location
- Identify and secure "bottleneck" positions that cut off opponents' expansion
- Expand toward resources you LACK from initial placement - seek balance
- When choosing between multiple settlement spots, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (total pip count)
  2. Access to resources you currently lack
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, securing future expansion)
  4. Proximity to useful ports
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Longest road (2 VP) requires strategic planning - only pursue if you already have 4+ roads built

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- When someone has 8+ points, ALWAYS target them with the robber regardless of other factors
- If you're being targeted by the robber, consider using knight cards immediately to protect production

TURN-BY-TURN PLANNING:
1. Start each turn by assessing your current VP and opponents' VPs (both visible and potential hidden points)
2. Identify your build priority for this turn: settlement, city, road, or development card?
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for your priority build
4. If you can't build your priority item, determine if trading or buying a development card is better
5. Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card or trade for needed resources
6. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

WINNING PATHS:
1. CITY-FOCUSED PATH: 3-4 cities (6-8 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 9-11 VP
2. BALANCED PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 VP card = 10 VP
3. DEVELOPMENT PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP

NEVER SAY NO TO FREE VPs:
- Always account for the 2 VP from longest road and largest army in your plans
- These special cards are EASY to lose if you're not defending them
- Invest in roads/knights to maintain your lead if these VPs are part of your strategy
- Be alert for opponents trying to steal these bonus points

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

RESPONSE:
# Strategic Analysis for Robber Movement

I'll analyze the best spot to place the robber by examining:
1. High-value hexes that RED depends on
2. Hexes that could help me block important resources
3. Opportunities to steal valuable resources from RED

## Resource Production Analysis:
RED's most valuable productions:
- 🧱6 (3 pips) at node 1
- 🌲8 (3 pips) at node 5 (city, so double production)
- 🌾5 (2 pips) at node 22

## Current Game State:
- I have 5 VP (3 settlements + longest road)
- RED has 4 VP (2 settlements + 1 city)
- I need to prioritize getting resources for my next city upgrade, ideally at node 17 (high-value spot)

## Best Robber Placements:
- Option 1: Move to (1,-1,0) [🧱6] to block RED's brick production at node 1
- Option 0: Move to (0,0,0) [🌲4] to block RED's wood production at nodes 1 and 5
- Option 15: Move to (1,1,-2) [⛏️11] to block RED's ore at node 22
- Option 16: Move to (2,0,-2) [🌾5] to block RED's wheat at node 22

Blocking 🧱6 (option 1) would stop RED from getting the critical brick needed for expansion. Additionally, this is a high-probability roll (6) that RED relies on for a key resource.

Option 0 would block 🌲4, but this is a lower probability number.

Option 16 would block 🌾5 (wheat), which would slow RED's city development.

Given that RED likely wants to expand their road network to regain longest road from me, blocking their brick production is the most strategic move.

<plan>
1. Block RED's brick production to slow their expansion
2. Continue working toward building a city at node 17 (with 🌲8, 🌲6, ⛏️5)
3. Use the ore port (2:1) to efficiently trade excess ore for other needed resources
4. Consider development cards when I have excess sheep+wheat+ore
5. Victory path: 3 settlements (3VP) + 1-2 cities (2-4VP) + longest road (2VP) + potential development card VP = 10VP
</plan>

# Game State Analysis

Let me analyze the current state to determine my best move:

## Victory Points
- I have 5 VP (3 settlements + 2 VP for longest road)
- RED has 4 VP (2 settlements + 1 city)
- I need 5 more VP to win

## Resource Assessment
Current resources: 2 🌲WOOD, 1 🌾WHEAT, 2 ⛏️ORE
Looking at my plan, I want to build a city at node 17, which requires:
- 3 ORE (I have 2)
- 2 WHEAT (I have 1)

I'm short 1 ORE and 1 WHEAT to build a city.

## Available Actions
My options:
- End turn
- Trade at port: I have access to a 2:1 ORE port, but I need ORE, not trade it away
- None of the maritime trade options make sense as I'd be trading away my valuable ORE to get other resources

## Strategic Considerations
1. I'm closer to victory than RED (5 VP vs 4 VP)
2. I have longest road (2 VP bonus) which is critical to maintain
3. My current priority is upgrading to a city at node 17
4. I don't have enough resources for any meaningful build this turn
5. Trading at the port would be counterproductive as I need to accumulate ORE, not trade it

## Decision Logic
Since I can't build a city this turn and don't have enough resources for any other meaningful action, and the trade options would set me back rather than help me progress toward my goal, the best move is to end my turn and hope for better dice rolls next time.

<plan>
1. Continue accumulating resources for a city at node 17 (need 1 more ORE and 1 more WHEAT)
2. Maintain longest road advantage
3. Consider buying development cards if I get excess sheep+wheat+ore
4. Block RED's brick production with the robber when opportunity arises
5. Victory path remains: 3 settlements (3VP) + 1-2 cities (2-4VP) + longest road (2VP) + potential development card VP = 10VP
</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Target hexes with HIGH probability numbers (6,8,5,9) - prioritize these above all else
- Go for resource DIVERSITY: secure ALL five resources between your two settlements
- Focus on ORE and WHEAT for city upgrades (numbers 5-9 preferred)
- Evaluate each potential settlement by its TOTAL PIP COUNT (sum of probability dots)
- Place your initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Avoid placing both settlements near the same resources - diversify your income!
- Always consider 3:1 ports if your initial placement gives you limited access to certain resources
- Place roads in directions that block opponents' expansion routes

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT & CITY BUILDING PRIORITY:
- FIRST PRIORITY: Build 1-2 additional settlements early to secure critical resources you lack
- SECOND PRIORITY: Upgrade to cities as quickly as possible to double resource production
- THIRD PRIORITY: Build roads only when they lead directly to valuable settlement locations
- Early game (1-5 turns): Secure key settlements at high-value locations
- Mid-game (6-15 turns): Focus heavily on upgrading to cities (2-3 cities should be your target)
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road
- When short on a key resource, use 2:1 ports if available before using 3:1 or 4:1 ports
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat to other players unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- If you have excess of a resource, use ports rather than trading with opponents

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards primarily when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber OR to reach Largest Army (3+ knights)
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city or settlement build
- Use Monopoly cards after high-probability dice rolls to collect maximum resources
- Keep track of how many VP cards you've drawn (5 in the deck total)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn
- When development cards are your path to victory, aim for: 3 cities (6 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 victory cards (2 VP)
- Consider buying development cards when you have limited build options (blocked roads, etc.)

OPTIMAL EXPANSION PATH:
- Build roads with PURPOSE - every road should lead to a viable settlement location
- Identify and secure "bottleneck" positions that cut off opponents' expansion
- Expand toward resources you LACK from initial placement - seek balance
- When choosing between multiple settlement spots, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (total pip count)
  2. Access to resources you currently lack
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, securing future expansion)
  4. Proximity to useful ports
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Longest road (2 VP) requires strategic planning - only pursue if you already have 4+ roads built

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- When someone has 8+ points, ALWAYS target them with the robber regardless of other factors
- If you're being targeted by the robber, consider using knight cards immediately to protect production

TURN-BY-TURN PLANNING:
1. Start each turn by assessing your current VP and opponents' VPs (both visible and potential hidden points)
2. Identify your build priority for this turn: settlement, city, road, or development card?
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for your priority build
4. If you can't build your priority item, determine if trading or buying a development card is better
5. Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card or trade for needed resources
6. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

WINNING PATHS:
1. CITY-FOCUSED PATH: 3-4 cities (6-8 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 9-11 VP
2. BALANCED PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 VP card = 10 VP
3. DEVELOPMENT PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP

NEVER SAY NO TO FREE VPs:
- Always account for the 2 VP from longest road and largest army in your plans
- These special cards are EASY to lose if you're not defending them
- Invest in roads/knights to maintain your lead if these VPs are part of your strategy
- Be alert for opponents trying to steal these bonus points

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 45 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Continue accumulating resources for a city at node 17 (need 1 more ORE and 1 more WHEAT)
2. Maintain longest road advantage
3. Consider buying development cards if I get excess sheep+wheat+ore
4. Block RED's brick production with the robber when opportunity arises
5. Victory path remains: 3 settlements (3VP) + 1-2 cities (2-4VP) + longest road (2VP) + potential development card VP = 10VP

# Game Analysis for Settlers of Catan (Turn 45)

Let me analyze the current game state and determine the optimal action to take.

## Current Game Status
- I (BLUE) have 5/10 victory points:
  - 3 VP from settlements
  - 2 VP from longest road
- I have 2 WOOD, 1 WHEAT, and 4 ORE resources
- RED has 4 VP and 5 hidden cards

## Resource Analysis
For a city upgrade at node 17, I need:
- 3 ORE (I have 4) ✓
- 2 WHEAT (I have 1) ✗ - Need 1 more WHEAT

## Port Access
I have access to a 2:1 ORE port (nodes 40, 44), which allows me to trade 2 ORE for 1 of any other resource.

## Available Actions
- [0] End turn
- [1-4] Use port to trade for various resources

## Decision Analysis
My current plan is to build a city at node 17, which would give me 2 more VP (reaching 7/10). I have enough ORE but need 1 more WHEAT.

Looking at the available actions, action [4] lets me trade 2 ORE for 1 WHEAT, which would give me exactly what I need to build a city. This is clearly the optimal move as it directly advances my victory plan.

After this trade, I'll have:
- 2 WOOD, 2 WHEAT, 2 ORE
- Enough resources to build a city (3 ORE, 2 WHEAT)

<plan>
1. Trade 2 ORE for 1 WHEAT using the port
2. Build a city at node 17 (this will give me 2 more VP, reaching 7/10)
3. Continue working toward 10 VP through: 
   - 3 settlements (3 VP) + 1 city (2 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + potentially buying development cards for VP = 10 VP
4. Watch for RED's expansion and protect longest road advantage
</plan>

The optimal action is to trade for WHEAT using my port access:

RESPONSE:
I'll analyze the current game state and available options carefully.

## Game Analysis

Current VP: 5/10 (3 settlements + longest road bonus)
Resources: 2 WOOD, 2 WHEAT, 2 ORE

My current plan involves upgrading a settlement to a city at node 17. Let's check what I need:
- City upgrade requires: 3 ORE + 2 WHEAT
- I have: 2 ORE + 2 WHEAT

I'm short 1 ORE to build a city. Looking at my available actions, I can:
1. End turn (action 0)
2. Trade using ports (actions 1-4)

Specifically, action 4 allows me to trade 2 ORE for 1 WHEAT at my ore port. However, this trade doesn't make sense because:
1. I already have 2 WHEAT, which is exactly what I need for a city
2. I'm short on ORE, so trading away ORE would move me further from my goal

None of the port trades (1-4) help me get the additional ORE I need. Since I can't make any beneficial build or trade this turn, the optimal move is to end my turn and collect more resources.

<plan>
1. End turn and wait to collect more ORE (1 more needed)
2. Build a city at node 17 once I have 3 ORE + 2 WHEAT
3. Continue focusing on settlements at strategic locations
4. Maintain longest road advantage for 2 VP
5. Consider development cards if excess resources accumulate
</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Target hexes with HIGH probability numbers (6,8,5,9) - prioritize these above all else
- Go for resource DIVERSITY: secure ALL five resources between your two settlements
- Focus on ORE and WHEAT for city upgrades (numbers 5-9 preferred)
- Evaluate each potential settlement by its TOTAL PIP COUNT (sum of probability dots)
- Place your initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Avoid placing both settlements near the same resources - diversify your income!
- Always consider 3:1 ports if your initial placement gives you limited access to certain resources
- Place roads in directions that block opponents' expansion routes

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT & CITY BUILDING PRIORITY:
- FIRST PRIORITY: Build 1-2 additional settlements early to secure critical resources you lack
- SECOND PRIORITY: Upgrade to cities as quickly as possible to double resource production
- THIRD PRIORITY: Build roads only when they lead directly to valuable settlement locations
- Early game (1-5 turns): Secure key settlements at high-value locations
- Mid-game (6-15 turns): Focus heavily on upgrading to cities (2-3 cities should be your target)
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road
- When short on a key resource, use 2:1 ports if available before using 3:1 or 4:1 ports
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat to other players unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- If you have excess of a resource, use ports rather than trading with opponents

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards primarily when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber OR to reach Largest Army (3+ knights)
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city or settlement build
- Use Monopoly cards after high-probability dice rolls to collect maximum resources
- Keep track of how many VP cards you've drawn (5 in the deck total)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn
- When development cards are your path to victory, aim for: 3 cities (6 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 victory cards (2 VP)
- Consider buying development cards when you have limited build options (blocked roads, etc.)

OPTIMAL EXPANSION PATH:
- Build roads with PURPOSE - every road should lead to a viable settlement location
- Identify and secure "bottleneck" positions that cut off opponents' expansion
- Expand toward resources you LACK from initial placement - seek balance
- When choosing between multiple settlement spots, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (total pip count)
  2. Access to resources you currently lack
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, securing future expansion)
  4. Proximity to useful ports
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Longest road (2 VP) requires strategic planning - only pursue if you already have 4+ roads built

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- When someone has 8+ points, ALWAYS target them with the robber regardless of other factors
- If you're being targeted by the robber, consider using knight cards immediately to protect production

TURN-BY-TURN PLANNING:
1. Start each turn by assessing your current VP and opponents' VPs (both visible and potential hidden points)
2. Identify your build priority for this turn: settlement, city, road, or development card?
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for your priority build
4. If you can't build your priority item, determine if trading or buying a development card is better
5. Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card or trade for needed resources
6. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

WINNING PATHS:
1. CITY-FOCUSED PATH: 3-4 cities (6-8 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 9-11 VP
2. BALANCED PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 VP card = 10 VP
3. DEVELOPMENT PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP

NEVER SAY NO TO FREE VPs:
- Always account for the 2 VP from longest road and largest army in your plans
- These special cards are EASY to lose if you're not defending them
- Invest in roads/knights to maintain your lead if these VPs are part of your strategy
- Be alert for opponents trying to steal these bonus points

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game Analysis for Blue Player

## Current Game State Assessment
- I have 5/10 victory points (3 settlements + longest road bonus)
- Resources: 3 Wood, 2 Wheat, 2 Ore
- I need 5 more victory points to win
- My main production hexes are Wood (8, 6), Brick (6, 11), Sheep (9), and Ore (5)

## Resource Analysis
- I have Wood (3), Wheat (2), and Ore (2)
- I'm missing Brick and Sheep for potential settlements
- For a city upgrade at node 17, I need 3 Ore (have 2) and 2 Wheat (have 2)

## Strategic Options

### Option: End Turn
If I end my turn, I'll wait to collect the additional Ore I need to build my city. With the robber on the Brick 6 hex, I'm not losing much production by ending my turn. This aligns with my current plan of upgrading to a city at node 17 once I have sufficient resources.

### Option: Maritime Trade
The trade options available are all using my "None" port, which means they're likely 3:1 or 4:1 trades. These are inefficient trades, especially since I already have the key resources I need (Wood, Wheat) and am just short on Ore.

## Decision Logic
1. I'm just 1 Ore short of being able to build a city at node 17
2. Ore (5) is one of my productive hexes, so I have a good chance of getting it on future rolls
3. None of the maritime trade options help me get more Ore efficiently
4. I have the longest road advantage (2 VP), which is secure for now
5. Maintaining my resources is better than making inefficient trades

<plan>
1. End turn to wait for the additional Ore I need
2. Build a city at node 17 once I have 3 Ore + 2 Wheat (currently have 2 Ore + 2 Wheat)
3. After city upgrade, focus on strategic settlement placement for more resource diversity
4. Maintain longest road advantage
5. Consider development cards if excess resources accumulate
</plan>

Based on this analysis, the optimal move is to end my turn and wait for additional resources through dice rolls rather than making inefficient trades.

# Game Analysis for Settlers of Catan

Let me analyze my current position and available actions:

## Current Situation
- I have 5 victory points (3 settlements + longest road bonus)
- Resources: 3 Wood, 2 Wheat, 2 Ore
- My plan indicates I need 3 Ore + 2 Wheat to upgrade a settlement to a city

## Resource Analysis
- I need 1 more Ore to build a city at node 17
- I have good Wood production but currently no way to trade it effectively
- None of the listed maritime trade options help me get more Ore

## Available Actions
- [0] End Turn
- [1-4] Various maritime trades, none of which give me Ore

## Strategic Considerations
1. I can't currently build anything meaningful with my existing resources
2. None of the maritime trades help me acquire the Ore I need
3. My planned city upgrade at node 17 is still the correct priority
4. I'm only 1 Ore away from being able to build a city

Looking at the trades, I notice that while I have access to a 2:1 Ore port (nodes 40, 44), there's oddly no option to trade for Ore in the listed actions. This means I can't acquire Ore through trading right now.

Since I'm close to having enough resources for a city upgrade (just need 1 more Ore), and none of the available actions help me achieve this goal, the logical choice is to end my turn and hope to get the needed Ore on the next dice roll.

<plan>
1. End turn to collect more resources
2. Build a city at node 17 once I have 3 Ore + 2 Wheat (currently have 2 Ore + 2 Wheat)
3. After city upgrade, target strategic settlement locations for more resource diversity
4. Maintain longest road advantage
5. Consider development cards if excess resources accumulate
</plan>

Based on this analysis, I choose to:

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Target hexes with HIGH probability numbers (6,8,5,9) - prioritize these above all else
- Go for resource DIVERSITY: secure ALL five resources between your two settlements
- Focus on ORE and WHEAT for city upgrades (numbers 5-9 preferred)
- Evaluate each potential settlement by its TOTAL PIP COUNT (sum of probability dots)
- Place your initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Avoid placing both settlements near the same resources - diversify your income!
- Always consider 3:1 ports if your initial placement gives you limited access to certain resources
- Place roads in directions that block opponents' expansion routes

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT & CITY BUILDING PRIORITY:
- FIRST PRIORITY: Build 1-2 additional settlements early to secure critical resources you lack
- SECOND PRIORITY: Upgrade to cities as quickly as possible to double resource production
- THIRD PRIORITY: Build roads only when they lead directly to valuable settlement locations
- Early game (1-5 turns): Secure key settlements at high-value locations
- Mid-game (6-15 turns): Focus heavily on upgrading to cities (2-3 cities should be your target)
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road
- When short on a key resource, use 2:1 ports if available before using 3:1 or 4:1 ports
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat to other players unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- If you have excess of a resource, use ports rather than trading with opponents

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards primarily when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber OR to reach Largest Army (3+ knights)
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city or settlement build
- Use Monopoly cards after high-probability dice rolls to collect maximum resources
- Keep track of how many VP cards you've drawn (5 in the deck total)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn
- When development cards are your path to victory, aim for: 3 cities (6 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 victory cards (2 VP)
- Consider buying development cards when you have limited build options (blocked roads, etc.)

OPTIMAL EXPANSION PATH:
- Build roads with PURPOSE - every road should lead to a viable settlement location
- Identify and secure "bottleneck" positions that cut off opponents' expansion
- Expand toward resources you LACK from initial placement - seek balance
- When choosing between multiple settlement spots, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (total pip count)
  2. Access to resources you currently lack
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, securing future expansion)
  4. Proximity to useful ports
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Longest road (2 VP) requires strategic planning - only pursue if you already have 4+ roads built

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- When someone has 8+ points, ALWAYS target them with the robber regardless of other factors
- If you're being targeted by the robber, consider using knight cards immediately to protect production

TURN-BY-TURN PLANNING:
1. Start each turn by assessing your current VP and opponents' VPs (both visible and potential hidden points)
2. Identify your build priority for this turn: settlement, city, road, or development card?
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for your priority build
4. If you can't build your priority item, determine if trading or buying a development card is better
5. Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card or trade for needed resources
6. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

WINNING PATHS:
1. CITY-FOCUSED PATH: 3-4 cities (6-8 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 9-11 VP
2. BALANCED PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 VP card = 10 VP
3. DEVELOPMENT PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP

NEVER SAY NO TO FREE VPs:
- Always account for the 2 VP from longest road and largest army in your plans
- These special cards are EASY to lose if you're not defending them
- Invest in roads/knights to maintain your lead if these VPs are part of your strategy
- Be alert for opponents trying to steal these bonus points

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game State Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state and determine the optimal action:

## Current Position
- I have 5 VP (3 settlements + Longest Road bonus)
- I have 3 Wood, 1 Sheep, 2 Wheat, 2 Ore
- I need 5 more VP to win (10 total)
- RED also has 5 VP (3 settlements + 1 city)

## My Resources & Needs
For city upgrade at node 17, I need:
- 3 Ore (have 2) → need 1 more Ore
- 2 Wheat (have 2) → have enough

## Available Actions
0. End turn
1. Buy development card (costs 1 Sheep, 1 Wheat, 1 Ore)
2-5. Various maritime trades (at 2:1 rates for ports)

## Decision Analysis
1. **City Upgrade Strategy**: I'm just 1 Ore short of upgrading my settlement at node 17 to a city. This would give me +1 VP and double my production on a strong node (8,6,5 numbers).

2. **Development Card Option**: I could buy a dev card using 1 Sheep, 1 Wheat, 1 Ore, but this:
   - Reduces my Ore (delaying city upgrade)
   - Has uncertain value (could be Victory Point, Knight, etc.)
   - Would leave me with 3 Wood, 0 Sheep, 1 Wheat, 1 Ore

3. **End Turn**: If I end my turn, I might collect more resources on the next roll:
   - My settlements produce from 8, 6, 5, 11, 9, 2 (strong probability)
   - I have a good chance of getting the Ore I need in the next turn
   - All my current resources will be preserved

4. **Trade Options**: I don't have enough matching resources to make any of the offered port trades.

## Strategic Decision
The optimal play is to end my turn (option 0) because:
1. I'm just 1 Ore away from upgrading to a city, which is a priority
2. Trading or buying dev cards would delay this upgrade
3. With my settlements on strong probability numbers, I'm likely to get what I need next roll
4. I maintain Longest Road advantage and am keeping pace with RED

<plan>
1. End turn to collect more resources
2. Build a city at node 17 once I have 3 Ore + 2 Wheat (currently have 2 Ore)
3. After city upgrade, target strategic settlement locations for more resource diversity
4. Maintain longest road advantage
5. Consider development cards if excess resources accumulate

# Robber Placement Analysis

Let me analyze the best hexes to place the robber on to maximize my strategic advantage.

## Current Game State Assessment
- I have 5 VP (3 settlements + 2 for longest road)
- RED also has 5 VP (3 settlements + 1 city)
- I'm currently working toward building a city at node 17
- Need 1 more ORE (have 1, need 2 more) + 1 more WHEAT (have 1, need 1 more) for a city

## Robber Placement Strategy
I should evaluate options based on:
1. Blocking RED's high-value production
2. Targeting resources I need (if RED has them)
3. Minimizing impact to my own production

## Analyzing Hex Options
Looking at RED's production:
- 🌲4 (at nodes 1 and 5) - Option [0]
- 🧱6 (at nodes 1 and 7) - Option [1]
- 🐑4 (at nodes 1 and 22) - Option [6]
- ⛏️11 (at nodes 5 and 22) - Option [15]
- 🌾5 (at node 22) - Option [16]
- 🌲8 (at node 5) - Option [4]
- 🐑8 (at node 7) - Option [7]
- 🧱10 (at node 7) - Option [17]

Most valuable targets:
- 🧱6 is 3 pips and RED has two settlements on it
- 🐑8 is 3 pips
- 🌲8 is 3 pips
- ⛏️11 is 2 pips but could block ore RED might have

## Best Options
1. Option [1]: Block 🧱6 - This is high probability (6) and RED has two settlements on it.
2. Option [7]: Block 🐑8 - Another high probability hex (8) that RED profits from.

Since I need ore for my city, I need to consider if RED might have ore to steal. The ⛏️11 hex at Option [15] is a good target if I suspect RED has ore.

Given that I'm pursuing a city strategy and ORE is my immediate need, Option [15] (placing robber on ⛏️11) seems most aligned with my goals. This blocks RED's ore production and gives me a chance to steal ore directly.

<plan>
1. Move robber to block RED's ore production and try to steal ore
2. Continue working toward building a city at node 17 (need 2 more ore + 1 more wheat)
3. After city upgrade, target strategic settlement locations for more resource diversity
4. Maintain longest road advantage
5. Consider development cards if excess resources accumulate
</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Target hexes with HIGH probability numbers (6,8,5,9) - prioritize these above all else
- Go for resource DIVERSITY: secure ALL five resources between your two settlements
- Focus on ORE and WHEAT for city upgrades (numbers 5-9 preferred)
- Evaluate each potential settlement by its TOTAL PIP COUNT (sum of probability dots)
- Place your initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Avoid placing both settlements near the same resources - diversify your income!
- Always consider 3:1 ports if your initial placement gives you limited access to certain resources
- Place roads in directions that block opponents' expansion routes

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT & CITY BUILDING PRIORITY:
- FIRST PRIORITY: Build 1-2 additional settlements early to secure critical resources you lack
- SECOND PRIORITY: Upgrade to cities as quickly as possible to double resource production
- THIRD PRIORITY: Build roads only when they lead directly to valuable settlement locations
- Early game (1-5 turns): Secure key settlements at high-value locations
- Mid-game (6-15 turns): Focus heavily on upgrading to cities (2-3 cities should be your target)
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road
- When short on a key resource, use 2:1 ports if available before using 3:1 or 4:1 ports
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat to other players unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- If you have excess of a resource, use ports rather than trading with opponents

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards primarily when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber OR to reach Largest Army (3+ knights)
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city or settlement build
- Use Monopoly cards after high-probability dice rolls to collect maximum resources
- Keep track of how many VP cards you've drawn (5 in the deck total)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn
- When development cards are your path to victory, aim for: 3 cities (6 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 victory cards (2 VP)
- Consider buying development cards when you have limited build options (blocked roads, etc.)

OPTIMAL EXPANSION PATH:
- Build roads with PURPOSE - every road should lead to a viable settlement location
- Identify and secure "bottleneck" positions that cut off opponents' expansion
- Expand toward resources you LACK from initial placement - seek balance
- When choosing between multiple settlement spots, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (total pip count)
  2. Access to resources you currently lack
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, securing future expansion)
  4. Proximity to useful ports
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Longest road (2 VP) requires strategic planning - only pursue if you already have 4+ roads built

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- When someone has 8+ points, ALWAYS target them with the robber regardless of other factors
- If you're being targeted by the robber, consider using knight cards immediately to protect production

TURN-BY-TURN PLANNING:
1. Start each turn by assessing your current VP and opponents' VPs (both visible and potential hidden points)
2. Identify your build priority for this turn: settlement, city, road, or development card?
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for your priority build
4. If you can't build your priority item, determine if trading or buying a development card is better
5. Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card or trade for needed resources
6. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

WINNING PATHS:
1. CITY-FOCUSED PATH: 3-4 cities (6-8 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 9-11 VP
2. BALANCED PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 VP card = 10 VP
3. DEVELOPMENT PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP

NEVER SAY NO TO FREE VPs:
- Always account for the 2 VP from longest road and largest army in your plans
- These special cards are EASY to lose if you're not defending them
- Invest in roads/knights to maintain your lead if these VPs are part of your strategy
- Be alert for opponents trying to steal these bonus points

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 53 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Move robber to block RED's ore production and try to steal ore
2. Continue working toward building a city at node 17 (need 2 more ore + 1 more wheat)
3. After city upgrade, target strategic settlement locations for more resource diversity
4. Maintain longest road advantage
5. Consider development cards if excess resources accumulate

# Game Analysis

Let me thoroughly analyze the current game state and available options before making my decision.

## Current Game Status
- **Victory Points**: I have 5/10 VP (3 settlements = 3 VP, Longest Road = 2 VP)
- **Resources**: 1 Wood, 1 Brick, 1 Sheep, 1 Wheat, 2 Ore
- **Victory Points for RED**: 5/10 (3 settlements = 3 VP, 1 city = 2 VP)

## My Plan and Priority Assessment
My current plan involves:
1. Working toward building a city at node 17 (need 2 more ore + 1 more wheat)
2. Targeting strategic settlement locations after city upgrade
3. Maintaining longest road advantage

## Resource Analysis
- For a city upgrade, I need 3 ore + 2 wheat total
- I currently have 2 ore and 1 wheat, so I need 1 more ore and 1 more wheat
- For a new settlement, I have exactly the resources needed (1 wood, 1 brick, 1 wheat, 1 sheep)

## Options Assessment

### Option 0: End Turn
- Not optimal as I have resources to build something.

### Options 1-10: Build Road
- I already have Longest Road (6 segments vs RED's 5)
- Building another road doesn't immediately help me toward my goal of a city
- Would use my wood and brick which could go toward a settlement

### Options 11-12: Build Settlement
- Would give me +1 VP (to reach 6/10 VP)
- Settlement at node 41 would give me access to ore (5 pips)
- Settlement at node 42 doesn't appear to give me good resource access based on info
- Building a settlement now aligns with expanding my resource production

### Option 13: Buy Development Card
- Could yield a Victory Point card, Knight, Year of Plenty, Monopoly, or Road Building
- Knight cards help toward Largest Army (2 VP)
- VP cards are hidden until I win
- Would use my sheep, wheat, and one ore

### Options 14-17: Maritime Trade
- Not optimal as I don't have excess resources to trade

## Decision Logic

Looking at my current plan and resources:
1. I'm aiming for a city at node 17, but I'm missing 1 ore and 1 wheat.
2. Building a settlement now would increase my VP lead and expand resource production.
3. Settlement at node 41 would give me access to ore (5 pips), helping with future city building.
4. Buying a development card could potentially give me a VP or Knight but is less certain.

Building a settlement at node 41 (option 11) seems optimal as it:
- Increases my VP count to 6/10
- Gives me access to more ore production
- Makes progress toward winning
- Creates a more solid board position

<plan>
1. Build settlement at node 41 to increase VP to 6/10 and get ore access
2. Continue working toward city upgrade at node 17 (now need 1 more ore + 1 more wheat)
3. Maintain longest road advantage
4. Consider development cards with excess resources
</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Target hexes with HIGH probability numbers (6,8,5,9) - prioritize these above all else
- Go for resource DIVERSITY: secure ALL five resources between your two settlements
- Focus on ORE and WHEAT for city upgrades (numbers 5-9 preferred)

- NEVER trade away ore or wheat to other players unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- If you have excess of a resource, use ports rather than trading with opponents

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards primarily when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber OR to reach Largest Army (3+ knights)
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city or settlement build
- Use Monopoly cards after high-probability dice rolls to collect maximum resources
- Keep track of how many VP cards you've drawn (5 in the deck total)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn
- When development cards are your path to victory, aim for: 3 cities (6 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 victory cards (2 VP)
- Consider buying development cards when you have limited build options (blocked roads, etc.)

OPTIMAL EXPANSION PATH:
- Build roads with PURPOSE - every road should lead to a viable settlement location

  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, securing future expansion)
  4. Proximity to useful ports
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Longest road (2 VP) requires strategic planning - only pursue if you already have 4+ roads built

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- When someone has 8+ points, ALWAYS target them with the robber regardless of other factors
- If you're being targeted by the robber, consider using knight cards immediately to protect production

TURN-BY-TURN PLANNING:
1. Start each turn by assessing your current VP and opponents' VPs (both visible and potential hidden points)
2. Identify your build priority for this turn: settlement, city, road, or development card?
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for your priority build
4. If you can't build your priority item, determine if trading or buying a development card is better
5. Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card or trade for needed resources
6. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

WINNING PATHS:
1. CITY-FOCUSED PATH: 3-4 cities (6-8 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 9-11 VP
2. BALANCED PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 VP card = 10 VP
3. DEVELOPMENT PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP

NEVER SAY NO TO FREE VPs:
- Always account for the 2 VP from longest road and largest army in your plans
- These special cards are EASY to lose if you're not defending them
- Invest in roads/knights to maintain your lead if these VPs are part of your strategy
- Be alert for opponents trying to steal these bonus points

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 53 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Build settlement at node 41 to increase VP to 6/10 and get ore access
2. Continue working toward city upgrade at node 17 (now need 1 more ore + 1 more wheat)
3. Maintain longest road advantage
4. Consider development cards with excess resources

# Game Analysis for Blue Player

Let me analyze my current game state and options:

## Current Status
- I have 6/10 VP (4 settlements + longest road bonus)
- Resources: 2 Ore
- Robber is on hex (1, 1, -2), which is an Ore-11 hex
- I have Longest Road (6 segments)
- I need to reach 10 victory points to win

## Available Actions
0. End Turn
1-4. Maritime trades using my 2:1 Ore port to get Wood, Sheep, Brick, or Wheat

## Strategic Considerations

1. **Resource Evaluation**: I have 2 Ore cards, which is good since Ore is important for city upgrades. I need 3 Ore and 2 Wheat to upgrade a settlement to a city.

2. **Victory Point Path**: With 6 VP already, I need 4 more. Options:
   - Upgrade 2 settlements to cities (+2 VP)
   - Build 1 more settlement (+1 VP) and upgrade 1 settlement to city (+1 VP)
   - Get largest army (+2 VP) - would need 3 knights
   - Some combination of the above

3. **Resource Needs**: 
   - To upgrade a settlement (e.g., node 17) to a city: Need 1 more Ore + 2 Wheat
   - For development cards: Need Ore, Wheat, and Sheep

Given my current resources and options, I don't have enough resources to build anything this turn. Since I can't do any productive builds with just 2 Ore, and I can trade at 2:1 rate for other resources, let me consider what would be most valuable:

- Wheat would help me work toward a city upgrade
- Brick or Wood could help extend my road network to secure new settlement locations

<plan>
1. End turn to save my 2 Ore for city upgrade at node 17
2. Next turn focus on acquiring 1 more Ore and 2 Wheat to upgrade settlement at node 17 to a city
3. Then aim for either another city upgrade or new settlement plus development cards
4. Continue maintaining longest road advantage
</plan>

Since I can't build anything useful this turn, and trading away my Ore would set back my city upgrade plans, the most strategic move is to end my turn and save resources.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Target hexes with HIGH probability numbers (6,8,5,9) - prioritize these above all else
- Go for resource DIVERSITY: secure ALL five resources between your two settlements
- Focus on ORE and WHEAT for city upgrades (numbers 5-9 preferred)
- Evaluate each potential settlement by its TOTAL PIP COUNT (sum of probability dots)
- Place your initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Avoid placing both settlements near the same resources - diversify your income!
- Always consider 3:1 ports if your initial placement gives you limited access to certain resources
- Place roads in directions that block opponents' expansion routes

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT & CITY BUILDING PRIORITY:
- FIRST PRIORITY: Build 1-2 additional settlements early to secure critical resources you lack
- SECOND PRIORITY: Upgrade to cities as quickly as possible to double resource production
- THIRD PRIORITY: Build roads only when they lead directly to valuable settlement locations
- Early game (1-5 turns): Secure key settlements at high-value locations
- Mid-game (6-15 turns): Focus heavily on upgrading to cities (2-3 cities should be your target)
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road
- When short on a key resource, use 2:1 ports if available before using 3:1 or 4:1 ports
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat to other players unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- If you have excess of a resource, use ports rather than trading with opponents

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards primarily when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber OR to reach Largest Army (3+ knights)
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city or settlement build
- Use Monopoly cards after high-probability dice rolls to collect maximum resources
- Keep track of how many VP cards you've drawn (5 in the deck total)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn
- When development cards are your path to victory, aim for: 3 cities (6 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 victory cards (2 VP)
- Consider buying development cards when you have limited build options (blocked roads, etc.)

OPTIMAL EXPANSION PATH:
- Build roads with PURPOSE - every road should lead to a viable settlement location
- Identify and secure "bottleneck" positions that cut off opponents' expansion
- Expand toward resources you LACK from initial placement - seek balance
- When choosing between multiple settlement spots, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (total pip count)
  2. Access to resources you currently lack
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, securing future expansion)
  4. Proximity to useful ports
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Longest road (2 VP) requires strategic planning - only pursue if you already have 4+ roads built

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- When someone has 8+ points, ALWAYS target them with the robber regardless of other factors
- If you're being targeted by the robber, consider using knight cards immediately to protect production

TURN-BY-TURN PLANNING:
1. Start each turn by assessing your current VP and opponents' VPs (both visible and potential hidden points)
2. Identify your build priority for this turn: settlement, city, road, or development card?
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for your priority build
4. If you can't build your priority item, determine if trading or buying a development card is better
5. Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card or trade for needed resources
6. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

WINNING PATHS:
1. CITY-FOCUSED PATH: 3-4 cities (6-8 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 9-11 VP
2. BALANCED PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 VP card = 10 VP
3. DEVELOPMENT PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP

NEVER SAY NO TO FREE VPs:
- Always account for the 2 VP from longest road and largest army in your plans
- These special cards are EASY to lose if you're not defending them
- Invest in roads/knights to maintain your lead if these VPs are part of your strategy
- Be alert for opponents trying to steal these bonus points

# Game Analysis for Settlers of Catan

I'll analyze the current game state and determine the optimal action.

## Current Situation Assessment:
- I have 6 VP: 4 settlements (4 VP) + Longest Road bonus (2 VP)
- Resources: 1 Wood and 2 Ore
- RED has 5 VP with 3 settlements + 1 city
- I need 4 more VP to win
- Robber is on (1,1,-2), which is an Ore 11 hex

## Victory Path Options:
1. **City Upgrades**: 2 settlements → 2 cities = +2 VP
2. **New Settlement**: Build 1 more settlement = +1 VP
3. **Development Cards**: Potentially get VP cards or largest army

## Available Actions:
- End Turn (0)
- Trade options using ports (1-4)

## Analysis of Actions:
I currently have 1 Wood and 2 Ore. My existing plan was to save resources for a city upgrade at node 17, which requires 3 Ore and 2 Wheat. I already have 2 Ore, so I need 1 more Ore and 2 Wheat.

None of the maritime trade options would directly help me get closer to the city upgrade immediately, as I don't have enough resources to trade efficiently.

**Trading Analysis:**
- Option 1-4: Trading would require 2 resources of the same type, but I only have 1 Wood and 2 Ore. I need to keep my Ore for the city upgrade.

**Strategic Considerations:**
- Ending my turn preserves my 2 Ore for the city upgrade
- I have settlements at good production spots (17, 9, 44, 41)
- I have the longest road (6 segments) giving me 2 VP already

<plan>
1. End turn to preserve my 2 Ore for future city upgrade
2. Next turn, focus on acquiring 1 more Ore and 2 Wheat to upgrade settlement at node 17 to a city
3. Continue maintaining longest road advantage
4. After city upgrade, evaluate whether to build another city or pursue development cards for VP or largest army
</plan>

Given that I can't make any productive trades with my current resources, and I want to save my 2 Ore for the city upgrade, the optimal move is to end my turn.

- When development cards are your path to victory, aim for: 3 cities (6 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 victory cards (2 VP)
- Consider buying development cards when you have limited build options (blocked roads, etc.)

OPTIMAL EXPANSION PATH:
- Build roads with PURPOSE - every road should lead to a viable settlement location
- Identify and secure "bottleneck" positions that cut off opponents' expansion
- Expand toward resources you LACK from initial placement - seek balance
- When choosing between multiple settlement spots, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (total pip count)
  2. Access to resources you currently lack
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, securing future expansion)
  4. Proximity to useful ports
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Longest road (2 VP) requires strategic planning - only pursue if you already have 4+ roads built

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- When someone has 8+ points, ALWAYS target them with the robber regardless of other factors
- If you're being targeted by the robber, consider using knight cards immediately to protect production

TURN-BY-TURN PLANNING:
1. Start each turn by assessing your current VP and opponents' VPs (both visible and potential hidden points)
2. Identify your build priority for this turn: settlement, city, road, or development card?
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for your priority build
4. If you can't build your priority item, determine if trading or buying a development card is better
5. Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card or trade for needed resources
6. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

WINNING PATHS:
1. CITY-FOCUSED PATH: 3-4 cities (6-8 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 9-11 VP
2. BALANCED PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 VP card = 10 VP
3. DEVELOPMENT PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP

NEVER SAY NO TO FREE VPs:
- Always account for the 2 VP from longest road and largest army in your plans
- These special cards are EASY to lose if you're not defending them
- Invest in roads/knights to maintain your lead if these VPs are part of your strategy
- Be alert for opponents trying to steal these bonus points

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

## Analysis of Game State

Let me analyze my current position and the available actions:

**Current Victory Points:** 4/10 VP
- 4 settlements (4 VP)
- No cities (0 VP)
- No longest road or largest army bonuses

**Resources:** 2 Wood, 1 Sheep, 2 Ore
- I need 3 Ore + 2 Wheat for a city upgrade
- I currently have 2 Ore, so I need 1 more Ore and 2 Wheat

**Opponent Status:**
- RED has 7 VP (3 settlements, 1 city, longest road)
- RED is 3 VP ahead and closer to winning
- RED has 3 hidden resource cards

**Ports:**
- I have access to a 2:1 Ore port (nodes 40, 44)
- This could be useful later, but not with my current resources

**Available Actions:**
- End turn [0]
- Trade port options [1-4] - all require resources I don't have

## Decision Process

1. **Can I build anything this turn?** 
   - No, I don't have the resources for any building actions
   - No city (need 3 Ore + 2 Wheat, have 2 Ore)
   - No settlement (need 1 Wood + 1 Brick + 1 Wheat + 1 Sheep, missing Brick and Wheat)
   - No development card (need 1 Ore + 1 Wheat + 1 Sheep, missing Wheat)
   - No additional road (need 1 Wood + 1 Brick, missing Brick)

2. **Should I trade using ports?**
   - The trade options listed are invalid as they require "None" resource
   - Even if they were valid, I wouldn't want to trade away my Ore as I'm saving it for a city

3. **Strategic considerations:**
   - I should preserve my 2 Ore toward the 3 Ore needed for a city
   - Node 17 is a good city upgrade target (produces Wood and Ore)
   - I need to focus on acquiring Wheat next turn

4. **Current plan evaluation:**
   - My current plan to save Ore for a city upgrade is still valid
   - I should end my turn to preserve resources

<plan>
1. End turn to preserve my 2 Ore for future city upgrade
2. Next turn, focus on acquiring 1 more Ore and 2 Wheat to upgrade settlement at node 17 to a city
3. Continue maintaining longest road advantage
4. After city upgrade, evaluate whether to build another city or pursue development cards for VP or largest army
</plan>

Since I cannot make any productive trades or builds this turn, I should end my turn to preserve my valuable Ore for future city upgrades.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Target hexes with HIGH probability numbers (6,8,5,9) - prioritize these above all else
- Go for resource DIVERSITY: secure ALL five resources between your two settlements
- Focus on ORE and WHEAT for city upgrades (numbers 5-9 preferred)
- Evaluate each potential settlement by its TOTAL PIP COUNT (sum of probability dots)
- Place your initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Avoid placing both settlements near the same resources - diversify your income!
- Always consider 3:1 ports if your initial placement gives you limited access to certain resources
- Place roads in directions that block opponents' expansion routes

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT & CITY BUILDING PRIORITY:
- FIRST PRIORITY: Build 1-2 additional settlements early to secure critical resources you lack
- SECOND PRIORITY: Upgrade to cities as quickly as possible to double resource production
- THIRD PRIORITY: Build roads only when they lead directly to valuable settlement locations
- Early game (1-5 turns): Secure key settlements at high-value locations
- Mid-game (6-15 turns): Focus heavily on upgrading to cities (2-3 cities should be your target)
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road
- When short on a key resource, use 2:1 ports if available before using 3:1 or 4:1 ports
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat to other players unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- If you have excess of a resource, use ports rather than trading with opponents

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards primarily when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber OR to reach Largest Army (3+ knights)
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city or settlement build
- Use Monopoly cards after high-probability dice rolls to collect maximum resources
- Keep track of how many VP cards you've drawn (5 in the deck total)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn
- When development cards are your path to victory, aim for: 3 cities (6 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 victory cards (2 VP)
- Consider buying development cards when you have limited build options (blocked roads, etc.)

OPTIMAL EXPANSION PATH:
- Build roads with PURPOSE - every road should lead to a viable settlement location
- Identify and secure "bottleneck" positions that cut off opponents' expansion
- Expand toward resources you LACK from initial placement - seek balance
- When choosing between multiple settlement spots, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (total pip count)
  2. Access to resources you currently lack
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, securing future expansion)
  4. Proximity to useful ports
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Longest road (2 VP) requires strategic planning - only pursue if you already have 4+ roads built

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- When someone has 8+ points, ALWAYS target them with the robber regardless of other factors
- If you're being targeted by the robber, consider using knight cards immediately to protect production

TURN-BY-TURN PLANNING:
1. Start each turn by assessing your current VP and opponents' VPs (both visible and potential hidden points)
2. Identify your build priority for this turn: settlement, city, road, or development card?
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for your priority build
4. If you can't build your priority item, determine if trading or buying a development card is better
5. Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card or trade for needed resources
6. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

WINNING PATHS:
1. CITY-FOCUSED PATH: 3-4 cities (6-8 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 9-11 VP
2. BALANCED PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 VP card = 10 VP
3. DEVELOPMENT PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP

NEVER SAY NO TO FREE VPs:
- Always account for the 2 VP from longest road and largest army in your plans
- These special cards are EASY to lose if you're not defending them
- Invest in roads/knights to maintain your lead if these VPs are part of your strategy
- Be alert for opponents trying to steal these bonus points

# Game Analysis for Blue Player (Turn 59)

Let me assess the current game situation and determine the best move:

## Current Game State
- I have 4 VP (4 settlements)
- Resources: 3 Wood, 1 Brick, 2 Sheep, 2 Ore
- Red has 7 VP (3 settlements, 1 city, longest road)
- Red currently has the longest road (7 segments vs my 6)
- I need 6 more VP to win

## Resource Assessment
- I have 3 Wood, 1 Brick - enough to build 1 road
- I have 2 Ore - need 3 total for a city
- Missing resources: I need Wheat (2) for a city upgrade

## Strategic Options

1. **Build a road**
   - Would use my 1 Wood and 1 Brick
   - Potentially work toward longest road (need 2 more roads to overtake Red)
   - Best road locations would extend toward promising settlement spots or secure longest road

2. **End turn**
   - Preserve my 2 Ore for a city upgrade
   - Need to collect 1 more Ore and 2 Wheat in future turns

3. **Maritime trading**
   - I could trade resources but don't have excess of anything worth trading

## Decision Analysis
Looking at the road options, none seem to immediately lead to a new settlement opportunity or significantly improve my position toward longest road. I need 2 more roads to overtake Red's longest road, but that's not an immediate priority.

My current plan involves upgrading a settlement to a city, which requires 3 Ore and 2 Wheat. I already have 2 Ore, so I'm making progress toward this goal.

Building a road now would deplete my Brick, which might be needed for future expansion. Since I don't see an immediate advantage to building a road this turn, saving resources makes more sense.

<plan>
1. End turn to preserve my resources
2. Focus on acquiring 1 more Ore and 2 Wheat to upgrade a settlement (preferably at node 17) to a city
3. Continue looking for opportunities to extend my road network strategically

Since there are no immediate high-value plays available and I want to save my resources for a city upgrade, I'll end my turn.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Target hexes with HIGH probability numbers (6,8,5,9) - prioritize these above all else
- Go for resource DIVERSITY: secure ALL five resources between your two settlements
- Focus on ORE and WHEAT for city upgrades (numbers 5-9 preferred)
- Evaluate each potential settlement by its TOTAL PIP COUNT (sum of probability dots)
- Place your initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Avoid placing both settlements near the same resources - diversify your income!
- Always consider 3:1 ports if your initial placement gives you limited access to certain resources
- Place roads in directions that block opponents' expansion routes

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT & CITY BUILDING PRIORITY:
- FIRST PRIORITY: Build 1-2 additional settlements early to secure critical resources you lack
- SECOND PRIORITY: Upgrade to cities as quickly as possible to double resource production
- THIRD PRIORITY: Build roads only when they lead directly to valuable settlement locations
- Early game (1-5 turns): Secure key settlements at high-value locations
- Mid-game (6-15 turns): Focus heavily on upgrading to cities (2-3 cities should be your target)
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road
- When short on a key resource, use 2:1 ports if available before using 3:1 or 4:1 ports
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat to other players unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- If you have excess of a resource, use ports rather than trading with opponents

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards primarily when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber OR to reach Largest Army (3+ knights)
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city or settlement build
- Use Monopoly cards after high-probability dice rolls to collect maximum resources
- Keep track of how many VP cards you've drawn (5 in the deck total)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn
- When development cards are your path to victory, aim for: 3 cities (6 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 victory cards (2 VP)
- Consider buying development cards when you have limited build options (blocked roads, etc.)

OPTIMAL EXPANSION PATH:
- Build roads with PURPOSE - every road should lead to a viable settlement location
- Identify and secure "bottleneck" positions that cut off opponents' expansion
- Expand toward resources you LACK from initial placement - seek balance
- When choosing between multiple settlement spots, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (total pip count)
  2. Access to resources you currently lack
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, securing future expansion)
  4. Proximity to useful ports
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Longest road (2 VP) requires strategic planning - only pursue if you already have 4+ roads built

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- When someone has 8+ points, ALWAYS target them with the robber regardless of other factors
- If you're being targeted by the robber, consider using knight cards immediately to protect production

TURN-BY-TURN PLANNING:
1. Start each turn by assessing your current VP and opponents' VPs (both visible and potential hidden points)
2. Identify your build priority for this turn: settlement, city, road, or development card?
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for your priority build
4. If you can't build your priority item, determine if trading or buying a development card is better
5. Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card or trade for needed resources
6. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

WINNING PATHS:
1. CITY-FOCUSED PATH: 3-4 cities (6-8 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 9-11 VP
2. BALANCED PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 VP card = 10 VP
3. DEVELOPMENT PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP

NEVER SAY NO TO FREE VPs:
- Always account for the 2 VP from longest road and largest army in your plans
- These special cards are EASY to lose if you're not defending them
- Invest in roads/knights to maintain your lead if these VPs are part of your strategy
- Be alert for opponents trying to steal these bonus points

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 61 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. End turn to preserve my resources
2. Focus on acquiring 1 more Ore and 2 Wheat to upgrade a settlement (preferably at node 17) to a city
3. Continue looking for opportunities to extend my road network strategically
4. After city upgrade, evaluate whether to build another city or pursue development cards
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.

# Game Analysis for Blue Player

Let me analyze the current game state to determine the optimal move.

## Current Game Status
- I have 4 VP (4 settlements)
- Red has 7 VP (3 settlements, 1 city, longest road bonus)
- I have 4 Wood, 2 Brick, 2 Sheep, 2 Ore
- I need 1 more Ore and 2 Wheat to upgrade a settlement to a city

## Resource Assessment
- I'm missing Wheat for city upgrades
- I have strong Wood production (nodes 17 has Wood 8 and Wood 6)
- I have decent Ore production (nodes 17 and 41 both produce Ore)
- I have access to the 2:1 Ore port at nodes 40, 44

## Options Analysis

1. **Build a Road (Actions 1-10)**
   - I have 4 Wood and 2 Brick, enough for 2 road segments
   - Building roads could help me work toward longest road (need 8+ segments)
   - Currently have 7 roads built with longest path of 6
   - Red has longest road bonus with 7 segments

2. **Maritime Trade (Actions 11-18)**
   - Could trade for Wheat which I need for city upgrades
   - Action 14: Trade at port for Wheat - but which port is this using? The only Wheat port is at nodes 32,33, which I don't have access to.
   - Action 17: Trade for more Sheep - not a priority

3. **End Turn (Action 0)**
   - Preserve resources to build a city next turn if I get Wheat

## Strategic Considerations

Red is at 7 VP and needs 3 more to win. I'm at 4 VP and need 6 more. I need to accelerate my point generation.

I could try to reach longest road (would need 8 roads to surpass Red's 7), which would give me 2 VP. I currently have resources for 2 road segments.

However, upgrading to cities is a more efficient VP strategy. Each city is +1 VP and doubles resource production. With my current resources, I'm close to upgrading (just need 2 Wheat and 1 Ore).

Since I can't build a city this turn (lacking Wheat), I should consider:
1. Building roads toward potential settlement locations and/or to work toward longest road
2. Trading for Wheat to prepare for city upgrade

Looking at my current longest road path of 6 segments, I would need 2 more roads to reach 8 segments and take longest road from Red. This is achievable with my current resources, but I need to ensure the roads connect to my existing longest path.

<plan>
1. Build 2 road segments to extend my longest road path to 8 segments
2. Take longest road bonus (+2 VP) to reach 6 VP
3. On next turn, focus on upgrading a settlement (preferably at node 17) to a city
4. Continue to develop toward 10 victory points through cities and development cards
</plan>

Since I don't have clear information about which edges connect to form my current longest path, I need to make an educated guess. Looking at my settlements and the available road options, I should build roads that are most likely to extend my current longest path.

Action 8 (Build road at edge 17, 18) and Action 10 (Build road at edge 18, 40) seem likely to be connected to my settlement at node 17, which could help extend my longest path.

Since I need to build my longest road, I'll choose to build a road at edge 17, 18.

\boxed{8}
========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Target hexes with HIGH probability numbers (6,8,5,9) - prioritize these above all else
- Go for resource DIVERSITY: secure ALL five resources between your two settlements
- Focus on ORE and WHEAT for city upgrades (numbers 5-9 preferred)
- Evaluate each potential settlement by its TOTAL PIP COUNT (sum of probability dots)
- Place your initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Avoid placing both settlements near the same resources - diversify your income!
- Always consider 3:1 ports if your initial placement gives you limited access to certain resources
- Place roads in directions that block opponents' expansion routes

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT & CITY BUILDING PRIORITY:
- FIRST PRIORITY: Build 1-2 additional settlements early to secure critical resources you lack
- SECOND PRIORITY: Upgrade to cities as quickly as possible to double resource production
- THIRD PRIORITY: Build roads only when they lead directly to valuable settlement locations
- Early game (1-5 turns): Secure key settlements at high-value locations
- Mid-game (6-15 turns): Focus heavily on upgrading to cities (2-3 cities should be your target)
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road
- When short on a key resource, use 2:1 ports if available before using 3:1 or 4:1 ports
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat to other players unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- If you have excess of a resource, use ports rather than trading with opponents

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards primarily when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber OR to reach Largest Army (3+ knights)
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city or settlement build
- Use Monopoly cards after high-probability dice rolls to collect maximum resources
- Keep track of how many VP cards you've drawn (5 in the deck total)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn
- When development cards are your path to victory, aim for: 3 cities (6 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 victory cards (2 VP)
- Consider buying development cards when you have limited build options (blocked roads, etc.)

OPTIMAL EXPANSION PATH:
- Build roads with PURPOSE - every road should lead to a viable settlement location
- Identify and secure "bottleneck" positions that cut off opponents' expansion
- Expand toward resources you LACK from initial placement - seek balance
- When choosing between multiple settlement spots, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (total pip count)
  2. Access to resources you currently lack
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, securing future expansion)
  4. Proximity to useful ports
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Longest road (2 VP) requires strategic planning - only pursue if you already have 4+ roads built

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- When someone has 8+ points, ALWAYS target them with the robber regardless of other factors
- If you're being targeted by the robber, consider using knight cards immediately to protect production

TURN-BY-TURN PLANNING:
1. Start each turn by assessing your current VP and opponents' VPs (both visible and potential hidden points)
2. Identify your build priority for this turn: settlement, city, road, or development card?
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for your priority build
4. If you can't build your priority item, determine if trading or buying a development card is better
5. Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card or trade for needed resources
6. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

WINNING PATHS:
1. CITY-FOCUSED PATH: 3-4 cities (6-8 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 9-11 VP
2. BALANCED PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 VP card = 10 VP
3. DEVELOPMENT PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP

NEVER SAY NO TO FREE VPs:
- Always account for the 2 VP from longest road and largest army in your plans
- These special cards are EASY to lose if you're not defending them
- Invest in roads/knights to maintain your lead if these VPs are part of your strategy
- Be alert for opponents trying to steal these bonus points

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 61 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Build 2 road segments to extend my longest road path to 8 segments
2. Take longest road bonus (+2 VP) to reach 6 VP
3. On next turn, focus on upgrading a settlement (preferably at node 17) to a city
4. Continue to develop toward 10 victory points through cities and development cards
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.

# Game Analysis for Settlers of Catan

## Current Situation Assessment
- I have 4 VP (4 settlements)
- RED has 7 VP (3 settlements, 1 city, longest road bonus)
- I have 3 wood, 1 brick, 2 sheep, 2 ore
- My current longest road is 6 segments (RED has 7)

## Strategic Analysis
My current plan involves building roads to capture longest road to reach 6 VP. This would require building 2 more roads to reach 8 segments total, taking the longest road bonus from RED. I can build one road this turn with my current resources, but I'll need more brick to complete the plan next turn.

## Available Options

1. **Road Building**: I have enough resources (1 wood, 1 brick) to build one road. Looking at the available road options, I need to choose one that extends my longest path.

2. **Maritime Trade**: I could trade for more brick using my 2:1 ore port (since I have access to the ore port at nodes 40, 44), but I don't have enough ore to do this trade.

## Road Building Analysis
To extend my longest road path effectively, I need to identify which road placement would:
1. Extend my current longest path
2. Position me to continue extending on my next turn
3. Potentially block RED's expansion

Looking at the road options, I need to determine which one continues my current longest path. Since the road options aren't described in detail in terms of which connect to my existing path, I'll make a logical inference based on node numbers that my longest path is connected to my settlements.

The most strategic nodes would likely be near my settlements (nodes 17, 9, 44, 41). Options 3, 4, 8, 9, and 10 appear to be near my settlements based on node numbers.

Option 9 (edge 43, 44) connects to my settlement at node 44, which seems like a good continuation of my path.
Option 3 (edge 38, 39) is near my settlement at node 41.

## Decision
I should build a road that extends my longest path, positioning me to capture longest road on my next turn. Based on the node numbers, Option 9 (edge 43, 44) appears to be the most strategic choice as it connects to my settlement at node 44.

<plan>
1. Build road at edge (43, 44) to extend my longest path to 7 segments
2. On next turn, acquire brick (through production or trading) to build another road to reach 8 segments
3. Claim longest road bonus (+2 VP) to reach 6 VP total
4. Continue saving ore and wheat for upgrading a settlement to a city (preferably at node 17)
5. Develop toward 10 victory points through cities and development cards
</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Target hexes with HIGH probability numbers (6,8,5,9) - prioritize these above all else
- Go for resource DIVERSITY: secure ALL five resources between your two settlements
- Focus on ORE and WHEAT for city upgrades (numbers 5-9 preferred)
- Evaluate each potential settlement by its TOTAL PIP COUNT (sum of probability dots)
- Place your initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Avoid placing both settlements near the same resources - diversify your income!
- Always consider 3:1 ports if your initial placement gives you limited access to certain resources
- Place roads in directions that block opponents' expansion routes

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT & CITY BUILDING PRIORITY:
- FIRST PRIORITY: Build 1-2 additional settlements early to secure critical resources you lack
- SECOND PRIORITY: Upgrade to cities as quickly as possible to double resource production
- THIRD PRIORITY: Build roads only when they lead directly to valuable settlement locations
- Early game (1-5 turns): Secure key settlements at high-value locations
- Mid-game (6-15 turns): Focus heavily on upgrading to cities (2-3 cities should be your target)
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road
- When short on a key resource, use 2:1 ports if available before using 3:1 or 4:1 ports
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat to other players unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- If you have excess of a resource, use ports rather than trading with opponents

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards primarily when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber OR to reach Largest Army (3+ knights)
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city or settlement build
- Use Monopoly cards after high-probability dice rolls to collect maximum resources
- Keep track of how many VP cards you've drawn (5 in the deck total)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn
- When development cards are your path to victory, aim for: 3 cities (6 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 victory cards (2 VP)
- Consider buying development cards when you have limited build options (blocked roads, etc.)

OPTIMAL EXPANSION PATH:
- Build roads with PURPOSE - every road should lead to a viable settlement location
- Identify and secure "bottleneck" positions that cut off opponents' expansion
- Expand toward resources you LACK from initial placement - seek balance
- When choosing between multiple settlement spots, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (total pip count)
  2. Access to resources you currently lack
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, securing future expansion)
  4. Proximity to useful ports
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Longest road (2 VP) requires strategic planning - only pursue if you already have 4+ roads built

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- When someone has 8+ points, ALWAYS target them with the robber regardless of other factors
- If you're being targeted by the robber, consider using knight cards immediately to protect production

TURN-BY-TURN PLANNING:
1. Start each turn by assessing your current VP and opponents' VPs (both visible and potential hidden points)
2. Identify your build priority for this turn: settlement, city, road, or development card?
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for your priority build
4. If you can't build your priority item, determine if trading or buying a development card is better
5. Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card or trade for needed resources
6. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

WINNING PATHS:
1. CITY-FOCUSED PATH: 3-4 cities (6-8 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 9-11 VP
2. BALANCED PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 VP card = 10 VP
3. DEVELOPMENT PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP

NEVER SAY NO TO FREE VPs:
- Always account for the 2 VP from longest road and largest army in your plans
- These special cards are EASY to lose if you're not defending them
- Invest in roads/knights to maintain your lead if these VPs are part of your strategy
- Be alert for opponents trying to steal these bonus points

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game Analysis for Settlers of Catan

I'll analyze the current game state and decide on my optimal action.

## Current Game Status
- I have 4 victory points (4 settlements)
- RED has 7 victory points (3 settlements, 1 city, longest road)
- I have 2 wood, 2 sheep, and 2 ore resources
- My longest road is 7 segments, same as RED who currently holds the bonus
- I have 4 settlements, with good production on nodes 17 and 9

## Resource Assessment
- I have good wood production (node 17 has 8 and 6)
- I need wheat for cities and development cards
- I need brick to continue my road strategy

## Strategic Options

1. **End Turn (Option 0)**
   - Will gain resources on next roll
   - But this wastes an opportunity to improve my position

2. **Trade for Brick (Option 3)**
   - Could use 2 ore to get 1 brick via the ore port
   - This would help extend my road network
   - Could potentially claim longest road on my next turn (with another brick)

3. **Trade for Wheat (Option 4)**
   - Could use 2 ore to get 1 wheat via the ore port
   - Getting wheat is important for city upgrades
   - However, I need 2 wheat + 3 ore for a city, still far from that goal

## Decision Process
- RED is at 7 points, I'm at 4 - I need to gain ground quickly
- Taking longest road would give me 2 VP, bringing me to 6 VP
- I can potentially reach 8 VP after that with one city upgrade
- Since I already have 7 road segments, I need to focus on extending my road network

Looking at my current plan and resources, I should trade for brick to extend my road network. My ore port makes this efficient, and it aligns with my stated plan of building more roads to claim longest road.

<plan>
1. Trade 2 ore for 1 brick using my ore port
2. Build road on next turn to reach 8 segments and claim longest road (+2 VP)
3. After securing longest road, focus on upgrading a settlement to a city (preferably node 17)
4. Continue developing toward 10 victory points through cities and development cards
</plan>

The optimal move is to trade for brick to advance my road strategy.

# Analyzing the Game State

Let me thoroughly analyze the current game state to make the optimal decision:

## Current Position
- I have 4 VP from 4 settlements
- RED has 7 VP (5 from buildings + 2 from longest road)
- I have 2 WOOD, 1 BRICK, 2 SHEEP
- My resources are limited but sufficient for one road build

## Longest Road Analysis
- RED currently has longest road with 7 segments
- I have 9 roads built with my longest path at 7 segments
- Building 1 more road could potentially get me to 8 segments, stealing longest road

## Victory Path
- If I can steal longest road, I'll gain 2 VP, bringing me to 6/10
- After that, I'd need 4 more VP to win (2 cities or a combination of other strategies)

## Road Build Options Analysis
Examining the available road placements to determine which might extend my longest path:

The key question is which road would extend my current longest path, rather than creating a branch or secondary path.

Looking at the available road build options, I need to identify which one connects to my current longest continuous path. Without seeing the exact layout of my roads, I need to make an educated guess based on the node connections and my settlements.

My current plan involves trading for brick to build a road next turn, but I actually have enough resources (2 wood, 1 brick) to build a road right now!

<plan>
1. Build a road now to reach 8 segments and claim longest road (+2 VP)
2. After securing longest road, focus on upgrading a settlement to a city (preferably node 17)
3. Continue developing toward 10 victory points through cities and development cards
</plan>

Since I have the resources needed, I should build a road now to try to claim longest road. Without seeing the exact layout of my current roads, I need to select the option that is most likely to extend my current longest path.

Based on my settlements at nodes 9, 17, 41, and 44, I believe option #8 (Build a road at edge (16, 18)) or option #10 (Build a road at edge (18, 40)) are most likely to be connected to my settlement at node 17, potentially extending my longest path.

Of these, option #10 seems most strategic as it connects toward node 40, which is part of my ore port. This aligns with my long-term plan of upgrading to cities.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Target hexes with HIGH probability numbers (6,8,5,9) - prioritize these above all else
- Go for resource DIVERSITY: secure ALL five resources between your two settlements
- Focus on ORE and WHEAT for city upgrades (numbers 5-9 preferred)
- Evaluate each potential settlement by its TOTAL PIP COUNT (sum of probability dots)
- Place your initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Avoid placing both settlements near the same resources - diversify your income!
- Always consider 3:1 ports if your initial placement gives you limited access to certain resources
- Place roads in directions that block opponents' expansion routes

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT & CITY BUILDING PRIORITY:
- FIRST PRIORITY: Build 1-2 additional settlements early to secure critical resources you lack
- SECOND PRIORITY: Upgrade to cities as quickly as possible to double resource production
- THIRD PRIORITY: Build roads only when they lead directly to valuable settlement locations
- Early game (1-5 turns): Secure key settlements at high-value locations
- Mid-game (6-15 turns): Focus heavily on upgrading to cities (2-3 cities should be your target)
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road
- When short on a key resource, use 2:1 ports if available before using 3:1 or 4:1 ports
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat to other players unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- If you have excess of a resource, use ports rather than trading with opponents

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards primarily when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber OR to reach Largest Army (3+ knights)
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city or settlement build
- Use Monopoly cards after high-probability dice rolls to collect maximum resources
- Keep track of how many VP cards you've drawn (5 in the deck total)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn
- When development cards are your path to victory, aim for: 3 cities (6 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 victory cards (2 VP)
- Consider buying development cards when you have limited build options (blocked roads, etc.)

OPTIMAL EXPANSION PATH:
- Build roads with PURPOSE - every road should lead to a viable settlement location
- Identify and secure "bottleneck" positions that cut off opponents' expansion
- Expand toward resources you LACK from initial placement - seek balance
- When choosing between multiple settlement spots, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (total pip count)
  2. Access to resources you currently lack
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, securing future expansion)
  4. Proximity to useful ports
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Longest road (2 VP) requires strategic planning - only pursue if you already have 4+ roads built

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- When someone has 8+ points, ALWAYS target them with the robber regardless of other factors
- If you're being targeted by the robber, consider using knight cards immediately to protect production

TURN-BY-TURN PLANNING:
1. Start each turn by assessing your current VP and opponents' VPs (both visible and potential hidden points)
2. Identify your build priority for this turn: settlement, city, road, or development card?
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for your priority build
4. If you can't build your priority item, determine if trading or buying a development card is better
5. Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card or trade for needed resources
6. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

WINNING PATHS:
1. CITY-FOCUSED PATH: 3-4 cities (6-8 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 9-11 VP
2. BALANCED PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 VP card = 10 VP
3. DEVELOPMENT PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP

NEVER SAY NO TO FREE VPs:
- Always account for the 2 VP from longest road and largest army in your plans
- These special cards are EASY to lose if you're not defending them
- Invest in roads/knights to maintain your lead if these VPs are part of your strategy
- Be alert for opponents trying to steal these bonus points

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 65 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Build a road now to reach 8 segments and claim longest road (+2 VP)
2. After securing longest road, focus on upgrading a settlement to a city (preferably node 17)
3. Continue developing toward 10 victory points through cities and development cards

# Game State Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state thoroughly:

## Current Victory Points
- RED: 7/10 VP (including +2 for longest road)
- BLUE (me): 4/10 VP

## My Resources
- 2 Wood
- 4 Sheep
- No other resources

## Building Options
I don't have enough resources to build:
- Road (need 1 Wood + 1 Brick, have 2 Wood only)
- Settlement (need 1 Wood + 1 Brick + 1 Wheat + 1 Sheep)
- City upgrade (need 3 Ore + 2 Wheat)
- Development card (need 1 Ore + 1 Wheat + 1 Sheep)

## Current Plan Review
My current plan was to build a road to reach 8 segments and claim longest road. However:
1. RED already has 9 segments, so I need 10 to take longest road
2. I currently have 8 road segments built according to the game state
3. I don't have the resources to build roads (missing brick)

## Trading Options
My only options are maritime trades using the 4:1 general port rate with my sheep. I could trade 4 sheep for 1 of any resource.

## Strategic Thinking

RED is at 7 VP and ahead, so I need to make progress. My previous plan needs adjustment since:
1. I can't build a road now (missing brick)
2. Even if I could build a road, RED has 9 segments so I would need 2 more roads to take longest road

With 4 sheep, I could trade for a resource, but that alone won't enable me to build anything this turn. The best approach is to adjust my plan and prepare for my next turn by obtaining a critical resource.

<plan>
1. Trade for 1 brick this turn to prepare for road building
2. On next turns, build roads strategically to reach 10+ segments and claim longest road (+2 VP)
3. Then focus on upgrading settlements to cities (node 17 with good ore production)
4. Continue developing toward 10 victory points through roads, cities and development cards
</plan>

Among my options, trading 4 sheep for 1 brick (option 4) makes the most sense. This will give me the brick I need to build a road on my next turn, advancing my plan to eventually claim longest road.

3. DEVELOPMENT PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP

NEVER SAY NO TO FREE VPs:
- Always account for the 2 VP from longest road and largest army in your plans
- These special cards are EASY to lose if you're not defending them
- Invest in roads/knights to maintain your lead if these VPs are part of your strategy
- Be alert for opponents trying to steal these bonus points

# Game Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state and optimal actions:

## Victory Point Status
- RED: 7 VP (3 settlements + 1 city + Longest Road bonus)
- BLUE (me): 4 VP (4 settlements, no bonuses)

## Current Resources
- I have: 2 Wood, 1 Brick
- This allows me to build exactly one road this turn

## Potential Win Paths
1. **Longest Road Strategy**: RED currently has Longest Road (9 segments). I have 8 segments according to the game state. With a strategic build plan, I could potentially reach 10+ segments and take the Longest Road bonus (+2 VP).
2. **City Upgrade Path**: I have settlements at good production spots, especially node 17 which produces Wood (8) and Ore (5).

## Road Building Analysis

My current plan indicates I should be building roads to eventually claim Longest Road. Let me analyze each possible road location:

1. Edge (9, 10): Extends toward the wheat port
2. Edge (1, 2): Extends toward the center
3. Edge (38, 39): Connects near the 3:1 port
4. Edge (2, 3): Extends toward the center
5. Edge (4, 15): Connects settlements
6. Edge (8, 9): Near my existing settlement
7. Edge (16, 18): Extends toward promising location
8. Edge (21, 43): Extends toward the sheep port
9. Edge (14, 15): Connects settlements
10. Edge (43, 47): Extends toward the sheep port

To determine the optimal road placement, I need to:
1. Identify which road continues my longest continuous path
2. Consider which road offers best future expansion potential

Looking at my current longest path (8 segments) and given I only need to reach 10 to surpass RED, I should focus on roads that extend my current longest path rather than creating new branches.

Without a detailed map showing exactly which 8 segments make up my current longest path, I need to infer which roads would most likely extend it. Based on the node numbers and typical board layouts, edges (14, 15) or (4, 15) seem most likely to continue my longest path as they connect between settlements.

I'm also drawn to edge (38, 39) as it connects near a port which could be strategically valuable.

## Final Decision

Looking at the road options, I believe edge (14, 15) at position 9 is most likely to extend my current longest road path based on the node numbers. This would give me 9 segments total, tying with RED, and positioning me to take Longest Road on my next turn.

<plan>
1. Build a road at edge (14, 15) this turn to extend my longest path to 9 segments
2. Next turn, build another strategic road to reach 10 segments and claim Longest Road (+2 VP)
3. Continue developing toward city upgrades, especially at node 17 with good ore production
4. Secure 10 VP through a combination of settlements (4 VP), cities (2+ VP), and Longest Road (2 VP)

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Target hexes with HIGH probability numbers (6,8,5,9) - prioritize these above all else
- Go for resource DIVERSITY: secure ALL five resources between your two settlements
- Focus on ORE and WHEAT for city upgrades (numbers 5-9 preferred)
- Evaluate each potential settlement by its TOTAL PIP COUNT (sum of probability dots)
- Place your initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Avoid placing both settlements near the same resources - diversify your income!
- Always consider 3:1 ports if your initial placement gives you limited access to certain resources
- Place roads in directions that block opponents' expansion routes

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT & CITY BUILDING PRIORITY:
- FIRST PRIORITY: Build 1-2 additional settlements early to secure critical resources you lack
- SECOND PRIORITY: Upgrade to cities as quickly as possible to double resource production
- THIRD PRIORITY: Build roads only when they lead directly to valuable settlement locations
- Early game (1-5 turns): Secure key settlements at high-value locations
- Mid-game (6-15 turns): Focus heavily on upgrading to cities (2-3 cities should be your target)
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road
- When short on a key resource, use 2:1 ports if available before using 3:1 or 4:1 ports
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat to other players unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- If you have excess of a resource, use ports rather than trading with opponents

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards primarily when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber OR to reach Largest Army (3+ knights)
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city or settlement build
- Use Monopoly cards after high-probability dice rolls to collect maximum resources
- Keep track of how many VP cards you've drawn (5 in the deck total)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn
- When development cards are your path to victory, aim for: 3 cities (6 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 victory cards (2 VP)
- Consider buying development cards when you have limited build options (blocked roads, etc.)

OPTIMAL EXPANSION PATH:
- Build roads with PURPOSE - every road should lead to a viable settlement location
- Identify and secure "bottleneck" positions that cut off opponents' expansion
- Expand toward resources you LACK from initial placement - seek balance
- When choosing between multiple settlement spots, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (total pip count)
  2. Access to resources you currently lack
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, securing future expansion)
  4. Proximity to useful ports
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Longest road (2 VP) requires strategic planning - only pursue if you already have 4+ roads built

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- When someone has 8+ points, ALWAYS target them with the robber regardless of other factors
- If you're being targeted by the robber, consider using knight cards immediately to protect production

TURN-BY-TURN PLANNING:
1. Start each turn by assessing your current VP and opponents' VPs (both visible and potential hidden points)
2. Identify your build priority for this turn: settlement, city, road, or development card?
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for your priority build
4. If you can't build your priority item, determine if trading or buying a development card is better
5. Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card or trade for needed resources
6. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

WINNING PATHS:
1. CITY-FOCUSED PATH: 3-4 cities (6-8 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 9-11 VP
2. BALANCED PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 VP card = 10 VP
3. DEVELOPMENT PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP

NEVER SAY NO TO FREE VPs:
- Always account for the 2 VP from longest road and largest army in your plans
- These special cards are EASY to lose if you're not defending them
- Invest in roads/knights to maintain your lead if these VPs are part of your strategy
- Be alert for opponents trying to steal these bonus points

Board Understanding Guide:

- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section

# Game State Analysis

Let me analyze my current position and options:

## Victory Point Status
- I have 4 VP (4 settlements)
- RED has 8 VP (4 settlements, 1 city, Longest Road)
- RED is 2 VP away from winning, I need 6 more VP

## Resources
- I have 3 WOOD and 2 BRICK - exactly enough for one road

## Current Plan Review
My plan is to build roads to eventually take Longest Road from RED, who currently has 11 segments. I have 8 segments now, so I would need to build at least 4 more road segments to surpass RED's 11 segments.

## Options Analysis
Since I can only build a road this turn with my resources, I need to place it optimally to:
1. Extend my longest continuous path
2. Move toward beneficial locations for future settlements
3. Block RED's expansion if possible

Looking at the road options, I need to determine which one extends my longest continuous path.

My longest path currently has 8 segments. To take the Longest Road bonus, I would need at least 12 segments total (to surpass RED's 11).

## Road Placement Options
Given my settlements at nodes 9, 17, 41, and 44, I need to analyze which road option would extend my longest path:

- Option 4 (edge 38, 39): This appears to be near my settlement at node 41 and could extend toward the 3:1 port
- Option 8 (edge 16, 18): This connects near my settlement at node 17
- Option 2 (edge 13, 14): This could expand toward the wheat port and my node 17 settlement

Looking at these carefully, option 4 (edge 38, 39) seems most likely to extend my current longest path. It connects to my settlement at node 41 and continues my road network toward the 3:1 port, helping extend my longest continuous path.

## Revised Strategy

<plan>
1. Continue building roads to extend my longest path, eventually reaching 12+ segments to take Longest Road (+2 VP)
2. Save resources for a city upgrade at node 17 (produces good ore and wood) to gain +1 VP
3. Look for opportunities to build additional settlements for more VPs
4. Target reaching 10 VP through: current settlements (4 VP) + Longest Road (2 VP) + 2 cities (4 VP)

Given my current position, I should continue expanding my road network to work toward Longest Road. I'll build a road at edge (38, 39) to extend my path and position myself for future expansion.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Target hexes with HIGH probability numbers (6,8,5,9) - prioritize these above all else
- Go for resource DIVERSITY: secure ALL five resources between your two settlements
- Focus on ORE and WHEAT for city upgrades (numbers 5-9 preferred)
- Evaluate each potential settlement by its TOTAL PIP COUNT (sum of probability dots)
- Place your initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Avoid placing both settlements near the same resources - diversify your income!
- Always consider 3:1 ports if your initial placement gives you limited access to certain resources
- Place roads in directions that block opponents' expansion routes

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT & CITY BUILDING PRIORITY:
- FIRST PRIORITY: Build 1-2 additional settlements early to secure critical resources you lack
- SECOND PRIORITY: Upgrade to cities as quickly as possible to double resource production
- THIRD PRIORITY: Build roads only when they lead directly to valuable settlement locations
- Early game (1-5 turns): Secure key settlements at high-value locations
- Mid-game (6-15 turns): Focus heavily on upgrading to cities (2-3 cities should be your target)
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road
- When short on a key resource, use 2:1 ports if available before using 3:1 or 4:1 ports
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat to other players unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- If you have excess of a resource, use ports rather than trading with opponents

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards primarily when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber OR to reach Largest Army (3+ knights)
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city or settlement build
- Use Monopoly cards after high-probability dice rolls to collect maximum resources
- Keep track of how many VP cards you've drawn (5 in the deck total)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn
- When development cards are your path to victory, aim for: 3 cities (6 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 victory cards (2 VP)
- Consider buying development cards when you have limited build options (blocked roads, etc.)

OPTIMAL EXPANSION PATH:
- Build roads with PURPOSE - every road should lead to a viable settlement location
- Identify and secure "bottleneck" positions that cut off opponents' expansion
- Expand toward resources you LACK from initial placement - seek balance
- When choosing between multiple settlement spots, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (total pip count)
  2. Access to resources you currently lack
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, securing future expansion)
  4. Proximity to useful ports
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Longest road (2 VP) requires strategic planning - only pursue if you already have 4+ roads built

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- When someone has 8+ points, ALWAYS target them with the robber regardless of other factors
- If you're being targeted by the robber, consider using knight cards immediately to protect production

TURN-BY-TURN PLANNING:
1. Start each turn by assessing your current VP and opponents' VPs (both visible and potential hidden points)
2. Identify your build priority for this turn: settlement, city, road, or development card?
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for your priority build
4. If you can't build your priority item, determine if trading or buying a development card is better
5. Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card or trade for needed resources
6. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

WINNING PATHS:
1. CITY-FOCUSED PATH: 3-4 cities (6-8 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 9-11 VP
2. BALANCED PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 VP card = 10 VP
3. DEVELOPMENT PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP

NEVER SAY NO TO FREE VPs:
- Always account for the 2 VP from longest road and largest army in your plans
- These special cards are EASY to lose if you're not defending them
- Invest in roads/knights to maintain your lead if these VPs are part of your strategy
- Be alert for opponents trying to steal these bonus points

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 67 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Continue building roads to extend my longest path, eventually reaching 12+ segments to take Longest Road (+2 VP)
2. Save resources for a city upgrade at node 17 (produces good ore and wood) to gain +1 VP
3. Look for opportunities to build additional settlements for more VPs
4. Target reaching 10 VP through: current settlements (4 VP) + Longest Road (2 VP) + 2 cities (4 VP)
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.

# Game State Analysis

Let me analyze the current game situation carefully:

## Victory Point Situation
- RED: 8 VP (4 settlements, 1 city, longest road = 4 + 2 + 2 = 8)
- BLUE: 4 VP (4 settlements = 4 VP)
- RED is 2 VP away from winning

## My Resources
- 2 Wood, 1 Brick - exact resources needed for 1 road

## Strategic Considerations
1. RED has longest road with 11 segments vs. my 8 segments
2. I have 12 roads built, which means I'd need to build at least 4 more roads to take longest road (11 + 1 = 12 minimum)
3. I don't have enough resources to build a settlement or city
4. I can only build one road with my current resources

Looking at my current plan, I'm trying to:
- Extend longest road to eventually take that bonus
- Save for city upgrades
- Build more settlements

However, with just one road possible this turn, I need to determine which road placement gives me the best future position.

## Road Placement Analysis

Let me analyze the possible road placements to see which best advances my strategy:

- Road at edge (9, 10) - Connects from settlement at node 9 but doesn't seem to be part of my longest road path
- Road at edge (13, 14) - Could extend toward ore/wood resources
- Road at edge (1, 2) - Near RED's territory, not part of my main network
- Road at edge (37, 38) - Connects toward 3:1 port
- Road at edge (2, 3) - Near RED's territory, not part of my main network
- Road at edge (4, 15) - Near RED's territory, not part of my main network
- Road at edge (8, 9) - Connects to my settlement at node 9 but may not extend my longest path
- Road at edge (16, 18) - Could connect my network between settlements
- Road at edge (21, 43) - Extends toward node 43 which connects to my settlement at 44
- Road at edge (14, 37) - Connects between ore production areas
- Road at edge (43, 47) - Leads toward sheep port, connects from node 43

Without being able to visualize the exact road network, I need to determine which of these options would best increase my continuous road length. The most strategic choice would be one that:
1. Extends my current longest road path
2. Moves toward potential settlement spots
3. Helps connect my network optimally

Based on my analysis and the options available, the road at edge (21, 43) seems most strategic as it appears to extend toward my settlement at node 44, potentially connecting parts of my network and extending my longest road path. This would help with my current plan of eventually challenging RED for longest road.

<plan>
1. Build roads strategically to connect my settlements and extend my longest path
2. Continue saving resources for a city upgrade at node 17 (produces good ore and wood)
3. Look for opportunities to build additional settlements toward resource-rich areas
4. Target reaching 10 VP through: current settlements (4 VP) + Longest Road (2 VP) + 2 cities (4 VP)
</plan>

# Game State Analysis

Let me analyze my current position and available actions:

## Current Resources
- 2 Wood
- 2 Ore
- No Brick, Sheep, or Wheat

## Victory Point Status
- I have 4 VP from settlements
- Red has 8 VP (4 from settlements, 1 from city, 2 from longest road, possibly 1 hidden VP)
- Red is significantly ahead and close to winning

## Available Actions
0. End Turn (without building anything)
1-4. Trade options through ports for various resources

## Strategic Assessment

Given that I have only Wood and Ore, I can't build anything directly this turn:
- Settlement requires 1 Wood, 1 Brick, 1 Wheat, 1 Sheep
- City requires 3 Ore, 2 Wheat (I have 2 Ore but no Wheat)
- Road requires 1 Wood, 1 Brick (I have Wood but no Brick)
- Development card requires 1 Ore, 1 Wheat, 1 Sheep (I have Ore but no Wheat or Sheep)

Red has 10 resources, which means they're likely to build on their next turn and could potentially win. I need to make progress toward either:
1. Catching up in points
2. Breaking Red's longest road to set them back

Looking at my port options, I can see I have access to the 2:1 Ore port at nodes 40, 44. However, the actions listed don't reflect this - they all say "Give 2 🏜️None" which is unclear. Since I can't immediately build anything useful with the resources I can trade for, and I need to save my limited resources, the best option is to end my turn.

<plan>
1. Save resources for city upgrade at node 17 (produces good ore and wood)
2. Focus on breaking Red's longest road as they're approaching victory
3. Next turn, aim to build roads toward breaking their road network or establishing our own longest road
4. Target reaching 10 VP through: settlements (4 VP) + City upgrades (at least 2 cities = 4 VP) + either development cards (2 VP) or longest road (2 VP)
</plan>

Without being able to make meaningful progress this turn, I'll end my turn and hope for better resource rolls.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Target hexes with HIGH probability numbers (6,8,5,9) - prioritize these above all else
- Go for resource DIVERSITY: secure ALL five resources between your two settlements
- Focus on ORE and WHEAT for city upgrades (numbers 5-9 preferred)
- Evaluate each potential settlement by its TOTAL PIP COUNT (sum of probability dots)
- Place your initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Avoid placing both settlements near the same resources - diversify your income!
- Always consider 3:1 ports if your initial placement gives you limited access to certain resources
- Place roads in directions that block opponents' expansion routes

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT & CITY BUILDING PRIORITY:
- FIRST PRIORITY: Build 1-2 additional settlements early to secure critical resources you lack
- SECOND PRIORITY: Upgrade to cities as quickly as possible to double resource production
- THIRD PRIORITY: Build roads only when they lead directly to valuable settlement locations
- Early game (1-5 turns): Secure key settlements at high-value locations
- Mid-game (6-15 turns): Focus heavily on upgrading to cities (2-3 cities should be your target)
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road
- When short on a key resource, use 2:1 ports if available before using 3:1 or 4:1 ports
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat to other players unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- If you have excess of a resource, use ports rather than trading with opponents

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards primarily when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber OR to reach Largest Army (3+ knights)
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city or settlement build
- Use Monopoly cards after high-probability dice rolls to collect maximum resources
- Keep track of how many VP cards you've drawn (5 in the deck total)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn
- When development cards are your path to victory, aim for: 3 cities (6 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 victory cards (2 VP)
- Consider buying development cards when you have limited build options (blocked roads, etc.)

OPTIMAL EXPANSION PATH:
- Build roads with PURPOSE - every road should lead to a viable settlement location
- Identify and secure "bottleneck" positions that cut off opponents' expansion
- Expand toward resources you LACK from initial placement - seek balance
- When choosing between multiple settlement spots, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (total pip count)
  2. Access to resources you currently lack
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, securing future expansion)
  4. Proximity to useful ports
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Longest road (2 VP) requires strategic planning - only pursue if you already have 4+ roads built

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- When someone has 8+ points, ALWAYS target them with the robber regardless of other factors
- If you're being targeted by the robber, consider using knight cards immediately to protect production

TURN-BY-TURN PLANNING:
1. Start each turn by assessing your current VP and opponents' VPs (both visible and potential hidden points)
2. Identify your build priority for this turn: settlement, city, road, or development card?
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for your priority build
4. If you can't build your priority item, determine if trading or buying a development card is better
5. Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card or trade for needed resources
6. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

WINNING PATHS:
1. CITY-FOCUSED PATH: 3-4 cities (6-8 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 9-11 VP
2. BALANCED PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 VP card = 10 VP
3. DEVELOPMENT PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP

NEVER SAY NO TO FREE VPs:
- Always account for the 2 VP from longest road and largest army in your plans
- These special cards are EASY to lose if you're not defending them
- Invest in roads/knights to maintain your lead if these VPs are part of your strategy
- Be alert for opponents trying to steal these bonus points

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 71 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Save resources for city upgrade at node 17 (produces good ore and wood)
2. Focus on breaking Red's longest road as they're approaching victory
3. Next turn, aim to build roads toward breaking their road network or establishing our own longest road
4. Target reaching 10 VP through: settlements (4 VP) + City upgrades (at least 2 cities = 4 VP) + either development cards (2 VP) or longest road (2 VP)

# Game Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state and my available options:

## Current Situation
- **RED** has 9 VP (5 settlements + 1 city + longest road) and is 1 VP away from winning
- **BLUE** (me) has only 4 VP (4 settlements) and needs 6 more VP
- I have 3 Wood, 2 Brick, 2 Ore
- RED currently has longest road with 11 segments (my longest is 9)
- RED has 6 hidden cards

## Resources & Building Options
I have enough resources to build exactly one road (costs 1 Wood + 1 Brick). After building, I'll still have 2 Wood, 1 Brick, 2 Ore - not enough for another settlement, city, or development card.

## Strategic Priority
RED is close to winning (9/10 VP), so my priority should be:
1. Disrupt RED's longest road if possible
2. Set myself up for progress on my next turn
3. Consider my path to 10 VP

## Road Building Options Analysis
Let me analyze the key road options:

- Looking at breaking RED's longest road: I need to check if any of these road placements could interfere with RED's current longest road network. Unfortunately, without seeing the full road network visualization, I can't determine which road would directly break RED's longest road.

- Looking at extending my own road network: Road options that extend my current longest path would be valuable, especially if I could eventually surpass RED's 11-segment road.

- Setting up for future settlements: Roads that lead to viable settlement locations would be valuable for future expansion.

Given the limited information about the exact road configurations, I'll focus on strategic positions:

- Edge (19, 21) connects near the Sheep port and opens expansion opportunities
- Edge (43, 47) heads directly toward the Sheep port
- Edge (16, 21) appears to be in a strategic central position
- Edge (37, 38) connects toward the 3:1 general port

## Decision Logic
Given RED is one point away from winning, my priority must be to:
1. Try to break their longest road if possible
2. Set myself up to potentially gain longest road
3. Position for future settlement opportunities

Without seeing the full road network, I'm making a strategic guess based on the node locations. Edge (16, 21) appears to be in a central position that might help me extend my road network while potentially blocking RED's expansion. This connects nodes near ore and sheep resources, which could help my future development.

<plan>
1. Build a road at edge (16, 21) to potentially extend my longest road network
2. Next turn, focus on either breaking RED's longest road or building toward new settlement locations
3. Long-term, aim for city upgrades (especially at node 17) when I gather enough resources
4. Target reaching 10 VP through: 4 settlements (4 VP) + 2-3 cities (4-6 VP) + longest road (2 VP)
</plan>

I choose to build a road at edge (16, 21).

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Target hexes with HIGH probability numbers (6,8,5,9) - prioritize these above all else
- Go for resource DIVERSITY: secure ALL five resources between your two settlements
- Focus on ORE and WHEAT for city upgrades (numbers 5-9 preferred)
- Evaluate each potential settlement by its TOTAL PIP COUNT (sum of probability dots)
- Place your initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Avoid placing both settlements near the same resources - diversify your income!
- Always consider 3:1 ports if your initial placement gives you limited access to certain resources
- Place roads in directions that block opponents' expansion routes

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT & CITY BUILDING PRIORITY:
- FIRST PRIORITY: Build 1-2 additional settlements early to secure critical resources you lack
- SECOND PRIORITY: Upgrade to cities as quickly as possible to double resource production
- THIRD PRIORITY: Build roads only when they lead directly to valuable settlement locations
- Early game (1-5 turns): Secure key settlements at high-value locations
- Mid-game (6-15 turns): Focus heavily on upgrading to cities (2-3 cities should be your target)
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road
- When short on a key resource, use 2:1 ports if available before using 3:1 or 4:1 ports
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat to other players unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- If you have excess of a resource, use ports rather than trading with opponents

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards primarily when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber OR to reach Largest Army (3+ knights)
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city or settlement build
- Use Monopoly cards after high-probability dice rolls to collect maximum resources
- Keep track of how many VP cards you've drawn (5 in the deck total)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn
- When development cards are your path to victory, aim for: 3 cities (6 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 victory cards (2 VP)
- Consider buying development cards when you have limited build options (blocked roads, etc.)

OPTIMAL EXPANSION PATH:
- Build roads with PURPOSE - every road should lead to a viable settlement location
- Identify and secure "bottleneck" positions that cut off opponents' expansion
- Expand toward resources you LACK from initial placement - seek balance
- When choosing between multiple settlement spots, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (total pip count)
  2. Access to resources you currently lack
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, securing future expansion)
  4. Proximity to useful ports
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Longest road (2 VP) requires strategic planning - only pursue if you already have 4+ roads built

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- When someone has 8+ points, ALWAYS target them with the robber regardless of other factors
- If you're being targeted by the robber, consider using knight cards immediately to protect production

TURN-BY-TURN PLANNING:
1. Start each turn by assessing your current VP and opponents' VPs (both visible and potential hidden points)
2. Identify your build priority for this turn: settlement, city, road, or development card?
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for your priority build
4. If you can't build your priority item, determine if trading or buying a development card is better
5. Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card or trade for needed resources
6. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

WINNING PATHS:
1. CITY-FOCUSED PATH: 3-4 cities (6-8 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 9-11 VP
2. BALANCED PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 VP card = 10 VP
3. DEVELOPMENT PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP

NEVER SAY NO TO FREE VPs:
- Always account for the 2 VP from longest road and largest army in your plans
- These special cards are EASY to lose if you're not defending them
- Invest in roads/knights to maintain your lead if these VPs are part of your strategy
- Be alert for opponents trying to steal these bonus points

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game Analysis

Let me analyze my current situation and available options:

## Current Game State
- I have 4 VP (4 settlements, 0 cities)
- RED has 9 VP (5 settlements, 1 city, Longest Road)
- RED is just 1 VP away from winning
- I have 2 WOOD, 1 BRICK, 2 ORE resources
- I have a 10-segment road network vs RED's 11-segment road

## Immediate Concerns
1. RED is at 9 VP and could win next turn
2. My best short-term option is to potentially break RED's longest road
3. I have resources to build exactly one road

## Road Building Options Analysis
Looking at my options, I need to evaluate where a road would be most strategic:
- Breaking RED's longest road would immediately remove 2 VP from RED
- Extending my own road network could potentially give me longest road (2 VP)
- Setting up future settlement opportunities

Since I have exactly the resources for one road (1 WOOD, 1 BRICK), I need to choose carefully.

## Strategic Analysis
RED is just 1 VP away from winning. The most impactful play would be to break their longest road if possible. However, I need to check if any of my road options would do this.

From the available road placements, I don't see an obvious way to directly cut RED's road network. In this case, my best strategy is to extend my own road network to either:
1. Position myself to get the longest road in future turns
2. Set up for future settlements

Looking at the options, I should choose a road that:
- Extends my 10-segment network (potentially toward longest road)
- Opens up promising settlement locations
- Blocks RED from further expansion

## Decision
Based on the limited information about the road connectivity, I'll make my best judgment. Option #4 (Build a road at edge (19, 21)) appears strategic as it connects to node 21 which is connected to tile (0, 2, -2) with wheat production and potential port access. This could set up for a future settlement.

<plan>
1. Build road at edge (19, 21) to extend my road network
2. Focus next on acquiring sheep and wheat to build settlements at strategic nodes
3. Break RED's longest road if an opportunity arises
4. Long-term goal: upgrade settlements to cities when I have sufficient ore/wheat
5. Target reaching 10 VP through: 4 settlements (4 VP) + 2-3 cities (4-6 VP) + longest road (2 VP)
</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Target hexes with HIGH probability numbers (6,8,5,9) - prioritize these above all else
- Go for resource DIVERSITY: secure ALL five resources between your two settlements
- Focus on ORE and WHEAT for city upgrades (numbers 5-9 preferred)
- Evaluate each potential settlement by its TOTAL PIP COUNT (sum of probability dots)
- Place your initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Avoid placing both settlements near the same resources - diversify your income!
- Always consider 3:1 ports if your initial placement gives you limited access to certain resources
- Place roads in directions that block opponents' expansion routes

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT & CITY BUILDING PRIORITY:
- FIRST PRIORITY: Build 1-2 additional settlements early to secure critical resources you lack
- SECOND PRIORITY: Upgrade to cities as quickly as possible to double resource production
- THIRD PRIORITY: Build roads only when they lead directly to valuable settlement locations
- Early game (1-5 turns): Secure key settlements at high-value locations
- Mid-game (6-15 turns): Focus heavily on upgrading to cities (2-3 cities should be your target)
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road
- When short on a key resource, use 2:1 ports if available before using 3:1 or 4:1 ports
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat to other players unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- If you have excess of a resource, use ports rather than trading with opponents

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards primarily when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber OR to reach Largest Army (3+ knights)
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city or settlement build
- Use Monopoly cards after high-probability dice rolls to collect maximum resources
- Keep track of how many VP cards you've drawn (5 in the deck total)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn
- When development cards are your path to victory, aim for: 3 cities (6 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 victory cards (2 VP)
- Consider buying development cards when you have limited build options (blocked roads, etc.)

OPTIMAL EXPANSION PATH:
- Build roads with PURPOSE - every road should lead to a viable settlement location
- Identify and secure "bottleneck" positions that cut off opponents' expansion
- Expand toward resources you LACK from initial placement - seek balance
- When choosing between multiple settlement spots, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (total pip count)
  2. Access to resources you currently lack
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, securing future expansion)
  4. Proximity to useful ports
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Longest road (2 VP) requires strategic planning - only pursue if you already have 4+ roads built

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- When someone has 8+ points, ALWAYS target them with the robber regardless of other factors
- If you're being targeted by the robber, consider using knight cards immediately to protect production

TURN-BY-TURN PLANNING:
1. Start each turn by assessing your current VP and opponents' VPs (both visible and potential hidden points)
2. Identify your build priority for this turn: settlement, city, road, or development card?
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for your priority build
4. If you can't build your priority item, determine if trading or buying a development card is better
5. Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card or trade for needed resources
6. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

WINNING PATHS:
1. CITY-FOCUSED PATH: 3-4 cities (6-8 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 9-11 VP
2. BALANCED PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 VP card = 10 VP
3. DEVELOPMENT PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP

NEVER SAY NO TO FREE VPs:
- Always account for the 2 VP from longest road and largest army in your plans
- These special cards are EASY to lose if you're not defending them
- Invest in roads/knights to maintain your lead if these VPs are part of your strategy
- Be alert for opponents trying to steal these bonus points

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game Analysis for Blue Player

Let me analyze the current state of the game and my options:

## Current Game State
- I have 4 VP (4 settlements worth 1 VP each)
- Red has 9 VP (5 settlements + 1 city + longest road)
- I have only 1 WOOD and 2 ORE as resources
- Red is only 1 VP away from winning
- I have no development cards in hand
- My existing plan involves building a road at edge (19, 21)

## Available Actions
0. End turn
1-4. Maritime trade options for various resources using my ORE port (2:1)

## Strategic Analysis

Red is at 9 VP and very close to winning. I have 4 VP and am significantly behind. With my current resources (1 wood, 2 ore), I cannot build anything meaningful:
- Roads cost 1 wood + 1 brick (I lack brick)
- Settlements cost 1 wood + 1 brick + 1 sheep + 1 wheat (I lack multiple resources)
- Cities cost 2 wheat + 3 ore (I have ore but no wheat)
- Development cards cost 1 sheep + 1 wheat + 1 ore (I lack sheep and wheat)

Looking at the maritime trade options:
- I have access to a 2:1 ORE port (nodes 40, 44)
- With 2 ore, I could trade for 1 of any resource
- However, getting just 1 additional resource won't enable me to build anything this turn

<plan>
1. Preserve my resources this turn - I can't build anything useful with just one additional resource
2. On future turns, target breaking RED's longest road by building strategically
3. Focus on acquiring sheep and wheat through trades/rolls to enable settlement or development card builds
4. Long-term: Work toward cities when I accumulate more ore/wheat
5. Since I'm far behind, I need to be more aggressive in blocking RED while building toward my own victory path
</plan>

Since I can't make meaningful progress this turn regardless of which resource I might acquire through trading, and since preserving my 2 ORE might be valuable for city building later (each city needs 3 ore), the optimal move is to simply end my turn.

2. Identify your build priority for this turn: settlement, city, road, or development card?
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for your priority build
4. If you can't build your priority item, determine if trading or buying a development card is better
5. Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card or trade for needed resources
6. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

WINNING PATHS:
1. CITY-FOCUSED PATH: 3-4 cities (6-8 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 9-11 VP
2. BALANCED PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 VP card = 10 VP
3. DEVELOPMENT PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP

NEVER SAY NO TO FREE VPs:
- Always account for the 2 VP from longest road and largest army in your plans
- These special cards are EASY to lose if you're not defending them
- Invest in roads/knights to maintain your lead if these VPs are part of your strategy
- Be alert for opponents trying to steal these bonus points

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 73 | Player: BLUE | Action: MOVE_ROBBER

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Preserve my resources this turn - I can't build anything useful with just one additional resource
2. On future turns, target breaking RED's longest road by building strategically
3. Focus on acquiring sheep and wheat through trades/rolls to enable settlement or development card builds
4. Long-term: Work toward cities when I accumulate more ore/wheat
5. Since I'm far behind, I need to be more aggressive in blocking RED while building toward my own victory path

# Game Analysis for Robber Placement

I need to determine the optimal robber placement to hinder RED (who is close to winning with 9 VP) while maximizing my chances of gaining valuable resources.

## Current Game State Assessment
- RED has 9/10 VP (just 1 away from winning)
- I (BLUE) have only 4/10 VP (far behind)
- RED has longest road (2 VP) with 11 segments
- RED has 4 hidden resource cards
- I have limited resources: 1 wood, 1 sheep, 2 ore

## Robber Placement Strategy
I need to:
1. Block a high-probability tile that RED is using
2. Maximize likelihood of stealing a valuable resource
3. Disrupt RED's ability to build further

Looking at RED's production:
- They have settlements/cities on hexes with: 🧱6 (2 buildings), 🌲8, 🐑8, 🐑9, 🌾5, etc.
- Their most productive hexes are those with values 6 and 8 (highest probability)

## Options Analysis
The most promising options are:

**Option [1]** - Move robber to (1, -1, 0) 🧱6:
- Blocks a 6-value brick hex (high probability)
- RED has TWO settlements here (nodes 1 and 7)
- Brick is crucial for road building, which RED needs to maintain longest road advantage
- Could steal a brick or another valuable resource

**Option [7]** - Move robber to (2, -2, 0) 🐑8:
- Blocks an 8-value sheep hex (high probability)
- RED has settlements at nodes 7 and 27
- Could significantly reduce RED's resource income

**Option [4]** - Move robber to (-1, 1, 0) 🌲8:
- Blocks an 8-value wood hex
- RED has a city at node 5 (double production)
- Wood is crucial for RED's road strategy
- Has high probability (8)

Looking at these options, the most strategic choice is Option [1] (Move robber to 🧱6). This blocks a key resource with high probability that RED uses for TWO settlements, and brick is critical for RED to maintain their longest road advantage. Cutting off brick will significantly slow RED's ability to extend their road network and potentially win next turn.

<plan>
1. Disrupt RED's brick production to limit their ability to extend roads
2. Try to steal valuable resources from RED
3. Work toward breaking RED's longest road by building strategically when resources allow
4. Focus on acquiring sheep and wheat for development cards (victory points or knights)
5. Target city upgrades when I accumulate more ore/wheat
</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Target hexes with HIGH probability numbers (6,8,5,9) - prioritize these above all else
- Go for resource DIVERSITY: secure ALL five resources between your two settlements
- Focus on ORE and WHEAT for city upgrades (numbers 5-9 preferred)
- Evaluate each potential settlement by its TOTAL PIP COUNT (sum of probability dots)
- Place your initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Avoid placing both settlements near the same resources - diversify your income!
- Always consider 3:1 ports if your initial placement gives you limited access to certain resources
- Place roads in directions that block opponents' expansion routes

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT & CITY BUILDING PRIORITY:
- FIRST PRIORITY: Build 1-2 additional settlements early to secure critical resources you lack
- SECOND PRIORITY: Upgrade to cities as quickly as possible to double resource production
- THIRD PRIORITY: Build roads only when they lead directly to valuable settlement locations
- Early game (1-5 turns): Secure key settlements at high-value locations
- Mid-game (6-15 turns): Focus heavily on upgrading to cities (2-3 cities should be your target)
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road
- When short on a key resource, use 2:1 ports if available before using 3:1 or 4:1 ports
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat to other players unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- If you have excess of a resource, use ports rather than trading with opponents

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards primarily when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber OR to reach Largest Army (3+ knights)
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city or settlement build
- Use Monopoly cards after high-probability dice rolls to collect maximum resources
- Keep track of how many VP cards you've drawn (5 in the deck total)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn
- When development cards are your path to victory, aim for: 3 cities (6 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 victory cards (2 VP)
- Consider buying development cards when you have limited build options (blocked roads, etc.)

OPTIMAL EXPANSION PATH:
- Build roads with PURPOSE - every road should lead to a viable settlement location
- Identify and secure "bottleneck" positions that cut off opponents' expansion
- Expand toward resources you LACK from initial placement - seek balance
- When choosing between multiple settlement spots, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (total pip count)
  2. Access to resources you currently lack
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, securing future expansion)
  4. Proximity to useful ports
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Longest road (2 VP) requires strategic planning - only pursue if you already have 4+ roads built

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- When someone has 8+ points, ALWAYS target them with the robber regardless of other factors
- If you're being targeted by the robber, consider using knight cards immediately to protect production

TURN-BY-TURN PLANNING:
1. Start each turn by assessing your current VP and opponents' VPs (both visible and potential hidden points)
2. Identify your build priority for this turn: settlement, city, road, or development card?
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for your priority build
4. If you can't build your priority item, determine if trading or buying a development card is better
5. Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card or trade for needed resources
6. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

WINNING PATHS:
1. CITY-FOCUSED PATH: 3-4 cities (6-8 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 9-11 VP
2. BALANCED PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 VP card = 10 VP
3. DEVELOPMENT PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP

NEVER SAY NO TO FREE VPs:
- Always account for the 2 VP from longest road and largest army in your plans
- These special cards are EASY to lose if you're not defending them
- Invest in roads/knights to maintain your lead if these VPs are part of your strategy
- Be alert for opponents trying to steal these bonus points

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Analysis of Current Game State and Options

## Game Overview
- RED is leading with 9/10 victory points, including the +2 VP from Longest Road (11 segments)
- BLUE (me) has only 4/10 victory points with 10 road segments (just short of stealing Longest Road)
- Current resources: 1 WOOD, 1 BRICK, 1 SHEEP, 2 ORE
- No development cards in hand

## Assessment of Available Options

Option 0: End Turn
- Ending the turn doesn't progress my position and gives RED another opportunity to win the game

Options 1-4: Maritime Trade using 2:1 port
- I have access to the 2:1 ORE port (nodes 40, 44), but I don't have any resources to trade for materials I need

## Strategic Evaluation

RED is one point away from winning and has 3 hidden cards. They could potentially:
1. Build another settlement
2. Upgrade to a city
3. Have a victory point development card

The only action available is to end my turn. None of the trade options are executable given my current resources.

<plan>
1. Continue disrupting RED's production when possible
2. Try to steal Longest Road by building one more road when resources allow (need just 1 more)
3. Work toward buying development cards for potential victory points or knights
4. Consider city upgrades when possible
5. When rolling a 7, target RED's resource production, especially brick or wood
</plan>

Since I don't have enough resources for any trades or builds, and cannot make any meaningful play this turn, I must end my turn.

- Place roads in directions that block opponents' expansion routes

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT & CITY BUILDING PRIORITY:
- FIRST PRIORITY: Build 1-2 additional settlements early to secure critical resources you lack
- SECOND PRIORITY: Upgrade to cities as quickly as possible to double resource production
- THIRD PRIORITY: Build roads only when they lead directly to valuable settlement locations
- Early game (1-5 turns): Secure key settlements at high-value locations
- Mid-game (6-15 turns): Focus heavily on upgrading to cities (2-3 cities should be your target)
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road
- When short on a key resource, use 2:1 ports if available before using 3:1 or 4:1 ports
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat to other players unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- If you have excess of a resource, use ports rather than trading with opponents

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards primarily when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber OR to reach Largest Army (3+ knights)
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city or settlement build
- Use Monopoly cards after high-probability dice rolls to collect maximum resources
- Keep track of how many VP cards you've drawn (5 in the deck total)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn
- When development cards are your path to victory, aim for: 3 cities (6 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 victory cards (2 VP)
- Consider buying development cards when you have limited build options (blocked roads, etc.)

OPTIMAL EXPANSION PATH:
- Build roads with PURPOSE - every road should lead to a viable settlement location
- Identify and secure "bottleneck" positions that cut off opponents' expansion
- Expand toward resources you LACK from initial placement - seek balance
- When choosing between multiple settlement spots, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (total pip count)
  2. Access to resources you currently lack
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, securing future expansion)
  4. Proximity to useful ports
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Longest road (2 VP) requires strategic planning - only pursue if you already have 4+ roads built

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- When someone has 8+ points, ALWAYS target them with the robber regardless of other factors
- If you're being targeted by the robber, consider using knight cards immediately to protect production

TURN-BY-TURN PLANNING:
1. Start each turn by assessing your current VP and opponents' VPs (both visible and potential hidden points)
2. Identify your build priority for this turn: settlement, city, road, or development card?
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for your priority build
4. If you can't build your priority item, determine if trading or buying a development card is better
5. Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card or trade for needed resources
6. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

WINNING PATHS:
1. CITY-FOCUSED PATH: 3-4 cities (6-8 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 9-11 VP
2. BALANCED PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 VP card = 10 VP
3. DEVELOPMENT PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP

NEVER SAY NO TO FREE VPs:
- Always account for the 2 VP from longest road and largest army in your plans
- These special cards are EASY to lose if you're not defending them
- Invest in roads/knights to maintain your lead if these VPs are part of your strategy
- Be alert for opponents trying to steal these bonus points

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game Analysis for Settlers of Catan

I'll analyze my current game state and available actions to determine the optimal move.

## Current Situation
- I (BLUE) have 4 VP (4 settlements)
- RED has 9 VP (5 settlements, 1 city, longest road bonus)
- My resources: 2 Wood, 1 Brick, 1 Sheep, 4 Ore
- RED is 1 VP away from winning
- I have 10 connected roads (vs RED's 11 for longest road)
- Robber is currently on a brick hex (1, -1, 0)

## Strategic Considerations
1. RED is very close to winning with 9 VP out of 10
2. I'm 6 VP behind, meaning I need to both advance my position and slow RED down
3. My plan mentions trying to steal Longest Road (need just 1 more road)
4. I currently have enough resources to build 1 road (2 Wood + 1 Brick)
5. Building that road could potentially let me claim longest road (+2 VP)
6. I also have 4 Ore, which is valuable for city upgrades or development cards

<plan>
1. Build a road to extend my longest road to 11, trying to steal the longest road bonus from RED
2. Use my 4 ore + future resources to buy development cards (hoping for VP cards or knights)
3. If I get more ore and wheat, upgrade a settlement to a city
4. When rolling 7, target RED's key resource hexes (especially wood, brick, and wheat)
5. Look for opportunities to block RED's expansion with strategic building
</plan>

## Action Analysis
- [0] End turn - This wastes my opportunity to build a road and potentially claim longest road
- [1-4] Maritime trade options - None of these make sense as I already have the resources to build a road

The clear best action is to build a road to extend my longest road to 11 segments, which would tie with RED for the longest road. However, building a road isn't listed among the available actions.

This suggests I may have already used my build phase earlier in this turn, or there's an issue with the available actions.

Given the limited options presented, I should end my turn (action 0) since none of the maritime trades will help my position. I should save my resources for my next turn where I can hopefully build that crucial road.

\boxed{0}
========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Target hexes with HIGH probability numbers (6,8,5,9) - prioritize these above all else
- Go for resource DIVERSITY: secure ALL five resources between your two settlements
- Focus on ORE and WHEAT for city upgrades (numbers 5-9 preferred)
- Evaluate each potential settlement by its TOTAL PIP COUNT (sum of probability dots)
- Place your initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Avoid placing both settlements near the same resources - diversify your income!
- Always consider 3:1 ports if your initial placement gives you limited access to certain resources
- Place roads in directions that block opponents' expansion routes

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT & CITY BUILDING PRIORITY:
- FIRST PRIORITY: Build 1-2 additional settlements early to secure critical resources you lack
- SECOND PRIORITY: Upgrade to cities as quickly as possible to double resource production
- THIRD PRIORITY: Build roads only when they lead directly to valuable settlement locations
- Early game (1-5 turns): Secure key settlements at high-value locations
- Mid-game (6-15 turns): Focus heavily on upgrading to cities (2-3 cities should be your target)
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road
- When short on a key resource, use 2:1 ports if available before using 3:1 or 4:1 ports
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat to other players unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- If you have excess of a resource, use ports rather than trading with opponents

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards primarily when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber OR to reach Largest Army (3+ knights)
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city or settlement build
- Use Monopoly cards after high-probability dice rolls to collect maximum resources
- Keep track of how many VP cards you've drawn (5 in the deck total)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn
- When development cards are your path to victory, aim for: 3 cities (6 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 victory cards (2 VP)
- Consider buying development cards when you have limited build options (blocked roads, etc.)

OPTIMAL EXPANSION PATH:
- Build roads with PURPOSE - every road should lead to a viable settlement location
- Identify and secure "bottleneck" positions that cut off opponents' expansion
- Expand toward resources you LACK from initial placement - seek balance
- When choosing between multiple settlement spots, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (total pip count)
  2. Access to resources you currently lack
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, securing future expansion)
  4. Proximity to useful ports
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Longest road (2 VP) requires strategic planning - only pursue if you already have 4+ roads built

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- When someone has 8+ points, ALWAYS target them with the robber regardless of other factors
- If you're being targeted by the robber, consider using knight cards immediately to protect production

2. Identify your build priority for this turn: settlement, city, road, or development card?
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for your priority build
4. If you can't build your priority item, determine if trading or buying a development card is better
5. Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card or trade for needed resources
6. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

WINNING PATHS:

2. BALANCED PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 VP card = 10 VP
3. DEVELOPMENT PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP

NEVER SAY NO TO FREE VPs:
- Always account for the 2 VP from longest road and largest army in your plans
- These special cards are EASY to lose if you're not defending them
- Invest in roads/knights to maintain your lead if these VPs are part of your strategy
- Be alert for opponents trying to steal these bonus points

# Analyzing the Robber Movement Options

I need to carefully assess where to place the robber to maximize impact against RED, who is leading with 9/10 victory points.

## Game State Analysis
- RED is at 9 VP and has Longest Road (2 VP), meaning they have 7 VP from buildings (5 settlements + 1 city)
- RED has 5 hidden resource cards
- I have 4 VP from settlements, 2 brick, 1 sheep, and 2 ore
- RED is clearly closest to winning and needs to be targeted
- RED has many high-value production hexes (several 6s and 8s)

## Strategic Considerations
1. Target RED's highest value production hexes
2. Consider targeting resources RED likely needs for their next build
3. Prioritize hexes connected to multiple RED settlements/cities
4. Bonus if the hex isn't producing anything for me

## Evaluating Key Hexes
Looking at RED's buildings, their most valuable production comes from:
- 🌲8 (3 dots): Connected to RED's city at node 5
- 🧱6 (3 dots): Connected to RED settlements at 1 and 7
- 🐑8 (3 dots): Connected to RED settlements at 7 and 27

Let's examine each corresponding robber move option:
- Option [3]: Move to 🌲8 (-1, 1, 0) - Blocks RED's city production of valuable wood
- Option [0]: Move to 🌲4 (0, 0, 0) - Connected to RED's city and settlement
- Option [6]: Move to 🐑8 (2, -2, 0) - Blocks 2 RED settlements
- Option [2]: Move to 🐑10 (-1, 0, 1) - Only connects to 1 RED settlement
- Option [7]: Move to 🐑9 (1, -2, 1) - Connected to RED's settlement at 27

The robber is currently at 🧱6, which is already blocking one of RED's valuable hexes. Moving it to another high-value hex would be optimal.

<plan>
1. Block RED's high-value production with robber placement, specifically targeting wood production from the 8 hex
2. Build a road to extend my longest road to 11, trying to steal the longest road bonus from RED
3. Use my ore to buy development cards (hoping for VP cards or knights)
4. Look for opportunities to block RED's expansion with strategic building
</plan>

Option [3] seems optimal because:
- It targets 🌲8, a high-probability hex (3 dots)
- It's connected to RED's city, so it blocks double production
- Wood is likely valuable for RED to continue extending their road network
- I have the opportunity to steal a card from RED

Therefore, I choose option 3.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Target hexes with HIGH probability numbers (6,8,5,9) - prioritize these above all else
- Go for resource DIVERSITY: secure ALL five resources between your two settlements
- Focus on ORE and WHEAT for city upgrades (numbers 5-9 preferred)
- Evaluate each potential settlement by its TOTAL PIP COUNT (sum of probability dots)
- Place your initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Avoid placing both settlements near the same resources - diversify your income!
- Always consider 3:1 ports if your initial placement gives you limited access to certain resources
- Place roads in directions that block opponents' expansion routes

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT & CITY BUILDING PRIORITY:
- FIRST PRIORITY: Build 1-2 additional settlements early to secure critical resources you lack
- SECOND PRIORITY: Upgrade to cities as quickly as possible to double resource production
- THIRD PRIORITY: Build roads only when they lead directly to valuable settlement locations
- Early game (1-5 turns): Secure key settlements at high-value locations
- Mid-game (6-15 turns): Focus heavily on upgrading to cities (2-3 cities should be your target)
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road
- When short on a key resource, use 2:1 ports if available before using 3:1 or 4:1 ports
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat to other players unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- If you have excess of a resource, use ports rather than trading with opponents

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards primarily when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber OR to reach Largest Army (3+ knights)
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city or settlement build
- Use Monopoly cards after high-probability dice rolls to collect maximum resources
- Keep track of how many VP cards you've drawn (5 in the deck total)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn
- When development cards are your path to victory, aim for: 3 cities (6 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 victory cards (2 VP)
- Consider buying development cards when you have limited build options (blocked roads, etc.)

OPTIMAL EXPANSION PATH:
- Build roads with PURPOSE - every road should lead to a viable settlement location
- Identify and secure "bottleneck" positions that cut off opponents' expansion
- Expand toward resources you LACK from initial placement - seek balance
- When choosing between multiple settlement spots, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (total pip count)
  2. Access to resources you currently lack
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, securing future expansion)
  4. Proximity to useful ports
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Longest road (2 VP) requires strategic planning - only pursue if you already have 4+ roads built

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- When someone has 8+ points, ALWAYS target them with the robber regardless of other factors
- If you're being targeted by the robber, consider using knight cards immediately to protect production

TURN-BY-TURN PLANNING:
1. Start each turn by assessing your current VP and opponents' VPs (both visible and potential hidden points)
2. Identify your build priority for this turn: settlement, city, road, or development card?
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for your priority build
4. If you can't build your priority item, determine if trading or buying a development card is better
5. Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card or trade for needed resources
6. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

WINNING PATHS:
1. CITY-FOCUSED PATH: 3-4 cities (6-8 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 9-11 VP
2. BALANCED PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 VP card = 10 VP
3. DEVELOPMENT PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP

NEVER SAY NO TO FREE VPs:
- Always account for the 2 VP from longest road and largest army in your plans
- These special cards are EASY to lose if you're not defending them
- Invest in roads/knights to maintain your lead if these VPs are part of your strategy
- Be alert for opponents trying to steal these bonus points

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Analyzing Game State for Optimal Action

Let me analyze the current game state strategically:

## Victory Point Situation
- RED: 9/10 VPs (5 settlements + 1 city + Longest Road bonus)
- BLUE (me): 4/10 VPs (4 settlements)
- RED is one point away from winning

## Resource Assessment
I currently have:
- 2 BRICK
- 1 SHEEP
- 3 ORE

## Action Options Analysis
I only have 5 options:
- [0] End turn
- [1-4] Various maritime trades

## Strategic Considerations

RED is on the verge of winning with 9/10 points and 4 hidden cards. They could potentially:
- Build another settlement (needs brick, wood, sheep, wheat)
- Upgrade a settlement to a city (needs ore, ore, wheat)
- Buy a development card (needs ore, sheep, wheat) that might be a victory point

Looking at my own resources:
- I don't have enough resources to build anything meaningful right now
- I can't steal longest road as RED has 11 road segments vs my 10
- I have 3 ORE which could potentially be used for a development card (if I could get wheat and sheep)

Given that RED has 4 hidden cards, they might be close to building something that gives them the win. My best bet might be to try to get a development card on my next turn that might help me delay their victory or advance mine.

<plan>
1. Use maritime trade to get the wheat I need for a development card
2. Buy a development card next turn (hoping for a Knight to disrupt RED or a VP card)
3. Continue working toward longest road to steal RED's 2 VP bonus
4. Look for opportunities to block RED's expansion through strategic building
</plan>

Since I have 3 ORE already and need WHEAT for a development card, trading for WHEAT seems most logical.

The only maritime trade that makes sense is:
[4] Trade port: Give 2 None for 1 WHEAT

It's unclear what "Give 2 None" means in the options, but based on the available ports, I assume this refers to using the 2:1 ORE port I have access to at nodes 40, 44.

Therefore, I'll choose option 4 to trade for wheat, which will position me to buy a development card next turn.

# Game Analysis for Settlers of Catan

Let me analyze the current game state and available options:

## Current Situation
- I have 4 VP (from 4 settlements)
- RED has 9 VP (5 settlements, 1 city, longest road bonus)
- RED is just 1 point away from winning
- I have: 2 🧱BRICK, 1 🐑SHEEP, 1 🌾WHEAT, 1 ⛏️ORE
- Available actions: End Turn [0] or Buy Development Card [1]

## Option Analysis

**Option 1: Buy a Development Card (1 🐑SHEEP, 1 🌾WHEAT, 1 ⛏️ORE)**
- I have exactly the resources needed
- Potential outcomes:
  - Knight card (5/25 chance): Would give me my 2nd knight, moving toward largest army (need 3+)
  - Victory Point card (5/25 chance): Would increase my points directly
  - Year of Plenty/Monopoly/Road Building (15/25 chance): Utility cards to help future turns

**Option 0: End Turn**
- I'd save my resources for future builds
- However, I have enough for a development card right now
- RED is very close to winning (9/10 VP), so I need to take strategic actions

## Strategic Considerations
1. RED is just 1 point from winning
2. I need to advance my position as much as possible
3. With 24 development cards remaining, I have decent chances of getting a useful card
4. Getting a knight could help disrupt RED's resource production
5. If I get a VP card, I'd be at 5 VP (halfway to winning)
6. Any development card is better than no progress this turn

<plan>
1. Buy a development card now, hoping for a Knight or VP card
2. Continue working toward longest road (I have 10 segments vs RED's 11)
3. If I get a Knight, use it strategically to block RED's key resource
4. Look for opportunities to build more settlements at strategic locations
5. Consider city upgrades when resources allow to accelerate point gain
</plan>

Given RED's near-win position and my current resources allowing for a development card purchase, I should take the opportunity to potentially gain a VP or tactical advantage.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Target hexes with HIGH probability numbers (6,8,5,9) - prioritize these above all else
- Go for resource DIVERSITY: secure ALL five resources between your two settlements
- Focus on ORE and WHEAT for city upgrades (numbers 5-9 preferred)
- Evaluate each potential settlement by its TOTAL PIP COUNT (sum of probability dots)
- Place your initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Avoid placing both settlements near the same resources - diversify your income!
- Always consider 3:1 ports if your initial placement gives you limited access to certain resources
- Place roads in directions that block opponents' expansion routes

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT & CITY BUILDING PRIORITY:
- FIRST PRIORITY: Build 1-2 additional settlements early to secure critical resources you lack
- SECOND PRIORITY: Upgrade to cities as quickly as possible to double resource production
- THIRD PRIORITY: Build roads only when they lead directly to valuable settlement locations
- Early game (1-5 turns): Secure key settlements at high-value locations
- Mid-game (6-15 turns): Focus heavily on upgrading to cities (2-3 cities should be your target)
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road
- When short on a key resource, use 2:1 ports if available before using 3:1 or 4:1 ports
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat to other players unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- If you have excess of a resource, use ports rather than trading with opponents

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards primarily when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber OR to reach Largest Army (3+ knights)
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city or settlement build
- Use Monopoly cards after high-probability dice rolls to collect maximum resources
- Keep track of how many VP cards you've drawn (5 in the deck total)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn
- When development cards are your path to victory, aim for: 3 cities (6 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 victory cards (2 VP)
- Consider buying development cards when you have limited build options (blocked roads, etc.)

OPTIMAL EXPANSION PATH:
- Build roads with PURPOSE - every road should lead to a viable settlement location
- Identify and secure "bottleneck" positions that cut off opponents' expansion
- Expand toward resources you LACK from initial placement - seek balance
- When choosing between multiple settlement spots, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (total pip count)
  2. Access to resources you currently lack
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, securing future expansion)
  4. Proximity to useful ports
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Longest road (2 VP) requires strategic planning - only pursue if you already have 4+ roads built

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- When someone has 8+ points, ALWAYS target them with the robber regardless of other factors
- If you're being targeted by the robber, consider using knight cards immediately to protect production

TURN-BY-TURN PLANNING:
1. Start each turn by assessing your current VP and opponents' VPs (both visible and potential hidden points)
2. Identify your build priority for this turn: settlement, city, road, or development card?
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for your priority build
4. If you can't build your priority item, determine if trading or buying a development card is better
5. Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card or trade for needed resources
6. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

WINNING PATHS:
1. CITY-FOCUSED PATH: 3-4 cities (6-8 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 9-11 VP
2. BALANCED PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 VP card = 10 VP
3. DEVELOPMENT PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP

NEVER SAY NO TO FREE VPs:
- Always account for the 2 VP from longest road and largest army in your plans
- These special cards are EASY to lose if you're not defending them
- Invest in roads/knights to maintain your lead if these VPs are part of your strategy
- Be alert for opponents trying to steal these bonus points

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 79 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Buy a development card now, hoping for a Knight or VP card
2. Continue working toward longest road (I have 10 segments vs RED's 11)
3. If I get a Knight, use it strategically to block RED's key resource
4. Look for opportunities to build more settlements at strategic locations
5. Consider city upgrades when resources allow to accelerate point gain

# Game Analysis for Settlers of Catan

Let me analyze the current game state and determine the optimal action:

## Current Game State
- I have 4 VP (4 settlements)
- RED has 9 VP (5 settlements, 1 city, longest road bonus)
- RED is just 1 VP away from winning
- I have 2 brick resources and 1 KNIGHT development card
- The robber is on a wood hex (-1,1,0) with value 8 (high probability)
- I have 10 road segments vs RED's 11 segments (RED has longest road)

## Action Options
[0] Play Knight card - Move robber and steal a resource
[1] Roll the dice

## Strategic Analysis

RED is dangerously close to winning with 9 VP. They could win on their next turn if they:
1. Build another settlement (reaching 10 VP)
2. Upgrade a settlement to a city (reaching 10 VP)
3. Buy a development card that might be a victory point card

Playing my Knight card would:
1. Allow me to move the robber to a hex producing resources RED needs
2. Let me steal a resource from RED (they have 6 cards)
3. Bring me closer to claiming Largest Army (I would have 2 knights played vs 0 for RED)

If I roll the dice:
1. I might get resources I need for building
2. But RED is so close to winning that any advantage they gain from the roll could be decisive

<plan>
1. Play the Knight card now to disrupt RED's production and steal a resource
2. Place the robber on a high-probability hex that RED depends on (either the brick 6, sheep 8, or wheat 5)
3. Try to gain resources to build more roads to take longest road (need 2+ more roads)
4. Continue buying development cards when possible to try for Largest Army
5. Look for settlement opportunities at strategic locations
</plan>

Given RED's commanding lead (9 VP vs my 4 VP) and their closeness to victory, disrupting their production and possibly stealing a key resource is critical. Playing the Knight card now is clearly the better strategic choice as it gives me the best chance to slow RED down and potentially steal a resource they need.

# Analysis of Robber Placement Options

I need to strategically position the robber to maximize my chances of winning. First, let me assess the game state:

- RED has 9 VP with Longest Road (2 VP)
- I (BLUE) have 4 VP and am far behind
- RED has 6 hidden resource cards that I could potentially steal
- My priority should be disrupting RED's production while improving my own position

## Key Hex Analysis

Let me identify RED's most valuable production hexes:
1. Brick 6 (1,-1,0) - HIGH value (⭐⭐⭐) - connected to 2 RED settlements
2. Sheep 8 (2,-2,0) - HIGH value (⭐⭐⭐) - connected to 2 RED settlements
3. Wheat 5 (2,0,-2) - MEDIUM value (⭐⭐) - connected to 1 RED settlement
4. Wood 8 (-1,1,0) - HIGH value (⭐⭐⭐) - this is already blocked by the robber

## Strategic Considerations:

1. RED is at 9 VP and close to winning
2. RED has Longest Road (2 VP), which I need to take if possible
3. I need to disrupt RED's most valuable resource production
4. I need brick to build more roads to potentially take Longest Road

## Optimal Placement Options:

- Option [1]: Move robber to Brick 6 (1,-1,0) - Blocks RED's critical brick production from two settlements, and allows me to steal a card.
- Option [6]: Move robber to Sheep 8 (2,-2,0) - Blocks RED's valuable sheep production from two settlements.
- Option [16]: Move robber to Wheat 5 (2,0,-2) - Blocks RED's wheat production, critical for cities.

## Final Decision:
Option [1] is optimal because:
- Brick is RED's most crucial resource for maintaining and extending Longest Road
- RED has two settlements on this hex, severely impacting their production
- I need to steal brick if possible to build my own roads and challenge Longest Road
- This disrupts RED's ability to further extend their road network

<plan>
1. Block RED's brick production with the robber at hex (1,-1,0)
2. Continue building roads toward taking Longest Road from RED (need 2+ more roads)
3. Look for settlement opportunities at strategic locations
4. Buy development cards when possible to try for Largest Army
5. Target taking RED's Longest Road as my primary path to victory
</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Target hexes with HIGH probability numbers (6,8,5,9) - prioritize these above all else
- Go for resource DIVERSITY: secure ALL five resources between your two settlements
- Focus on ORE and WHEAT for city upgrades (numbers 5-9 preferred)
- Evaluate each potential settlement by its TOTAL PIP COUNT (sum of probability dots)
- Place your initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Avoid placing both settlements near the same resources - diversify your income!
- Always consider 3:1 ports if your initial placement gives you limited access to certain resources
- Place roads in directions that block opponents' expansion routes

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT & CITY BUILDING PRIORITY:
- FIRST PRIORITY: Build 1-2 additional settlements early to secure critical resources you lack
- SECOND PRIORITY: Upgrade to cities as quickly as possible to double resource production
- THIRD PRIORITY: Build roads only when they lead directly to valuable settlement locations
- Early game (1-5 turns): Secure key settlements at high-value locations
- Mid-game (6-15 turns): Focus heavily on upgrading to cities (2-3 cities should be your target)
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road
- When short on a key resource, use 2:1 ports if available before using 3:1 or 4:1 ports
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat to other players unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- If you have excess of a resource, use ports rather than trading with opponents

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards primarily when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber OR to reach Largest Army (3+ knights)
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city or settlement build
- Use Monopoly cards after high-probability dice rolls to collect maximum resources
- Keep track of how many VP cards you've drawn (5 in the deck total)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn
- When development cards are your path to victory, aim for: 3 cities (6 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 victory cards (2 VP)
- Consider buying development cards when you have limited build options (blocked roads, etc.)

OPTIMAL EXPANSION PATH:
- Build roads with PURPOSE - every road should lead to a viable settlement location
- Identify and secure "bottleneck" positions that cut off opponents' expansion
- Expand toward resources you LACK from initial placement - seek balance
- When choosing between multiple settlement spots, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (total pip count)
  2. Access to resources you currently lack
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, securing future expansion)
  4. Proximity to useful ports
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Longest road (2 VP) requires strategic planning - only pursue if you already have 4+ roads built

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- When someone has 8+ points, ALWAYS target them with the robber regardless of other factors
- If you're being targeted by the robber, consider using knight cards immediately to protect production

TURN-BY-TURN PLANNING:
1. Start each turn by assessing your current VP and opponents' VPs (both visible and potential hidden points)
2. Identify your build priority for this turn: settlement, city, road, or development card?
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for your priority build
4. If you can't build your priority item, determine if trading or buying a development card is better
5. Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card or trade for needed resources
6. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

WINNING PATHS:
1. CITY-FOCUSED PATH: 3-4 cities (6-8 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 9-11 VP
2. BALANCED PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 VP card = 10 VP
3. DEVELOPMENT PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP

NEVER SAY NO TO FREE VPs:
- Always account for the 2 VP from longest road and largest army in your plans
- These special cards are EASY to lose if you're not defending them
- Invest in roads/knights to maintain your lead if these VPs are part of your strategy
- Be alert for opponents trying to steal these bonus points

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 81 | Player: BLUE | Action: MOVE_ROBBER

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Block RED's brick production with the robber at hex (1,-1,0)
2. Continue building roads toward taking Longest Road from RED (need 2+ more roads)
3. Look for settlement opportunities at strategic locations
4. Buy development cards when possible to try for Largest Army
5. Target taking RED's Longest Road as my primary path to victory

# Analyzing Robber Placement Options

I need to carefully analyze the game state and determine the optimal robber placement to maximize my chances of winning.

## Game Status Analysis
- RED is leading with 9 VP, just 1 away from winning
- I (BLUE) have only 4 VP, so I'm far behind
- RED has the Longest Road (11 segments) worth 2 VP
- My plan involves taking the Longest Road from RED
- RED has 7 hidden resource cards
- I have 1 WOOD, 2 BRICK, 1 WHEAT

## Target Analysis
Since RED is close to winning (9/10 VP), disrupting their resource production is critical. Looking at their buildings and the high-value hexes:

1. RED's key production:
   - Brick at (1,-1,0) with value 6 (⭐⭐⭐) - Currently blocked by robber
   - Sheep at (2,-2,0) with value 8 (⭐⭐⭐)
   - Wood at (-1,1,0) with value 8 (⭐⭐⭐)

2. Other valuable tiles for RED:
   - Sheep at (1,-2,1) with value 9 (⭐⭐)
   - Wood at (-1,-1,2) with value 9 (⭐⭐)
   - Wheat at (2,0,-2) with value 5 (⭐⭐)

## Strategic Considerations
1. The robber is already on the Brick hex (1,-1,0) with value 6, which is a good placement
2. My current plan is to block RED's brick production to slow their road building
3. However, I should consider if there are better hexes to target now
4. Stealing from RED could give me a valuable resource

## Optimal Target Evaluation
- Option [6]: Moving to (2,-2,0) targets RED's sheep production with value 8 (⭐⭐⭐) at node 7 and 27
- Option [3]: Moving to (-1,1,0) targets RED's wood production with value 8 (⭐⭐⭐) at node 5
- Option [7]: Moving to (1,-2,1) targets RED's sheep production with value 9 (⭐⭐) at node 27

Since I need to build roads to take Longest Road, blocking RED's wood production seems most effective to prevent them from extending their road network further. RED's city at node 5 produces wood from the 8-value wood hex, making this an even more impactful target.

<plan>
1. Block RED's wood production with the robber at hex (-1,1,0)
2. Continue building roads toward taking Longest Road from RED (need 2+ more roads)
3. Look for settlement opportunities at strategic locations
4. Buy development cards when possible to try for Largest Army
5. Target taking RED's Longest Road as my primary path to victory
</plan>

Based on the analysis, I'll choose to move the robber to the wood hex with value 8 at (-1,1,0) and steal from RED.

- NEVER trade away ore or wheat to other players unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- If you have excess of a resource, use ports rather than trading with opponents

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards primarily when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber OR to reach Largest Army (3+ knights)
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city or settlement build
- Use Monopoly cards after high-probability dice rolls to collect maximum resources
- Keep track of how many VP cards you've drawn (5 in the deck total)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn
- When development cards are your path to victory, aim for: 3 cities (6 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 victory cards (2 VP)
- Consider buying development cards when you have limited build options (blocked roads, etc.)

# Game Analysis: Robber Placement Decision

I need to evaluate the best hex to place my robber to maximize my chances of winning while disrupting RED who is at 9/10 victory points and close to winning.

## Situation Assessment
- RED is at 9/10 VP (very close to winning)
- I (BLUE) am at 4/10 VP (far behind)
- RED has longest road (11 segments, 2 VP)
- My plan involves taking longest road from RED

## Key Considerations
1. Disrupt RED's highest value resources
2. Target resources RED needs to expand
3. Prioritize high probability numbers
4. Consider what resource I might steal

## Analyzing Top Options

Looking at RED's settlements/cities:
- RED produces most from: Brick (6), Sheep (8), Wood (8), Wood(4)
- RED has several high probability tiles (8s, 6s)

Best robber candidates:
- Tile (1, -1, 0): Brick 6 [⭐⭐⭐] - Blocks RED's access to critical brick (needed for roads)
- Tile (2, -2, 0): Sheep 8 [⭐⭐⭐] - Blocks RED's access to high-value sheep
- Tile (0, 0, 0): Wood 4 [⭐] - Less valuable but blocks multiple settlements

Since RED is close to winning and likely trying to extend their road network or build another settlement, blocking brick production would be most damaging to their strategy. This also aligns with my goal of competing for longest road.

<plan>
1. Block RED's brick production with robber at hex (1,-1,0)
2. Continue building roads to compete for longest road (need 2+ more roads)
3. Look for settlement opportunities at strategic locations
4. Buy development cards when possible to try for Largest Army
5. Target taking RED's Longest Road as my primary path to victory
</plan>

The optimal choice is to place the robber on the brick 6 hex, which is option 1.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Target hexes with HIGH probability numbers (6,8,5,9) - prioritize these above all else
- Go for resource DIVERSITY: secure ALL five resources between your two settlements
- Focus on ORE and WHEAT for city upgrades (numbers 5-9 preferred)
- Evaluate each potential settlement by its TOTAL PIP COUNT (sum of probability dots)
- Place your initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Avoid placing both settlements near the same resources - diversify your income!
- Always consider 3:1 ports if your initial placement gives you limited access to certain resources
- Place roads in directions that block opponents' expansion routes

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT & CITY BUILDING PRIORITY:
- FIRST PRIORITY: Build 1-2 additional settlements early to secure critical resources you lack
- SECOND PRIORITY: Upgrade to cities as quickly as possible to double resource production
- THIRD PRIORITY: Build roads only when they lead directly to valuable settlement locations
- Early game (1-5 turns): Secure key settlements at high-value locations
- Mid-game (6-15 turns): Focus heavily on upgrading to cities (2-3 cities should be your target)
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road
- When short on a key resource, use 2:1 ports if available before using 3:1 or 4:1 ports
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat to other players unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- If you have excess of a resource, use ports rather than trading with opponents

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards primarily when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber OR to reach Largest Army (3+ knights)
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city or settlement build
- Use Monopoly cards after high-probability dice rolls to collect maximum resources
- Keep track of how many VP cards you've drawn (5 in the deck total)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn
- When development cards are your path to victory, aim for: 3 cities (6 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 victory cards (2 VP)
- Consider buying development cards when you have limited build options (blocked roads, etc.)

OPTIMAL EXPANSION PATH:
- Build roads with PURPOSE - every road should lead to a viable settlement location
- Identify and secure "bottleneck" positions that cut off opponents' expansion
- Expand toward resources you LACK from initial placement - seek balance
- When choosing between multiple settlement spots, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (total pip count)
  2. Access to resources you currently lack
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, securing future expansion)
  4. Proximity to useful ports
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Longest road (2 VP) requires strategic planning - only pursue if you already have 4+ roads built

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- When someone has 8+ points, ALWAYS target them with the robber regardless of other factors
- If you're being targeted by the robber, consider using knight cards immediately to protect production

TURN-BY-TURN PLANNING:
1. Start each turn by assessing your current VP and opponents' VPs (both visible and potential hidden points)
2. Identify your build priority for this turn: settlement, city, road, or development card?
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for your priority build
4. If you can't build your priority item, determine if trading or buying a development card is better
5. Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card or trade for needed resources
6. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

WINNING PATHS:
1. CITY-FOCUSED PATH: 3-4 cities (6-8 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 9-11 VP
2. BALANCED PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 VP card = 10 VP
3. DEVELOPMENT PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP

NEVER SAY NO TO FREE VPs:
- Always account for the 2 VP from longest road and largest army in your plans
- These special cards are EASY to lose if you're not defending them
- Invest in roads/knights to maintain your lead if these VPs are part of your strategy
- Be alert for opponents trying to steal these bonus points

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 85 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Block RED's brick production with robber at hex (1,-1,0)
2. Continue building roads to compete for longest road (need 2+ more roads)

# Analyzing the Game State

Let me carefully analyze the current game state and determine the best action.

## Current Victory Points
- RED: 9/10 VP (5 settlements, 1 city, longest road bonus)
- BLUE (me): 4/10 VP (4 settlements, 0 cities)

RED is only 1 point away from winning, which puts me in a very dangerous position.

## My Resources
- 2 WOOD
- 3 BRICK
- 1 SHEEP
- 3 WHEAT
- No development cards

## Available Actions
0. End turn
1. Build settlement at node 19
2. Build settlement at node 21
3. Build settlement at node 38

## Settlement Analysis

Let me analyze each potential settlement location:

**Node 19**:
- Connected to hexes: ⛏️3, ⛏️11, 🐑4
- Production: Ore from two hexes (3 and 11) and sheep (4)
- Numbers: 3 (low), 11 (medium), 4 (low) - overall medium production potential
- Strategic value: Access to ore which I need for city upgrades

**Node 21**:
- Connected to hexes: ⛏️3, 🧱11, 🌾3
- Production: Ore, brick, and wheat
- Numbers: 3 (low), 11 (medium), 3 (low) - overall medium-low production
- Strategic value: Resource diversity

**Node 38**:
- Connected to hexes: 🌲6, one or more hexes not clearly visible
- Numbers: 6 (high)
- Strategic value: At the 3:1 port (nodes 38, 39 mentioned as port locations)

## Strategic Considerations

1. RED is at 9 points and very close to winning. I need to make significant progress.
2. I have 4 points now, far behind RED.
3. My longest road is 10 segments, while RED's is 11. 
4. If I could build more roads and take longest road, that would be a 4-point swing (RED -2, me +2).
5. I need settlements for more production and points.
6. Building a settlement gives me +1 VP immediately.

## Decision Analysis

Settlement at node 19 seems most valuable because:
- It gives access to TWO ore-producing hexes, which I desperately need for city upgrades
- Ore is critical for my development card strategy (mentioned in my plan)
- It provides immediate +1 VP

I have exactly the resources needed to build a settlement (1 wood, 1 brick, 1 wheat, 1 sheep).

<plan>
1. Build settlement at node 19 to secure ore production
2. Focus on upgrading settlements to cities for rapid VP gain
3. Continue building roads to compete for longest road
4. Buy development cards when possible to try for Largest Army
5. Target both city development and longest road as my path to victory
</plan>

Building a settlement at node 19 is my best move as it gives me access to much-needed ore production while immediately increasing my VP count.

- NEVER trade away ore or wheat to other players unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- If you have excess of a resource, use ports rather than trading with opponents

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards primarily when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber OR to reach Largest Army (3+ knights)
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city or settlement build
- Use Monopoly cards after high-probability dice rolls to collect maximum resources

- Consider buying development cards when you have limited build options (blocked roads, etc.)

OPTIMAL EXPANSION PATH:
- Build roads with PURPOSE - every road should lead to a viable settlement location
- Identify and secure "bottleneck" positions that cut off opponents' expansion
- Expand toward resources you LACK from initial placement - seek balance
- When choosing between multiple settlement spots, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (total pip count)
  2. Access to resources you currently lack
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, securing future expansion)
  4. Proximity to useful ports
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Longest road (2 VP) requires strategic planning - only pursue if you already have 4+ roads built

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- When someone has 8+ points, ALWAYS target them with the robber regardless of other factors
- If you're being targeted by the robber, consider using knight cards immediately to protect production

TURN-BY-TURN PLANNING:
1. Start each turn by assessing your current VP and opponents' VPs (both visible and potential hidden points)
2. Identify your build priority for this turn: settlement, city, road, or development card?
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for your priority build
4. If you can't build your priority item, determine if trading or buying a development card is better
5. Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card or trade for needed resources
6. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

WINNING PATHS:
1. CITY-FOCUSED PATH: 3-4 cities (6-8 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 9-11 VP
2. BALANCED PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 VP card = 10 VP
3. DEVELOPMENT PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP

NEVER SAY NO TO FREE VPs:
- Always account for the 2 VP from longest road and largest army in your plans
- These special cards are EASY to lose if you're not defending them
- Invest in roads/knights to maintain your lead if these VPs are part of your strategy
- Be alert for opponents trying to steal these bonus points

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state and available options carefully:

## Current Situation
- I have 5 VP (5 settlements, 0 cities)
- Red has 9 VP (5 settlements, 1 city, longest road +2 VP) - only needs 1 more VP to win
- My resources: 1 wood, 2 brick, 1 sheep, 2 wheat, 2 ore
- The robber is blocking a brick hex (1, -1, 0) which is a 6 (high productivity)
- I have played 2 knight cards already, need 1 more to get Largest Army
- Red has longest road (11 segments vs my 10)

## Victory Path Assessment
Red is close to winning with 9 VP. They only need to build one more settlement (or a VP development card) to win. This is an urgent situation.

## Available Actions
1. End turn
2. Buy development card (1 sheep, 1 wheat, 1 ore)
3-5. Various port trades

## Action Analysis

**Option 1: Buy Development Card**
This is my most promising option because:
- It could give me a Victory Point card (immediate help)
- It could give me a Knight (moving me closer to Largest Army)
- It could give me a helpful Progress card (Year of Plenty, Monopoly, Road Building)
- Development cards are hidden until played, adding strategic uncertainty
- I have exactly the resources needed (1 sheep, 1 wheat, 1 ore)

If I get a Knight, I'd move to 3 knights total, earning the Largest Army bonus (2 VP), increasing to 7 VP.
If I get a VP card, I'd increase to 6 VP.

**End Turn Option:**
Ending my turn provides no benefit and allows Red to potentially win on their turn.

**Maritime Trades:**
None of these trades currently help me take immediate action that would increase my VP or block Red.

<plan>
1. Buy development cards to compete for largest army (need 1 more knight)
2. Use development cards to disrupt Red's resource collection with knights
3. Attempt to extend my road network to compete for longest road
4. Upgrade settlements to cities when possible for VP gain
5. Block Red's expansion opportunities
</plan>

Given that Red is at 9/10 VP and could win on their next turn, my best move is to buy a development card hoping for either a VP card or Knight to secure Largest Army (which would give me 2 more VP).

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Target hexes with HIGH probability numbers (6,8,5,9) - prioritize these above all else
- Go for resource DIVERSITY: secure ALL five resources between your two settlements
- Focus on ORE and WHEAT for city upgrades (numbers 5-9 preferred)
- Evaluate each potential settlement by its TOTAL PIP COUNT (sum of probability dots)
- Place your initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Avoid placing both settlements near the same resources - diversify your income!
- Always consider 3:1 ports if your initial placement gives you limited access to certain resources
- Place roads in directions that block opponents' expansion routes

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT & CITY BUILDING PRIORITY:
- FIRST PRIORITY: Build 1-2 additional settlements early to secure critical resources you lack
- SECOND PRIORITY: Upgrade to cities as quickly as possible to double resource production
- THIRD PRIORITY: Build roads only when they lead directly to valuable settlement locations
- Early game (1-5 turns): Secure key settlements at high-value locations
- Mid-game (6-15 turns): Focus heavily on upgrading to cities (2-3 cities should be your target)
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road
- When short on a key resource, use 2:1 ports if available before using 3:1 or 4:1 ports
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat to other players unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- If you have excess of a resource, use ports rather than trading with opponents

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards primarily when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber OR to reach Largest Army (3+ knights)
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city or settlement build
- Use Monopoly cards after high-probability dice rolls to collect maximum resources
- Keep track of how many VP cards you've drawn (5 in the deck total)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn
- When development cards are your path to victory, aim for: 3 cities (6 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 victory cards (2 VP)
- Consider buying development cards when you have limited build options (blocked roads, etc.)

OPTIMAL EXPANSION PATH:
- Build roads with PURPOSE - every road should lead to a viable settlement location
- Identify and secure "bottleneck" positions that cut off opponents' expansion
- Expand toward resources you LACK from initial placement - seek balance
- When choosing between multiple settlement spots, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (total pip count)
  2. Access to resources you currently lack
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, securing future expansion)
  4. Proximity to useful ports
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Longest road (2 VP) requires strategic planning - only pursue if you already have 4+ roads built

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- When someone has 8+ points, ALWAYS target them with the robber regardless of other factors
- If you're being targeted by the robber, consider using knight cards immediately to protect production

TURN-BY-TURN PLANNING:
1. Start each turn by assessing your current VP and opponents' VPs (both visible and potential hidden points)

3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for your priority build
4. If you can't build your priority item, determine if trading or buying a development card is better
5. Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card or trade for needed resources
6. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

WINNING PATHS:
1. CITY-FOCUSED PATH: 3-4 cities (6-8 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 9-11 VP
2. BALANCED PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 VP card = 10 VP
3. DEVELOPMENT PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP

NEVER SAY NO TO FREE VPs:
- Always account for the 2 VP from longest road and largest army in your plans
- These special cards are EASY to lose if you're not defending them
- Invest in roads/knights to maintain your lead if these VPs are part of your strategy
- Be alert for opponents trying to steal these bonus points

# Analysis of Game State

Let me assess the current game state:

- **Victory Points**:
  - RED: 9/10 (very close to winning)
  - BLUE (me): 5/10 (significantly behind)

- **Key Resources**:
  - I have: 1 Wood, 2 Brick, 1 Wheat, 3 Ore
  - I can't build anything significant immediately with these resources

- **Development Cards**:
  - I have 1 Knight card
  - I've already played 2 Knight cards
  - RED has no development cards

- **Special Bonuses**:
  - RED has Longest Road (+2 VP)
  - No one has Largest Army (needs 3 knights minimum)

## Strategic Options

RED is one point away from winning, which makes this an emergency situation. My options:

1. **Play Knight (Action 0)**:
   - I can move the robber to a high-value hex for RED
   - I can steal a resource from RED
   - This brings me to 3 played knights, potentially securing Largest Army (+2 VP)
   - This disrupts RED's production at a critical moment

2. **Roll Dice (Action 1)**:
   - Standard progression of the game
   - Might get resources to build something
   - Does nothing to stop RED who is likely to win on their next turn

## Decision

Given that RED is at 9 VP and could win on their next turn, my priority must be disruption. Playing my Knight card is optimal because:

1. I'll get to 3 knights played, securing Largest Army (+2 VP), bringing me to 7 VP
2. I can disrupt RED's resource production by placing the robber on a high-value hex
3. I can potentially steal a valuable resource from RED

<plan>
1. Play Knight to secure Largest Army (+2 VP)
2. Target RED's highest production hex with the robber (probably 🐑8 or 🧱6)
3. Continue building toward longest road to potentially steal that bonus
4. Convert settlements to cities when possible
5. Buy more development cards for potential VPs
</plan>

The optimal decision is to play my Knight card.

- Place your initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Avoid placing both settlements near the same resources - diversify your income!
- Always consider 3:1 ports if your initial placement gives you limited access to certain resources
- Place roads in directions that block opponents' expansion routes

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT & CITY BUILDING PRIORITY:
- FIRST PRIORITY: Build 1-2 additional settlements early to secure critical resources you lack
- SECOND PRIORITY: Upgrade to cities as quickly as possible to double resource production
- THIRD PRIORITY: Build roads only when they lead directly to valuable settlement locations
- Early game (1-5 turns): Secure key settlements at high-value locations
- Mid-game (6-15 turns): Focus heavily on upgrading to cities (2-3 cities should be your target)
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road
- When short on a key resource, use 2:1 ports if available before using 3:1 or 4:1 ports
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat to other players unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- If you have excess of a resource, use ports rather than trading with opponents

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards primarily when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber OR to reach Largest Army (3+ knights)
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city or settlement build
- Use Monopoly cards after high-probability dice rolls to collect maximum resources
- Keep track of how many VP cards you've drawn (5 in the deck total)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn
- When development cards are your path to victory, aim for: 3 cities (6 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 victory cards (2 VP)
- Consider buying development cards when you have limited build options (blocked roads, etc.)

OPTIMAL EXPANSION PATH:
- Build roads with PURPOSE - every road should lead to a viable settlement location
- Identify and secure "bottleneck" positions that cut off opponents' expansion
- Expand toward resources you LACK from initial placement - seek balance
- When choosing between multiple settlement spots, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (total pip count)
  2. Access to resources you currently lack
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, securing future expansion)
  4. Proximity to useful ports
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Longest road (2 VP) requires strategic planning - only pursue if you already have 4+ roads built

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- When someone has 8+ points, ALWAYS target them with the robber regardless of other factors
- If you're being targeted by the robber, consider using knight cards immediately to protect production

TURN-BY-TURN PLANNING:
1. Start each turn by assessing your current VP and opponents' VPs (both visible and potential hidden points)
2. Identify your build priority for this turn: settlement, city, road, or development card?
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for your priority build
4. If you can't build your priority item, determine if trading or buying a development card is better
5. Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card or trade for needed resources
6. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

WINNING PATHS:
1. CITY-FOCUSED PATH: 3-4 cities (6-8 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 9-11 VP
2. BALANCED PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 VP card = 10 VP
3. DEVELOPMENT PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP

NEVER SAY NO TO FREE VPs:
- Always account for the 2 VP from longest road and largest army in your plans
- These special cards are EASY to lose if you're not defending them
- Invest in roads/knights to maintain your lead if these VPs are part of your strategy
- Be alert for opponents trying to steal these bonus points

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 89 | Player: BLUE | Action: MOVE_ROBBER

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Play Knight to secure Largest Army (+2 VP)
2. Target RED's highest production hex with the robber (probably 🐑8 or 🧱6)
3. Continue building toward longest road to potentially steal that bonus
4. Convert settlements to cities when possible
5. Buy more development cards for potential VPs

RESPONSE:
# Game Analysis: Where to Move the Robber

I need to move the robber strategically to disrupt RED's production while maximizing my chances of getting useful resources when stealing.

## Opponent Assessment
- RED has 9/10 victory points (only needs 1 more to win)
- RED has 12 hidden resource cards
- RED currently holds Longest Road bonus (+2 VP)
- RED has 5 settlements and 1 city

## My Position
- I have 7/10 victory points
- I hold Largest Army bonus (+2 VP)
- I have 1 🌲WOOD, 2 🧱BRICK, 1 🌾WHEAT, 3 ⛏️ORE
- I need more resources to either:
  1. Build cities (need more wheat)
  2. Extend my roads to steal Longest Road (need more wood/brick)
  3. Buy development cards (need sheep/wheat/ore)

## Strategic Robber Placement

Looking at RED's highest-producing hexes:
- 🧱6 (⭐⭐⭐) - Currently blocked by robber
- 🐑8 (⭐⭐⭐) at (2, -2, 0) - Hex #6 in options
- 🌲8 (⭐⭐⭐) at (-1, 1, 0) - Hex #3 in options
- 🧱6 (⭐⭐⭐) at (1, -1, 0) - Currently blocked by robber

RED's settlements at nodes 7 and 27 both produce high-value resources from 🐑8 with ⭐⭐⭐. This is a great target.

RED's city at node 5 produces from 🌲8, so that's another excellent target.

Since RED is just 1 VP away from winning, I need to block their most productive hex.

<plan>
1. Block RED's highest production hex (🐑8 or 🌲8)
2. Try to steal a useful resource (wood/brick would help me build roads toward longest road)
3. Continue building toward longest road to steal that bonus
4. Convert settlements to cities when possible
5. Buy more development cards if I get sheep
</plan>

Between 🐑8 and 🌲8:
- 🐑8 affects two of RED's settlements (nodes 7 and 27)
- 🌲8 affects RED's city at node 5 (double production)

The most impactful choice is to move the robber to the 🌲8 hex at (-1, 1, 0), which corresponds to option #3. This blocks RED's city and gives me a chance to steal resources, potentially wood which would help me extend my road network.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Target hexes with HIGH probability numbers (6,8,5,9) - prioritize these above all else
- Go for resource DIVERSITY: secure ALL five resources between your two settlements
- Focus on ORE and WHEAT for city upgrades (numbers 5-9 preferred)
- Evaluate each potential settlement by its TOTAL PIP COUNT (sum of probability dots)
- Place your initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Avoid placing both settlements near the same resources - diversify your income!
- Always consider 3:1 ports if your initial placement gives you limited access to certain resources
- Place roads in directions that block opponents' expansion routes

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT & CITY BUILDING PRIORITY:
- FIRST PRIORITY: Build 1-2 additional settlements early to secure critical resources you lack
- SECOND PRIORITY: Upgrade to cities as quickly as possible to double resource production
- THIRD PRIORITY: Build roads only when they lead directly to valuable settlement locations
- Early game (1-5 turns): Secure key settlements at high-value locations
- Mid-game (6-15 turns): Focus heavily on upgrading to cities (2-3 cities should be your target)
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road
- When short on a key resource, use 2:1 ports if available before using 3:1 or 4:1 ports
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat to other players unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- If you have excess of a resource, use ports rather than trading with opponents

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards primarily when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber OR to reach Largest Army (3+ knights)
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city or settlement build
- Use Monopoly cards after high-probability dice rolls to collect maximum resources
- Keep track of how many VP cards you've drawn (5 in the deck total)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn
- When development cards are your path to victory, aim for: 3 cities (6 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 victory cards (2 VP)
- Consider buying development cards when you have limited build options (blocked roads, etc.)

OPTIMAL EXPANSION PATH:
- Build roads with PURPOSE - every road should lead to a viable settlement location
- Identify and secure "bottleneck" positions that cut off opponents' expansion
- Expand toward resources you LACK from initial placement - seek balance
- When choosing between multiple settlement spots, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (total pip count)
  2. Access to resources you currently lack
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, securing future expansion)
  4. Proximity to useful ports
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Longest road (2 VP) requires strategic planning - only pursue if you already have 4+ roads built

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- When someone has 8+ points, ALWAYS target them with the robber regardless of other factors
- If you're being targeted by the robber, consider using knight cards immediately to protect production

TURN-BY-TURN PLANNING:
1. Start each turn by assessing your current VP and opponents' VPs (both visible and potential hidden points)
2. Identify your build priority for this turn: settlement, city, road, or development card?
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for your priority build
4. If you can't build your priority item, determine if trading or buying a development card is better
5. Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card or trade for needed resources
6. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

WINNING PATHS:
1. CITY-FOCUSED PATH: 3-4 cities (6-8 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 9-11 VP
2. BALANCED PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 VP card = 10 VP
3. DEVELOPMENT PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP

NEVER SAY NO TO FREE VPs:
- Always account for the 2 VP from longest road and largest army in your plans
- These special cards are EASY to lose if you're not defending them
- Invest in roads/knights to maintain your lead if these VPs are part of your strategy
- Be alert for opponents trying to steal these bonus points

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state before making my decision.

## Current Standings
- RED: 9/10 VP (5 settlements + 1 city + Longest Road bonus)
- BLUE: 7/10 VP (5 settlements + Largest Army bonus)

Red is dangerously close to winning, just 1 VP away. I need to make progress toward victory.

## My Resources
- 1 WOOD, 3 BRICK, 1 SHEEP, 1 WHEAT, 4 ORE

## Available Options
1. End Turn (Action 0)
2. Buy Development Card (Action 1) - costs 1 SHEEP, 1 WHEAT, 1 ORE
3. Maritime Trade Options (Actions 2-5) - all require resources I don't have enough of

## Strategic Analysis

The robber is currently on (-1, 1, 0) which is a wood hex with value 8. This is a good position for me since it blocks one of RED's high-value resources.

I need to formulate a path to victory:
- I currently have 7 VP
- I need 3 more VP to win
- Options for VPs:
  1. Build cities (+1 VP each, need 2 ORE + 3 WHEAT)
  2. Build settlements (+1 VP each, need 1 WOOD + 1 BRICK + 1 SHEEP + 1 WHEAT)
  3. Development cards (potential VP cards or knights to maintain Largest Army)
  4. Steal Longest Road from RED (I have 10 roads vs RED's 11)

With my current resources, I can't build any settlements or cities immediately.

I have enough resources to buy a development card (1 SHEEP, 1 WHEAT, 1 ORE). This could give me:
- A VP card (immediate progress)
- A knight (strengthen Largest Army)
- Year of Plenty or Monopoly (help get resources for settlements/cities)
- Road Building (help take Longest Road)

I have 4 ORE, so my path to cities is closer than it appears - I just need wheat.

<plan>
1. Buy a development card hoping for a VP card, knight, or utility card
2. Continue blocking RED's high production with the robber
3. Work toward building a city (need 1 more ore and 3 wheat) 
4. If I get road building cards, continue expanding roads to steal Longest Road
5. Keep RED from reaching 10 VP at all costs
</plan>

Given my resources and options, buying a development card is the most strategic move. It's my only productive action this turn, and it can potentially give me a direct VP card or help with future resource gathering.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Target hexes with HIGH probability numbers (6,8,5,9) - prioritize these above all else
- Go for resource DIVERSITY: secure ALL five resources between your two settlements
- Focus on ORE and WHEAT for city upgrades (numbers 5-9 preferred)
- Evaluate each potential settlement by its TOTAL PIP COUNT (sum of probability dots)
- Place your initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Avoid placing both settlements near the same resources - diversify your income!
- Always consider 3:1 ports if your initial placement gives you limited access to certain resources
- Place roads in directions that block opponents' expansion routes

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT & CITY BUILDING PRIORITY:
- FIRST PRIORITY: Build 1-2 additional settlements early to secure critical resources you lack
- SECOND PRIORITY: Upgrade to cities as quickly as possible to double resource production
- THIRD PRIORITY: Build roads only when they lead directly to valuable settlement locations
- Early game (1-5 turns): Secure key settlements at high-value locations
- Mid-game (6-15 turns): Focus heavily on upgrading to cities (2-3 cities should be your target)
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road
- When short on a key resource, use 2:1 ports if available before using 3:1 or 4:1 ports
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat to other players unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- If you have excess of a resource, use ports rather than trading with opponents

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards primarily when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber OR to reach Largest Army (3+ knights)
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city or settlement build
- Use Monopoly cards after high-probability dice rolls to collect maximum resources
- Keep track of how many VP cards you've drawn (5 in the deck total)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn
- When development cards are your path to victory, aim for: 3 cities (6 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 victory cards (2 VP)
- Consider buying development cards when you have limited build options (blocked roads, etc.)

OPTIMAL EXPANSION PATH:
- Build roads with PURPOSE - every road should lead to a viable settlement location
- Identify and secure "bottleneck" positions that cut off opponents' expansion
- Expand toward resources you LACK from initial placement - seek balance
- When choosing between multiple settlement spots, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (total pip count)
  2. Access to resources you currently lack
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, securing future expansion)
  4. Proximity to useful ports
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Longest road (2 VP) requires strategic planning - only pursue if you already have 4+ roads built

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- When someone has 8+ points, ALWAYS target them with the robber regardless of other factors
- If you're being targeted by the robber, consider using knight cards immediately to protect production

TURN-BY-TURN PLANNING:
1. Start each turn by assessing your current VP and opponents' VPs (both visible and potential hidden points)
2. Identify your build priority for this turn: settlement, city, road, or development card?
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for your priority build
4. If you can't build your priority item, determine if trading or buying a development card is better
5. Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card or trade for needed resources
6. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

WINNING PATHS:
1. CITY-FOCUSED PATH: 3-4 cities (6-8 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 9-11 VP
2. BALANCED PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 VP card = 10 VP
3. DEVELOPMENT PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP

NEVER SAY NO TO FREE VPs:
- Always account for the 2 VP from longest road and largest army in your plans
- These special cards are EASY to lose if you're not defending them
- Invest in roads/knights to maintain your lead if these VPs are part of your strategy
- Be alert for opponents trying to steal these bonus points

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

2. Continue blocking RED's high production with the robber

# Game State Analysis

Let me carefully analyze the current game state and my options:

## Victory Points Analysis
- I (BLUE) have 7 VP: 5 settlements (5 VP) + Largest Army (2 VP)
- RED has 9 VP: 5 settlements (5 VP) + 1 city (2 VP) + Longest Road (2 VP)
- RED is just 1 VP away from winning, making them a serious threat

## Resources
- I have: 1 WOOD, 3 BRICK, 3 ORE
- I also have 1 unplayed KNIGHT card

## Building Options
With my current resources:
- I can't build a settlement (need 1 WOOD, 1 BRICK, 1 SHEEP, 1 WHEAT)
- I can't build a city (need 3 ORE, 2 WHEAT)
- I can't buy a development card (need 1 SHEEP, 1 WHEAT, 1 ORE)
- I can build roads, but I have no clear strategic expansion targets right now

## Maritime Trade Options
The available trade options (actions 1-4) all start with "Give 2 None" which seems to be an error in the prompt. However, I appear to have access to the 2:1 ORE port (nodes 40, 44).

## Strategic Considerations
1. RED is at 9 VP and could win on their next turn
2. I need to increase my VP production to catch up
3. I could aim to build a city (need 2 WHEAT)
4. I could aim to steal Longest Road from RED (need to build more roads)
5. I could aim for more development cards (need SHEEP and WHEAT)

<plan>
1. End my turn since I can't make any productive trades or builds
2. Continue blocking RED's high production with the robber
3. Work toward building a city (need 2 WHEAT)
4. Consider buying development cards if I get SHEEP and WHEAT
5. Keep blocking RED from reaching 10 VP
</plan>

Given my lack of build options and the unclear trade options that seem to require resources I don't have ("Give 2 None"), my best move is to end my turn and hope for better dice rolls next time.

# Initial Settlement Placement Analysis

I need to choose my very first settlement placement, which is one of the most critical decisions in the game. Let me analyze the board systematically.

## Step 1: Identify High Value Hexes and Numbers
The highest probability numbers are 6 and 8 (5 dots), followed by 5 and 9 (4 dots):
- 🐑6 (0, -1, 1) - Sheep hex with 6
- 🧱8 (-2, 1, 1) - Brick hex with 8
- 🐑8 (-2, 0, 2) - Sheep hex with 8
- 🧱9 (0, 0, 0) - Brick hex with 9
- 🐑9 (-1, 1, 0) - Sheep hex with 9
- 🌲5 (1, 0, -1) - Wood hex with 5
- 🌾5 (2, -2, 0) - Wheat hex with 5

## Step 2: Find Nodes with Multiple High-Value Hexes
Let me identify nodes that connect to multiple high-probability hexes:

- Node 3: Connected to 🐑6 and 🧱9 and 🐑4
- Node 4: Connected to 🧱9, 🐑9 and 🐑4
- Node 14: Connected to 🐑8, 🧱8 and 🐑4
- Node 15: Connected to 🧱8, 🐑9 and 🐑4
- Node 17: Connected to 🧱8, 🐑9 and 🏜️- (desert)

## Step 3: Evaluate Resource Diversity
For my first settlement, I want to secure access to as many different resources as possible, especially those with high probability numbers.

## Step 4: Calculate Total Pip Count for Top Candidates
Let me calculate the pip count (sum of probability dots) for my best options:

- Node 14: 🐑8 (5 dots) + 🧱8 (5 dots) + 🐑4 (2 dots) = 12 pips
- Node 15: 🧱8 (5 dots) + 🐑9 (4 dots) + 🐑4 (2 dots) = 11 pips
- Node 3: 🐑6 (5 dots) + 🧱9 (4 dots) + 🐑4 (2 dots) = 11 pips
- Node 4: 🧱9 (4 dots) + 🐑9 (4 dots) + 🐑4 (2 dots) = 10 pips

## Step 5: Consider Port Access
None of these high-value nodes are directly connected to ports, so this isn't a deciding factor yet.

## Final Decision
Node 14 is optimal for my first settlement because:
1. Highest pip count (12)
2. Access to both brick (critical early resource) and sheep
3. Positions me for expansion toward ore and wheat hexes later

For my initial settlement placement, I should choose node 14.

<plan>
1. Place first settlement at node 14 (access to 🧱8, 🐑8, and 🐑4)
2. Place second settlement on opposite side of board to secure wheat and ore access
3. Initial road should point toward good expansion opportunities
4. Focus early expansion toward wood and wheat resources
5. Target city upgrades once I've secured basic resource income
</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Target hexes with HIGH probability numbers (6,8,5,9) - prioritize these above all else
- Go for resource DIVERSITY: secure ALL five resources between your two settlements
- Focus on ORE and WHEAT for city upgrades (numbers 5-9 preferred)
- Evaluate each potential settlement by its TOTAL PIP COUNT (sum of probability dots)
- Place your initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Avoid placing both settlements near the same resources - diversify your income!
- Always consider 3:1 ports if your initial placement gives you limited access to certain resources
- Place roads in directions that block opponents' expansion routes

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT & CITY BUILDING PRIORITY:
- FIRST PRIORITY: Build 1-2 additional settlements early to secure critical resources you lack
- SECOND PRIORITY: Upgrade to cities as quickly as possible to double resource production
- THIRD PRIORITY: Build roads only when they lead directly to valuable settlement locations
- Early game (1-5 turns): Secure key settlements at high-value locations
- Mid-game (6-15 turns): Focus heavily on upgrading to cities (2-3 cities should be your target)
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road
- When short on a key resource, use 2:1 ports if available before using 3:1 or 4:1 ports
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat to other players unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- If you have excess of a resource, use ports rather than trading with opponents

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards primarily when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber OR to reach Largest Army (3+ knights)
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city or settlement build
- Use Monopoly cards after high-probability dice rolls to collect maximum resources
- Keep track of how many VP cards you've drawn (5 in the deck total)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn
- When development cards are your path to victory, aim for: 3 cities (6 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 victory cards (2 VP)
- Consider buying development cards when you have limited build options (blocked roads, etc.)

OPTIMAL EXPANSION PATH:
- Build roads with PURPOSE - every road should lead to a viable settlement location
- Identify and secure "bottleneck" positions that cut off opponents' expansion
- Expand toward resources you LACK from initial placement - seek balance
- When choosing between multiple settlement spots, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (total pip count)
  2. Access to resources you currently lack
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, securing future expansion)
  4. Proximity to useful ports
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Longest road (2 VP) requires strategic planning - only pursue if you already have 4+ roads built

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- When someone has 8+ points, ALWAYS target them with the robber regardless of other factors
- If you're being targeted by the robber, consider using knight cards immediately to protect production

TURN-BY-TURN PLANNING:
1. Start each turn by assessing your current VP and opponents' VPs (both visible and potential hidden points)
2. Identify your build priority for this turn: settlement, city, road, or development card?
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for your priority build
4. If you can't build your priority item, determine if trading or buying a development card is better
5. Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card or trade for needed resources
6. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

WINNING PATHS:
1. CITY-FOCUSED PATH: 3-4 cities (6-8 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 9-11 VP
2. BALANCED PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 VP card = 10 VP
3. DEVELOPMENT PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP

NEVER SAY NO TO FREE VPs:
- Always account for the 2 VP from longest road and largest army in your plans
- These special cards are EASY to lose if you're not defending them
- Invest in roads/knights to maintain your lead if these VPs are part of your strategy
- Be alert for opponents trying to steal these bonus points

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 0 | Player: BLUE | Action: BUILD_INITIAL_ROAD

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Place first settlement at node 14 (access to 🧱8, 🐑8, and 🐑4)
2. Place second settlement on opposite side of board to secure wheat and ore access
3. Initial road should point toward good expansion opportunities
4. Focus early expansion toward wood and wheat resources
5. Target city upgrades once I've secured basic resource income

# Analyzing Initial Road Placement

I need to carefully consider where to place my first road as it will determine my early expansion options. Let's analyze each available option:

## Available Road Placement Options:
- [0] Edge (13, 14): Connects toward node 13, which touches 🐑4, 🐑8, 🧱10 hexes
- [1] Edge (14, 15): Connects toward node 15, which touches 🐑4, 🧱8, 🧱4 hexes
- [2] Edge (14, 37): Connects toward node 37, which touches 🐑8, 🧱8, likely port access

## Strategic Considerations:
1. **Resource Diversification**: I currently have access to brick and sheep from my settlement at node 14, but I'm missing wood, wheat, and ore.
2. **Expansion Options**: I need to place my road in a direction that allows me to reach valuable nodes with missing resources.
3. **Port Access**: The sheep port is near nodes 38-39, which could be accessible if I build toward node 37.

## Direction Analysis:
- Option [0] (13, 14): Leads toward more sheep and potentially ore (🐑4, 🐑8, 🧱10)
- Option [1] (14, 15): Leads toward more brick resources (🐑4, 🧱8, 🧱4)
- Option [2] (14, 37): Leads toward the sheep port and potentially better expansion (🐑8, 🧱8)

Since I already have good sheep and brick production from my settlement at node 14, building toward more of these resources isn't optimal. I need to diversify. Looking at the board, the direction toward node 37 gives me access to the sheep port (useful for my excess sheep) and opens up expansion toward other parts of the board that might give me access to wheat, wood, or ore.

<plan>
1. Place first settlement at node 14 (access to 🧱8, 🐑8, and 🐑4)
2. Place first road at edge (14, 37) to expand toward sheep port and better future expansion opportunities
3. Place second settlement on opposite side of board to secure wheat, wood, and ore access
4. Focus early expansion toward wood and wheat resources
5. Target city upgrades once I've secured basic resource income
</plan>

After careful analysis, I'll choose road placement option [2], connecting nodes 14 and 37, as it provides the best opportunity for future expansion toward the sheep port and potentially better resource diversification.

- Consider buying development cards when you have limited build options (blocked roads, etc.)

OPTIMAL EXPANSION PATH:
- Build roads with PURPOSE - every road should lead to a viable settlement location
- Identify and secure "bottleneck" positions that cut off opponents' expansion
- Expand toward resources you LACK from initial placement - seek balance
- When choosing between multiple settlement spots, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (total pip count)
  2. Access to resources you currently lack
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, securing future expansion)
  4. Proximity to useful ports
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Longest road (2 VP) requires strategic planning - only pursue if you already have 4+ roads built

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- When someone has 8+ points, ALWAYS target them with the robber regardless of other factors
- If you're being targeted by the robber, consider using knight cards immediately to protect production

TURN-BY-TURN PLANNING:
1. Start each turn by assessing your current VP and opponents' VPs (both visible and potential hidden points)
2. Identify your build priority for this turn: settlement, city, road, or development card?
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for your priority build
4. If you can't build your priority item, determine if trading or buying a development card is better
5. Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card or trade for needed resources
6. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

WINNING PATHS:
1. CITY-FOCUSED PATH: 3-4 cities (6-8 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 9-11 VP
2. BALANCED PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 VP card = 10 VP
3. DEVELOPMENT PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP

NEVER SAY NO TO FREE VPs:
- Always account for the 2 VP from longest road and largest army in your plans
- These special cards are EASY to lose if you're not defending them
- Invest in roads/knights to maintain your lead if these VPs are part of your strategy
- Be alert for opponents trying to steal these bonus points

Board Understanding Guide:

- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 2 | Player: BLUE | Action: BUILD_INITIAL_SETTLEMENT

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Place first settlement at node 14 (access to 🧱8, 🐑8, and 🐑4)
2. Place first road at edge (14, 37) to expand toward sheep port and better future expansion opportunities
3. Place second settlement on opposite side of board to secure wheat, wood, and ore access
4. Focus early expansion toward wood and wheat resources
5. Target city upgrades once I've secured basic resource income

# Analyzing Initial Settlement Placement Options

I need to place my second initial settlement carefully to complement my first settlement at node 14, which produces brick (8) and sheep (4,8). Following the initial placement strategy:

## Assessment Criteria
1. Target high probability numbers (6,8,5,9)
2. Secure resource diversity (need wood, ore, wheat)
3. Ensure settlements are on opposite sides of the board
4. Consider access to ports that might be useful

## First Settlement Analysis
- My first settlement at node 14 gives me:
  - Strong brick production (8)
  - Excellent sheep production (4,8)
  - No wheat, wood, or ore

## Node Analysis for Second Settlement
I need to prioritize spots with:
1. Access to wheat, wood, and ore
2. Good probability numbers
3. Location on opposite side of the board from node 14

Let me analyze the most promising nodes:

### Node 24
- Resources: Wheat(5), Wood(5), Wood(11)
- Pip count: 2 + 2 + 2 = 6
- Location: Eastern side (good - opposite of node 14)
- Access to ore: No (but ore port nearby)

### Node 25
- Resources: Wheat(5), Ore(12)
- Pip count: 2 + 1 = 3
- Location: Eastern side 
- Direct access to ore port

### Node 26
- Resources: Wheat(5)
- Pip count: 2
- Location: Eastern side
- Direct access to ore port

### Node 7
- Resources: Wheat(5), Wheat(11), Wood(5)
- Pip count: 2 + 2 + 2 = 6
- Location: Eastern side
- Strong wheat production

### Node 6
- Resources: Wheat(10), Wheat(11), Wood(5)
- Pip count: 2 + 2 + 2 = 6
- Location: Eastern side
- Strong wheat production

## Decision Analysis
Node 7 provides the best combination overall:
- Access to both wheat and wood (resources I lack)
- Good probability numbers (pip count = 6)
- Located on the opposite side from my first settlement
- Though lacking ore, I could expand toward ore hexes

Node 24 is also strong with similar resources, but node 7 offers better wheat production with access to two wheat hexes.

<plan>
1. Place second settlement at node 7 to secure wheat and wood resources
2. Focus early game on expanding toward ore production
3. Use my strong sheep and brick production to build early roads and settlements
4. Target city upgrades once I've secured ore access
5. Consider development cards as I'll have good sheep+wheat access
</plan>

Based on this analysis, I'll select node 7 for my second settlement.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Target hexes with HIGH probability numbers (6,8,5,9) - prioritize these above all else
- Go for resource DIVERSITY: secure ALL five resources between your two settlements
- Focus on ORE and WHEAT for city upgrades (numbers 5-9 preferred)
- Evaluate each potential settlement by its TOTAL PIP COUNT (sum of probability dots)
- Place your initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Avoid placing both settlements near the same resources - diversify your income!
- Always consider 3:1 ports if your initial placement gives you limited access to certain resources
- Place roads in directions that block opponents' expansion routes

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT & CITY BUILDING PRIORITY:
- FIRST PRIORITY: Build 1-2 additional settlements early to secure critical resources you lack
- SECOND PRIORITY: Upgrade to cities as quickly as possible to double resource production
- THIRD PRIORITY: Build roads only when they lead directly to valuable settlement locations
- Early game (1-5 turns): Secure key settlements at high-value locations
- Mid-game (6-15 turns): Focus heavily on upgrading to cities (2-3 cities should be your target)
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road
- When short on a key resource, use 2:1 ports if available before using 3:1 or 4:1 ports
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat to other players unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- If you have excess of a resource, use ports rather than trading with opponents

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards primarily when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber OR to reach Largest Army (3+ knights)
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city or settlement build
- Use Monopoly cards after high-probability dice rolls to collect maximum resources
- Keep track of how many VP cards you've drawn (5 in the deck total)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn
- When development cards are your path to victory, aim for: 3 cities (6 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 victory cards (2 VP)
- Consider buying development cards when you have limited build options (blocked roads, etc.)

OPTIMAL EXPANSION PATH:
- Build roads with PURPOSE - every road should lead to a viable settlement location
- Identify and secure "bottleneck" positions that cut off opponents' expansion
- Expand toward resources you LACK from initial placement - seek balance
- When choosing between multiple settlement spots, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (total pip count)
  2. Access to resources you currently lack
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, securing future expansion)
  4. Proximity to useful ports
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Longest road (2 VP) requires strategic planning - only pursue if you already have 4+ roads built

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- When someone has 8+ points, ALWAYS target them with the robber regardless of other factors
- If you're being targeted by the robber, consider using knight cards immediately to protect production

TURN-BY-TURN PLANNING:
1. Start each turn by assessing your current VP and opponents' VPs (both visible and potential hidden points)
2. Identify your build priority for this turn: settlement, city, road, or development card?
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for your priority build
4. If you can't build your priority item, determine if trading or buying a development card is better
5. Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card or trade for needed resources
6. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

WINNING PATHS:
1. CITY-FOCUSED PATH: 3-4 cities (6-8 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 9-11 VP
2. BALANCED PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 VP card = 10 VP
3. DEVELOPMENT PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP

NEVER SAY NO TO FREE VPs:
- Always account for the 2 VP from longest road and largest army in your plans
- These special cards are EASY to lose if you're not defending them
- Invest in roads/knights to maintain your lead if these VPs are part of your strategy
- Be alert for opponents trying to steal these bonus points

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 2 | Player: BLUE | Action: BUILD_INITIAL_ROAD

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Place second settlement at node 7 to secure wheat and wood resources
2. Focus early game on expanding toward ore production
3. Use my strong sheep and brick production to build early roads and settlements
4. Target city upgrades once I've secured ore access
5. Consider development cards as I'll have good sheep+wheat access
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.

# Analyzing Initial Road Placement for Second Settlement

I need to carefully evaluate my road options for the second settlement at node 7, which will determine my expansion path and future strategy.

## Analysis of Current Position:
- My first settlement is at node 14 (produces sheep 4, sheep 8, brick 8)
- My second settlement is at node 7 (produces wheat 11, wheat 5, wheat 10)
- I have strong wheat production (3 different wheat hexes!) but currently lack wood and ore
- I have 3 wheat resources currently but no wood/brick to build a road

## Expansion Options Analysis:
Let me analyze each road option from node 7:

**[0] Road at edge (7, 24):**
- Leads northeast toward the ore port (nodes 25, 26)
- Close to wood (2) and ore (12) hexes
- Would help secure ore production which I lack
- Position seems less contested as RED is focused elsewhere

**[1] Road at edge (6, 7):**
- Leads west toward wood (5) production
- Creates path toward center of board
- Potentially conflicts with RED's expansion path

**[2] Road at edge (7, 8):**
- Leads northwest toward wood (2) production
- Creates path toward wood port (nodes 28, 29)
- This direction appears less contested

## Strategic Considerations:
- I need wood and ore as my top priorities since I have strong wheat and sheep production
- My second settlement has incredible wheat production but no other resources
- Avoiding direct conflict with RED is preferable in early game
- Securing access to ore will be crucial for city upgrades

<plan>
1. Build road toward ore port and ore/wood resources (option 0)
2. Aim to build next settlement at node 25 or 26 to secure ore production and port access
3. Use strong wheat and sheep production to trade for resources I lack
4. Focus on city upgrades once ore production is secured
5. Consider development cards given my strong wheat/sheep access
</plan>

Option 0 (road at edge 7, 24) provides the best path toward securing ore production and the ore port, which will complement my existing resource production and help me achieve city upgrades faster.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Target hexes with HIGH probability numbers (6,8,5,9) - prioritize these above all else
- Go for resource DIVERSITY: secure ALL five resources between your two settlements
- Focus on ORE and WHEAT for city upgrades (numbers 5-9 preferred)
- Evaluate each potential settlement by its TOTAL PIP COUNT (sum of probability dots)
- Place your initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Avoid placing both settlements near the same resources - diversify your income!
- Always consider 3:1 ports if your initial placement gives you limited access to certain resources
- Place roads in directions that block opponents' expansion routes

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT & CITY BUILDING PRIORITY:
- FIRST PRIORITY: Build 1-2 additional settlements early to secure critical resources you lack
- SECOND PRIORITY: Upgrade to cities as quickly as possible to double resource production
- THIRD PRIORITY: Build roads only when they lead directly to valuable settlement locations
- Early game (1-5 turns): Secure key settlements at high-value locations
- Mid-game (6-15 turns): Focus heavily on upgrading to cities (2-3 cities should be your target)
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road
- When short on a key resource, use 2:1 ports if available before using 3:1 or 4:1 ports
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat to other players unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- If you have excess of a resource, use ports rather than trading with opponents

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards primarily when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber OR to reach Largest Army (3+ knights)
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city or settlement build
- Use Monopoly cards after high-probability dice rolls to collect maximum resources
- Keep track of how many VP cards you've drawn (5 in the deck total)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn
- When development cards are your path to victory, aim for: 3 cities (6 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 victory cards (2 VP)
- Consider buying development cards when you have limited build options (blocked roads, etc.)

OPTIMAL EXPANSION PATH:
- Build roads with PURPOSE - every road should lead to a viable settlement location
- Identify and secure "bottleneck" positions that cut off opponents' expansion
- Expand toward resources you LACK from initial placement - seek balance
- When choosing between multiple settlement spots, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (total pip count)
  2. Access to resources you currently lack
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, securing future expansion)
  4. Proximity to useful ports
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Longest road (2 VP) requires strategic planning - only pursue if you already have 4+ roads built

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- When someone has 8+ points, ALWAYS target them with the robber regardless of other factors
- If you're being targeted by the robber, consider using knight cards immediately to protect production

TURN-BY-TURN PLANNING:
1. Start each turn by assessing your current VP and opponents' VPs (both visible and potential hidden points)
2. Identify your build priority for this turn: settlement, city, road, or development card?
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for your priority build
4. If you can't build your priority item, determine if trading or buying a development card is better
5. Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card or trade for needed resources
6. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

WINNING PATHS:
1. CITY-FOCUSED PATH: 3-4 cities (6-8 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 9-11 VP
2. BALANCED PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 VP card = 10 VP
3. DEVELOPMENT PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP

NEVER SAY NO TO FREE VPs:
- Always account for the 2 VP from longest road and largest army in your plans
- These special cards are EASY to lose if you're not defending them
- Invest in roads/knights to maintain your lead if these VPs are part of your strategy
- Be alert for opponents trying to steal these bonus points

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 2 | Player: BLUE | Action: MOVE_ROBBER

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Build road toward ore port and ore/wood resources (option 0)
2. Aim to build next settlement at node 25 or 26 to secure ore production and port access
3. Use strong wheat and sheep production to trade for resources I lack
4. Focus on city upgrades once ore production is secured
5. Consider development cards given my strong wheat/sheep access
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.

# Game Analysis for Robber Placement

I need to decide where to place the robber to maximize my advantage while minimizing my opponents' production. Let me analyze the options carefully.

## Current Game State Assessment
- I (BLUE) have strong sheep production from two high-probability hexes (4 and 8)
- I have excellent wheat production from three hexes (5, 10, 11)
- I'm lacking in ore, brick, and wood resources
- I currently have 3 wheat in hand
- RED has settlements producing brick, wheat, sheep, ore, and wood
- The robber needs to be placed on a hex that hurts RED while helping my strategy

## Analyzing Key Robber Placement Options

**Option [0] - Move to (0,0,0) (Brick 9) and steal from RED**
- This hex produces brick 9 (high probability)
- RED has a settlement here
- Would block a valuable brick resource (which I need for roads)
- Stealing from RED might give me a needed resource

**Option [1] - Move to (1,-1,0) (Wheat 11) and steal from RED**
- This hex produces wheat 11
- RED has a settlement here
- I already have 3 wheat and good wheat production
- Not very strategic for me to block wheat

**Option [2] - Move to (0,-1,1) (Sheep 6) and steal from RED**
- This hex produces sheep 6 (high probability)
- RED has a settlement here
- I already have excellent sheep production
- Not strategic for me to block sheep

**Option [5] - Move to (0,1,-1) (Ore 3) and steal from RED**
- This hex produces ore 3 (low probability)
- RED has a settlement here
- Ore is crucial for my city strategy
- But the probability is low (3), so not much impact

**Option [6] - Move to (1,0,-1) (Wood 5) and steal from RED**
- This hex produces wood 5 (good probability)
- RED has a settlement here
- Wood is something I need for expansion
- Decent probability (5) makes this impactful

**Option [15] - Move to (1,1,-2) (Wood 6) and steal from RED**
- This hex produces wood 6 (high probability)
- RED has a settlement here
- Would block a valuable wood resource (probability 6)
- Stealing from RED might give me wood that I need

## Strategic Decision

Looking at my plan, I need to:
1. Build toward the ore port
2. Secure ore production
3. Continue expansion

The most impactful moves are:
- Option [0] to block brick 9 (helps prevent RED from building roads)
- Option [15] to block wood 6 (high probability resource RED needs)

Since my plan focuses on building roads toward ore resources and the ore port, I need brick and wood. Blocking RED's high-probability wood hex (option 15) seems most strategic, as:
1. It disrupts RED's wood production at a high-probability hex (6)
2. It gives me a chance to steal a resource (possibly wood)
3. It aligns with my expansion goals by limiting RED's ability to build roads

<plan>
1. Move robber to wood 6 hex to limit RED's wood production
2. Continue building road toward ore port and ore/wood resources
3. Aim to build next settlement at node 25 or 26 to secure ore production and port access
4. Use strong wheat and sheep production to trade for resources I lack
5. Focus on city upgrades once ore production is secured
</plan>

Based on this analysis, I choose:

# Analyzing Robber Placement Options

First, let me review the current game state and my strategic position:

- I (BLUE) have 2 VP, with settlements at nodes 14 and 7
- I have strong sheep production but am currently lacking brick and ore
- RED also has 2 VP with settlements at nodes 2 and 20
- The robber is currently on the wood 6 hex at (1, 1, -2), which is blocking RED's high-value wood production
- I have 1 wood and 3 wheat in my hand

## Robber Placement Considerations:
1. **Continue blocking RED's high-value resources**
2. **Steal a valuable resource from RED** if possible
3. **Avoid disrupting my own future expansion plans**

Looking at RED's settlements:
- Settlement at node 2: produces brick 9 (⭐⭐), wheat 11 (⭐), sheep 6 (⭐⭐⭐)
- Settlement at node 20: produces ore 3 (⭐), wood 5 (⭐⭐), and wood 6 (⭐⭐⭐) - currently blocked

Let's evaluate the best options:

### Option 2: Move robber to (0, -1, 1) - Sheep 6 hex
- This blocks RED's sheep 6 (⭐⭐⭐) production at node 2
- RED would lose access to high-probability sheep
- I can steal from RED
- This doesn't affect my production

### Option 0: Move robber to (0, 0, 0) - Brick 9 hex
- This blocks RED's brick 9 (⭐⭐) production at node 2
- Brick is valuable early game for roads and settlements
- I can steal from RED
- This doesn't affect my production

### Option 6: Move robber to (1, 0, -1) - Wood 5 hex
- This blocks RED's wood 5 (⭐⭐) production at node 20
- I can steal from RED
- Continues limiting RED's wood production after removing the robber from wood 6

Given that I'm already blocking RED's wood 6 production, the most strategic move would be to shift to blocking either their sheep or brick production.

<plan>
1. Move robber to sheep 6 hex to limit RED's strong sheep production
2. Continue building road toward ore port and ore/wood resources
3. Aim to build next settlement at node 25 or 26 to secure ore production and port access
4. Use strong wheat and sheep production to trade for resources I lack
5. Focus on city upgrades once ore production is secured
</plan>

The sheep 6 hex is RED's highest probability resource (⭐⭐⭐), so blocking it will have the most significant impact on their resource generation, while also giving me a chance to steal a resource.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Target hexes with HIGH probability numbers (6,8,5,9) - prioritize these above all else
- Go for resource DIVERSITY: secure ALL five resources between your two settlements
- Focus on ORE and WHEAT for city upgrades (numbers 5-9 preferred)
- Evaluate each potential settlement by its TOTAL PIP COUNT (sum of probability dots)
- Place your initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Avoid placing both settlements near the same resources - diversify your income!
- Always consider 3:1 ports if your initial placement gives you limited access to certain resources
- Place roads in directions that block opponents' expansion routes

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT & CITY BUILDING PRIORITY:
- FIRST PRIORITY: Build 1-2 additional settlements early to secure critical resources you lack
- SECOND PRIORITY: Upgrade to cities as quickly as possible to double resource production
- THIRD PRIORITY: Build roads only when they lead directly to valuable settlement locations
- Early game (1-5 turns): Secure key settlements at high-value locations
- Mid-game (6-15 turns): Focus heavily on upgrading to cities (2-3 cities should be your target)
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road
- When short on a key resource, use 2:1 ports if available before using 3:1 or 4:1 ports
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat to other players unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- If you have excess of a resource, use ports rather than trading with opponents

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards primarily when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber OR to reach Largest Army (3+ knights)
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city or settlement build
- Use Monopoly cards after high-probability dice rolls to collect maximum resources
- Keep track of how many VP cards you've drawn (5 in the deck total)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn
- When development cards are your path to victory, aim for: 3 cities (6 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 victory cards (2 VP)
- Consider buying development cards when you have limited build options (blocked roads, etc.)

OPTIMAL EXPANSION PATH:
- Build roads with PURPOSE - every road should lead to a viable settlement location
- Identify and secure "bottleneck" positions that cut off opponents' expansion
- Expand toward resources you LACK from initial placement - seek balance
- When choosing between multiple settlement spots, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (total pip count)
  2. Access to resources you currently lack
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, securing future expansion)
  4. Proximity to useful ports
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Longest road (2 VP) requires strategic planning - only pursue if you already have 4+ roads built

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- When someone has 8+ points, ALWAYS target them with the robber regardless of other factors
- If you're being targeted by the robber, consider using knight cards immediately to protect production

TURN-BY-TURN PLANNING:
1. Start each turn by assessing your current VP and opponents' VPs (both visible and potential hidden points)
2. Identify your build priority for this turn: settlement, city, road, or development card?
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for your priority build
4. If you can't build your priority item, determine if trading or buying a development card is better
5. Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card or trade for needed resources
6. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

WINNING PATHS:
1. CITY-FOCUSED PATH: 3-4 cities (6-8 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 9-11 VP
2. BALANCED PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 VP card = 10 VP
3. DEVELOPMENT PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP

NEVER SAY NO TO FREE VPs:
- Always account for the 2 VP from longest road and largest army in your plans
- These special cards are EASY to lose if you're not defending them
- Invest in roads/knights to maintain your lead if these VPs are part of your strategy
- Be alert for opponents trying to steal these bonus points

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 6 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Move robber to sheep 6 hex to limit RED's strong sheep production
2. Continue building road toward ore port and ore/wood resources
3. Aim to build next settlement at node 25 or 26 to secure ore production and port access
4. Use strong wheat and sheep production to trade for resources I lack
5. Focus on city upgrades once ore production is secured

❓ Select action by number (0-12):


Based on this information, which action number do you choose? Think step by step about your options, then put the final action number in a box like \boxed{1}.
RESPONSE:
I'll analyze the current game state to determine the optimal action.

### Game Analysis

**Current Position:**
- I have 2 VP (2 settlements)
- Resources: 1 Wood, 1 Brick, 2 Sheep, 4 Wheat
- Production: Strong in wheat and sheep, but lacking consistent ore, brick, and wood
- Current plan involves moving toward ore port and improving ore production

**Available Options:**
1. End turn
2. Build a road (8 possible locations)
3. Maritime trade (4:1 ratio to convert wheat to other resources)

**Strategic Considerations:**

1. **Resource Analysis:** 
   - I have exactly enough resources for 1 road (1 wood, 1 brick)
   - My wheat (4) is in excess but insufficient for development cards (need ore)
   - No settlements/cities can be built this turn

2. **Road Building Options:**
   - Road toward ore port would be ideal (supports current plan)
   - Looking at node 25: connects to ore port (nodes 25-26)

3. **Expansion Priorities:**
   - Need better ore production for city upgrades
   - Currently strong in sheep and wheat but weak in brick/wood/ore

Looking at the road options, I need to choose one that advances my strategy toward securing ore production and the ore port.

From my settlement at node 7, building a road at edge (24, 25) [option 4] would move me directly toward the ore port at nodes 25-26. This aligns perfectly with my current plan of securing ore production and port access.

<plan>
1. Build road toward ore port at edge (24, 25)
2. Next turn, try to secure resources for settlement at node 25 (ore port)
3. Use ore port to improve city development capabilities
4. Focus on city upgrades once ore production is secured
5. Consider development cards if resources allow
</plan>

Building this road is the clear optimal choice as it directly advances my strategic goals.

1. CITY-FOCUSED PATH: 3-4 cities (6-8 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 9-11 VP
2. BALANCED PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 VP card = 10 VP
3. DEVELOPMENT PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP

NEVER SAY NO TO FREE VPs:
- Always account for the 2 VP from longest road and largest army in your plans
- These special cards are EASY to lose if you're not defending them
- Invest in roads/knights to maintain your lead if these VPs are part of your strategy
- Be alert for opponents trying to steal these bonus points

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 6 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Build road toward ore port at edge (24, 25)
2. Next turn, try to secure resources for settlement at node 25 (ore port)
3. Use ore port to improve city development capabilities
4. Focus on city upgrades once ore production is secured
5. Consider development cards if resources allow

# Game Analysis

Let me analyze my current position and available actions in detail:

## Current Status
- 2 VPs from 2 settlements
- Resources: 2 sheep, 4 wheat
- I have strong wheat production (3 wheat hexes)
- I lack ore, brick, and wood
- I've built a road toward the ore port (nodes 24, 25)

## Available Options
1. End turn (option 0)
2. Trade 4 wheat for 1 of any resource (options 1-4)

## Strategic Assessment

My current plan is to build toward the ore port at node 25. However, I still need to build a settlement there, which requires:
- 1 wheat (I have 4)
- 1 sheep (I have 2)
- 1 brick (I need this)
- 1 wood (I need this)

Looking at my options, I could trade 4 wheat for either wood or brick to advance my plan. This would leave me with 0 wheat but I have good wheat production, so I should get more on upcoming rolls.

Getting brick would allow me to build a settlement at node 25 next turn if I also get a wood from production. Getting wood would require me to also get a brick from production to build the settlement.

Given the robber is currently on a sheep hex (6), my sheep production is slightly reduced, making my wheat my most reliable resource. Therefore, I should use my wheat surplus strategically.

## Decision Logic

Since I'm trying to reach the ore port (2:1 ore trade), getting a settlement at node 25 is critical for my city-focused strategy. Looking at the resource distribution:
- Brick (8, 9, 4) has strong probability but I don't have access to it
- Wood (2, 5, 6, 11) exists on the board but I don't produce any

I think I should trade for brick since:
1. The brick port is farther away from my current position
2. I need both wood and brick, but brick might be harder to acquire through trades
3. Wood hexes are more numerous on this board

<plan>
1. Trade wheat for brick to prepare for settlement at node 25 (ore port)
2. Next turn, acquire wood (through production or another trade) to build settlement at node 25
3. Once settled at the ore port, use it to accelerate city development
4. Focus on upgrading settlements to cities for increased production
5. Consider development cards if resources allow
</plan>

Based on this analysis, I'll trade 4 wheat for 1 brick to advance my settlement plan.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Target hexes with HIGH probability numbers (6,8,5,9) - prioritize these above all else
- Go for resource DIVERSITY: secure ALL five resources between your two settlements
- Focus on ORE and WHEAT for city upgrades (numbers 5-9 preferred)
- Evaluate each potential settlement by its TOTAL PIP COUNT (sum of probability dots)
- Place your initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Avoid placing both settlements near the same resources - diversify your income!
- Always consider 3:1 ports if your initial placement gives you limited access to certain resources
- Place roads in directions that block opponents' expansion routes

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT & CITY BUILDING PRIORITY:
- FIRST PRIORITY: Build 1-2 additional settlements early to secure critical resources you lack
- SECOND PRIORITY: Upgrade to cities as quickly as possible to double resource production
- THIRD PRIORITY: Build roads only when they lead directly to valuable settlement locations
- Early game (1-5 turns): Secure key settlements at high-value locations
- Mid-game (6-15 turns): Focus heavily on upgrading to cities (2-3 cities should be your target)
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road
- When short on a key resource, use 2:1 ports if available before using 3:1 or 4:1 ports
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat to other players unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- If you have excess of a resource, use ports rather than trading with opponents

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards primarily when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber OR to reach Largest Army (3+ knights)
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city or settlement build
- Use Monopoly cards after high-probability dice rolls to collect maximum resources
- Keep track of how many VP cards you've drawn (5 in the deck total)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn
- When development cards are your path to victory, aim for: 3 cities (6 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 victory cards (2 VP)
- Consider buying development cards when you have limited build options (blocked roads, etc.)

OPTIMAL EXPANSION PATH:
- Build roads with PURPOSE - every road should lead to a viable settlement location
- Identify and secure "bottleneck" positions that cut off opponents' expansion
- Expand toward resources you LACK from initial placement - seek balance
- When choosing between multiple settlement spots, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (total pip count)
  2. Access to resources you currently lack
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, securing future expansion)
  4. Proximity to useful ports
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Longest road (2 VP) requires strategic planning - only pursue if you already have 4+ roads built

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- When someone has 8+ points, ALWAYS target them with the robber regardless of other factors
- If you're being targeted by the robber, consider using knight cards immediately to protect production

TURN-BY-TURN PLANNING:
1. Start each turn by assessing your current VP and opponents' VPs (both visible and potential hidden points)
2. Identify your build priority for this turn: settlement, city, road, or development card?
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for your priority build
4. If you can't build your priority item, determine if trading or buying a development card is better
5. Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card or trade for needed resources
6. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

WINNING PATHS:
1. CITY-FOCUSED PATH: 3-4 cities (6-8 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 9-11 VP
2. BALANCED PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 VP card = 10 VP
3. DEVELOPMENT PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP

NEVER SAY NO TO FREE VPs:
- Always account for the 2 VP from longest road and largest army in your plans
- These special cards are EASY to lose if you're not defending them
- Invest in roads/knights to maintain your lead if these VPs are part of your strategy
- Be alert for opponents trying to steal these bonus points

# Game Analysis for Settlers of Catan - Turn 24

Let me carefully analyze the current game state and my available actions.

## Current Game State Assessment
- I have 2 VP (2 settlements)
- RED has 5 VP (3 settlements + longest road)
- My resources: 3 🧱BRICK, 3 🐑SHEEP, 4 🌾WHEAT
- I currently have a road leading to node 25, which is an ORE port (2:1)
- The RED player is ahead with 5 VP compared to my 2 VP

## My Current Position
I have settlements at:
- Node 14: Producing sheep and brick (good numbers: 4, 8)
- Node 7: Producing wheat (good numbers: 5, 10, 11)

I'm lacking ORE production completely, which will be critical for city upgrades. However, I have a road to node 25 which is an ORE port - this could partly compensate for my lack of ore production.

## Available Actions
1-4. Maritime trade options to exchange 4 wheat for various resources
0. End turn

## Strategic Analysis
Looking at my previous plan, I wanted to trade wheat for brick to build a settlement at node 25 (ore port). However, I already have 3 brick, so I don't need to trade for more brick.

To build a settlement, I need:
- 1 wood + 1 brick + 1 sheep + 1 wheat
- I have 3 brick, 3 sheep, 4 wheat, but 0 wood

Therefore, my greatest need right now is WOOD to build the settlement at node 25.

Fortunately, option [1] allows me to trade 4 wheat for 1 wood, which is exactly what I need.

After this trade, I'll have:
- 1 wood, 3 brick, 3 sheep, 0 wheat

This gives me the resources needed to build a settlement next turn (1 wood, 1 brick, 1 sheep, 1 wheat). I'll need to produce or trade for 1 more wheat on my next turn.

<plan>
1. Trade 4 wheat for 1 wood this turn through maritime trade
2. Next turn, build a settlement at node 25 (ore port) if I produce the 1 wheat needed
3. Use the ore port to accelerate city development once I acquire ore
4. Focus on upgrading settlements to cities for increased production
5. Consider development cards if resources allow
</plan>

This is clearly the optimal move as it directly advances my settlement-building plan, which will give me access to the ore port and increase my victory points.

- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- When someone has 8+ points, ALWAYS target them with the robber regardless of other factors
- If you're being targeted by the robber, consider using knight cards immediately to protect production

TURN-BY-TURN PLANNING:
1. Start each turn by assessing your current VP and opponents' VPs (both visible and potential hidden points)
2. Identify your build priority for this turn: settlement, city, road, or development card?
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for your priority build
4. If you can't build your priority item, determine if trading or buying a development card is better
5. Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card or trade for needed resources
6. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

WINNING PATHS:
1. CITY-FOCUSED PATH: 3-4 cities (6-8 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 9-11 VP
2. BALANCED PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 VP card = 10 VP
3. DEVELOPMENT PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP

NEVER SAY NO TO FREE VPs:
- Always account for the 2 VP from longest road and largest army in your plans
- These special cards are EASY to lose if you're not defending them
- Invest in roads/knights to maintain your lead if these VPs are part of your strategy
- Be alert for opponents trying to steal these bonus points

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 24 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Trade 4 wheat for 1 wood this turn through maritime trade
2. Next turn, build a settlement at node 25 (ore port) if I produce the 1 wheat needed
3. Use the ore port to accelerate city development once I acquire ore
4. Focus on upgrading settlements to cities for increased production
5. Consider development cards if resources allow

# Game State Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state and my options:

## Current Status
- I have 2 VP vs RED's 5 VP (including 2 VP for longest road)
- My Resources: 1 Wood, 3 Brick, 3 Sheep
- No development cards
- Two settlements: one producing mostly sheep, another producing wheat

## My Current Plan
My plan involves:
1. Trading 4 wheat for 1 wood through maritime trade
2. Building a settlement at node 25 (ore port)
3. Using the ore port for city development
4. Upgrading settlements to cities

## Issue with Current Plan
I don't have any wheat to trade as indicated in my plan. The plan seems to have an error - I have sheep but not wheat to trade.

## Available Actions
- I can build a road (costs 1 wood, 1 brick) in various locations
- I don't have enough resources for settlements (need wood, brick, wheat, sheep)
- I don't have enough resources for cities (need ore, wheat)
- I don't have enough resources for development cards (need ore, wheat, sheep)

## Strategic Options
Let me evaluate road building options:
1. Edge (24, 53): Expands toward the wheat-producing region, could lead to wood port
2. Edge (25, 26): Moves toward the ore port - aligns with my plan
3. Edge (13, 14): This actually doesn't make sense as I already have a settlement at node 14
4. Edge (37, 38): Expands toward sheep port - I already have plenty of sheep
5. Edge (6, 7): This doesn't make sense as I already have a settlement at node 7
6. Edge (14, 15): Expands from my sheep-producing settlement toward a diversification option
7. Edge (36, 37): Not a strategic direction based on visible board
8. Edge (7, 8): Expands from my wheat-producing settlement toward additional wheat sources

## Strategic Decision
Option 2 (building road at edge 25, 26) seems most aligned with my existing plan of reaching the ore port at node 25. This would allow me to build a settlement there later when I get the remaining resources.

<plan>
1. Build a road toward the ore port (edge 25, 26) this turn
2. Focus on acquiring resources for a settlement at node 25 (ore port)
3. Use the ore port to accelerate city development once I acquire ore
4. Focus on upgrading settlements to cities for increased production
5. Consider development cards if resources allow
</plan>

Given my resources (1 wood, 3 brick, 3 sheep) and the need to reach the ore port for my long-term strategy, I'll build a road at edge (25, 26).

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Target hexes with HIGH probability numbers (6,8,5,9) - prioritize these above all else
- Go for resource DIVERSITY: secure ALL five resources between your two settlements
- Focus on ORE and WHEAT for city upgrades (numbers 5-9 preferred)
- Evaluate each potential settlement by its TOTAL PIP COUNT (sum of probability dots)
- Place your initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Avoid placing both settlements near the same resources - diversify your income!
- Always consider 3:1 ports if your initial placement gives you limited access to certain resources
- Place roads in directions that block opponents' expansion routes

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT & CITY BUILDING PRIORITY:
- FIRST PRIORITY: Build 1-2 additional settlements early to secure critical resources you lack
- SECOND PRIORITY: Upgrade to cities as quickly as possible to double resource production
- THIRD PRIORITY: Build roads only when they lead directly to valuable settlement locations
- Early game (1-5 turns): Secure key settlements at high-value locations
- Mid-game (6-15 turns): Focus heavily on upgrading to cities (2-3 cities should be your target)
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road
- When short on a key resource, use 2:1 ports if available before using 3:1 or 4:1 ports
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat to other players unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- If you have excess of a resource, use ports rather than trading with opponents

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards primarily when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber OR to reach Largest Army (3+ knights)
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city or settlement build
- Use Monopoly cards after high-probability dice rolls to collect maximum resources
- Keep track of how many VP cards you've drawn (5 in the deck total)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn
- When development cards are your path to victory, aim for: 3 cities (6 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 victory cards (2 VP)
- Consider buying development cards when you have limited build options (blocked roads, etc.)

OPTIMAL EXPANSION PATH:
- Build roads with PURPOSE - every road should lead to a viable settlement location
- Identify and secure "bottleneck" positions that cut off opponents' expansion
- Expand toward resources you LACK from initial placement - seek balance
- When choosing between multiple settlement spots, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (total pip count)
  2. Access to resources you currently lack
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, securing future expansion)
  4. Proximity to useful ports
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Longest road (2 VP) requires strategic planning - only pursue if you already have 4+ roads built

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- When someone has 8+ points, ALWAYS target them with the robber regardless of other factors
- If you're being targeted by the robber, consider using knight cards immediately to protect production

TURN-BY-TURN PLANNING:
1. Start each turn by assessing your current VP and opponents' VPs (both visible and potential hidden points)
2. Identify your build priority for this turn: settlement, city, road, or development card?
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for your priority build
4. If you can't build your priority item, determine if trading or buying a development card is better
5. Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card or trade for needed resources
6. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

WINNING PATHS:
1. CITY-FOCUSED PATH: 3-4 cities (6-8 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 9-11 VP
2. BALANCED PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 VP card = 10 VP
3. DEVELOPMENT PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP

NEVER SAY NO TO FREE VPs:
- Always account for the 2 VP from longest road and largest army in your plans
- These special cards are EASY to lose if you're not defending them
- Invest in roads/knights to maintain your lead if these VPs are part of your strategy
- Be alert for opponents trying to steal these bonus points

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy

# Game State Analysis

I need to move the robber to maximize my chances of winning while hindering RED, who has 5 victory points to my 2.

## Current Situation
- RED is leading with 5 VP (including 2 VP from longest road)
- I need to focus on resource gathering for my next build
- I have 2 settlements located at nodes 14 and 7

## Robber Placement Strategy
I want to:
1. Block RED's high-value production 
2. Target a hex that gives me a chance to steal a valuable resource
3. Avoid harming my own production

## Evaluating Options
Looking at RED's settlements:
- Node 2: produces from 🧱9[⭐⭐], 🌾11[⭐], 🐑6[⭐⭐⭐]
- Node 20: produces from ⛏️3[⭐], 🌲5[⭐⭐], 🌲6[⭐⭐⭐]
- Node 21: produces from ⛏️3[⭐], 🧱4[⭐], 🌾3[⭐]

The highest value production for RED is:
- 🐑6 (3 pips) at (0, -1, 1) - option 2
- 🌲6 (3 pips) at (1, 1, -2) - option 15
- 🧱9 (2 pips) at (0, 0, 0) - option 0

<plan>
1. Block RED's high-probability resource production
2. Focus on building toward the ore port (node 25)
3. Use the ore port to facilitate city upgrades once I get ore
4. Look to create another settlement at a high-value location with ore or brick
5. Work toward upgrading settlements to cities for increased production
</plan>

My optimal choice is to block the 6-value sheep hex at (0, -1, 1) because:
1. It has the highest probability (3 pips) among RED's resources
2. RED is likely collecting sheep for development cards or trading
3. This disrupts a 6-value hex, one of the highest probability numbers
4. I can steal a resource from RED, potentially something valuable for my next build

Therefore, I choose option 2 - Move the robber to (0, -1, 1) and steal from RED.

4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Target hexes with HIGH probability numbers (6,8,5,9) - prioritize these above all else
- Go for resource DIVERSITY: secure ALL five resources between your two settlements
- Focus on ORE and WHEAT for city upgrades (numbers 5-9 preferred)
- Evaluate each potential settlement by its TOTAL PIP COUNT (sum of probability dots)
- Place your initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Avoid placing both settlements near the same resources - diversify your income!
- Always consider 3:1 ports if your initial placement gives you limited access to certain resources
- Place roads in directions that block opponents' expansion routes

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT & CITY BUILDING PRIORITY:
- FIRST PRIORITY: Build 1-2 additional settlements early to secure critical resources you lack
- SECOND PRIORITY: Upgrade to cities as quickly as possible to double resource production
- THIRD PRIORITY: Build roads only when they lead directly to valuable settlement locations
- Early game (1-5 turns): Secure key settlements at high-value locations
- Mid-game (6-15 turns): Focus heavily on upgrading to cities (2-3 cities should be your target)
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road
- When short on a key resource, use 2:1 ports if available before using 3:1 or 4:1 ports
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat to other players unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- If you have excess of a resource, use ports rather than trading with opponents

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards primarily when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber OR to reach Largest Army (3+ knights)
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city or settlement build
- Use Monopoly cards after high-probability dice rolls to collect maximum resources
- Keep track of how many VP cards you've drawn (5 in the deck total)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn
- When development cards are your path to victory, aim for: 3 cities (6 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 victory cards (2 VP)
- Consider buying development cards when you have limited build options (blocked roads, etc.)

OPTIMAL EXPANSION PATH:
- Build roads with PURPOSE - every road should lead to a viable settlement location
- Identify and secure "bottleneck" positions that cut off opponents' expansion
- Expand toward resources you LACK from initial placement - seek balance
- When choosing between multiple settlement spots, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (total pip count)
  2. Access to resources you currently lack
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, securing future expansion)
  4. Proximity to useful ports
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Longest road (2 VP) requires strategic planning - only pursue if you already have 4+ roads built

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- When someone has 8+ points, ALWAYS target them with the robber regardless of other factors
- If you're being targeted by the robber, consider using knight cards immediately to protect production

TURN-BY-TURN PLANNING:
1. Start each turn by assessing your current VP and opponents' VPs (both visible and potential hidden points)
2. Identify your build priority for this turn: settlement, city, road, or development card?
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for your priority build
4. If you can't build your priority item, determine if trading or buying a development card is better
5. Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card or trade for needed resources
6. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

WINNING PATHS:
1. CITY-FOCUSED PATH: 3-4 cities (6-8 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 9-11 VP
2. BALANCED PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 VP card = 10 VP
3. DEVELOPMENT PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP

NEVER SAY NO TO FREE VPs:
- Always account for the 2 VP from longest road and largest army in your plans
- These special cards are EASY to lose if you're not defending them
- Invest in roads/knights to maintain your lead if these VPs are part of your strategy
- Be alert for opponents trying to steal these bonus points

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 28 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Block RED's high-probability resource production
2. Focus on building toward the ore port (node 25)
3. Use the ore port to facilitate city upgrades once I get ore
4. Look to create another settlement at a high-value location with ore or brick
5. Work toward upgrading settlements to cities for increased production

# Game Analysis for Catan - Turn 28

Let me analyze the current game state and make the optimal decision.

## Current Game Status
- I (BLUE) have 2 VP from 2 settlements
- RED has 5 VP (3 settlements + longest road bonus)
- RED is halfway to victory and ahead by 3 points
- My resources: 2 🧱BRICK, 3 🐑SHEEP, 1 🌾WHEAT, 1 ⛏️ORE
- Available actions: End Turn [0] or Buy Development Card [1]

## Strategic Assessment

I have a settlement at node 14 producing sheep and brick well (8 and 4 pips) and another at node 7 producing wheat (but all low probability numbers).

RED has good positioning with 3 settlements and longest road bonus. They're clearly pursuing a fast expansion strategy with longest road and an aggressive settlement build.

I can purchase a development card with my current resources (1 sheep, 1 wheat, 1 ore). Let's evaluate this option:

**Benefits of buying a development card:**
1. Possibility of drawing a Victory Point card (immediate hidden VP)
2. Possibility of drawing a Knight card to work toward Largest Army (2 VP)
3. Possibility of drawing a useful action card (Road Building, Year of Plenty, Monopoly)

Since I can't build any settlements or roads this turn (not enough resources), a development card is my only building option.

## Looking at my plan
My current plan is:
1. Block RED's high-probability resource production
2. Focus on building toward the ore port (node 25)
3. Use the ore port to facilitate city upgrades
4. Look to create settlements at high-value locations
5. Work toward upgrading settlements to cities

I notice I've already built to the ore port (nodes 25-26). This was good execution of my plan.

<plan>
1. Buy development cards when resources allow to compete for largest army and gain potential VPs
2. Use the ore port to facilitate city upgrades when I get ore
3. Build a settlement at node 26 to secure ore port and more resource production
4. Target RED's progress by using knights and robber placement
5. Focus on upgrading existing settlements to cities for increased production
</plan>

## Decision
Since my only building option this turn is a development card, and I have exactly the resources needed (1 sheep, 1 wheat, 1 ore), I should purchase one. This gives me a chance for a VP card, knight card, or useful action card. Even if I roll poorly next turn, I'll still have a development card to potentially help my position.

# Game Analysis for Settlers of Catan

Let me analyze my current position and available actions:

## Current State Assessment
- I have 2 VP (2 settlements + 1 hidden VP card = 3 actual VP)
- RED has 6 VP (2 settlements + 1 city + longest road)
- I have 2 🧱BRICK, 4 🐑SHEEP, 2 🌾WHEAT
- RED is ahead by 3-4 VP, getting close to winning

## Resource Analysis
- My production is good for 🌾WHEAT (3 sources) and 🐑SHEEP (2 sources, one currently blocked)
- I lack ⛏️ORE and have limited 🧱BRICK and 🌲WOOD
- I've built toward the ⛏️ORE port (nodes 25-26), which will be valuable once I secure it

## Available Actions
I can either end my turn or trade 4 sheep for another resource.

### Trading Analysis
Given my current holdings and plan:
- **WOOD**: Would allow me to build a road, but not enough for a settlement (need brick too)
- **WHEAT**: Already have 2, not a priority right now
- **ORE**: Could help toward city upgrade, but I'd still be far from the 3 ore needed
- **BRICK**: Adding 1 brick to my existing 2 would give me 3 brick, which with 1 wood would be enough for a settlement

Looking at my previous plan, I want to build a settlement at node 26 to secure the ore port. If I trade for brick, I'm preparing for this goal but still need wood.

## Decision Reasoning
1. Trading 4 sheep for 1 brick gives me 3 brick total
2. I'll still need 1 wood for a settlement (future trade or production)
3. This helps advance toward my settlement at node 26 goal
4. Ending turn without using my excess sheep is inefficient

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Target hexes with HIGH probability numbers (6,8,5,9) - prioritize these above all else
- Go for resource DIVERSITY: secure ALL five resources between your two settlements
- Focus on ORE and WHEAT for city upgrades (numbers 5-9 preferred)
- Evaluate each potential settlement by its TOTAL PIP COUNT (sum of probability dots)
- Place your initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Avoid placing both settlements near the same resources - diversify your income!
- Always consider 3:1 ports if your initial placement gives you limited access to certain resources
- Place roads in directions that block opponents' expansion routes

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT & CITY BUILDING PRIORITY:
- FIRST PRIORITY: Build 1-2 additional settlements early to secure critical resources you lack
- SECOND PRIORITY: Upgrade to cities as quickly as possible to double resource production
- THIRD PRIORITY: Build roads only when they lead directly to valuable settlement locations
- Early game (1-5 turns): Secure key settlements at high-value locations
- Mid-game (6-15 turns): Focus heavily on upgrading to cities (2-3 cities should be your target)
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road
- When short on a key resource, use 2:1 ports if available before using 3:1 or 4:1 ports
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat to other players unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- If you have excess of a resource, use ports rather than trading with opponents

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards primarily when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber OR to reach Largest Army (3+ knights)
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city or settlement build
- Use Monopoly cards after high-probability dice rolls to collect maximum resources
- Keep track of how many VP cards you've drawn (5 in the deck total)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn
- When development cards are your path to victory, aim for: 3 cities (6 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 victory cards (2 VP)
- Consider buying development cards when you have limited build options (blocked roads, etc.)

OPTIMAL EXPANSION PATH:
- Build roads with PURPOSE - every road should lead to a viable settlement location
- Identify and secure "bottleneck" positions that cut off opponents' expansion
- Expand toward resources you LACK from initial placement - seek balance
- When choosing between multiple settlement spots, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (total pip count)
  2. Access to resources you currently lack
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, securing future expansion)
  4. Proximity to useful ports
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Longest road (2 VP) requires strategic planning - only pursue if you already have 4+ roads built

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- When someone has 8+ points, ALWAYS target them with the robber regardless of other factors
- If you're being targeted by the robber, consider using knight cards immediately to protect production

TURN-BY-TURN PLANNING:
1. Start each turn by assessing your current VP and opponents' VPs (both visible and potential hidden points)
2. Identify your build priority for this turn: settlement, city, road, or development card?
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for your priority build
4. If you can't build your priority item, determine if trading or buying a development card is better
5. Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card or trade for needed resources
6. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

WINNING PATHS:
1. CITY-FOCUSED PATH: 3-4 cities (6-8 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 9-11 VP
2. BALANCED PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 VP card = 10 VP
3. DEVELOPMENT PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP

NEVER SAY NO TO FREE VPs:
- Always account for the 2 VP from longest road and largest army in your plans
- These special cards are EASY to lose if you're not defending them
- Invest in roads/knights to maintain your lead if these VPs are part of your strategy
- Be alert for opponents trying to steal these bonus points

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game Analysis

Let me assess the current state and available actions carefully.

## Current Game State

- I have 2/10 points (plus 1 hidden victory point card = 3/10)
- Red has 6/10 points (with longest road)
- My resources: 4 🧱BRICK, 2 🌾WHEAT
- I own 2 settlements, one at node 14 and one at node 7
- I have built roads toward node 26, which connects to the ore port
- The robber is currently blocking my sheep production hex at (-2, 0, 2)
- Red is ahead with 6 points and has longest road

## Current Plan Review

My existing plan was:
1. Trade sheep for brick (already accomplished, since I have 4 brick)
2. Acquire wood to build settlement at node 26 for the ore port
3. Focus on city upgrades and development cards
4. Consider knights to remove robber from sheep production and compete for largest army

## Available Options Analysis

My options are:
- [0] End turn
- [1-4] Trade 4 brick for either wheat, wood, sheep, or ore

Let me evaluate:
1. I need wood to build a settlement at node 26 (my next goal)
2. I have 4 brick, which is exactly enough for a 4:1 port trade
3. The logical trade is to get wood, which aligns with my plan

Looking at my current settlements:
- Node 14 produces sheep and brick (but sheep is blocked by robber)
- Node 7 produces wheat
- I don't have any wood or ore production

To progress toward building a settlement at node 26, I need:
- 1 brick (already have)
- 1 wood (need to acquire)
- 1 wheat (already have)
- 1 sheep (need to acquire)

## Decision

Given my resources and plan, the best action is to trade 4 brick for 1 wood using the general port. This gets me one step closer to building a settlement at node 26, which would secure the ore port and help me pursue city upgrades later.

<plan>
1. Trade 4 brick for 1 wood now
2. On next turn or when resources permit, get 1 sheep to build settlement at node 26
3. Once ore port is secured, focus on city upgrades by trading for ore using the port
4. Buy development cards when possible to compete for largest army
</plan>

I'll analyze the current game state and determine the best action for this turn.

## Current Situation Assessment
- I have 2 victory points (2 settlements) + 1 hidden VP card = 3 VP total
- RED has 6 VP (2 settlements, 1 city, longest road)
- I have 1 wood, 1 brick, 3 wheat
- My current plan involves trading for wood to build a settlement at node 26 (ore port)
- The robber is on a sheep hex (-2, 0, 2) which affects my settlement at node 14

## Resource Analysis
- I'm producing wheat well (3 wheat hexes at my settlement at node 7)
- I lack sheep production due to robber
- I have no ore production
- Limited wood and brick production

## Available Actions
I can either end my turn or build a road. I have exactly enough resources (1 wood, 1 brick) to build one road.

## Road Building Options Analysis
- Road at edge (24, 53): Leads away from my planned settlement at node 26
- Road at edge (13, 14): Not useful, already connected
- Road at edge (26, 27): Extends from my planned settlement location at node 26
- Road at edge (37, 38): Leads toward sheep port from my settlement at node 14
- Road at edge (6, 7): Not useful, already connected
- Road at edge (14, 15): Extends from my settlement at node 14
- Road at edge (36, 37): Not useful, already connected
- Road at edge (7, 8): Extends from my settlement at node 7

## Strategic Decision
My current plan involves building a settlement at node 26 to secure the ore port. Since I already have a road to node 26, I should consider the next strategic direction after securing that settlement.

Option 1: Build road (26, 27) to prepare for further expansion after building the settlement at node 26.
Option 2: Build road (37, 38) to work toward the sheep port, which would help with my sheep shortage.
Option 3: End turn and preserve resources for trading next turn.

Since I need 1 more sheep to build the settlement at node 26, and RED is far ahead with 6 VP, I should focus on executing my plan efficiently.

<plan>
1. Build road at edge (26, 27) now to prepare for expansion after securing ore port
2. Next turn, trade for 1 sheep to build settlement at node 26 (ore port)
3. Use ore port to efficiently upgrade to cities
4. Continue expanding toward node 27 for additional settlements
5. Buy development cards when excess resources permit to compete for largest army
</plan>

The road at (26, 27) provides the best strategic value by preparing for future expansion after I secure the ore port. Building this road now will save me time later and position me for further expansion.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Target hexes with HIGH probability numbers (6,8,5,9) - prioritize these above all else
- Go for resource DIVERSITY: secure ALL five resources between your two settlements
- Focus on ORE and WHEAT for city upgrades (numbers 5-9 preferred)
- Evaluate each potential settlement by its TOTAL PIP COUNT (sum of probability dots)
- Place your initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Avoid placing both settlements near the same resources - diversify your income!
- Always consider 3:1 ports if your initial placement gives you limited access to certain resources
- Place roads in directions that block opponents' expansion routes

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT & CITY BUILDING PRIORITY:
- FIRST PRIORITY: Build 1-2 additional settlements early to secure critical resources you lack
- SECOND PRIORITY: Upgrade to cities as quickly as possible to double resource production
- THIRD PRIORITY: Build roads only when they lead directly to valuable settlement locations
- Early game (1-5 turns): Secure key settlements at high-value locations
- Mid-game (6-15 turns): Focus heavily on upgrading to cities (2-3 cities should be your target)
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road
- When short on a key resource, use 2:1 ports if available before using 3:1 or 4:1 ports
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat to other players unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- If you have excess of a resource, use ports rather than trading with opponents

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards primarily when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber OR to reach Largest Army (3+ knights)
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city or settlement build
- Use Monopoly cards after high-probability dice rolls to collect maximum resources
- Keep track of how many VP cards you've drawn (5 in the deck total)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn
- When development cards are your path to victory, aim for: 3 cities (6 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 victory cards (2 VP)
- Consider buying development cards when you have limited build options (blocked roads, etc.)

OPTIMAL EXPANSION PATH:
- Build roads with PURPOSE - every road should lead to a viable settlement location
- Identify and secure "bottleneck" positions that cut off opponents' expansion
- Expand toward resources you LACK from initial placement - seek balance
- When choosing between multiple settlement spots, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (total pip count)
  2. Access to resources you currently lack
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, securing future expansion)
  4. Proximity to useful ports
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Longest road (2 VP) requires strategic planning - only pursue if you already have 4+ roads built

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- When someone has 8+ points, ALWAYS target them with the robber regardless of other factors
- If you're being targeted by the robber, consider using knight cards immediately to protect production

TURN-BY-TURN PLANNING:
1. Start each turn by assessing your current VP and opponents' VPs (both visible and potential hidden points)
2. Identify your build priority for this turn: settlement, city, road, or development card?
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for your priority build
4. If you can't build your priority item, determine if trading or buying a development card is better
5. Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card or trade for needed resources
6. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

WINNING PATHS:
1. CITY-FOCUSED PATH: 3-4 cities (6-8 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 9-11 VP
2. BALANCED PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 VP card = 10 VP
3. DEVELOPMENT PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP

NEVER SAY NO TO FREE VPs:
- Always account for the 2 VP from longest road and largest army in your plans
- These special cards are EASY to lose if you're not defending them
- Invest in roads/knights to maintain your lead if these VPs are part of your strategy
- Be alert for opponents trying to steal these bonus points

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Robber Placement Strategy Analysis

Let me analyze the optimal robber placement by considering several key factors:

## Game State Assessment
- Red has 6 VP to my 2 VP, putting them much closer to winning
- Red has Longest Road (2 VP) and a city (2 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP)
- I need to slow Red's progress while advancing my plan to build at the ore port

## Robber Targets
I should prioritize placing the robber on high-value hexes that Red depends on, preferably with high probability numbers.

Let's examine Red's resource production:
- RED's city at node 2 produces: 🧱9[⭐⭐], 🌾11[⭐], 🐑6[⭐⭐⭐]
- RED's settlement at node 20: ⛏️3[⭐], 🌲5[⭐⭐], 🌲6[⭐⭐⭐]
- RED's settlement at node 21: ⛏️3[⭐], 🧱4[⭐], 🌾3[⭐]

The highest probability resources for Red are:
1. 🐑6 (sheep) at the city - very high value (3 dots)
2. 🌲6 (wood) at a settlement - high value (3 dots)
3. 🧱9 (brick) at the city - medium-high value (2 dots)

## Best Options Analysis
- Option [2] targets 🐑6 (0, -1, 1) and allows stealing from Red. This blocks their highest probability hex at their city.
- Option [15] targets 🌲6 (1, 1, -2) and allows stealing from Red. This blocks their second highest probability hex.
- Option [0] targets 🧱9 (0, 0, 0) and allows stealing from Red. This blocks their brick production at their city.

Option [2] provides the most significant impact because:
1. It targets sheep on a 6 (high probability)
2. It affects Red's city production (doubled resource loss)
3. It hits their strongest hex (3 dots)
4. I get to steal a resource from Red

<plan>
1. Place robber on sheep 6 hex and steal from Red
2. Build road at edge (26, 27) next to prepare for expansion after securing ore port
3. Next turn, trade for 1 sheep to build settlement at node 26 (ore port)
4. Use ore port to efficiently upgrade to cities
5. Focus on cities for VP accumulation while seeking development cards
</plan>

The optimal move is to place the robber on the sheep 6 hex to severely limit Red's production capacity at their city.

# Analysis of Robber Placement Options

I need to strategically place the robber to maximize my chances of winning by hindering my opponent who is far ahead (7 VP vs my 2 VP) and potentially gaining a useful resource.

## Game State Assessment
- RED has 7 VP (3 settlements + 1 city + longest road bonus)
- I only have 2 VP (2 settlements + 1 hidden VP card)
- RED is 3 points away from winning, making them a serious threat
- I need to hamper RED's resource production while advancing my plan to reach the ore port

## Evaluating Key Robber Placement Options

### Critical RED Production Spots:
1. Hex (0, 0, 0) - Brick 9 [⭐⭐] - This produces for RED's city at node 2
2. Hex (1, 1, -2) - Wood 6 [⭐⭐⭐] - High probability tile producing for RED
3. Hex (1, 0, -1) - Wood 5 [⭐⭐] - Another wood producer for RED
4. Hex (-1, 1, 0) - Sheep 9 [⭐⭐] - Produces for RED settlement
5. Hex (0, 1, -1) - Ore 3 [⭐] - Supplies ore to RED's settlements

I need to specifically target:
- High probability numbers (5, 6, 8, 9)
- Resources RED needs for expansion (likely brick, wood for roads)
- Resources I need (ore, wood, brick)

The best options are:

**Option 15** - Move robber to (1, 1, -2) Wood 6 [⭐⭐⭐]
- Blocks a high probability (6) wood tile
- Wood is critical for RED's road building strategy
- I can steal a card from RED

**Option 0** - Move robber to (0, 0, 0) Brick 9 [⭐⭐]
- Blocks a good probability brick tile
- Brick is essential for RED to continue road/settlement expansion
- I can steal a card from RED

**Option 5** - Move robber to (1, 0, -1) Wood 5 [⭐⭐]
- Blocks another wood hex
- Wood is critical for RED's expansion
- I can steal a card from RED

## Decision
Since RED already has longest road and is likely focusing on further expansion, blocking their wood production is most critical. Option 15 targets the highest probability wood hex (6), which will significantly impede RED's ability to build more roads and settlements.

<plan>
1. Place robber on wood 6 hex (1, 1, -2) and steal from RED
2. Continue plan to build road at edge (26, 27) to prepare for expansion to ore port
3. Next turn, trade for 1 sheep to build settlement at node 26 (ore port)
4. Use ore port to efficiently upgrade to cities
5. Focus on cities for VP accumulation while seeking development cards
</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Target hexes with HIGH probability numbers (6,8,5,9) - prioritize these above all else
- Go for resource DIVERSITY: secure ALL five resources between your two settlements
- Focus on ORE and WHEAT for city upgrades (numbers 5-9 preferred)
- Evaluate each potential settlement by its TOTAL PIP COUNT (sum of probability dots)
- Place your initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Avoid placing both settlements near the same resources - diversify your income!
- Always consider 3:1 ports if your initial placement gives you limited access to certain resources
- Place roads in directions that block opponents' expansion routes

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT & CITY BUILDING PRIORITY:
- FIRST PRIORITY: Build 1-2 additional settlements early to secure critical resources you lack
- SECOND PRIORITY: Upgrade to cities as quickly as possible to double resource production
- THIRD PRIORITY: Build roads only when they lead directly to valuable settlement locations
- Early game (1-5 turns): Secure key settlements at high-value locations
- Mid-game (6-15 turns): Focus heavily on upgrading to cities (2-3 cities should be your target)
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road
- When short on a key resource, use 2:1 ports if available before using 3:1 or 4:1 ports
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat to other players unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- If you have excess of a resource, use ports rather than trading with opponents

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards primarily when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber OR to reach Largest Army (3+ knights)
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city or settlement build
- Use Monopoly cards after high-probability dice rolls to collect maximum resources
- Keep track of how many VP cards you've drawn (5 in the deck total)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn
- When development cards are your path to victory, aim for: 3 cities (6 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 victory cards (2 VP)
- Consider buying development cards when you have limited build options (blocked roads, etc.)

OPTIMAL EXPANSION PATH:
- Build roads with PURPOSE - every road should lead to a viable settlement location
- Identify and secure "bottleneck" positions that cut off opponents' expansion
- Expand toward resources you LACK from initial placement - seek balance
- When choosing between multiple settlement spots, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (total pip count)
  2. Access to resources you currently lack
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, securing future expansion)
  4. Proximity to useful ports
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Longest road (2 VP) requires strategic planning - only pursue if you already have 4+ roads built

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- When someone has 8+ points, ALWAYS target them with the robber regardless of other factors
- If you're being targeted by the robber, consider using knight cards immediately to protect production

TURN-BY-TURN PLANNING:
1. Start each turn by assessing your current VP and opponents' VPs (both visible and potential hidden points)
2. Identify your build priority for this turn: settlement, city, road, or development card?
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for your priority build
4. If you can't build your priority item, determine if trading or buying a development card is better
5. Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card or trade for needed resources
6. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

WINNING PATHS:
1. CITY-FOCUSED PATH: 3-4 cities (6-8 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 9-11 VP
2. BALANCED PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 VP card = 10 VP
3. DEVELOPMENT PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP

NEVER SAY NO TO FREE VPs:
- Always account for the 2 VP from longest road and largest army in your plans
- These special cards are EASY to lose if you're not defending them
- Invest in roads/knights to maintain your lead if these VPs are part of your strategy
- Be alert for opponents trying to steal these bonus points

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 58 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Place robber on wood 6 hex (1, 1, -2) and steal from RED
2. Continue plan to build road at edge (26, 27) to prepare for expansion to ore port
3. Next turn, trade for 1 sheep to build settlement at node 26 (ore port)
4. Use ore port to efficiently upgrade to cities
5. Focus on cities for VP accumulation while seeking development cards

# Analysis of Game State & Options

## Current Game Status
- I have 2 VP (2 settlements + 1 hidden VP card = 3 VP total)
- RED has 7 VP (3 settlements + 1 city + longest road = 7 VP)
- RED is ahead by 4 VP and close to winning
- My resources: 2 🧱BRICK, 1 🐑SHEEP, 4 🌾WHEAT
- I need to accelerate my VP accumulation

## My Current Plan Assessment
My current plan is to build road (26, 27) to prepare for the ore port settlement. This makes sense as:
1. I need ore for city upgrades
2. Cities offer the fastest VP growth (2 VP per city)
3. I already have two settlements maximizing income

However, I don't see an option to place the robber this turn, nor to build a road. This suggests I already rolled and didn't get a 7, and I can't build now due to resource limitations.

## Options Available
- End turn [0]
- Trade 4 wheat for various resources [1-4]

With my current resources (2 brick, 1 sheep, 4 wheat), I can't build anything directly:
- Settlement needs: 1 brick, 1 wheat, 1 sheep, 1 wood (missing wood)
- Road needs: 1 brick, 1 wood (missing wood)
- City needs: 2 wheat, 3 ore (missing ore)
- Development card needs: 1 sheep, 1 wheat, 1 ore (missing ore)

## Strategic Decision
To continue my plan to reach node 26 (ore port), I need wood to build roads. Trading 4 wheat for 1 wood [1] would allow me to build a road on my next turn.

<plan>
1. Trade 4 wheat for 1 wood this turn
2. Next turn, build a road at edge (26,27) toward the ore port
3. Gather resources to build settlement at node 26 (ore port)
4. Use ore port to efficiently upgrade to cities
5. Focus on cities for VP growth while seeking development cards
</plan>

Given RED's lead at 7 VP, I need to accelerate my development. Getting the ore port is critical for my city strategy. Therefore, I'll trade for wood to build a road next turn.

# Game Analysis for Turn 58

Let me analyze the current game state and determine the optimal move.

## Game Status Analysis:
- I have only 2 visible Victory Points (2 settlements)
- I have 1 hidden Victory Point (development card)
- Red has 7 Victory Points (3 settlements + 1 city + longest road)
- I'm far behind and need a strategic plan

## Resource Analysis:
- I have 1 wood, 2 brick, 1 sheep
- I have enough resources to build a road (costs 1 wood, 1 brick)
- I will still have 1 brick left after building a road

## Strategic Considerations:
1. My current plan indicates trading wheat for wood, but I notice I don't have wheat listed in my resources
2. I need to evaluate which road building option advances my position best
3. Red is at 7 points, so they're close to winning - I need efficient moves

## Road Option Analysis:
Let me evaluate each road option based on:
- Does it get me closer to building a settlement?
- Does it help me contest longest road?
- Does it give me access to valuable resources or ports?

Looking at the available road options and the board state:
- Edge (27,28) moves toward the wood port
- Edge (24,53) moves toward the ore port
- Edge (8,27) connects toward a potential settlement spot near wood port
- Other options don't clearly advance toward settlement locations or strategic ports

The most strategic options seem to be:
1. Edge (27,28) - closer to wood port
2. Edge (24,53) - closer to ore port
3. Edge (8,27) - potential settlement location path

My previous plan mentioned building toward the ore port at edge (26,27), but this isn't in my current options. The closest option to that plan is edge (24,53) which seems to move toward the ore port area.

<plan>
1. Build road at edge (24,53) this turn to advance toward the ore port
2. Next turns: continue building toward settlement at node 26 (ore port)
3. Use ore port to efficiently upgrade to cities
4. Focus on cities for VP growth while seeking development cards
5. Try to contest longest road if possible
</plan>

Edge (24,53) aligns best with my previous strategic plan of getting to the ore port, which will help me efficiently upgrade to cities. This is critical given how far behind I am.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Target hexes with HIGH probability numbers (6,8,5,9) - prioritize these above all else
- Go for resource DIVERSITY: secure ALL five resources between your two settlements
- Focus on ORE and WHEAT for city upgrades (numbers 5-9 preferred)
- Evaluate each potential settlement by its TOTAL PIP COUNT (sum of probability dots)
- Place your initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Avoid placing both settlements near the same resources - diversify your income!
- Always consider 3:1 ports if your initial placement gives you limited access to certain resources
- Place roads in directions that block opponents' expansion routes

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT & CITY BUILDING PRIORITY:
- FIRST PRIORITY: Build 1-2 additional settlements early to secure critical resources you lack
- SECOND PRIORITY: Upgrade to cities as quickly as possible to double resource production
- THIRD PRIORITY: Build roads only when they lead directly to valuable settlement locations
- Early game (1-5 turns): Secure key settlements at high-value locations
- Mid-game (6-15 turns): Focus heavily on upgrading to cities (2-3 cities should be your target)
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road
- When short on a key resource, use 2:1 ports if available before using 3:1 or 4:1 ports
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat to other players unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- If you have excess of a resource, use ports rather than trading with opponents

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards primarily when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber OR to reach Largest Army (3+ knights)
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city or settlement build
- Use Monopoly cards after high-probability dice rolls to collect maximum resources
- Keep track of how many VP cards you've drawn (5 in the deck total)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn
- When development cards are your path to victory, aim for: 3 cities (6 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 victory cards (2 VP)
- Consider buying development cards when you have limited build options (blocked roads, etc.)

OPTIMAL EXPANSION PATH:
- Build roads with PURPOSE - every road should lead to a viable settlement location
- Identify and secure "bottleneck" positions that cut off opponents' expansion
- Expand toward resources you LACK from initial placement - seek balance
- When choosing between multiple settlement spots, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (total pip count)
  2. Access to resources you currently lack
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, securing future expansion)
  4. Proximity to useful ports
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Longest road (2 VP) requires strategic planning - only pursue if you already have 4+ roads built

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- When someone has 8+ points, ALWAYS target them with the robber regardless of other factors
- If you're being targeted by the robber, consider using knight cards immediately to protect production

TURN-BY-TURN PLANNING:
1. Start each turn by assessing your current VP and opponents' VPs (both visible and potential hidden points)
2. Identify your build priority for this turn: settlement, city, road, or development card?
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for your priority build
4. If you can't build your priority item, determine if trading or buying a development card is better
5. Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card or trade for needed resources
6. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

WINNING PATHS:
1. CITY-FOCUSED PATH: 3-4 cities (6-8 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 9-11 VP
2. BALANCED PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 VP card = 10 VP
3. DEVELOPMENT PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP

NEVER SAY NO TO FREE VPs:
- Always account for the 2 VP from longest road and largest army in your plans
- These special cards are EASY to lose if you're not defending them
- Invest in roads/knights to maintain your lead if these VPs are part of your strategy
- Be alert for opponents trying to steal these bonus points

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 66 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Build road at edge (24,53) this turn to advance toward the ore port
2. Next turns: continue building toward settlement at node 26 (ore port)
3. Use ore port to efficiently upgrade to cities
4. Focus on cities for VP growth while seeking development cards
5. Try to contest longest road if possible

# Game State Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state and determine the optimal action:

## Victory Points
- BLUE (me): 2 VP (2 settlements) + 1 hidden VP (from VP card) = 3 VP total
- RED: 8 VP (1 city = 2 VP, 4 settlements = 4 VP, longest road = 2 VP)
- RED is just 2 VP away from winning!

## Resource Assessment
I currently have:
- 1 🧱BRICK
- 2 🐑SHEEP
- 4 🌾WHEAT
- 0 ⛏️ORE
- 0 🌲WOOD

## Action Options
- [0] End my turn
- [1-4] Trade 4 WHEAT for another resource (WOOD, SHEEP, ORE, or BRICK)

## Current Plan Evaluation
My current plan was to build a road at edge (24,53) to advance toward the ore port, but I don't have any WOOD to build a road (requires BRICK + WOOD).

## Strategic Options

Looking at my resources, I can't build any roads, settlements, cities, or buy development cards with what I have. I'm limited to trading.

Based on my current plan to build toward the ore port, I need WOOD to build a road. Trading 4 WHEAT for 1 WOOD would allow me to build a road this turn with my 1 BRICK and the acquired WOOD.

RED is at 8 VP and could win soon, so I need to make progress on my plan.

<plan>
1. Trade 4 WHEAT for 1 WOOD this turn
2. Build road with BRICK + WOOD immediately after trading
3. Continue building toward settlement at node 26 (ore port)
4. Use ore port to efficiently get resources for city upgrades
5. Focus on cities and development cards while watching RED's progress
</plan>

Given my analysis, I should trade 4 WHEAT for 1 WOOD to enable building a road this turn according to my plan.

# Game Analysis for Turn 66

I'll analyze the current game state and determine the optimal move for the Blue player.

## Current Game State Assessment
- **Victory Points**: Blue has 2/10 visible VP + 1 hidden VP card = 3/10 VP total
- **Red has 8/10 VP** (4 settlements, 1 city, longest road bonus)
- **Resources**: Blue has 1 WOOD, 1 BRICK, 2 SHEEP
- **Current Plan**: Trade 4 WHEAT for 1 WOOD, then build road toward node 26 (ore port)

## Immediate Problem
- The current plan mentions trading 4 WHEAT for 1 WOOD, but Blue doesn't have any WHEAT to trade
- Red is very close to winning (8/10 VP) and might win on their next turn
- Blue needs to make progress toward catching up

## Options Analysis
1. **End Turn**: This wastes our current resources and gives Red another turn closer to victory
2. **Build Road**: We have exactly 1 WOOD and 1 BRICK, which is enough to build a road

## Road Building Analysis
We need to carefully choose which road to build to maximize our chances of:
1. Expanding toward valuable resources we lack (primarily ORE)
2. Blocking Red's expansion 
3. Working toward the ore port at node 26 as mentioned in our plan

Looking at each road option:
- Road at edge (13, 14): Already have a settlement at node 14, not helpful
- Road at edge (52, 53): Very far from current positions, not strategic
- Road at edge (8, 27): Helps move toward wood port and potential expansion
- Road at edge (37, 38): Moves toward sheep port, not our priority resource
- Road at edge (27, 28): Moves toward wood port, but wood isn't critical
- Road at edge (6, 7): Already have a settlement at node 7, not helpful
- Road at edge (14, 15): Helps expand from our settlement at node 14
- Road at edge (36, 37): Not particularly strategic
- Road at edge (7, 8): Expands from our wheat-strong settlement

The most strategic roads appear to be either edge (14, 15) or edge (8, 27). Looking at the map and our current position:

- Road (14, 15) helps us expand from our settlement at node 14, which produces sheep and brick
- Road (8, 27) helps us expand from our wheat-producing settlement at node 7 toward potential new resources

Given that our plan mentions building toward node 26 (ore port), and we need to diversify our resources (especially getting ore access), the road that best advances us in that direction appears to be edge (8, 27).

<plan>
1. Build road at edge (8, 27) this turn to begin expansion toward ore port
2. Continue building roads toward settlement at node 26 (ore port)
3. Use ore port to efficiently get resources for city upgrades
4. Focus on gaining development cards to catch up with RED
5. Look for opportunities to break RED's longest road
</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Target hexes with HIGH probability numbers (6,8,5,9) - prioritize these above all else
- Go for resource DIVERSITY: secure ALL five resources between your two settlements
- Focus on ORE and WHEAT for city upgrades (numbers 5-9 preferred)
- Evaluate each potential settlement by its TOTAL PIP COUNT (sum of probability dots)
- Place your initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Avoid placing both settlements near the same resources - diversify your income!
- Always consider 3:1 ports if your initial placement gives you limited access to certain resources
- Place roads in directions that block opponents' expansion routes

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT & CITY BUILDING PRIORITY:
- FIRST PRIORITY: Build 1-2 additional settlements early to secure critical resources you lack
- SECOND PRIORITY: Upgrade to cities as quickly as possible to double resource production
- THIRD PRIORITY: Build roads only when they lead directly to valuable settlement locations
- Early game (1-5 turns): Secure key settlements at high-value locations
- Mid-game (6-15 turns): Focus heavily on upgrading to cities (2-3 cities should be your target)
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road
- When short on a key resource, use 2:1 ports if available before using 3:1 or 4:1 ports
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat to other players unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- If you have excess of a resource, use ports rather than trading with opponents

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards primarily when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber OR to reach Largest Army (3+ knights)
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city or settlement build
- Use Monopoly cards after high-probability dice rolls to collect maximum resources
- Keep track of how many VP cards you've drawn (5 in the deck total)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn
- When development cards are your path to victory, aim for: 3 cities (6 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 victory cards (2 VP)
- Consider buying development cards when you have limited build options (blocked roads, etc.)

OPTIMAL EXPANSION PATH:
- Build roads with PURPOSE - every road should lead to a viable settlement location
- Identify and secure "bottleneck" positions that cut off opponents' expansion
- Expand toward resources you LACK from initial placement - seek balance
- When choosing between multiple settlement spots, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (total pip count)
  2. Access to resources you currently lack
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, securing future expansion)
  4. Proximity to useful ports
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Longest road (2 VP) requires strategic planning - only pursue if you already have 4+ roads built

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- When someone has 8+ points, ALWAYS target them with the robber regardless of other factors
- If you're being targeted by the robber, consider using knight cards immediately to protect production

TURN-BY-TURN PLANNING:
1. Start each turn by assessing your current VP and opponents' VPs (both visible and potential hidden points)
2. Identify your build priority for this turn: settlement, city, road, or development card?
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for your priority build
4. If you can't build your priority item, determine if trading or buying a development card is better
5. Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card or trade for needed resources
6. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

WINNING PATHS:
1. CITY-FOCUSED PATH: 3-4 cities (6-8 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 9-11 VP
2. BALANCED PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 VP card = 10 VP
3. DEVELOPMENT PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP

NEVER SAY NO TO FREE VPs:
- Always account for the 2 VP from longest road and largest army in your plans
- These special cards are EASY to lose if you're not defending them
- Invest in roads/knights to maintain your lead if these VPs are part of your strategy
- Be alert for opponents trying to steal these bonus points

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 0 | Player: BLUE | Action: BUILD_INITIAL_SETTLEMENT

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Build road at edge (8, 27) this turn to begin expansion toward ore port
2. Continue building roads toward settlement at node 26 (ore port)
3. Use ore port to efficiently get resources for city upgrades
4. Focus on gaining development cards to catch up with RED
5. Look for opportunities to break RED's longest road

# Analyzing Initial Settlement Placement

This is a critical decision that will shape my entire game strategy. I need to select the best possible location for my first settlement based on the key criteria from the Initial Placement Strategy:

1. Target high probability numbers (6,8,5,9)
2. Aim for resource diversity
3. Focus on ore and wheat for city upgrades
4. Evaluate by total pip count
5. Place settlements on opposite sides for expansion
6. Consider ports for resource management

Let me analyze the most promising locations by examining hexes with high-value numbers:

## High-Value Hexes:
- 🌾8 (2,-2,0): Wheat with 8 (high value, 5 pips)
- ⛏️8 (0,1,-1): Ore with 8 (high value, 5 pips)
- 🌾6 (-1,1,0): Wheat with 6 (high value, 5 pips)
- 🌾6 (2,0,-2): Wheat with 6 (high value, 5 pips)
- ⛏️5 (1,1,-2): Ore with 5 (good value, 4 pips)
- 🐑5 (0,-2,2): Sheep with 5 (good value, 4 pips)

## Best Candidate Nodes:
Let me check which nodes connect to these high-value hexes:

Node 7: Connects to Wheat-8 and Sheep-11
Node 8: Connects to Wheat-8 and Wheat-4
Node 19: Connects to Ore-8, Ore-5, and Wood-9
Node 20: Connects to Ore-8, Ore-5, and Wood-12
Node 22: Connects to Ore-5, Wheat-6, and Wood-12
Node 23: Connects to Wheat-6 and Sheep-11

Of these, node 19 stands out as exceptional because:
1. It connects to TWO high-value ore hexes (8 and 5)
2. It connects to wood-9, giving me three resources
3. Total pip count is excellent (5 + 4 + 4 = 13 pips)
4. It's near the ore-wheat-wood cluster, which are the most critical resources

Node 7 is also strong as it combines wheat-8 and sheep-11, but lacks ore.
Node 20 is similar to 19 but with slightly less optimal resource mix.

## Final Decision:
For my first settlement, I'll select node 19 which gives access to:
- Ore at value 8 (essential for cities)
- Ore at value 5 (double ore access)
- Wood at value 9 (good for road building)

This sets me up well for city development while securing access to both ore and wood.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Target hexes with HIGH probability numbers (6,8,5,9) - prioritize these above all else
- Go for resource DIVERSITY: secure ALL five resources between your two settlements
- Focus on ORE and WHEAT for city upgrades (numbers 5-9 preferred)
- Evaluate each potential settlement by its TOTAL PIP COUNT (sum of probability dots)
- Place your initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Avoid placing both settlements near the same resources - diversify your income!
- Always consider 3:1 ports if your initial placement gives you limited access to certain resources
- Place roads in directions that block opponents' expansion routes

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT & CITY BUILDING PRIORITY:
- FIRST PRIORITY: Build 1-2 additional settlements early to secure critical resources you lack
- SECOND PRIORITY: Upgrade to cities as quickly as possible to double resource production
- THIRD PRIORITY: Build roads only when they lead directly to valuable settlement locations
- Early game (1-5 turns): Secure key settlements at high-value locations
- Mid-game (6-15 turns): Focus heavily on upgrading to cities (2-3 cities should be your target)
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road
- When short on a key resource, use 2:1 ports if available before using 3:1 or 4:1 ports
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat to other players unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- If you have excess of a resource, use ports rather than trading with opponents

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards primarily when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber OR to reach Largest Army (3+ knights)
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city or settlement build
- Use Monopoly cards after high-probability dice rolls to collect maximum resources
- Keep track of how many VP cards you've drawn (5 in the deck total)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn
- When development cards are your path to victory, aim for: 3 cities (6 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 victory cards (2 VP)
- Consider buying development cards when you have limited build options (blocked roads, etc.)

OPTIMAL EXPANSION PATH:
- Build roads with PURPOSE - every road should lead to a viable settlement location
- Identify and secure "bottleneck" positions that cut off opponents' expansion
- Expand toward resources you LACK from initial placement - seek balance
- When choosing between multiple settlement spots, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (total pip count)
  2. Access to resources you currently lack
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, securing future expansion)
  4. Proximity to useful ports
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Longest road (2 VP) requires strategic planning - only pursue if you already have 4+ roads built

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- When someone has 8+ points, ALWAYS target them with the robber regardless of other factors
- If you're being targeted by the robber, consider using knight cards immediately to protect production

TURN-BY-TURN PLANNING:
1. Start each turn by assessing your current VP and opponents' VPs (both visible and potential hidden points)
2. Identify your build priority for this turn: settlement, city, road, or development card?
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for your priority build
4. If you can't build your priority item, determine if trading or buying a development card is better
5. Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card or trade for needed resources
6. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

WINNING PATHS:
1. CITY-FOCUSED PATH: 3-4 cities (6-8 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 9-11 VP
2. BALANCED PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 VP card = 10 VP
3. DEVELOPMENT PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP

NEVER SAY NO TO FREE VPs:
- Always account for the 2 VP from longest road and largest army in your plans
- These special cards are EASY to lose if you're not defending them
- Invest in roads/knights to maintain your lead if these VPs are part of your strategy
- Be alert for opponents trying to steal these bonus points

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 0 | Player: BLUE | Action: BUILD_INITIAL_ROAD

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Build road at edge (8, 27) this turn to begin expansion toward ore port
2. Continue building roads toward settlement at node 26 (ore port)
3. Use ore port to efficiently get resources for city upgrades
4. Focus on gaining development cards to catch up with RED
5. Look for opportunities to break RED's longest road
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.

❓ Select action by number (0-2):


Based on this information, which action number do you choose? Think step by step about your options, then put the final action number in a box like \boxed{1}.
RESPONSE:
I need to analyze the best road placement for my initial setup from node 19, where I already have a settlement. Let me think through this carefully:

First, I'll assess my settlement's location and available road options:
- My settlement at node 19 produces ore (8 and 5) and wood (9) - great high-value resources
- I need to place a road that maximizes my expansion opportunities

Road options:
[0] Edge (19, 20): Leads toward wood (12) and wheat (6) hexes
[1] Edge (19, 21): Leads toward ore (8) and wood (9) hexes
[2] Edge (19, 46): Leads toward ore (5) and wood (9) hexes

Strategic analysis:
- Edge (19, 20) opens expansion toward wheat resources which I currently lack
- Edge (19, 21) keeps me near my current high-value ore and wood
- Edge (19, 46) leads toward the bottom area which has fewer opponents initially

Let me consider expansion potential:
- Following edge (19, 20) could eventually lead to node 22, which touches wheat (6)
- Edge (19, 21) could lead to node 43, which touches wood (9)
- Edge (19, 46) could lead to node 45, which could connect to the 3:1 port

Since I already have strong ore and wood production, expanding toward wheat makes the most strategic sense to diversify my resources. The path from edge (19, 20) creates the best opportunity to access wheat, which will be essential for city upgrades alongside my existing ore access.

<plan>
1. Build road at edge (19, 20) to begin expansion toward wheat resources
2. Continue expanding toward node 22 for a settlement with wheat access
3. Leverage ore production for city upgrades once wheat is secured
4. Consider development card purchases with sheep/ore/wheat once production is diversified
5. Watch for opportunities to establish longest road

# Analyzing Initial Settlement Placement

I need to select my second initial settlement, which is a critical decision that will shape my entire game strategy. Let me analyze the available options carefully.

## Current Situation Analysis
- I already have my first settlement at node 19, which produces ore from two hexes (8 and 5) and wood (9).
- I need to secure resources I'm missing - specifically wheat, sheep, and brick.
- This is my second initial settlement, so I'll receive resource cards from this location immediately.
- Ideal placement should complement my first settlement's production.

## Key Criteria for Settlement Selection
1. Access to missing resources (wheat, sheep, brick)
2. High probability numbers (6, 8, 5, 9)
3. Resource diversity
4. Positioning for future expansion
5. Access to useful ports

## Evaluating Top Options

Looking at the node options, I'll evaluate based on resource production:

### Node 4
- Resources: Wheat (6 - great probability), Brick (10 - lower probability), Sheep (2 - very low probability)
- Benefits: Gives me wheat (missing), brick (missing), and is on a wheat 6 hex (high probability)
- Position: Good expansion potential

### Node 15
- Resources: Wheat (6 - great probability), Brick (10 - lower probability)
- Benefits: Gives me wheat (missing) and brick (missing)
- Position: Reasonable but less resource diversity than some other options

### Node 23
- Resources: Wheat (6 - great probability), Sheep (11 - low probability), Wood (12 - very low probability)
- Benefits: Gives me wheat (missing), sheep (missing), and access to ore port
- Position: Decent expansion options

### Node 27
- Resources: Wheat (8 - excellent probability), Sheep (5 - decent probability)
- Benefits: Gives me wheat (missing) on an 8 hex, sheep (missing)
- Position: Close to sheep port

### Node 49
- Resources: Wheat (6 - great probability), Ore (5 - decent probability)
- Benefits: More wheat and ore production, brick port access
- Position: Good expansion options

## Decision
After analyzing the options, I believe node 27 offers the best combination of:
- Wheat on an 8 hex (excellent probability)
- Sheep on a 5 hex (decent probability)
- Access to sheep port
- Good positioning on opposite side of board from my first settlement
- Balances my resource production well

<plan>
1. Build my second initial settlement at node 27 to secure wheat (8) and sheep (5)
2. Focus on acquiring brick through trades to enable expansion
3. Build road toward wheat/ore areas for additional settlements
4. Aim for early city upgrades leveraging my strong ore production
5. Consider development card strategy with good ore/wheat/sheep access
</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Target hexes with HIGH probability numbers (6,8,5,9) - prioritize these above all else
- Go for resource DIVERSITY: secure ALL five resources between your two settlements
- Focus on ORE and WHEAT for city upgrades (numbers 5-9 preferred)
- Evaluate each potential settlement by its TOTAL PIP COUNT (sum of probability dots)
- Place your initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Avoid placing both settlements near the same resources - diversify your income!
- Always consider 3:1 ports if your initial placement gives you limited access to certain resources
- Place roads in directions that block opponents' expansion routes

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT & CITY BUILDING PRIORITY:
- FIRST PRIORITY: Build 1-2 additional settlements early to secure critical resources you lack
- SECOND PRIORITY: Upgrade to cities as quickly as possible to double resource production
- THIRD PRIORITY: Build roads only when they lead directly to valuable settlement locations
- Early game (1-5 turns): Secure key settlements at high-value locations
- Mid-game (6-15 turns): Focus heavily on upgrading to cities (2-3 cities should be your target)
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road
- When short on a key resource, use 2:1 ports if available before using 3:1 or 4:1 ports
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat to other players unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- If you have excess of a resource, use ports rather than trading with opponents

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards primarily when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber OR to reach Largest Army (3+ knights)
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city or settlement build
- Use Monopoly cards after high-probability dice rolls to collect maximum resources
- Keep track of how many VP cards you've drawn (5 in the deck total)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn
- When development cards are your path to victory, aim for: 3 cities (6 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 victory cards (2 VP)
- Consider buying development cards when you have limited build options (blocked roads, etc.)

OPTIMAL EXPANSION PATH:
- Build roads with PURPOSE - every road should lead to a viable settlement location
- Identify and secure "bottleneck" positions that cut off opponents' expansion
- Expand toward resources you LACK from initial placement - seek balance
- When choosing between multiple settlement spots, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (total pip count)
  2. Access to resources you currently lack
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, securing future expansion)
  4. Proximity to useful ports
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Longest road (2 VP) requires strategic planning - only pursue if you already have 4+ roads built

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- When someone has 8+ points, ALWAYS target them with the robber regardless of other factors
- If you're being targeted by the robber, consider using knight cards immediately to protect production

TURN-BY-TURN PLANNING:
1. Start each turn by assessing your current VP and opponents' VPs (both visible and potential hidden points)
2. Identify your build priority for this turn: settlement, city, road, or development card?
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for your priority build
4. If you can't build your priority item, determine if trading or buying a development card is better
5. Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card or trade for needed resources
6. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

WINNING PATHS:
1. CITY-FOCUSED PATH: 3-4 cities (6-8 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 9-11 VP
2. BALANCED PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 VP card = 10 VP
3. DEVELOPMENT PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP

NEVER SAY NO TO FREE VPs:
- Always account for the 2 VP from longest road and largest army in your plans
- These special cards are EASY to lose if you're not defending them
- Invest in roads/knights to maintain your lead if these VPs are part of your strategy
- Be alert for opponents trying to steal these bonus points

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 2 | Player: BLUE | Action: BUILD_INITIAL_ROAD

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Build my second initial settlement at node 27 to secure wheat (8) and sheep (5)
2. Focus on acquiring brick through trades to enable expansion
3. Build road toward wheat/ore areas for additional settlements
4. Aim for early city upgrades leveraging my strong ore production
5. Consider development card strategy with good ore/wheat/sheep access
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.

# Initial Placement Analysis

I need to choose the best location for my second initial road placement. This is a critical decision that will determine my expansion path.

Let's evaluate my current position:
- I have a settlement at node 19 (producing ore-8, wood-9, ore-5)
- I just placed my second settlement at node 27 (producing wheat-8)
- I have 1 wheat resource
- I have one road at (19, 20)

My current strengths:
- Excellent ore production (two ore hexes with 5 and 8)
- Good wheat (8) and wood (9) access
- My two settlements are well-positioned on opposite sides of the board

My main weaknesses:
- Limited brick access (need for expansion)
- No sheep production yet
- Only one wheat hex

## Road Options Analysis

[0] Build a road at edge (8, 27)
- Direction: Northeast from settlement 27
- Leads toward: High-value wheat-8 hex
- Opens expansion toward: Node 8 (wheat-8, forest-3, wheat-4)
- Strategic value: Moderate, connects toward additional wheat but overlaps resources

[1] Build a road at edge (26, 27)
- Direction: Southeast from settlement 27
- Leads toward: The ore-2:1 port and wheat-8 hex
- Opens expansion toward: Node 26 (wheat-8) and potentially to the 3:1 port
- Strategic value: Moderate, but limited expansion potential

[2] Build a road at edge (27, 28)
- Direction: Southwest from settlement 27
- Leads toward: The sheep-2:1 port and sheep-5 hex
- Opens expansion toward: Node 28 (sheep-2:1 port) and node 29 (sheep-5)
- Strategic value: High - gives access to sheep (missing resource) and a specialized port

## Strategic Decision

Looking at my resource distribution and expansion needs:

<plan>
1. Build my initial road toward the sheep-5 hex and sheep port to secure my missing resource
2. Prioritize getting brick to build roads and expand toward node 28/29 for sheep access
3. Build settlement at node 28 or 29 to secure sheep production and sheep port
4. Focus on city upgrades leveraging my strong ore production
5. Use the sheep port to trade excess sheep for other resources
</plan>

Option [2] is clearly best because:
- It leads toward the sheep resource I'm currently missing
- It connects to a sheep 2:1 port which will be valuable given my expected sheep production
- It creates opportunity to secure good sheep production on the 5-value hex
- This direction has the least competition from other players currently

The final decision is:

  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, securing future expansion)
  4. Proximity to useful ports
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Longest road (2 VP) requires strategic planning - only pursue if you already have 4+ roads built

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- When someone has 8+ points, ALWAYS target them with the robber regardless of other factors
- If you're being targeted by the robber, consider using knight cards immediately to protect production

TURN-BY-TURN PLANNING:
1. Start each turn by assessing your current VP and opponents' VPs (both visible and potential hidden points)
2. Identify your build priority for this turn: settlement, city, road, or development card?
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for your priority build
4. If you can't build your priority item, determine if trading or buying a development card is better
5. Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card or trade for needed resources
6. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

WINNING PATHS:
1. CITY-FOCUSED PATH: 3-4 cities (6-8 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 9-11 VP
2. BALANCED PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 VP card = 10 VP
3. DEVELOPMENT PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP

NEVER SAY NO TO FREE VPs:
- Always account for the 2 VP from longest road and largest army in your plans
- These special cards are EASY to lose if you're not defending them
- Invest in roads/knights to maintain your lead if these VPs are part of your strategy
- Be alert for opponents trying to steal these bonus points

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 6 | Player: BLUE | Action: MOVE_ROBBER

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Build my initial road toward the sheep-5 hex and sheep port to secure my missing resource
2. Prioritize getting brick to build roads and expand toward node 28/29 for sheep access
3. Build settlement at node 28 or 29 to secure sheep production and sheep port
4. Focus on city upgrades leveraging my strong ore production
5. Use the sheep port to trade excess sheep for other resources

# Game Analysis and Robber Placement Strategy

I need to make a decision about where to place the robber to maximize my advantage. Let me analyze the game state carefully.

## Game State Overview
- I'm playing BLUE with 2 VP, have settlements at nodes 19 and 27
- RED also has 2 VP with settlements at nodes 18 and 13
- I have 1 wood and 1 wheat in hand
- RED has 2 unknown resources
- My settlements produce ore (from 8 and 5), wood (from 9) and wheat (from 8)
- I'm missing brick and sheep in my production

## Robber Placement Goals
1. Block high-probability resources RED is using
2. Position to steal resources I need
3. Minimize impact on my own production

## Analyzing RED's Production
RED has settlements producing:
- Brick (from two 10 hexes)
- Wood (from 11 hex)
- Wheat (from 6 hex)
- Sheep (from 9 hex)
- Ore (from 4 hex)

## Best Robber Placement Options

Looking at RED's production, I should target their highest value resources that I also need:
- Option [9]: Placing on (-1, -1, 2) - RED's wood 11 hex
- Option [3]: Placing on (-1, 0, 1) - RED's brick 10 hex
- Option [4]: Placing on (-1, 1, 0) - RED's wheat 6 hex
- Option [12]: Placing on (-2, 2, 0) - RED's sheep 9 hex

The best choices are:
1. Option [3] to block brick 10 - RED has access to TWO brick hexes which gives them an advantage for road building, and I need brick to expand toward the sheep port
2. Option [12] to block sheep 9 - RED has sheep which I lack completely

Since my plan involves securing sheep access and brick is crucial for my expansion, I believe blocking one of RED's brick hexes is most strategic, while also giving me a chance to steal a resource.

<plan>
1. Block RED's brick production by placing robber on one of their brick hexes
2. Continue my expansion toward node 28/29 for sheep access and the sheep port
3. Once I acquire brick, build roads to reach node 28 or 29 for my next settlement
4. Focus on city upgrades leveraging my strong ore production
5. Use the sheep port to trade excess sheep once I secure that resource
</plan>

Therefore, I choose option [3] to place the robber on (-1, 0, 1), one of RED's brick hexes, and steal from RED.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Target hexes with HIGH probability numbers (6,8,5,9) - prioritize these above all else
- Go for resource DIVERSITY: secure ALL five resources between your two settlements
- Focus on ORE and WHEAT for city upgrades (numbers 5-9 preferred)
- Evaluate each potential settlement by its TOTAL PIP COUNT (sum of probability dots)
- Place your initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Avoid placing both settlements near the same resources - diversify your income!
- Always consider 3:1 ports if your initial placement gives you limited access to certain resources
- Place roads in directions that block opponents' expansion routes

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT & CITY BUILDING PRIORITY:
- FIRST PRIORITY: Build 1-2 additional settlements early to secure critical resources you lack
- SECOND PRIORITY: Upgrade to cities as quickly as possible to double resource production
- THIRD PRIORITY: Build roads only when they lead directly to valuable settlement locations
- Early game (1-5 turns): Secure key settlements at high-value locations
- Mid-game (6-15 turns): Focus heavily on upgrading to cities (2-3 cities should be your target)
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road
- When short on a key resource, use 2:1 ports if available before using 3:1 or 4:1 ports
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat to other players unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- If you have excess of a resource, use ports rather than trading with opponents

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards primarily when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber OR to reach Largest Army (3+ knights)
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city or settlement build
- Use Monopoly cards after high-probability dice rolls to collect maximum resources
- Keep track of how many VP cards you've drawn (5 in the deck total)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn
- When development cards are your path to victory, aim for: 3 cities (6 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 victory cards (2 VP)
- Consider buying development cards when you have limited build options (blocked roads, etc.)

OPTIMAL EXPANSION PATH:
- Build roads with PURPOSE - every road should lead to a viable settlement location
- Identify and secure "bottleneck" positions that cut off opponents' expansion
- Expand toward resources you LACK from initial placement - seek balance
- When choosing between multiple settlement spots, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (total pip count)
  2. Access to resources you currently lack
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, securing future expansion)
  4. Proximity to useful ports
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Longest road (2 VP) requires strategic planning - only pursue if you already have 4+ roads built

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- When someone has 8+ points, ALWAYS target them with the robber regardless of other factors
- If you're being targeted by the robber, consider using knight cards immediately to protect production

TURN-BY-TURN PLANNING:
1. Start each turn by assessing your current VP and opponents' VPs (both visible and potential hidden points)
2. Identify your build priority for this turn: settlement, city, road, or development card?
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for your priority build
4. If you can't build your priority item, determine if trading or buying a development card is better
5. Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card or trade for needed resources
6. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

WINNING PATHS:
1. CITY-FOCUSED PATH: 3-4 cities (6-8 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 9-11 VP
2. BALANCED PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 VP card = 10 VP
3. DEVELOPMENT PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP

NEVER SAY NO TO FREE VPs:
- Always account for the 2 VP from longest road and largest army in your plans
- These special cards are EASY to lose if you're not defending them
- Invest in roads/knights to maintain your lead if these VPs are part of your strategy
- Be alert for opponents trying to steal these bonus points

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

4. Focus on city upgrades leveraging my strong ore production
5. Use the sheep port to trade excess sheep once I secure that resource

RESPONSE:
# Game Analysis - Turn 16

I'll analyze my current situation thoroughly to determine the optimal action.

## Current Game State Assessment:
- I have 2 VP (2 settlements)
- Resources: 4 Wood, 3 Wheat
- Red has 2 VP and 7 hidden cards
- The robber is already on an ore hex (0,1,-1), likely blocking my own ore production at node 19
- I currently lack brick and sheep, which limits my building options

## Analyzing My Current Positions:
- Settlement at node 19: Produces ore (8 & 5) and wood (9) - strong ore production
- Settlement at node 27: Produces wheat (8) - excellent wheat production
- I have roads at (19,20) and (27,28), working toward expansion

## Evaluating Available Actions:
1. End Turn (0): Since I can't build anything now, this is my only practical option
2-4. Maritime Trades (1-4): Trading 4 wood for any resource is inefficient (4:1)
   - I need brick to build roads toward sheep (nodes 28/29) per my plan
   - However, trading at 4:1 is extremely inefficient and depletes my wood reserves

## Strategic Considerations:
- I should save my resources for more efficient future builds
- Trading 4 wood for 1 brick would leave me with no wood and only 1 brick - not enough for substantial progress
- My settlements are well-placed for ore and wheat production (strong city strategy)
- The robber needs to be moved when I roll a 7, preferably to block Red's brick production (10)

<plan>
1. End my turn and accumulate more resources
2. When rolling a 7, move robber to one of Red's brick hexes (10) to disrupt their production
3. Build roads toward node 28/29 for sheep access and the sheep port once I acquire brick
4. Focus on city upgrades with my strong ore/wheat production
5. Consider buying development cards if I get excess ore/wheat/sheep
</plan>

Based on the detailed analysis, the most efficient action is to end my turn and accumulate more resources for better trades or builds in future turns. Any maritime trade at this point would be inefficient and counter-productive.

- Always consider 3:1 ports if your initial placement gives you limited access to certain resources
- Place roads in directions that block opponents' expansion routes

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT & CITY BUILDING PRIORITY:
- FIRST PRIORITY: Build 1-2 additional settlements early to secure critical resources you lack
- SECOND PRIORITY: Upgrade to cities as quickly as possible to double resource production
- THIRD PRIORITY: Build roads only when they lead directly to valuable settlement locations
- Early game (1-5 turns): Secure key settlements at high-value locations
- Mid-game (6-15 turns): Focus heavily on upgrading to cities (2-3 cities should be your target)
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road
- When short on a key resource, use 2:1 ports if available before using 3:1 or 4:1 ports
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat to other players unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- If you have excess of a resource, use ports rather than trading with opponents

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards primarily when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber OR to reach Largest Army (3+ knights)
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city or settlement build
- Use Monopoly cards after high-probability dice rolls to collect maximum resources
- Keep track of how many VP cards you've drawn (5 in the deck total)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn
- When development cards are your path to victory, aim for: 3 cities (6 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 victory cards (2 VP)
- Consider buying development cards when you have limited build options (blocked roads, etc.)

OPTIMAL EXPANSION PATH:
- Build roads with PURPOSE - every road should lead to a viable settlement location
- Identify and secure "bottleneck" positions that cut off opponents' expansion
- Expand toward resources you LACK from initial placement - seek balance
- When choosing between multiple settlement spots, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (total pip count)
  2. Access to resources you currently lack
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, securing future expansion)
  4. Proximity to useful ports
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Longest road (2 VP) requires strategic planning - only pursue if you already have 4+ roads built

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- When someone has 8+ points, ALWAYS target them with the robber regardless of other factors
- If you're being targeted by the robber, consider using knight cards immediately to protect production

TURN-BY-TURN PLANNING:
1. Start each turn by assessing your current VP and opponents' VPs (both visible and potential hidden points)
2. Identify your build priority for this turn: settlement, city, road, or development card?
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for your priority build
4. If you can't build your priority item, determine if trading or buying a development card is better
5. Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card or trade for needed resources
6. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

WINNING PATHS:
1. CITY-FOCUSED PATH: 3-4 cities (6-8 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 9-11 VP
2. BALANCED PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 VP card = 10 VP
3. DEVELOPMENT PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP

NEVER SAY NO TO FREE VPs:
- Always account for the 2 VP from longest road and largest army in your plans
- These special cards are EASY to lose if you're not defending them
- Invest in roads/knights to maintain your lead if these VPs are part of your strategy
- Be alert for opponents trying to steal these bonus points

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 18 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. End my turn and accumulate more resources
2. When rolling a 7, move robber to one of Red's brick hexes (10) to disrupt their production
3. Build roads toward node 28/29 for sheep access and the sheep port once I acquire brick
4. Focus on city upgrades with my strong ore/wheat production
5. Consider buying development cards if I get excess ore/wheat/sheep

# Game Analysis and Strategic Decision

Let me analyze the current game state and available options:

## Current Resources
- I have 5 Wood, 3 Wheat, 1 Ore
- No Brick or Sheep

## Victory Point Status
- I have 2 VP (from 2 settlements)
- Red also has 2 VP (from 2 settlements)

## Production
My settlements are well-positioned:
- Settlement at node 19: produces Ore (8), Wood (9), Ore (5) - great ore production
- Settlement at node 27: produces Wheat (8) - excellent wheat production

## Strategic Position
- I have strong ore and wheat production (needed for cities)
- I'm missing brick and sheep for expansion
- I have roads toward node 28, which leads to the sheep port
- Red has many more roads (10) than me (4), suggesting they're pursuing longest road

## Action Options Analysis
1. End my turn (Option 0)
   - I have 9 resources total, no risk of losing half if a 7 is rolled
   - Waiting will allow me to accumulate more resources for better builds

2. Trade using 4:1 port (Options 1-4)
   - I have excess wood (5), and could trade for brick or sheep
   - But a 4:1 trade is very inefficient - better to wait for better resources

Considering my current game plan, I should continue accumulating resources. My ore and wheat production is strong, which supports upgrading to cities soon. Trading at this point is inefficient with a 4:1 ratio.

<plan>
1. End turn to accumulate more resources
2. Focus on upgrading one settlement to a city (need 3 ore, 2 wheat - already have 1 ore, 3 wheat)
3. Continue expanding toward node 28/29 for sheep port access
4. Buy development cards if I get excess ore/wheat/sheep
5. Watch Red's progress toward longest road and counter if needed
</plan>

Looking at all available actions, ending my turn is the most strategic move to continue my resource accumulation.

PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

# Game Analysis - Turn 20

Let me analyze my current game state and available options to determine the optimal move:

## Current Position Assessment:
- I have 2 VP (2 settlements)
- Resources: 5 Wood, 3 Wheat, 1 Ore
- I need 2 more Ore to upgrade a settlement to a city
- Red player has 2 VP and 5 roads built (longest: 3)
- The robber is on the ore hex with value 8, blocking my most valuable production

## Short-term Priorities:
1. I need to increase my resource production and VP total
2. Upgrading to a city requires 3 Ore + 2 Wheat (I have 1 Ore, 3 Wheat already)
3. Building a new settlement requires 1 Wood, 1 Brick, 1 Wheat, 1 Sheep (I have Wood and Wheat)

## Available Actions:
- End Turn [0]
- Trade 4 Wood for other resources [1-4]

## Option Analysis:
- Trading 4 Wood for 1 Ore [2] would give me 2 Ore total, one short of a city
- Trading 4 Wood for 1 Brick [4] could allow me to build a road, progressing toward a new settlement
- Ending turn [0] preserves my resources for future opportunities

If I trade 4 Wood for 1 Ore, I'd still be 1 Ore short of a city. If I trade for a Brick, I could build a road but still lack Sheep for a settlement. Neither trade seems optimal at this point.

Given that I have a strong production of Ore (despite the robber) and my city upgrade strategy requires more Ore, the best approach is to end my turn and wait for more favorable resource accumulation.

<plan>
1. End turn now to conserve resources
2. Wait for more Ore production (from my settlement at node 19)
3. Continue the city upgrade strategy (need 2 more Ore)
4. Build road toward sheep port at node 28/29 once I have brick
5. Consider development cards if I accumulate excess wheat/ore/sheep
</plan>

- THIRD PRIORITY: Build roads only when they lead directly to valuable settlement locations
- Early game (1-5 turns): Secure key settlements at high-value locations
- Mid-game (6-15 turns): Focus heavily on upgrading to cities (2-3 cities should be your target)
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road
- When short on a key resource, use 2:1 ports if available before using 3:1 or 4:1 ports
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat to other players unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- If you have excess of a resource, use ports rather than trading with opponents

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards primarily when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber OR to reach Largest Army (3+ knights)
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city or settlement build
- Use Monopoly cards after high-probability dice rolls to collect maximum resources
- Keep track of how many VP cards you've drawn (5 in the deck total)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn
- When development cards are your path to victory, aim for: 3 cities (6 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 victory cards (2 VP)
- Consider buying development cards when you have limited build options (blocked roads, etc.)

OPTIMAL EXPANSION PATH:
- Build roads with PURPOSE - every road should lead to a viable settlement location
- Identify and secure "bottleneck" positions that cut off opponents' expansion
- Expand toward resources you LACK from initial placement - seek balance
- When choosing between multiple settlement spots, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (total pip count)
  2. Access to resources you currently lack
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, securing future expansion)
  4. Proximity to useful ports
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Longest road (2 VP) requires strategic planning - only pursue if you already have 4+ roads built

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- When someone has 8+ points, ALWAYS target them with the robber regardless of other factors
- If you're being targeted by the robber, consider using knight cards immediately to protect production

TURN-BY-TURN PLANNING:
1. Start each turn by assessing your current VP and opponents' VPs (both visible and potential hidden points)
2. Identify your build priority for this turn: settlement, city, road, or development card?
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for your priority build
4. If you can't build your priority item, determine if trading or buying a development card is better
5. Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card or trade for needed resources
6. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

WINNING PATHS:
1. CITY-FOCUSED PATH: 3-4 cities (6-8 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 9-11 VP
2. BALANCED PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 VP card = 10 VP
3. DEVELOPMENT PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP

NEVER SAY NO TO FREE VPs:
- Always account for the 2 VP from longest road and largest army in your plans
- These special cards are EASY to lose if you're not defending them
- Invest in roads/knights to maintain your lead if these VPs are part of your strategy
- Be alert for opponents trying to steal these bonus points

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 22 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. End turn now to conserve resources
2. Wait for more Ore production (from my settlement at node 19)
3. Continue the city upgrade strategy (need 2 more Ore)
4. Build road toward sheep port at node 28/29 once I have brick
5. Consider development cards if I accumulate excess wheat/ore/sheep

# Game Analysis for Settlers of Catan

## Current Game State Assessment
- I have 2 victory points (2 settlements)
- Resources: 5 Wood, 3 Wheat, 1 Ore
- My opponent has 3 points (3 settlements) and is ahead
- The robber is currently on the Ore hex (0,1,-1) with value 8, which is one of my key production hexes
- I need 8 more points to win

## Resource Analysis
Looking at my resources, I have:
- Excess Wood (5)
- Decent Wheat (3)
- Limited Ore (1)
- No Brick or Sheep

My current plan involves:
1. Ending turn to conserve resources
2. Waiting for Ore production
3. Continuing city upgrades (need 2 more Ore)
4. Building road toward sheep port

## Available Actions
My options are:
- End my turn [0]
- Trade 4 Wood for various resources [1-4]

## Evaluation
I need to decide between conserving resources or trading my excess Wood for something I need.

A city costs 3 Ore + 2 Wheat. I have 1 Ore and 3 Wheat, so I still need 2 more Ore.
I can trade 4 Wood for 1 Ore [2], leaving me with 1 Wood, 3 Wheat, and 2 Ore - still 1 Ore short of a city.

My settlement at node 19 produces Ore from both the 8 and 5 hexes, but the 8 hex is currently blocked by the robber. This reduces my Ore production potential.

Building a road requires 1 Wood + 1 Brick. I have Wood but no Brick.

## Strategic Decision
Given my situation, I should trade 4 Wood for 1 Ore. This moves me closer to my city upgrade goal. Even though I'll still be 1 Ore short, it's better than keeping excess Wood that might be stolen or lost to a 7 roll.

<plan>
1. Trade 4 Wood for 1 Ore now
2. Wait for more Ore production from my settlement
3. Once I have 3 Ore total, upgrade a settlement to a city
4. After city upgrade, focus on getting Brick to build roads toward sheep port at node 28/29
5. Consider development cards once my city is built
</plan>

I'll trade 4 Wood for 1 Ore to get closer to my city upgrade.

PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Target hexes with HIGH probability numbers (6,8,5,9) - prioritize these above all else
- Go for resource DIVERSITY: secure ALL five resources between your two settlements
- Focus on ORE and WHEAT for city upgrades (numbers 5-9 preferred)
- Evaluate each potential settlement by its TOTAL PIP COUNT (sum of probability dots)
- Place your initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Avoid placing both settlements near the same resources - diversify your income!
- Always consider 3:1 ports if your initial placement gives you limited access to certain resources
- Place roads in directions that block opponents' expansion routes

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT & CITY BUILDING PRIORITY:
- FIRST PRIORITY: Build 1-2 additional settlements early to secure critical resources you lack

# Analysis of Game State

Let me examine my current position and options carefully:

## Victory Points
- I have 2 VP (from 2 settlements)
- RED has 3 VP (from 3 settlements)
- We're still early in the game with no longest road/largest army established

## Resources
- I have: 1 Wood, 4 Wheat, 2 Ore
- My settlements produce: Ore (8), Ore (5), Wood (9), Wheat (8)

## Strategic Position
- I have settlements at nodes 19 and 27, which are on opposite sides of the board
- My production is strong with good numbers (8, 9, 5) but I lack Brick and Sheep production
- I have access to the Sheep port (nodes 28, 29) - this could be valuable
- The robber is on my Ore (8) hex, blocking my best production

## Current Plan Analysis
My current plan mentions:
1. Trade 4 Wood for 1 Ore 
2. Wait for more Ore production
3. Get 3 Ore total to upgrade a settlement to a city
4. Focus on Brick for roads toward sheep port

However, I already have 2 Ore, not Wood, so I need to adjust my thinking.

## Options Evaluation

Looking at my available actions:
- [0] End turn - Not optimal as I have resources to trade
- [1-4] Trading options using 4 Wheat for various resources

I have 4 Wheat and can trade it for a resource I need. To make progress, I need to determine what my immediate goal should be:

1. **Upgrade to a city**: I need 3 Ore + 2 Wheat
   - I already have 2 Ore and 4 Wheat
   - I need 1 more Ore to upgrade to a city
   
2. **Build a settlement**: I need 1 Wood + 1 Brick + 1 Sheep + 1 Wheat
   - I have 1 Wood and 4 Wheat
   - I need Brick and Sheep
   
3. **Build roads**: I need Wood and Brick
   - I have 1 Wood
   - I need Brick

## Decision Making

Based on my resource distribution and progress toward victory, upgrading to a city is my best immediate option:
- It will double production at one of my settlements
- I'm already close (just need 1 more Ore)
- Cities are 2 VP each, getting me closer to winning

Trading 4 Wheat for 1 Ore would allow me to immediately upgrade to a city. This is an efficient use of my resources and aligns with the optimal city-building strategy.

<plan>
1. Trade 4 Wheat for 1 Ore now
2. Build a city at my settlement at node 19 (on the high-production Ore/Wood hex)
3. Once my city is built, focus on expanding toward the Sheep port at nodes 28/29
4. Consider buying development cards if I accumulate excess Sheep/Wheat/Ore
</plan>

Therefore, my optimal action is to trade 4 Wheat for 1 Ore (action #3).

4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Target hexes with HIGH probability numbers (6,8,5,9) - prioritize these above all else
- Go for resource DIVERSITY: secure ALL five resources between your two settlements
- Focus on ORE and WHEAT for city upgrades (numbers 5-9 preferred)
- Evaluate each potential settlement by its TOTAL PIP COUNT (sum of probability dots)
- Place your initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Avoid placing both settlements near the same resources - diversify your income!
- Always consider 3:1 ports if your initial placement gives you limited access to certain resources
- Place roads in directions that block opponents' expansion routes

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT & CITY BUILDING PRIORITY:
- FIRST PRIORITY: Build 1-2 additional settlements early to secure critical resources you lack
- SECOND PRIORITY: Upgrade to cities as quickly as possible to double resource production
- THIRD PRIORITY: Build roads only when they lead directly to valuable settlement locations
- Early game (1-5 turns): Secure key settlements at high-value locations
- Mid-game (6-15 turns): Focus heavily on upgrading to cities (2-3 cities should be your target)
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road
- When short on a key resource, use 2:1 ports if available before using 3:1 or 4:1 ports
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat to other players unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- If you have excess of a resource, use ports rather than trading with opponents

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards primarily when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber OR to reach Largest Army (3+ knights)
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city or settlement build
- Use Monopoly cards after high-probability dice rolls to collect maximum resources
- Keep track of how many VP cards you've drawn (5 in the deck total)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn
- When development cards are your path to victory, aim for: 3 cities (6 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 victory cards (2 VP)
- Consider buying development cards when you have limited build options (blocked roads, etc.)

OPTIMAL EXPANSION PATH:
- Build roads with PURPOSE - every road should lead to a viable settlement location
- Identify and secure "bottleneck" positions that cut off opponents' expansion
- Expand toward resources you LACK from initial placement - seek balance
- When choosing between multiple settlement spots, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (total pip count)
  2. Access to resources you currently lack
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, securing future expansion)
  4. Proximity to useful ports
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Longest road (2 VP) requires strategic planning - only pursue if you already have 4+ roads built

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- When someone has 8+ points, ALWAYS target them with the robber regardless of other factors
- If you're being targeted by the robber, consider using knight cards immediately to protect production

TURN-BY-TURN PLANNING:
1. Start each turn by assessing your current VP and opponents' VPs (both visible and potential hidden points)
2. Identify your build priority for this turn: settlement, city, road, or development card?
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for your priority build
4. If you can't build your priority item, determine if trading or buying a development card is better
5. Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card or trade for needed resources
6. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

WINNING PATHS:
1. CITY-FOCUSED PATH: 3-4 cities (6-8 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 9-11 VP
2. BALANCED PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 VP card = 10 VP
3. DEVELOPMENT PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP

NEVER SAY NO TO FREE VPs:
- Always account for the 2 VP from longest road and largest army in your plans
- These special cards are EASY to lose if you're not defending them
- Invest in roads/knights to maintain your lead if these VPs are part of your strategy
- Be alert for opponents trying to steal these bonus points

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 26 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Trade 4 Wheat for 1 Ore now
2. Build a city at my settlement at node 19 (on the high-production Ore/Wood hex)
3. Once my city is built, focus on expanding toward the Sheep port at nodes 28/29
4. Consider buying development cards if I accumulate excess Sheep/Wheat/Ore

# Game Analysis for Blue (Turn 26)

Let me carefully analyze the game state and consider my options:

## Current Game Status
- I'm Blue: 2 VP (2 settlements)
- Red: 3 VP (3 settlements)
- Resources: 1 Wood, 1 Wheat, 4 Ore
- Buildings: 2 settlements (nodes 19 and 27), 2 roads
- Both of my settlements have excellent production: node 19 produces Ore (8 pips) and Wood (9 pips)

## Strategic Assessment

My current plan was:
1. Trade for Ore to build a city at node 19
2. Expand toward Sheep port (nodes 28/29)

However, I already have 4 Ore! The plan likely meant to trade for Brick, not Ore, since I need 3 Ore + 2 Wheat for a city.

### Resource Needs:
- For a city: Need 3 Ore + 2 Wheat (I have 4 Ore but only 1 Wheat)
- For a settlement: Need 1 Brick + 1 Wood + 1 Wheat + 1 Sheep (I have 1 Wood, 1 Wheat, 0 Brick, 0 Sheep)
- For a road: Need 1 Brick + 1 Wood (I have 1 Wood, 0 Brick)

### Action Evaluation:
1. Trading 4 Ore for 1 Sheep: Doesn't help me complete any immediate builds
2. Trading 4 Ore for 1 Wheat: Would give me 2 Wheat, still short for a city (need 3 Ore, 2 Wheat)
3. Trading 4 Ore for 1 Wood: Doesn't help complete any builds (I already have 1 Wood)
4. Trading 4 Ore for 1 Brick: Would give me 1 Brick + 1 Wood, enough for 1 road, but not strategic
0. End turn: Best option since no trade advances my most efficient path to victory

## Decision Logic

Looking at my resources (1 Wood, 1 Wheat, 4 Ore), I can't build anything even with a trade. My best strategy is to end my turn, collect more resources, and work toward a city at node 19 next turn.

Wheat is my priority need right now - I just need 1 more to build a city. Since node 27 produces Wheat (8), there's a good chance I'll get what I need on upcoming rolls.

Trading Ore right now would be wasteful since I need 3 Ore for a city. After completing a city at node 19, I'll generate resources faster, especially from my high-pip value hexes.

<plan>
1. End turn now (no beneficial trades)
2. Wait for 1 more Wheat to build a city at node 19
3. Once city is built, focus on expanding toward Sheep port
4. Consider buying development cards if resources allow

# Robber Placement Analysis

Let me analyze this robber placement decision carefully.

## Game State Assessment
- I have 2 VP vs RED's 3 VP
- I need 1 more wheat for a city at node 19
- RED has 6 hidden resource cards, making them a good robbery target
- The robber is currently on (0, 1, -1), which is an Ore 8 hex - one of my own high-value production spots!

## Key Considerations
1. Moving the robber off my own Ore 8 hex is critical - it's blocking one of my best production spots
2. I want to block RED's production while stealing a useful resource (ideally Wheat)
3. I should target high-probability hexes that RED relies on

## Analyzing RED's Production
- RED has settlements at nodes 18, 13, and 4
- Node 18: produces Wheat 6, Sheep 9, Ore 4
- Node 13: produces Brick 10, Wood 11, Brick 10
- Node 4: produces Sheep 2, Brick 10, Wheat 6

The highest value hexes for RED are:
- Wheat 6 (at (-1, 1, 0)) - connects to node 18 and node 4
- Brick 10 (at (-1, 0, 1) and (-2, 0, 2)) - connect to nodes 13 and 4
- Sheep 9 (at (-2, 2, 0)) - connects to node 18

## Best Robber Placements

Option 4: Move robber to (-1, 1, 0) and steal from RED
- This blocks Wheat 6, a high-probability hex
- RED has settlements at nodes 18 and 4 that both produce from this hex
- I need Wheat for my city, so stealing might get me what I need

Option 12: Move robber to (-2, 2, 0) and steal from RED
- This blocks Sheep 9, a good probability hex
- RED has a settlement at node 18 producing from this hex

Option 3: Move robber to (-1, 0, 1) and steal from RED
- This blocks one of RED's Brick 10 hexes
- RED has settlements at nodes 13 and 4 producing from this hex

## Decision
Option 4 is optimal because:
1. It blocks a high-probability Wheat 6 hex that RED is using twice
2. I need Wheat for my city build, so stealing might complete my resource needs
3. This move impacts RED's production the most, targeting multiple settlements

<plan>
1. Move robber to Wheat 6 hex (-1, 1, 0) and steal from RED, hoping for Wheat
2. Use my Wheat (either stolen or from future rolls) to build a city at node 19
3. Continue expansion toward Sheep port for better trading options
4. Consider development cards for additional victory points
</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Target hexes with HIGH probability numbers (6,8,5,9) - prioritize these above all else
- Go for resource DIVERSITY: secure ALL five resources between your two settlements
- Focus on ORE and WHEAT for city upgrades (numbers 5-9 preferred)
- Evaluate each potential settlement by its TOTAL PIP COUNT (sum of probability dots)
- Place your initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Avoid placing both settlements near the same resources - diversify your income!
- Always consider 3:1 ports if your initial placement gives you limited access to certain resources
- Place roads in directions that block opponents' expansion routes

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT & CITY BUILDING PRIORITY:
- FIRST PRIORITY: Build 1-2 additional settlements early to secure critical resources you lack
- SECOND PRIORITY: Upgrade to cities as quickly as possible to double resource production
- THIRD PRIORITY: Build roads only when they lead directly to valuable settlement locations
- Early game (1-5 turns): Secure key settlements at high-value locations
- Mid-game (6-15 turns): Focus heavily on upgrading to cities (2-3 cities should be your target)
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road
- When short on a key resource, use 2:1 ports if available before using 3:1 or 4:1 ports
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat to other players unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- If you have excess of a resource, use ports rather than trading with opponents

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards primarily when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber OR to reach Largest Army (3+ knights)
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city or settlement build
- Use Monopoly cards after high-probability dice rolls to collect maximum resources
- Keep track of how many VP cards you've drawn (5 in the deck total)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn
- When development cards are your path to victory, aim for: 3 cities (6 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 victory cards (2 VP)
- Consider buying development cards when you have limited build options (blocked roads, etc.)

OPTIMAL EXPANSION PATH:
- Build roads with PURPOSE - every road should lead to a viable settlement location
- Identify and secure "bottleneck" positions that cut off opponents' expansion
- Expand toward resources you LACK from initial placement - seek balance
- When choosing between multiple settlement spots, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (total pip count)
  2. Access to resources you currently lack
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, securing future expansion)
  4. Proximity to useful ports
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Longest road (2 VP) requires strategic planning - only pursue if you already have 4+ roads built

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- When someone has 8+ points, ALWAYS target them with the robber regardless of other factors
- If you're being targeted by the robber, consider using knight cards immediately to protect production

TURN-BY-TURN PLANNING:
1. Start each turn by assessing your current VP and opponents' VPs (both visible and potential hidden points)
2. Identify your build priority for this turn: settlement, city, road, or development card?
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for your priority build
4. If you can't build your priority item, determine if trading or buying a development card is better
5. Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card or trade for needed resources
6. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

WINNING PATHS:
1. CITY-FOCUSED PATH: 3-4 cities (6-8 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 9-11 VP
2. BALANCED PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 VP card = 10 VP
3. DEVELOPMENT PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP

NEVER SAY NO TO FREE VPs:
- Always account for the 2 VP from longest road and largest army in your plans
- These special cards are EASY to lose if you're not defending them
- Invest in roads/knights to maintain your lead if these VPs are part of your strategy
- Be alert for opponents trying to steal these bonus points

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 28 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Move robber to Wheat 6 hex (-1, 1, 0) and steal from RED, hoping for Wheat
2. Use my Wheat (either stolen or from future rolls) to build a city at node 19
3. Continue expansion toward Sheep port for better trading options
4. Consider development cards for additional victory points

# Game Analysis for Settlers of Catan

Let me analyze the current game state and my available options:

## Current Game Status
- I have 2 victory points (2 settlements)
- I have 1 Wood, 1 Wheat, and 5 Ore resources
- Red has 3 victory points (3 settlements)
- The robber is already on the Wheat 6 hex (-1, 1, 0), which is one of Red's productive hexes

## Available Actions
- [0] End my turn
- [1-4] Trade 4 Ore for various resources using the 4:1 trade rate

## Strategic Assessment
My current resources aren't enough to build anything valuable immediately:
- City (2 Wheat + 3 Ore): I have sufficient Ore but only 1 Wheat
- Settlement (1 Wood + 1 Brick + 1 Wheat + 1 Sheep): I have Wood and Wheat but no Brick or Sheep
- Development Card (1 Wheat + 1 Sheep + 1 Ore): I have Wheat and Ore but no Sheep

Looking at my previous plan, I was hoping to steal Wheat from Red to build a city. Since I can't move the robber now (it's not a 7 roll or Knight card), I need to adjust my plan.

My most efficient path forward would be to trade for the resources I need:
- I could trade 4 Ore for 1 Sheep, which would allow me to buy a development card with my existing Wheat + Ore
- Alternatively, I could trade 4 Ore for 1 more Wheat, which would leave me with 2 Wheat and 1 Ore - not enough for any major build but getting closer to a city

<plan>
1. Trade 4 Ore for 1 Sheep
2. Use the Sheep + Wheat + Ore to buy a development card (hoping for a VP or Knight)
3. Continue working toward city upgrades when I get more Wheat
4. Look for expansion opportunities toward the Sheep port
</plan>

Since I'm 1 Sheep away from being able to buy a development card, and development cards offer the potential for immediate VPs, Knights (for Largest Army), or utility cards, this seems like the optimal choice.

I'll trade 4 Ore for 1 Sheep.

- My two settlements are on good production spots: one on 8⛏️ + 9🌲 + 5⛏️ (very good ore production), and one on 8🌾 (good wheat)
- The robber is on a wheat hex (-1, 1, 0) with value 6, blocking potentially good wheat production
- RED is ahead in both settlements (3 vs 2) and roads (5 vs 2)

## Available Actions
[0] End turn
[1] Buy a development card (costs 1🐑 + 1🌾 + 1⛏️)

## Decision Analysis

Option 1: Buy a development card
- Pros:
  - Could get a Knight (25% chance) to move the robber
  - Could get a Victory Point card (20% chance) for an immediate hidden VP
  - Could get a helpful action card (55% chance) like Year of Plenty, Monopoly, or Road Building
  - Progress toward Largest Army (2 VP)
  - Uses most of my current resources efficiently
- Cons:
  - Might get a card that doesn't help me immediately
  - Uses up resources that could be saved for expansion

Option 0: End turn
- Pros:
  - Save resources for future builds
- Cons:
  - Inefficient use of turn with resources to spend
  - No progress made toward victory

Looking at my current situation, buying a development card is clearly the better option. I have exactly the resources needed, and any development card will help me. I'm behind RED in visible VPs (2 vs 3), so I need to either catch up or get hidden points.

<plan>
1. Buy a development card now
2. Focus on getting more Wheat and Ore to upgrade one of my settlements to a city
3. Then use my Wood and any new resources to build roads toward the Sheep port (nodes 28-29)
4. Build a new settlement near the Sheep port to improve my Sheep income
5. Continue buying development cards when possible to work toward Largest Army
</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Target hexes with HIGH probability numbers (6,8,5,9) - prioritize these above all else
- Go for resource DIVERSITY: secure ALL five resources between your two settlements
- Focus on ORE and WHEAT for city upgrades (numbers 5-9 preferred)
- Evaluate each potential settlement by its TOTAL PIP COUNT (sum of probability dots)
- Place your initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Avoid placing both settlements near the same resources - diversify your income!
- Always consider 3:1 ports if your initial placement gives you limited access to certain resources
- Place roads in directions that block opponents' expansion routes

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT & CITY BUILDING PRIORITY:
- FIRST PRIORITY: Build 1-2 additional settlements early to secure critical resources you lack
- SECOND PRIORITY: Upgrade to cities as quickly as possible to double resource production
- THIRD PRIORITY: Build roads only when they lead directly to valuable settlement locations
- Early game (1-5 turns): Secure key settlements at high-value locations
- Mid-game (6-15 turns): Focus heavily on upgrading to cities (2-3 cities should be your target)
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road
- When short on a key resource, use 2:1 ports if available before using 3:1 or 4:1 ports
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat to other players unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- If you have excess of a resource, use ports rather than trading with opponents

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards primarily when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber OR to reach Largest Army (3+ knights)
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city or settlement build
- Use Monopoly cards after high-probability dice rolls to collect maximum resources
- Keep track of how many VP cards you've drawn (5 in the deck total)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn
- When development cards are your path to victory, aim for: 3 cities (6 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 victory cards (2 VP)
- Consider buying development cards when you have limited build options (blocked roads, etc.)

OPTIMAL EXPANSION PATH:
- Build roads with PURPOSE - every road should lead to a viable settlement location
- Identify and secure "bottleneck" positions that cut off opponents' expansion
- Expand toward resources you LACK from initial placement - seek balance
- When choosing between multiple settlement spots, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (total pip count)
  2. Access to resources you currently lack
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, securing future expansion)
  4. Proximity to useful ports
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Longest road (2 VP) requires strategic planning - only pursue if you already have 4+ roads built

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- When someone has 8+ points, ALWAYS target them with the robber regardless of other factors
- If you're being targeted by the robber, consider using knight cards immediately to protect production

TURN-BY-TURN PLANNING:
1. Start each turn by assessing your current VP and opponents' VPs (both visible and potential hidden points)
2. Identify your build priority for this turn: settlement, city, road, or development card?
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for your priority build
4. If you can't build your priority item, determine if trading or buying a development card is better
5. Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card or trade for needed resources
6. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

WINNING PATHS:
1. CITY-FOCUSED PATH: 3-4 cities (6-8 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 9-11 VP
2. BALANCED PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 VP card = 10 VP
3. DEVELOPMENT PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP

NEVER SAY NO TO FREE VPs:
- Always account for the 2 VP from longest road and largest army in your plans
- These special cards are EASY to lose if you're not defending them
- Invest in roads/knights to maintain your lead if these VPs are part of your strategy
- Be alert for opponents trying to steal these bonus points

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game Analysis - Settlers of Catan Turn 30

I need to decide between playing a Knight card or rolling the dice. Let me think about this strategically.

## Current Game State
- I have 2 VP from my 2 settlements
- I have no resources currently
- I have 1 Knight card in hand
- The robber is on Ore (8) at (0,1,-1), blocking one of my key high-value hexes
- Red has 3 VP and 4 cards in hand
- I'm at a critical point in my development plan

## Option 0: Play Knight Card
**Advantages:**
- Move the robber off my valuable 8-Ore hex (⛏️8[⭐⭐⭐]), which is my best production tile
- Steal a resource from Red (who has 4 cards)
- Move toward Largest Army (would need 2 more Knights)

**Disadvantages:**
- Playing before rolling means I might waste the opportunity to use it later this turn if I get blocked again
- No guarantee of stealing a useful resource

## Option 1: Roll Dice First
**Advantages:**
- Could get resources to build something immediately
- Could save the Knight card for a more strategic moment (e.g., if robber blocks me again)
- Most efficient play is usually to roll first, then decide actions based on new resources

**Disadvantages:**
- The robber is currently on my most productive hex (⛏️8), hampering my resource generation

## Strategic Assessment:
The robber is on my most valuable hex (⛏️8 with 3 pips), significantly hindering my production. My settlement at node 19 relies heavily on this hex for Ore production, which is crucial for both city upgrades and development cards according to my plan.

Rolling first could be inefficient if I don't get useful resources, while playing the Knight now guarantees removing the robber from my best hex and stealing a card from Red.

<plan>
1. Play Knight card now to move robber off my Ore hex
2. Steal a resource from Red, hopefully Ore or Wheat
3. Then roll the dice to maximize my resource production
4. Continue focus on getting Wheat and Ore to upgrade settlements to cities
5. Work toward building roads toward Sheep port (nodes 28-29) when Wood becomes available
</plan>

Given the robber is blocking my most productive hex (Ore 8), I should play the Knight card first to maximize my production on the subsequent roll. This aligns with my overall strategy of prioritizing city development, which requires Ore.

# Game State Analysis

I need to carefully analyze the board state and determine where to optimally place the robber.

## Current Situation
- I've played a Knight card and need to move the robber
- I have no resources currently
- RED has 4 hidden resource cards
- The robber is currently on an Ore hex (0, 1, -1) which is one of my high-value production hexes (8 pips)
- My plan involves gathering Ore and Wheat to upgrade settlements to cities

## Analyzing Robber Placement Options

When moving the robber, I should consider:
1. Moving it off my valuable production hexes
2. Blocking RED's best production
3. Stealing a useful resource from RED (ideally Ore or Wheat)

Looking at RED's settlements:
- Node 18: produces Wheat(6), Sheep(9), and Ore(4)
- Node 13: produces Brick(10), Wood(11), Brick(10)
- Node 4: produces Sheep(2), Brick(10), Wheat(6)

The Wheat(6) hex at (-1, 1, 0) is a high-value hex (5 pips) that produces for RED at node 18. This seems like an excellent target since:
- It blocks a high-probability resource (Wheat) that RED produces
- Wheat is also a resource I need for my city upgrade strategy
- I can steal from RED, possibly getting Wheat or another useful resource

Other good options include RED's Ore(4) hex at (-1, 2, -1), but the probability is lower (3 pips).

<plan>
1. Move the robber to Wheat(6) at (-1, 1, 0) and steal from RED
2. Roll dice to hopefully produce resources
3. Continue working toward upgrading settlements to cities
4. Build roads toward Sheep port (nodes 28-29) when Wood becomes available
</plan>

The best option is [4] Move robber to (-1, 1, 0) and steal from RED.
This blocks a good Wheat production hex from RED while allowing me to potentially steal a useful resource.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Target hexes with HIGH probability numbers (6,8,5,9) - prioritize these above all else
- Go for resource DIVERSITY: secure ALL five resources between your two settlements
- Focus on ORE and WHEAT for city upgrades (numbers 5-9 preferred)
- Evaluate each potential settlement by its TOTAL PIP COUNT (sum of probability dots)
- Place your initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Avoid placing both settlements near the same resources - diversify your income!
- Always consider 3:1 ports if your initial placement gives you limited access to certain resources
- Place roads in directions that block opponents' expansion routes

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT & CITY BUILDING PRIORITY:
- FIRST PRIORITY: Build 1-2 additional settlements early to secure critical resources you lack
- SECOND PRIORITY: Upgrade to cities as quickly as possible to double resource production
- THIRD PRIORITY: Build roads only when they lead directly to valuable settlement locations
- Early game (1-5 turns): Secure key settlements at high-value locations
- Mid-game (6-15 turns): Focus heavily on upgrading to cities (2-3 cities should be your target)
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road
- When short on a key resource, use 2:1 ports if available before using 3:1 or 4:1 ports
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat to other players unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- If you have excess of a resource, use ports rather than trading with opponents

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards primarily when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber OR to reach Largest Army (3+ knights)
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city or settlement build
- Use Monopoly cards after high-probability dice rolls to collect maximum resources
- Keep track of how many VP cards you've drawn (5 in the deck total)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn
- When development cards are your path to victory, aim for: 3 cities (6 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 victory cards (2 VP)
- Consider buying development cards when you have limited build options (blocked roads, etc.)

OPTIMAL EXPANSION PATH:
- Build roads with PURPOSE - every road should lead to a viable settlement location
- Identify and secure "bottleneck" positions that cut off opponents' expansion
- Expand toward resources you LACK from initial placement - seek balance
- When choosing between multiple settlement spots, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (total pip count)
  2. Access to resources you currently lack
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, securing future expansion)
  4. Proximity to useful ports
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Longest road (2 VP) requires strategic planning - only pursue if you already have 4+ roads built

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- When someone has 8+ points, ALWAYS target them with the robber regardless of other factors
- If you're being targeted by the robber, consider using knight cards immediately to protect production

TURN-BY-TURN PLANNING:
1. Start each turn by assessing your current VP and opponents' VPs (both visible and potential hidden points)
2. Identify your build priority for this turn: settlement, city, road, or development card?
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for your priority build
4. If you can't build your priority item, determine if trading or buying a development card is better
5. Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card or trade for needed resources
6. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

WINNING PATHS:
1. CITY-FOCUSED PATH: 3-4 cities (6-8 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 9-11 VP
2. BALANCED PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 VP card = 10 VP
3. DEVELOPMENT PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP

NEVER SAY NO TO FREE VPs:
- Always account for the 2 VP from longest road and largest army in your plans
- These special cards are EASY to lose if you're not defending them
- Invest in roads/knights to maintain your lead if these VPs are part of your strategy
- Be alert for opponents trying to steal these bonus points

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 36 | Player: BLUE | Action: MOVE_ROBBER

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Move the robber to Wheat(6) at (-1, 1, 0) and steal from RED
2. Roll dice to hopefully produce resources
3. Continue working toward upgrading settlements to cities
4. Build roads toward Sheep port (nodes 28-29) when Wood becomes available
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.

# Move Robber Strategic Analysis

I need to identify the optimal robber placement that disrupts my opponent's resource production while potentially gaining a useful resource for myself. Let me analyze this situation step by step:

## Current Game State Assessment:
- I have 2 VP vs RED's 3 VP, so RED is ahead
- RED has 3 settlements vs my 2, giving them more resource production
- RED has 4 hidden resource cards, which I could potentially steal
- I need to focus on upgrading my settlements to cities, which requires ore and wheat

## Analyzing High-Impact Robber Placements:

1. Move to (-1, 1, 0) [Option 4]: This is a Wheat hex with a value of 6 (high probability)
   - This blocks one of RED's settlements (node 18)
   - Wheat is a critical resource for city upgrades
   - RED has both a settlement at node 4 and node 18 that produce from this hex
   - This would block a highly productive wheat hex (6 - three pips)

2. Move to (0, -2, 2) [Option 8]: This is a Sheep hex with a value of 5
   - Not connected to any RED settlements
   - Doesn't help my strategy much

3. Move to (-2, 2, 0) [Option 12]: This is a Sheep hex with a value of 9
   - Connected to RED's settlement at node 18
   - Good probability (9 is a solid number with 4 pips)
   - Sheep is less critical for my city-building strategy

4. Move to (0, 0, 0) [Option 0]: This is a Sheep hex with a value of 2
   - Connected to RED's settlement at node 4
   - Very low probability (2 is the worst number with 1 pip)
   - Not worth blocking

## Best Option Analysis:
The Wheat hex at (-1, 1, 0) [Option 4] is clearly the best choice because:
1. It has a high production value (6 is one of the best numbers)
2. It blocks RED from getting Wheat, which they need for settlements/cities/development cards
3. It impacts TWO of RED's settlements (nodes 4 and 18)
4. Wheat is critical for my own city-building strategy
5. I can steal a card from RED, which might give me a resource I need

<plan>
1. Move robber to Wheat(6) hex at (-1, 1, 0) and steal from RED
2. Focus on getting ore resources to upgrade settlements to cities
3. Use the wheat I have (and potentially steal) to help with city upgrades
4. Build roads toward Sheep port (nodes 28-29) when Wood becomes available
5. Consider buying development cards if I obtain sheep

# Game Analysis and Robber Strategy

Let me analyze the current game state and determine the optimal move for placing the robber.

## Current Game Status
- I (BLUE) have 2 VP with 2 settlements
- RED has 3 VP with 3 settlements
- RED is currently ahead with more settlements and resources (7 cards)
- My resources: 2 wheat only
- I've played 1 knight card

## Robber Placement Considerations

I need to strategically place the robber to:
1. Block an important resource that RED benefits from
2. Steal a potentially valuable resource from RED
3. Minimize impact on my own production

Looking at RED's settlements:
- Node 18: Produces 🌾6[⭐⭐⭐], 🐑9[⭐⭐], ⛏️4[⭐]
- Node 13: Produces 🧱10[⭐], 🌲11[⭐], 🧱10[⭐]
- Node 4: Produces 🐑2, 🧱10[⭐], 🌾6[⭐⭐⭐]

The most valuable hex for RED is the Wheat(6) at (-1,1,0) which is high probability (⭐⭐⭐) and is connected to one of RED's settlements. This is particularly important since RED has 7 cards, suggesting they may be stockpiling resources for a significant build.

## Potential Actions Analysis

Option [4] - Move robber to (-1, 1, 0) and steal from RED:
- Blocks a high-value wheat hex (6 is a high probability)
- RED has a settlement at node 4 that produces from this wheat hex
- RED likely has wheat resources to steal since this is a high probability hex
- This wheat would help me build a city when I get ore

Option [13] - Move robber to (-2, 2, 0) and steal from RED:
- Blocks a sheep(9) hex with good probability (⭐⭐)
- RED has a settlement at node 18 that produces from this hex

Option [3] - Move robber to (-1, 0, 1) and steal from RED:
- Blocks a brick(10) hex with low probability (⭐)
- RED has settlements at nodes 13 and 4 that produce from this hex

Looking at my current plan, I need to focus on getting ore and wheat for city upgrades. Blocking RED's wheat production aligns with this plan and might allow me to steal wheat which I need.

<plan>
1. Move robber to Wheat(6) hex at (-1, 1, 0) and steal from RED
2. Continue focusing on acquiring ore resources to upgrade settlements to cities
3. Use the wheat I have (and potentially steal) to help with city upgrades
4. Build roads toward Sheep port (nodes 28-29) when Wood becomes available
5. Consider buying development cards if I obtain sheep
</plan>

Based on this analysis, the optimal move is to place the robber on the Wheat(6) hex at (-1,1,0) and steal from RED.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Target hexes with HIGH probability numbers (6,8,5,9) - prioritize these above all else
- Go for resource DIVERSITY: secure ALL five resources between your two settlements
- Focus on ORE and WHEAT for city upgrades (numbers 5-9 preferred)
- Evaluate each potential settlement by its TOTAL PIP COUNT (sum of probability dots)
- Place your initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Avoid placing both settlements near the same resources - diversify your income!
- Always consider 3:1 ports if your initial placement gives you limited access to certain resources
- Place roads in directions that block opponents' expansion routes

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT & CITY BUILDING PRIORITY:
- FIRST PRIORITY: Build 1-2 additional settlements early to secure critical resources you lack
- SECOND PRIORITY: Upgrade to cities as quickly as possible to double resource production
- THIRD PRIORITY: Build roads only when they lead directly to valuable settlement locations
- Early game (1-5 turns): Secure key settlements at high-value locations
- Mid-game (6-15 turns): Focus heavily on upgrading to cities (2-3 cities should be your target)
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road
- When short on a key resource, use 2:1 ports if available before using 3:1 or 4:1 ports
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat to other players unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- If you have excess of a resource, use ports rather than trading with opponents

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards primarily when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber OR to reach Largest Army (3+ knights)
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city or settlement build
- Use Monopoly cards after high-probability dice rolls to collect maximum resources
- Keep track of how many VP cards you've drawn (5 in the deck total)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn
- When development cards are your path to victory, aim for: 3 cities (6 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 victory cards (2 VP)
- Consider buying development cards when you have limited build options (blocked roads, etc.)

OPTIMAL EXPANSION PATH:
- Build roads with PURPOSE - every road should lead to a viable settlement location
- Identify and secure "bottleneck" positions that cut off opponents' expansion
- Expand toward resources you LACK from initial placement - seek balance
- When choosing between multiple settlement spots, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (total pip count)
  2. Access to resources you currently lack
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, securing future expansion)
  4. Proximity to useful ports
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Longest road (2 VP) requires strategic planning - only pursue if you already have 4+ roads built

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- When someone has 8+ points, ALWAYS target them with the robber regardless of other factors
- If you're being targeted by the robber, consider using knight cards immediately to protect production

TURN-BY-TURN PLANNING:
1. Start each turn by assessing your current VP and opponents' VPs (both visible and potential hidden points)
2. Identify your build priority for this turn: settlement, city, road, or development card?
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for your priority build
4. If you can't build your priority item, determine if trading or buying a development card is better
5. Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card or trade for needed resources
6. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

WINNING PATHS:
1. CITY-FOCUSED PATH: 3-4 cities (6-8 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 9-11 VP
2. BALANCED PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 VP card = 10 VP
3. DEVELOPMENT PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP

NEVER SAY NO TO FREE VPs:
- Always account for the 2 VP from longest road and largest army in your plans
- These special cards are EASY to lose if you're not defending them
- Invest in roads/knights to maintain your lead if these VPs are part of your strategy
- Be alert for opponents trying to steal these bonus points

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 56 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Move robber to Wheat(6) hex at (-1, 1, 0) and steal from RED
2. Continue focusing on acquiring ore resources to upgrade settlements to cities

# Game Analysis for Turn 56

Let me analyze the current game state and evaluate my options carefully to make the best decision.

## Victory Point Status
- BLUE (me): 2 VP (2 settlements)
- RED: 3 VP (3 settlements)
- RED is slightly ahead in points, and has more settlements and roads built

## Resource Analysis
- My resources: 2 Wood, 4 Wheat, 3 Ore
- RED has 9 hidden cards

## Available Actions
I can:
1. Upgrade settlement at node 19 (2 Wheat, 3 Ore)
2. Upgrade settlement at node 27 (2 Wheat, 3 Ore)
3-6. Various maritime trades (4:1 ratio)

## Settlement Production Analysis
- Node 19: Produces Ore(8★★★), Wood(9★★), Ore(5★★) - high probability and resource-rich
- Node 27: Produces only Wheat(8★★★) - high probability but single resource

## Strategic Evaluation

1. **City Upgrade Options**: I have exactly enough resources to upgrade one settlement to a city (2 Wheat + 3 Ore). This would give me +1 VP.

2. **Which settlement to upgrade?** 
   - Node 19 produces two Ore hexes (8 and 5) plus Wood (9) - all with good probabilities
   - Node 27 only produces Wheat (8) with high probability
   - Upgrading node 19 would double my production of Ore and Wood, which are critical resources

3. **Future Planning**:
   - Upgrading the settlement at node 19 increases my chances of getting more Ore and Wood
   - Ore is crucial for future city upgrades and development cards
   - Wood will help with road building towards the sheep port

4. **Maritime Trades**: Not necessary since I have the exact resources I need for a city upgrade

<plan>
1. Upgrade the settlement at node 19 to a city, increasing my VP to 3 and doubling my ore production
2. Focus on road building toward the sheep port (nodes 28-29) when more wood becomes available
3. Continue accumulating resources for another city upgrade at node 27 in the future
4. Consider buying development cards once I secure better access to sheep
</plan>

The optimal choice is to upgrade the settlement at node 19 to a city. This will:
- Increase my VPs to 3, tying with RED
- Double my production of Ore (from both the 8 and 5 hexes) and Wood (9 hex)
- Strengthen my position for future city upgrades and development cards
- Follow my existing strategic plan

# Analyzing the Game State

Let me analyze the current game state and available options:

## Current Status
- I have 3 VP (1 settlement, 1 city)
- Resources: 1 wood, 4 wheat, 6 ore
- The robber is on a wood tile (0, 2, -2) with number 9
- Red also has 3 VP (3 settlements)
- I have buildings at nodes 19 (city) and 27 (settlement)

## Options Analysis

**Option 1: Upgrade settlement at node 27 to a city**
- Cost: 2 wheat, 3 ore
- Benefits:
  - Increases VP to 4
  - Doubles wheat production on the 8 (high-value) hex
  - I have enough resources (4 wheat, 6 ore)
  - Creates a stronger position for the mid-game

**Options 2-9: Various maritime trades**
- None of these trades help me immediately build anything significant
- Trading resources now would leave me with fewer options next turn

## Strategic Considerations
- Upgrading to a city aligns with my mid-game strategy of focusing on city upgrades
- Node 27 has a high-value wheat hex (8) that would produce double with a city
- Red has 9 hidden cards, which is concerning, but they have no cities yet
- I need to accelerate my VP gain to keep pace

<plan>
1. Upgrade settlement at node 27 to a city, increasing my VP to 4 and doubling my wheat production
2. Continue collecting resources for road building toward the sheep port (nodes 28-29)
3. Save future wheat and ore production for development cards or another settlement
4. Prioritize getting more wood and brick to expand with roads and settlements
</plan>

The optimal play is clear: upgrade my settlement to a city to increase my VP count and double my wheat production on a highly productive hex.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Target hexes with HIGH probability numbers (6,8,5,9) - prioritize these above all else
- Go for resource DIVERSITY: secure ALL five resources between your two settlements
- Focus on ORE and WHEAT for city upgrades (numbers 5-9 preferred)
- Evaluate each potential settlement by its TOTAL PIP COUNT (sum of probability dots)
- Place your initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Avoid placing both settlements near the same resources - diversify your income!
- Always consider 3:1 ports if your initial placement gives you limited access to certain resources
- Place roads in directions that block opponents' expansion routes

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT & CITY BUILDING PRIORITY:
- FIRST PRIORITY: Build 1-2 additional settlements early to secure critical resources you lack
- SECOND PRIORITY: Upgrade to cities as quickly as possible to double resource production
- THIRD PRIORITY: Build roads only when they lead directly to valuable settlement locations
- Early game (1-5 turns): Secure key settlements at high-value locations
- Mid-game (6-15 turns): Focus heavily on upgrading to cities (2-3 cities should be your target)
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road
- When short on a key resource, use 2:1 ports if available before using 3:1 or 4:1 ports
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat to other players unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- If you have excess of a resource, use ports rather than trading with opponents

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards primarily when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber OR to reach Largest Army (3+ knights)
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city or settlement build
- Use Monopoly cards after high-probability dice rolls to collect maximum resources
- Keep track of how many VP cards you've drawn (5 in the deck total)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn
- When development cards are your path to victory, aim for: 3 cities (6 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 victory cards (2 VP)
- Consider buying development cards when you have limited build options (blocked roads, etc.)

OPTIMAL EXPANSION PATH:
- Build roads with PURPOSE - every road should lead to a viable settlement location
- Identify and secure "bottleneck" positions that cut off opponents' expansion
- Expand toward resources you LACK from initial placement - seek balance
- When choosing between multiple settlement spots, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (total pip count)
  2. Access to resources you currently lack
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, securing future expansion)
  4. Proximity to useful ports
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Longest road (2 VP) requires strategic planning - only pursue if you already have 4+ roads built

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- When someone has 8+ points, ALWAYS target them with the robber regardless of other factors
- If you're being targeted by the robber, consider using knight cards immediately to protect production

TURN-BY-TURN PLANNING:
1. Start each turn by assessing your current VP and opponents' VPs (both visible and potential hidden points)
2. Identify your build priority for this turn: settlement, city, road, or development card?
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for your priority build
4. If you can't build your priority item, determine if trading or buying a development card is better
5. Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card or trade for needed resources
6. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

WINNING PATHS:
1. CITY-FOCUSED PATH: 3-4 cities (6-8 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 9-11 VP
2. BALANCED PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 VP card = 10 VP
3. DEVELOPMENT PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP

NEVER SAY NO TO FREE VPs:
- Always account for the 2 VP from longest road and largest army in your plans
- These special cards are EASY to lose if you're not defending them
- Invest in roads/knights to maintain your lead if these VPs are part of your strategy
- Be alert for opponents trying to steal these bonus points

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 72 | Player: BLUE | Action: MOVE_ROBBER

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Upgrade settlement at node 27 to a city, increasing my VP to 4 and doubling my wheat production
2. Continue collecting resources for road building toward the sheep port (nodes 28-29)
3. Save future wheat and ore production for development cards or another settlement
4. Prioritize getting more wood and brick to expand with roads and settlements

# Game Analysis for Robber Placement

I need to choose the optimal location for the robber based on the current game state, focusing on maximizing my chances of winning while disrupting RED's progress.

## Game State Assessment
- I have 4 VPs (from 2 cities)
- RED has 5 VPs (3 settlements + longest road bonus)
- RED has 5 hidden resources, which I need to disrupt
- I'm focusing on getting resources for road building to reach the sheep port

## Robber Placement Strategy
I should analyze which hex would most effectively:
1. Block RED's key resource production
2. Give me a chance to steal a valuable resource
3. Protect my own valuable resources from future robber placement

Looking at RED's settlements:
- Node 18: produces wheat(6), sheep(9), ore(4)
- Node 13: produces brick(10), wood(11), brick(10)
- Node 4: produces sheep(2), brick(10), wheat(6)

The most valuable hexes for RED are:
- Wheat(6) at (-1, 1, 0) - good production value
- Brick(10) at (-1, 0, 1) - RED has two settlements on brick
- Wheat(6) at (-1, 1, 0) - high probability number

I should also consider which resources RED might need most. Given they already have longest road (so have been building with brick/wood), they might be switching to city building (ore/wheat) or development cards (ore/wheat/sheep).

## Best Choices Analysis:
1. Option [4] - Move robber to (-1, 1, 0) and steal from RED
   - This blocks a wheat hex with a 6 (high probability)
   - Wheat is critical for cities and development cards
   - RED has settlements at nodes 4 and 18 that produce from this hex
   
2. Option [3] - Move robber to (-1, 0, 1) and steal from RED
   - This blocks a brick hex with a 10
   - RED has 2 settlements that collect brick here
   - But brick is less valuable in the mid-game

3. Option [0] - Move robber to (0, 0, 0) and steal from RED
   - This blocks a sheep hex with a 2 (very low probability)
   - Not efficient to block such a low-value hex

<plan>
1. Block RED's wheat production by placing the robber on the wheat(6) hex
2. Focus on building roads toward the sheep port (nodes 28-29)
3. Work toward another settlement to secure sheep production
4. Save resources for development cards when possible
</plan>

Considering all factors, I should place the robber on RED's wheat(6) hex, which is a high probability resource they need for development and city building. This will slow their progress significantly while I continue executing my plan.

3. DEVELOPMENT PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP

NEVER SAY NO TO FREE VPs:
- Always account for the 2 VP from longest road and largest army in your plans
- These special cards are EASY to lose if you're not defending them
- Invest in roads/knights to maintain your lead if these VPs are part of your strategy
- Be alert for opponents trying to steal these bonus points

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

❓ Select action by number (0-4):


Based on this information, which action number do you choose? Think step by step about your options, then put the final action number in a box like \boxed{1}.
RESPONSE:
I'll analyze the current game state thoroughly to determine the optimal action.

## Game State Analysis

**VP Situation:**
- I (BLUE) have 4 VP from 2 cities
- RED has 5 VP (3 settlements + Longest Road bonus)
- RED is leading by 1 VP

**My Resources:**
- 1 Wood, 1 Wheat, 4 Ore
- Very strong in ore, weak in other resources

**Building Opportunities:**
- I don't have enough resources to build anything immediately
- Can't build a settlement (need 1 wood, 1 brick, 1 wheat, 1 sheep)
- Can't build a road (need 1 wood, 1 brick)
- Can't upgrade to a city (need 3 ore and 2 wheat - I have 4 ore but only 1 wheat)
- Can't buy a development card (need 1 ore, 1 wheat, 1 sheep)

**Trade Opportunities:**
- Can trade 4 ore for another resource using 4:1 ratio
- Sheep port is a strategic target (nodes 28-29), but I need to build more roads to reach it

## Strategic Assessment

1. Current Plan Review:
   - Blocking RED's wheat with the robber - already done
   - Building roads toward sheep port - good plan, but need brick and more wood
   - Securing sheep production - critical need
   - Saving for development cards - need sheep first

2. Production Analysis:
   - I have strong ore production (8, 5)
   - Good wood production (9)
   - Some wheat production (8)
   - No sheep or brick production

3. Critical Needs:
   - Sheep and brick are my biggest bottlenecks
   - Need at least 1 more wheat to make a city

## Action Consideration

I have 4 actions available:
- [0] End turn
- [1-4] Trade 4 ore for various resources

Given my 4 ore, I could trade for a resource I'm missing. Let's evaluate each option:

1. **Trade for Sheep**:
   - Would help toward a development card (need wheat + sheep + ore)
   - Would help toward a settlement (need wood + brick + wheat + sheep)
   - I have no sheep production, making this a critical resource

2. **Trade for Wheat**:
   - Would give me 2 wheat total
   - Still need 1 more wheat for a city upgrade
   - I already have wheat production

3. **Trade for Wood**:
   - Would give me 2 wood total
   - Could help toward a road or settlement
   - I already have wood production

4. **Trade for Brick**:
   - Would give me 1 brick
   - Essential for roads and settlements
   - I have no brick production

Looking at my current plan to build roads toward the sheep port, brick is my most immediate need. However, I should consider whether trading at this 4:1 ratio is worth it, or if I should wait for better opportunities.

Given that I'm already behind RED by 1 VP and need to make progress, and that I have no brick production at all, making a trade now is justified.

<plan>
1. Trade 4 ore for 1 brick to enable road building
2. Next turn, build a road toward the sheep port (nodes 28-29)
3. Focus on securing sheep production through either settlements or development cards
4. Work toward cities when I have sufficient wheat
</plan>

I'll trade my ore for brick to enable road building toward the sheep port next turn.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Target hexes with HIGH probability numbers (6,8,5,9) - prioritize these above all else
- Go for resource DIVERSITY: secure ALL five resources between your two settlements
- Focus on ORE and WHEAT for city upgrades (numbers 5-9 preferred)
- Evaluate each potential settlement by its TOTAL PIP COUNT (sum of probability dots)
- Place your initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Avoid placing both settlements near the same resources - diversify your income!
- Always consider 3:1 ports if your initial placement gives you limited access to certain resources
- Place roads in directions that block opponents' expansion routes

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT & CITY BUILDING PRIORITY:
- FIRST PRIORITY: Build 1-2 additional settlements early to secure critical resources you lack
- SECOND PRIORITY: Upgrade to cities as quickly as possible to double resource production
- THIRD PRIORITY: Build roads only when they lead directly to valuable settlement locations
- Early game (1-5 turns): Secure key settlements at high-value locations
- Mid-game (6-15 turns): Focus heavily on upgrading to cities (2-3 cities should be your target)
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road
- When short on a key resource, use 2:1 ports if available before using 3:1 or 4:1 ports
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat to other players unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- If you have excess of a resource, use ports rather than trading with opponents

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards primarily when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber OR to reach Largest Army (3+ knights)
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city or settlement build
- Use Monopoly cards after high-probability dice rolls to collect maximum resources
- Keep track of how many VP cards you've drawn (5 in the deck total)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn
- When development cards are your path to victory, aim for: 3 cities (6 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 victory cards (2 VP)
- Consider buying development cards when you have limited build options (blocked roads, etc.)

OPTIMAL EXPANSION PATH:
- Build roads with PURPOSE - every road should lead to a viable settlement location
- Identify and secure "bottleneck" positions that cut off opponents' expansion
- Expand toward resources you LACK from initial placement - seek balance
- When choosing between multiple settlement spots, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (total pip count)
  2. Access to resources you currently lack
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, securing future expansion)
  4. Proximity to useful ports
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Longest road (2 VP) requires strategic planning - only pursue if you already have 4+ roads built

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- When someone has 8+ points, ALWAYS target them with the robber regardless of other factors
- If you're being targeted by the robber, consider using knight cards immediately to protect production

TURN-BY-TURN PLANNING:
1. Start each turn by assessing your current VP and opponents' VPs (both visible and potential hidden points)
2. Identify your build priority for this turn: settlement, city, road, or development card?
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for your priority build
4. If you can't build your priority item, determine if trading or buying a development card is better
5. Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card or trade for needed resources
6. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

WINNING PATHS:
1. CITY-FOCUSED PATH: 3-4 cities (6-8 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 9-11 VP
2. BALANCED PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 VP card = 10 VP
3. DEVELOPMENT PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP

NEVER SAY NO TO FREE VPs:
- Always account for the 2 VP from longest road and largest army in your plans
- These special cards are EASY to lose if you're not defending them
- Invest in roads/knights to maintain your lead if these VPs are part of your strategy
- Be alert for opponents trying to steal these bonus points

RESPONSE:
# Game Analysis

Let me assess the current game state and my strategic options:

## Current Status
- I have 4 VP (2 cities)
- Red has 5 VP (3 settlements + longest road)
- My resources: 1 Wood, 1 Brick, 1 Wheat
- I have 2 key city placements with good production potential
- Red is ahead by only 1 VP, but has longest road secured

## Resource Evaluation
I have exactly enough resources to build a road (1 wood + 1 brick), but nothing else. My previous plan was to build a road toward the sheep port (nodes 28-29), which is still a valid option.

## Road Options Analysis
Let me evaluate each road option:

1. Edge (0, 20): This extends toward the center of the board, which isn't ideal for expansion.
2. Edge (8, 27): This extends from my city, but doesn't target any clear settlement location.
3. Edge (19, 46): Extends from my ore-producing city toward potentially valuable settlement locations.
4. Edge (26, 27): Extends from my wheat-producing city, but doesn't lead to clear expansion.
5. Edge (28, 29): Extends toward the sheep port, following my current plan.
6. Edge (20, 22): Connects toward center areas, not a strategic priority.
7. Edge (19, 21): Extends from my ore city, but not toward a clear settlement goal.

## Strategic Priority
My biggest weakness now is sheep production - I have none. My plan to build toward the sheep port (edge 28-29) remains sound, as this would give me 2:1 trading for sheep when I accumulate other resources. This supports my city-focused path to victory.

Option 5 (edge 28-29) aligns best with my current plan and strategic needs. Building this road gets me one step closer to the sheep port, which will be critical for resource conversion once I accumulate more ore, wheat, and wood.

<plan>
1. Build road toward the sheep port (nodes 28-29)
2. Continue gathering resources to build another road to reach the sheep port
3. Focus on developing my economy through trade at the port
4. Work toward additional settlements or cities when resources allow
5. Consider development cards if I accumulate excess sheep/wheat/ore
</plan>

Therefore, the optimal action is:

- Buy development cards primarily when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber OR to reach Largest Army (3+ knights)
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city or settlement build
- Use Monopoly cards after high-probability dice rolls to collect maximum resources
- Keep track of how many VP cards you've drawn (5 in the deck total)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn
- When development cards are your path to victory, aim for: 3 cities (6 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 victory cards (2 VP)
- Consider buying development cards when you have limited build options (blocked roads, etc.)

OPTIMAL EXPANSION PATH:
- Build roads with PURPOSE - every road should lead to a viable settlement location
- Identify and secure "bottleneck" positions that cut off opponents' expansion
- Expand toward resources you LACK from initial placement - seek balance
- When choosing between multiple settlement spots, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (total pip count)
  2. Access to resources you currently lack
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, securing future expansion)
  4. Proximity to useful ports
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Longest road (2 VP) requires strategic planning - only pursue if you already have 4+ roads built

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- When someone has 8+ points, ALWAYS target them with the robber regardless of other factors
- If you're being targeted by the robber, consider using knight cards immediately to protect production

TURN-BY-TURN PLANNING:
1. Start each turn by assessing your current VP and opponents' VPs (both visible and potential hidden points)
2. Identify your build priority for this turn: settlement, city, road, or development card?
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for your priority build
4. If you can't build your priority item, determine if trading or buying a development card is better
5. Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card or trade for needed resources
6. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

WINNING PATHS:
1. CITY-FOCUSED PATH: 3-4 cities (6-8 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 9-11 VP
2. BALANCED PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 VP card = 10 VP
3. DEVELOPMENT PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP

NEVER SAY NO TO FREE VPs:
- Always account for the 2 VP from longest road and largest army in your plans
- These special cards are EASY to lose if you're not defending them
- Invest in roads/knights to maintain your lead if these VPs are part of your strategy
- Be alert for opponents trying to steal these bonus points

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game Analysis for Settlers of Catan

Let me analyze the current game state and determine the optimal action.

## Current Situation
- I have 4 Victory Points (2 cities = 4 VP)
- Opponent has 5 Victory Points (3 settlements + Longest Road = 5 VP)
- My resources: 4 Wood, 1 Wheat
- I need to reach 10 VP to win
- I've played 1 Knight card already

## Board Position
- I have strong ore production (8 and 5 numbers)
- I have strong wheat production (8)
- I have access to wood (9)
- I'm lacking sheep and brick resources 
- My roads are heading toward a sheep port (nodes 28-29)

## Strategic Assessment
My current plan involves continuing to build toward the sheep port, which makes sense given my lack of sheep resources. However, I need to evaluate whether I should continue with this plan or make adjustments.

With my current resources (4 Wood, 1 Wheat), my options are limited:
1. End my turn and collect more resources
2. Trade 4 Wood for something else (sheep, ore, wheat, or brick)

To determine what trade makes sense, I need to consider my immediate goals:
- Building a road requires 1 Wood + 1 Brick
- Building a settlement requires 1 Wood + 1 Brick + 1 Sheep + 1 Wheat
- Upgrading to a city requires 2 Wheat + 3 Ore
- Buying a development card requires 1 Sheep + 1 Wheat + 1 Ore

Given that I'm trying to build toward the sheep port, it would make sense to trade for brick to build another road. However, I already have plenty of wood, so saving it for future road building is also logical.

Looking at my production capacity:
- I have excellent ore production (8 and 5)
- I have excellent wheat production (8)
- But I lack sheep and brick

<plan>
1. End turn to collect more resources
2. Focus on development cards path rather than roads (use my ore/wheat strength)
3. Trade for sheep when possible to enable development card purchases
4. Aim for Largest Army (2 VP) + more cities + development card VPs
5. Only build roads if they lead to strategic settlements
</plan>

Since I can't make meaningful progress this turn with a trade (trading wood for a single resource doesn't enable any builds), and I have strong production that will likely give me better options next turn, I should end my turn.

PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Target hexes with HIGH probability numbers (6,8,5,9) - prioritize these above all else
- Go for resource DIVERSITY: secure ALL five resources between your two settlements
- Focus on ORE and WHEAT for city upgrades (numbers 5-9 preferred)
- Evaluate each potential settlement by its TOTAL PIP COUNT (sum of probability dots)
- Place your initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Avoid placing both settlements near the same resources - diversify your income!
- Always consider 3:1 ports if your initial placement gives you limited access to certain resources
- Place roads in directions that block opponents' expansion routes

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT & CITY BUILDING PRIORITY:
- FIRST PRIORITY: Build 1-2 additional settlements early to secure critical resources you lack
- SECOND PRIORITY: Upgrade to cities as quickly as possible to double resource production
- THIRD PRIORITY: Build roads only when they lead directly to valuable settlement locations
- Early game (1-5 turns): Secure key settlements at high-value locations
- Mid-game (6-15 turns): Focus heavily on upgrading to cities (2-3 cities should be your target)
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road
- When short on a key resource, use 2:1 ports if available before using 3:1 or 4:1 ports
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat to other players unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- If you have excess of a resource, use ports rather than trading with opponents

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards primarily when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber OR to reach Largest Army (3+ knights)
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city or settlement build
- Use Monopoly cards after high-probability dice rolls to collect maximum resources
- Keep track of how many VP cards you've drawn (5 in the deck total)

# Game Analysis for Settlers of Catan

Let me analyze the current game state thoroughly:

## Current Victory Point Situation
- BLUE (me): 4 VP (2 cities = 4 VP)
- RED: 5 VP (3 settlements = 3 VP, Longest Road = 2 VP)

## My Resources
- 5x 🌲WOOD
- 1x 🌾WHEAT
- No other resources

## Available Actions
I can either end my turn or trade 4 wood for another resource.

## Strategic Analysis

First, I need to evaluate what I can do with my current resources. With just 5 wood and 1 wheat, I cannot:
- Build a settlement (needs brick, wood, sheep, wheat)
- Build a city (needs 3 ore, 2 wheat)
- Build a road (needs wood and brick)
- Buy a development card (needs ore, wheat, sheep)

My current plan focuses on development cards and cities. Both paths require more resources than I currently have.

Let's look at my production capabilities:
- City at node 19: produces ore (8), wood (9), and ore (5) - strong ore production!
- City at node 27: produces wheat (8) - strong wheat production!

This suggests I should continue with my development card strategy since I have good ore and wheat production, but I'm currently short on sheep.

### Trading Options
1. Trade 4 wood for sheep: Would enable a development card purchase after I get ore and wheat
2. Trade 4 wood for ore: Would contribute to city building
3. Trade 4 wood for more wheat: Would contribute to city building or dev cards
4. Trade 4 wood for brick: Would allow road building if needed

Trading now at a 4:1 ratio is quite inefficient. Since I have strong ore and wheat production positions, I'm likely to get these resources on upcoming dice rolls. What I really need is sheep for development cards.

However, looking at my road positions, I notice I don't have a sheep port nearby, but I do have some roads near node 28-29, which is a sheep port. If I wait, I'll likely get natural ore and wheat production, and can then make more efficient trades.

## Decision

Given my current situation, trading now would be inefficient. I should end my turn and wait for more resources, especially since I have strong production positions. My cities will naturally generate ore and wheat, and then I can make more strategic decisions.

<plan>
1. End turn to collect resources from my strong production spots
2. Use my ore/wheat production to either buy development cards (if I get sheep) or build cities
3. Consider building roads toward the sheep port (nodes 28-29) for more efficient trades in the future
4. Continue focusing on development cards and cities rather than competing for longest road
5. Watch for opportunities to play knight cards to potentially get largest army

- Evaluate each potential settlement by its TOTAL PIP COUNT (sum of probability dots)
- Place your initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Avoid placing both settlements near the same resources - diversify your income!
- Always consider 3:1 ports if your initial placement gives you limited access to certain resources
- Place roads in directions that block opponents' expansion routes

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT & CITY BUILDING PRIORITY:
- FIRST PRIORITY: Build 1-2 additional settlements early to secure critical resources you lack
- SECOND PRIORITY: Upgrade to cities as quickly as possible to double resource production
- THIRD PRIORITY: Build roads only when they lead directly to valuable settlement locations
- Early game (1-5 turns): Secure key settlements at high-value locations
- Mid-game (6-15 turns): Focus heavily on upgrading to cities (2-3 cities should be your target)
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road
- When short on a key resource, use 2:1 ports if available before using 3:1 or 4:1 ports
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat to other players unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- If you have excess of a resource, use ports rather than trading with opponents

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards primarily when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber OR to reach Largest Army (3+ knights)
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city or settlement build
- Use Monopoly cards after high-probability dice rolls to collect maximum resources
- Keep track of how many VP cards you've drawn (5 in the deck total)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn
- When development cards are your path to victory, aim for: 3 cities (6 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 victory cards (2 VP)
- Consider buying development cards when you have limited build options (blocked roads, etc.)

OPTIMAL EXPANSION PATH:
- Build roads with PURPOSE - every road should lead to a viable settlement location
- Identify and secure "bottleneck" positions that cut off opponents' expansion
- Expand toward resources you LACK from initial placement - seek balance
- When choosing between multiple settlement spots, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (total pip count)
  2. Access to resources you currently lack
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, securing future expansion)
  4. Proximity to useful ports
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Longest road (2 VP) requires strategic planning - only pursue if you already have 4+ roads built

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- When someone has 8+ points, ALWAYS target them with the robber regardless of other factors
- If you're being targeted by the robber, consider using knight cards immediately to protect production

TURN-BY-TURN PLANNING:
1. Start each turn by assessing your current VP and opponents' VPs (both visible and potential hidden points)
2. Identify your build priority for this turn: settlement, city, road, or development card?
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for your priority build
4. If you can't build your priority item, determine if trading or buying a development card is better
5. Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card or trade for needed resources
6. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

WINNING PATHS:
1. CITY-FOCUSED PATH: 3-4 cities (6-8 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 9-11 VP
2. BALANCED PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 VP card = 10 VP
3. DEVELOPMENT PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP

NEVER SAY NO TO FREE VPs:
- Always account for the 2 VP from longest road and largest army in your plans
- These special cards are EASY to lose if you're not defending them
- Invest in roads/knights to maintain your lead if these VPs are part of your strategy
- Be alert for opponents trying to steal these bonus points

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 78 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. End turn to collect resources from my strong production spots
2. Use my ore/wheat production to either buy development cards (if I get sheep) or build cities
3. Consider building roads toward the sheep port (nodes 28-29) for more efficient trades in the future
4. Continue focusing on development cards and cities rather than competing for longest road
5. Watch for opportunities to play knight cards to potentially get largest army

# Game State Analysis

Let me carefully analyze my current position and options:

## Victory Points
- I have 4 VP (2 cities)
- Red has 5 VP (3 settlements + Longest Road)
- We're both relatively close in this race

## My Resources
- 5 Wood
- 3 Wheat
- No other resources

## Production Setup
- I have strong Ore production (8 and 5 dice numbers)
- I have decent Wood production (9)
- I have strong Wheat production (8)
- I lack Brick and Sheep production

## Available Actions
I can only:
1. Trade 4 Wood for 1 Sheep
2. Trade 4 Wood for 1 Ore
3. Trade 4 Wood for 1 Wheat
4. Trade 4 Wood for 1 Brick
0. End my turn

## Strategic Considerations

Looking at my position, I need:
- For a city: 3 ore + 2 wheat (have 0 ore, 3 wheat)
- For a settlement: 1 wood, 1 brick, 1 wheat, 1 sheep (have 5 wood, 0 brick, 3 wheat, 0 sheep)
- For a development card: 1 ore, 1 wheat, 1 sheep (have 0 ore, 3 wheat, 0 sheep)

With my current resources, I can't build anything immediately. My strong production in ore will likely provide me resources on upcoming turns, so I should end my turn to collect more resources rather than trading at the unfavorable 4:1 ratio.

Looking at the position of the robber on the ore hex (0,1,-1), it's blocking one of my ore production spots. This is unfortunate, but I still have another ore production spot.

<plan>
1. End turn to collect more resources from my production spots
2. With my strong ore and wheat production, focus on city upgrades or development cards
3. Consider building toward the sheep port (nodes 28-29) since I already have roads nearby
4. Avoid costly 4:1 trades when I can wait for better resource combinations
5. Watch for opportunities to play knight cards to move the robber off my ore hex
</plan>

Given my assessment, the optimal action is to end my turn and wait for more favorable resource collections:

PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}

# Game Analysis for Blue Player

Let me carefully assess the current game state and available options:

## Current Game Status
- I have 4 VP (2 cities = 4 VP)
- Red has 5 VP (3 settlements = 3 VP + Longest Road = 2 VP)
- I have 5 wood and 3 wheat in hand
- The robber is on the ore hex (0,1,-1), blocking my ore production on a strong 8 value
- I have no development cards

## Resource Assessment
- My strongest production: Ore (from 8 and 5 value hexes) and Wheat (from 8 value hex)
- Currently lacking: Brick and sheep
- I have wood but no immediate use for it

## Available Actions
0. End turn
1-4. Trade 4 wood for various resources (sheep, ore, wheat, brick)

## Strategic Considerations:

1) **Building Options**:
   - Settlement (1 brick, 1 wood, 1 wheat, 1 sheep) - Need brick and sheep
   - City (3 ore, 2 wheat) - Need ore
   - Road (1 wood, 1 brick) - Need brick
   - Development Card (1 ore, 1 wheat, 1 sheep) - Need ore and sheep

2) **Trade Analysis**:
   - Trading 4 wood for 1 of any resource is inefficient (4:1 ratio)
   - I'm near the sheep port (nodes 28-29) but don't have a settlement there yet
   - No better trades available now

3) **Game Position**:
   - Red is ahead with 5 VP vs my 4 VP
   - The robber is blocking my ore production, which is critical for cities and development cards
   - I need to collect more resources before making significant moves

## Decision Logic:
- I don't have the right combinations to build anything meaningful
- None of the trade options (4:1) are efficient enough to justify spending my wood
- My best move is to end my turn to:
  1. Hope for favorable dice rolls for my production
  2. Wait for the robber to move off my ore hex
  3. Collect more key resources before making trades

<plan>
1. End my turn to collect more resources, particularly waiting for the robber to move off my ore hex
2. Once I get ore production back, focus on city upgrades or development cards
3. Consider building toward the sheep port (nodes 28-29) since I already have roads nearby

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Target hexes with HIGH probability numbers (6,8,5,9) - prioritize these above all else
- Go for resource DIVERSITY: secure ALL five resources between your two settlements
- Focus on ORE and WHEAT for city upgrades (numbers 5-9 preferred)
- Evaluate each potential settlement by its TOTAL PIP COUNT (sum of probability dots)
- Place your initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Avoid placing both settlements near the same resources - diversify your income!
- Always consider 3:1 ports if your initial placement gives you limited access to certain resources
- Place roads in directions that block opponents' expansion routes

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT & CITY BUILDING PRIORITY:
- FIRST PRIORITY: Build 1-2 additional settlements early to secure critical resources you lack
- SECOND PRIORITY: Upgrade to cities as quickly as possible to double resource production
- THIRD PRIORITY: Build roads only when they lead directly to valuable settlement locations
- Early game (1-5 turns): Secure key settlements at high-value locations
- Mid-game (6-15 turns): Focus heavily on upgrading to cities (2-3 cities should be your target)
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road
- When short on a key resource, use 2:1 ports if available before using 3:1 or 4:1 ports
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat to other players unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- If you have excess of a resource, use ports rather than trading with opponents

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards primarily when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber OR to reach Largest Army (3+ knights)
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city or settlement build
- Use Monopoly cards after high-probability dice rolls to collect maximum resources
- Keep track of how many VP cards you've drawn (5 in the deck total)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn
- When development cards are your path to victory, aim for: 3 cities (6 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 victory cards (2 VP)
- Consider buying development cards when you have limited build options (blocked roads, etc.)

OPTIMAL EXPANSION PATH:
- Build roads with PURPOSE - every road should lead to a viable settlement location
- Identify and secure "bottleneck" positions that cut off opponents' expansion
- Expand toward resources you LACK from initial placement - seek balance
- When choosing between multiple settlement spots, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (total pip count)
  2. Access to resources you currently lack
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, securing future expansion)
  4. Proximity to useful ports
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Longest road (2 VP) requires strategic planning - only pursue if you already have 4+ roads built

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- When someone has 8+ points, ALWAYS target them with the robber regardless of other factors
- If you're being targeted by the robber, consider using knight cards immediately to protect production

TURN-BY-TURN PLANNING:
1. Start each turn by assessing your current VP and opponents' VPs (both visible and potential hidden points)
2. Identify your build priority for this turn: settlement, city, road, or development card?
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for your priority build
4. If you can't build your priority item, determine if trading or buying a development card is better
5. Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card or trade for needed resources
6. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

WINNING PATHS:
1. CITY-FOCUSED PATH: 3-4 cities (6-8 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 9-11 VP
2. BALANCED PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 VP card = 10 VP
3. DEVELOPMENT PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP

NEVER SAY NO TO FREE VPs:
- Always account for the 2 VP from longest road and largest army in your plans
- These special cards are EASY to lose if you're not defending them
- Invest in roads/knights to maintain your lead if these VPs are part of your strategy
- Be alert for opponents trying to steal these bonus points

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 82 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. End my turn to collect more resources, particularly waiting for the robber to move off my ore hex
2. Once I get ore production back, focus on city upgrades or development cards
3. Consider building toward the sheep port (nodes 28-29) since I already have roads nearby
4. Avoid costly 4:1 trades when I can wait for better resource combinations
5. Watch for opportunities to play knight cards to move the robber off my ore hex

# Game State Analysis

Let me carefully analyze the current game state and available actions:

## Current Status
- I have 4 VP from my 2 cities
- Red has 5 VP (3 settlements + 2 VP for longest road)
- I have 5 wood, 3 wheat, and 2 ore resources
- The robber is blocking my ore hex (0,1,-1) which produces on 8
- I have no development cards

## Resource Production Assessment
- My best production is from my cities: ore on 8 (currently blocked), wood on 9, ore on 5, wheat on 8
- The robber on my ore hex is significantly limiting my production potential
- I need brick to build additional roads, but I have none

## Available Actions
- End turn [0]
- Maritime trades for sheep, ore, wheat, or brick at unfavorable 4:1 ratios [1-4]

## Strategic Considerations

The maritime trades are extremely inefficient at 4:1. Even though I have 5 wood, trading 4 of them for just 1 of another resource is a poor value proposition, especially when I'm not in an emergency situation.

Looking at my current plan, I'm waiting for the robber to move off my ore hex. This is the correct approach since:
1. I don't have enough resources to build anything meaningful right now
2. The 4:1 trades would deplete my wood but not give me enough resources for any significant build
3. Once the robber moves off my ore hex, my resource production will improve substantially

<plan>
1. End my turn to collect resources on future rolls
2. Hope the robber moves from my ore hex soon to restore my ore production
3. Once I get more resources, prioritize:
   a) Build roads toward the sheep port (nodes 28-29) for more efficient trades
   b) Save for a city upgrade or development cards
4. Consider using maritime trades only when I have excess resources or need one specific resource to complete a critical build
5. Keep building toward strategic locations to secure more resources
</plan>

Given my options, the optimal action is to end my turn since none of the maritime trades offer good value, and I'm better off waiting for better resource rolls.

# Analyzing the Game State and Available Actions

Let me carefully analyze my current position and options:

## Current Game Status
- I have 4 victory points (2 cities)
- Opponent has 5 victory points (3 settlements + longest road)
- My resources: 7 wood, 3 wheat, 2 ore
- The robber is blocking my ore production on the 8 hex
- I have minimal road connectivity with only 3 roads built
- I'm close to a sheep port (nodes 28-29) with a road already at node 29

## Possible Actions
- [0] End my turn
- [1-4] Various maritime trades using my excess wood

## Analysis of Each Option

**Option 0: End Turn**
- Pros: I'll collect resources on future dice rolls
- Cons: I'm not using my current resources efficiently, and I have 7 cards which risks losing half if a 7 is rolled

**Maritime Trade Options**
- I have excess wood (7) which I could trade
- Converting some wood now would reduce my hand size below 7, protecting me from losing resources on a 7 roll
- The sheep port is nearby, but I don't have access to it yet

## Resource Evaluation
- I need brick for roads to expand toward the sheep port or new settlement locations
- I need more ore for city upgrades (currently have 2)
- I have decent wheat production (6 and 8 numbers)
- I have excessive wood without immediate use

## Strategic Direction
Looking at my position, I need to:
1. Continue expansion with roads and eventually a new settlement
2. Protect my resource cards from a potential 7 roll
3. Acquire brick which I'm completely lacking

<plan>
1. Trade wood for brick to continue road expansion toward sheep port
2. Build roads toward nodes 28-29 (sheep port) for more efficient trades
3. Place a settlement near a brick source when possible
4. Once the robber moves from my ore hex, save ore and wheat for city upgrades
5. Consider development cards if I get excess sheep/wheat/ore
</plan>

Given this analysis, I should trade some of my excess wood for brick to enable road expansion. This also reduces my hand size below 7 cards, protecting me from a potential 7 roll.

PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Target hexes with HIGH probability numbers (6,8,5,9) - prioritize these above all else
- Go for resource DIVERSITY: secure ALL five resources between your two settlements
- Focus on ORE and WHEAT for city upgrades (numbers 5-9 preferred)
- Evaluate each potential settlement by its TOTAL PIP COUNT (sum of probability dots)
- Place your initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Avoid placing both settlements near the same resources - diversify your income!
- Always consider 3:1 ports if your initial placement gives you limited access to certain resources
- Place roads in directions that block opponents' expansion routes

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT & CITY BUILDING PRIORITY:
- FIRST PRIORITY: Build 1-2 additional settlements early to secure critical resources you lack
- SECOND PRIORITY: Upgrade to cities as quickly as possible to double resource production
- THIRD PRIORITY: Build roads only when they lead directly to valuable settlement locations
- Early game (1-5 turns): Secure key settlements at high-value locations
- Mid-game (6-15 turns): Focus heavily on upgrading to cities (2-3 cities should be your target)
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road
- When short on a key resource, use 2:1 ports if available before using 3:1 or 4:1 ports
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat to other players unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- If you have excess of a resource, use ports rather than trading with opponents

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards primarily when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber OR to reach Largest Army (3+ knights)
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city or settlement build
- Use Monopoly cards after high-probability dice rolls to collect maximum resources
- Keep track of how many VP cards you've drawn (5 in the deck total)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn
- When development cards are your path to victory, aim for: 3 cities (6 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 victory cards (2 VP)
- Consider buying development cards when you have limited build options (blocked roads, etc.)

OPTIMAL EXPANSION PATH:
- Build roads with PURPOSE - every road should lead to a viable settlement location
- Identify and secure "bottleneck" positions that cut off opponents' expansion
- Expand toward resources you LACK from initial placement - seek balance
- When choosing between multiple settlement spots, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (total pip count)
  2. Access to resources you currently lack
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, securing future expansion)
  4. Proximity to useful ports
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Longest road (2 VP) requires strategic planning - only pursue if you already have 4+ roads built

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- When someone has 8+ points, ALWAYS target them with the robber regardless of other factors
- If you're being targeted by the robber, consider using knight cards immediately to protect production

TURN-BY-TURN PLANNING:
1. Start each turn by assessing your current VP and opponents' VPs (both visible and potential hidden points)
2. Identify your build priority for this turn: settlement, city, road, or development card?
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for your priority build
4. If you can't build your priority item, determine if trading or buying a development card is better
5. Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card or trade for needed resources
6. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

WINNING PATHS:
1. CITY-FOCUSED PATH: 3-4 cities (6-8 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 9-11 VP
2. BALANCED PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 VP card = 10 VP
3. DEVELOPMENT PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP

NEVER SAY NO TO FREE VPs:
- Always account for the 2 VP from longest road and largest army in your plans
- These special cards are EASY to lose if you're not defending them
- Invest in roads/knights to maintain your lead if these VPs are part of your strategy
- Be alert for opponents trying to steal these bonus points

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game State Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state and available options:

## Current Standing
- I (BLUE) have 4 VP: 2 cities (4 VP total)
- RED has 5 VP: 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP)
- I have 3 wood, 1 brick, 3 wheat, 2 ore
- The robber is on my ore hex (0,1,-1), blocking one of my main ore sources

## Resource Analysis
- I have strong ore production (8 & 5) from my city at node 19
- I have strong wheat production (8) from my city at node 27
- I'm lacking brick and sheep sources
- My current resources enable me to build 1 road (3 wood, 1 brick)

## Strategic Considerations
1. I need to continue my road network to reach good settlement locations
2. My current plan involves expanding toward the sheep port (nodes 28-29)
3. I don't have enough resources for a settlement (need sheep) or city (need more ore/wheat)
4. Road placement is critical as RED already has longest road with 8 segments

## Action Options Analysis
I can build a road in several directions:
- Option 5 (10, 29): Continues expansion toward the sheep port, aligning with my current plan
- Option 8 (29, 30): Also continues expansion toward sheep resources, but doesn't get me to the port
- Options 1-4, 6-7: Move in different directions away from my current expansion path

## Decision
The best move is to continue with my current plan and extend my road network toward the sheep port. Given my limited access to sheep, securing the sheep port will be valuable for efficient future trades. Option 5 (building road at edge 10-29) directly advances this strategy.

<plan>
1. Build road at edge (10, 29) to continue expansion toward sheep port
2. Next, aim to acquire sheep to build a settlement at node 30 or 31
3. Once the robber moves from my ore hex, save ore and wheat for city upgrades
4. Continue road expansion to secure more settlements and potentially contest longest road
5. Target development cards if I accumulate excess sheep/wheat/ore
</plan>

# Game State Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state and consider my available actions:

## My Current Position
- I have 4 VP (2 cities = 4 VP)
- I have 2 wood, 3 wheat, 4 ore resources
- RED has 5 VP (3 settlements + longest road bonus)

## Available Actions
0. End turn
1-4. Trade 4 ore for another resource (sheep, wheat, wood, or brick) at 4:1 ratio

## Resource Analysis
- I have plenty of ore (4)
- I have good wheat (3) 
- I have some wood (2)
- I'm missing sheep and brick entirely

## Current Plan Review
My plan involves building a road at edge (10, 29), but I notice this road already exists based on the information provided: "ROADS: - 🔵 BLUE: (19, 20), (20, 19), (27, 28), (28, 27), (28, 29), (29, 28), (10, 29), (29, 10)"

This means I've already built the road I was planning to build. I need to adjust my plan.

## Board Position
- I have a strong ore and wheat production (primarily from city at node 19)
- My cities produce ore (nodes 8/5), wood (9), and wheat (8) - good for development cards
- I can expand toward node 30 or 31 near the sheep port
- RED is ahead with longest road bonus (8 segments vs my 4)

## Strategic Options
1. Trade 4 ore for 1 sheep to work toward a settlement at node 30 or 31
2. Trade 4 ore for 1 brick to build a road toward node 30/31
3. End my turn and wait for better dice rolls

## Decision Process
To build a settlement, I need 1 wheat + 1 brick + 1 sheep + 1 wood. I have wheat and wood but missing sheep and brick.

For a road, I need 1 wood + 1 brick. I have 2 wood but no brick.

The robber is currently on my ore hex, but I still have 4 ore - that's enough for one 4:1 trade.

Since my current plan mentions acquiring sheep for a settlement at node 30/31, and I need both sheep and brick, I should get whichever is more immediately useful.

Looking at my resources, if I trade for 1 brick, I'd have 2 wood + 1 brick = enough for a road on my next turn.
If I trade for 1 sheep, I'd have 1 sheep + 2 wood + 3 wheat, but still need 1 brick for a settlement.

<plan>
1. Trade 4 ore for 1 brick to prepare for road building
2. Build a road toward settlement spots at node 30 or 31 on next turn
3. Focus on getting sheep next for settlement building
4. After establishing a new settlement, focus on city upgrades
5. Consider development cards if I accumulate excess resources
</plan>

Since the road I thought I needed to build is already built, I need to build the next road in the path. For this, brick is the most critical resource right now, so I'll trade for brick.

PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Target hexes with HIGH probability numbers (6,8,5,9) - prioritize these above all else
- Go for resource DIVERSITY: secure ALL five resources between your two settlements
- Focus on ORE and WHEAT for city upgrades (numbers 5-9 preferred)
- Evaluate each potential settlement by its TOTAL PIP COUNT (sum of probability dots)
- Place your initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Avoid placing both settlements near the same resources - diversify your income!
- Always consider 3:1 ports if your initial placement gives you limited access to certain resources
- Place roads in directions that block opponents' expansion routes

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT & CITY BUILDING PRIORITY:
- FIRST PRIORITY: Build 1-2 additional settlements early to secure critical resources you lack
- SECOND PRIORITY: Upgrade to cities as quickly as possible to double resource production
- THIRD PRIORITY: Build roads only when they lead directly to valuable settlement locations
- Early game (1-5 turns): Secure key settlements at high-value locations
- Mid-game (6-15 turns): Focus heavily on upgrading to cities (2-3 cities should be your target)
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road
- When short on a key resource, use 2:1 ports if available before using 3:1 or 4:1 ports
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat to other players unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- If you have excess of a resource, use ports rather than trading with opponents

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards primarily when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber OR to reach Largest Army (3+ knights)
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city or settlement build
- Use Monopoly cards after high-probability dice rolls to collect maximum resources
- Keep track of how many VP cards you've drawn (5 in the deck total)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn
- When development cards are your path to victory, aim for: 3 cities (6 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 victory cards (2 VP)
- Consider buying development cards when you have limited build options (blocked roads, etc.)

OPTIMAL EXPANSION PATH:
- Build roads with PURPOSE - every road should lead to a viable settlement location
- Identify and secure "bottleneck" positions that cut off opponents' expansion
- Expand toward resources you LACK from initial placement - seek balance
- When choosing between multiple settlement spots, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (total pip count)
  2. Access to resources you currently lack
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, securing future expansion)
  4. Proximity to useful ports
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Longest road (2 VP) requires strategic planning - only pursue if you already have 4+ roads built

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- When someone has 8+ points, ALWAYS target them with the robber regardless of other factors
- If you're being targeted by the robber, consider using knight cards immediately to protect production

TURN-BY-TURN PLANNING:
1. Start each turn by assessing your current VP and opponents' VPs (both visible and potential hidden points)
2. Identify your build priority for this turn: settlement, city, road, or development card?
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for your priority build
4. If you can't build your priority item, determine if trading or buying a development card is better
5. Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card or trade for needed resources
6. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

WINNING PATHS:
1. CITY-FOCUSED PATH: 3-4 cities (6-8 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 9-11 VP
2. BALANCED PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 VP card = 10 VP
3. DEVELOPMENT PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP

NEVER SAY NO TO FREE VPs:
- Always account for the 2 VP from longest road and largest army in your plans
- These special cards are EASY to lose if you're not defending them
- Invest in roads/knights to maintain your lead if these VPs are part of your strategy
- Be alert for opponents trying to steal these bonus points

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 86 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Trade 4 ore for 1 brick to prepare for road building
2. Build a road toward settlement spots at node 30 or 31 on next turn

# Game Analysis for Settlers of Catan

Let me analyze the current game state and my available options:

## Current Status
- I (BLUE) have 4 VP (2 cities = 4 VP)
- RED has 5 VP (3 settlements = 3 VP + Longest Road = 2 VP)
- I have 2 WOOD, 1 BRICK, 3 WHEAT
- I need 6 more VP to win

## My Resources & Production
- My cities produce: ORE (8, 5) and WHEAT (8)
- I'm strong on ORE and WHEAT production (good for city upgrades)
- I'm weak on SHEEP, BRICK, and limited on WOOD

## Available Actions
My only build option is to construct a road using my 2 WOOD and 1 BRICK.

## Road Options Analysis:
1. Edge (9, 10) - Leads north from my road network
2. Edge (0, 20) - Connects my city at 19 toward the center
3. Edge (10, 11) - Extends toward the WOOD port (nodes 32, 33)
4. Edge (8, 27) - Connects near my city at 27
5. Edge (19, 46) - Extends from my city at 19 toward south
6. Edge (26, 27) - Connects around my city at 27
7. Edge (20, 22) - Extends toward the 2:1 ORE port
8. Edge (19, 21) - Extends from my city
9. Edge (29, 30) - Extends toward the Sheep hex with 5 value

Considering expansion opportunities:
- Option 9 (29, 30) leads toward the valuable SHEEP-5 hex and could eventually lead to a new settlement at node 30 or 31
- This aligns with my current plan of building toward these settlement spots
- I'm lacking SHEEP production currently, which I'll need for settlements and development cards

<plan>
1. Build a road at edge (29, 30) to prepare for settlement at node 30 or 31 (SHEEP-5 hex)
2. Work toward getting more SHEEP and BRICK for the next settlement
3. After establishing a new settlement, focus on city upgrades
4. Consider development cards if I accumulate excess resources
5. Monitor RED's VP progress and consider strategies to break their longest road if needed
</plan>

Given my analysis, the best option is road edge (29, 30) to continue my expansion toward the SHEEP-5 hex, which addresses my resource needs.

# Game Analysis

First, I'll assess my current status and available options:

## Current Game State
- **My Victory Points**: 4/10 (2 cities = 4 VP)
- **RED's Victory Points**: 6/10 (1 city, 2 settlements, longest road = 6 VP)
- **My Resources**: 3 🌲WOOD, 5 🌾WHEAT
- **Building Options**: Very limited with current resources - need BRICK and ORE

## Strategic Assessment
RED has a 2 VP advantage and already has longest road. I have no immediate way to build anything with just wood and wheat. My plan mentioned building a road at edge (29,30), but I can't do that without brick.

The robber is currently on an ore hex (0,1,-1) which is blocking ore production from one of my cities at node 19. This is further limiting my ability to get ore for city upgrades.

## Available Actions
My only options this turn are:
1. Trade 4 WHEAT for 1 WOOD (not useful - already have wood)
2. Trade 4 WHEAT for 1 SHEEP (could help toward development cards)
3. Trade 4 WHEAT for 1 ORE (helps toward city upgrades or development cards)
4. Trade 4 WHEAT for 1 BRICK (helps toward road/settlement building)
5. End my turn (conserve resources)

## Decision Logic
I need to decide whether to trade or end my turn. The 4:1 trade is quite inefficient, but sometimes necessary.

Looking at my original plan:
- I wanted to build a road toward node 30/31, which requires BRICK
- Afterward, I need SHEEP and BRICK for settlement expansion
- I also wanted to focus on city upgrades (need ORE)

Given RED's lead (6 VP to my 4 VP), I need to make progress this turn if possible. My cities at nodes 19 and 27 are producing ore (when not blocked by robber) and wheat, which is good for city upgrades, but I need to secure more sheep and brick.

<plan>
1. Trade for BRICK to build a road toward the SHEEP-5 hex (nodes 30/31)
2. Continue attempting to secure brick and sheep for settlement expansion
3. Look for opportunities to build toward the BRICK port (nodes 48,49) to improve brick acquisition
4. If I get knights from development cards, move the robber off my ore production
5. Monitor RED's progress and look for opportunities to break their longest road if possible
</plan>

Since my goal is to build toward the SHEEP-5 hex, and I need BRICK for a road, I'll trade 4 WHEAT for 1 BRICK.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Target hexes with HIGH probability numbers (6,8,5,9) - prioritize these above all else
- Go for resource DIVERSITY: secure ALL five resources between your two settlements
- Focus on ORE and WHEAT for city upgrades (numbers 5-9 preferred)
- Evaluate each potential settlement by its TOTAL PIP COUNT (sum of probability dots)
- Place your initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Avoid placing both settlements near the same resources - diversify your income!
- Always consider 3:1 ports if your initial placement gives you limited access to certain resources
- Place roads in directions that block opponents' expansion routes

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT & CITY BUILDING PRIORITY:
- FIRST PRIORITY: Build 1-2 additional settlements early to secure critical resources you lack
- SECOND PRIORITY: Upgrade to cities as quickly as possible to double resource production
- THIRD PRIORITY: Build roads only when they lead directly to valuable settlement locations
- Early game (1-5 turns): Secure key settlements at high-value locations
- Mid-game (6-15 turns): Focus heavily on upgrading to cities (2-3 cities should be your target)
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road
- When short on a key resource, use 2:1 ports if available before using 3:1 or 4:1 ports
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat to other players unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- If you have excess of a resource, use ports rather than trading with opponents

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards primarily when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber OR to reach Largest Army (3+ knights)
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city or settlement build
- Use Monopoly cards after high-probability dice rolls to collect maximum resources
- Keep track of how many VP cards you've drawn (5 in the deck total)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn
- When development cards are your path to victory, aim for: 3 cities (6 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 victory cards (2 VP)
- Consider buying development cards when you have limited build options (blocked roads, etc.)

OPTIMAL EXPANSION PATH:
- Build roads with PURPOSE - every road should lead to a viable settlement location
- Identify and secure "bottleneck" positions that cut off opponents' expansion
- Expand toward resources you LACK from initial placement - seek balance
- When choosing between multiple settlement spots, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (total pip count)
  2. Access to resources you currently lack
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, securing future expansion)
  4. Proximity to useful ports
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Longest road (2 VP) requires strategic planning - only pursue if you already have 4+ roads built

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- When someone has 8+ points, ALWAYS target them with the robber regardless of other factors
- If you're being targeted by the robber, consider using knight cards immediately to protect production

TURN-BY-TURN PLANNING:
1. Start each turn by assessing your current VP and opponents' VPs (both visible and potential hidden points)
2. Identify your build priority for this turn: settlement, city, road, or development card?
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for your priority build
4. If you can't build your priority item, determine if trading or buying a development card is better
5. Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card or trade for needed resources
6. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

WINNING PATHS:
1. CITY-FOCUSED PATH: 3-4 cities (6-8 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 9-11 VP
2. BALANCED PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 VP card = 10 VP
3. DEVELOPMENT PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP

NEVER SAY NO TO FREE VPs:
- Always account for the 2 VP from longest road and largest army in your plans
- These special cards are EASY to lose if you're not defending them
- Invest in roads/knights to maintain your lead if these VPs are part of your strategy
- Be alert for opponents trying to steal these bonus points

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 90 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Trade for BRICK to build a road toward the SHEEP-5 hex (nodes 30/31)
2. Continue attempting to secure brick and sheep for settlement expansion
3. Look for opportunities to build toward the BRICK port (nodes 48,49) to improve brick acquisition
4. If I get knights from development cards, move the robber off my ore production
5. Monitor RED's progress and look for opportunities to break their longest road if possible

# Game Analysis for Settlers of Catan - Turn 90

Let me analyze my current position and the available actions carefully.

## Current Game State Assessment:
- I have 4 VP (2 cities = 4 VP)
- Red has 6 VP (1 city = 2 VP, 2 settlements = 2 VP, longest road = 2 VP)
- I have 3 wood, 1 brick, 1 wheat
- The robber is on an ore hex (0,1,-1) that produces for one of my cities
- I have built 5 roads with a longest segment of 3, while Red has 13 roads with an 8-segment longest road

## Resources Analysis:
- I control good ore production when the robber isn't on my hex
- I have a city on wheat-8, giving me excellent wheat production
- I'm lacking in brick and sheep production
- I have just enough resources to build 1 road (1 wood + 1 brick)

## Strategic Options:

1. **Road Building Options**: I can build one road with my current resources. The key questions are:
   - Which road would lead toward a valuable settlement location?
   - Which road might help me challenge Red's longest road?
   - Which road connects to resources I'm lacking?

2. **Looking at the Available Road Options**:
   - Edge (9, 10): Not clear where this leads without the full map visualization
   - Edge (30, 31): This heads toward the sheep-5 hex, which was mentioned in my current plan
   - Edge (19, 46): This appears to be near my city at node 19 and could lead toward the brick port
   - Edge (20, 22): This could be expanding toward valuable territory

3. **Alignment with Current Plan**:
   My current plan mentions:
   - Trading for brick to build toward sheep-5 hex (nodes 30/31)
   - Looking to secure the brick port (nodes 48,49)

Since I already have the brick needed for a road, I should focus on executing the plan.

## Decision Process:

Option 8 (road at edge 30,31) aligns with my stated plan to build toward the Sheep-5 hex. This would help me access sheep, which I currently lack.

Option 5 (road at edge 19,46) might help me move toward the brick port, which is also mentioned in my plan.

Without a clearer visualization of the full map connectivity, I'll prioritize the option that explicitly matches my stated plan. Building toward sheep-5 appears to be the most strategic move based on the information provided, as it would help diversify my resource production.

<plan>
1. Build a road toward the SHEEP-5 hex (nodes 30/31) to eventually place a settlement and secure sheep production
2. Continue acquiring brick and wood for further road expansion
3. Look for opportunities to build toward the BRICK port (nodes 48,49) to improve brick acquisition
4. If I get knights from development cards, move the robber off my ore production
5. Monitor RED's progress and look for opportunities to break their longest road if possible
</plan>

Based on this analysis, I'll build a road at edge (30, 31) to continue my expansion toward the sheep resource.

- If you have excess of a resource, use ports rather than trading with opponents

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards primarily when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber OR to reach Largest Army (3+ knights)
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city or settlement build

# Game State Analysis

Let's analyze my current situation:

**Victory Point Status:**
- I have 4 VP (2 cities = 4 VP)
- RED has 7 VP (2 cities = 4 VP, 1 settlement = 1 VP, Longest Road = 2 VP)
- RED is 3 points ahead and getting close to winning

**Resources:**
- I have 2 WOOD, 3 WHEAT, 4 ORE
- I'm lacking BRICK and SHEEP

**Current Board Position:**
- I have cities producing ore, wood, and wheat
- The robber is on the ORE-8 hex, blocking one of my primary production hexes
- I don't have access to brick or sheep production
- My previous plan was to build toward the SHEEP-5 hex

## Strategic Assessment

RED is at 7 VP and likely close to winning. I need to accelerate my progress. Options:
1. Build roads - But I lack brick
2. Build settlements - Need brick and wood
3. Build cities - Need ore and wheat (which I have)
4. Buy development cards - Need ore, wheat, sheep (I have ore and wheat, but no sheep)

Given my resources (2 WOOD, 3 WHEAT, 4 ORE), I'm close to buying a development card (need 1 sheep), which would be valuable both for potential victory points and knights to move the robber.

## Action Evaluation

Looking at available actions:
- [0] End turn - Not optimal as I have resources to use
- [1] Trade 4 ORE for 1 SHEEP - Would allow me to buy a development card
- [2-4] Trade for other resources - Less valuable now

Trading 4 ORE for 1 SHEEP makes the most sense. This would allow me to buy a development card, which could be:
- A victory point card (immediately helpful)
- A knight (to move robber off my ORE-8 production)
- Year of Plenty or Monopoly (to accelerate my resource acquisition)

<plan>
1. Trade 4 ORE for 1 SHEEP via port
2. Buy a development card with 1 ORE, 1 WHEAT, 1 SHEEP
3. If I get a knight, use it to move the robber off my ORE-8 production
4. Continue working toward building settlements near SHEEP-5 or the BRICK port
5. Monitor RED's progress and prepare to disrupt their Longest Road if possible
</plan>

Given my current resource situation and the need to catch up to RED, trading 4 ORE for 1 SHEEP is my best move.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Target hexes with HIGH probability numbers (6,8,5,9) - prioritize these above all else
- Go for resource DIVERSITY: secure ALL five resources between your two settlements
- Focus on ORE and WHEAT for city upgrades (numbers 5-9 preferred)
- Evaluate each potential settlement by its TOTAL PIP COUNT (sum of probability dots)
- Place your initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Avoid placing both settlements near the same resources - diversify your income!
- Always consider 3:1 ports if your initial placement gives you limited access to certain resources
- Place roads in directions that block opponents' expansion routes

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT & CITY BUILDING PRIORITY:
- FIRST PRIORITY: Build 1-2 additional settlements early to secure critical resources you lack
- SECOND PRIORITY: Upgrade to cities as quickly as possible to double resource production
- THIRD PRIORITY: Build roads only when they lead directly to valuable settlement locations
- Early game (1-5 turns): Secure key settlements at high-value locations
- Mid-game (6-15 turns): Focus heavily on upgrading to cities (2-3 cities should be your target)
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road
- When short on a key resource, use 2:1 ports if available before using 3:1 or 4:1 ports
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat to other players unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- If you have excess of a resource, use ports rather than trading with opponents

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards primarily when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber OR to reach Largest Army (3+ knights)
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city or settlement build
- Use Monopoly cards after high-probability dice rolls to collect maximum resources
- Keep track of how many VP cards you've drawn (5 in the deck total)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn
- When development cards are your path to victory, aim for: 3 cities (6 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 victory cards (2 VP)
- Consider buying development cards when you have limited build options (blocked roads, etc.)

OPTIMAL EXPANSION PATH:
- Build roads with PURPOSE - every road should lead to a viable settlement location
- Identify and secure "bottleneck" positions that cut off opponents' expansion
- Expand toward resources you LACK from initial placement - seek balance
- When choosing between multiple settlement spots, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (total pip count)
  2. Access to resources you currently lack
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, securing future expansion)
  4. Proximity to useful ports
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Longest road (2 VP) requires strategic planning - only pursue if you already have 4+ roads built

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- When someone has 8+ points, ALWAYS target them with the robber regardless of other factors
- If you're being targeted by the robber, consider using knight cards immediately to protect production

TURN-BY-TURN PLANNING:
1. Start each turn by assessing your current VP and opponents' VPs (both visible and potential hidden points)
2. Identify your build priority for this turn: settlement, city, road, or development card?
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for your priority build
4. If you can't build your priority item, determine if trading or buying a development card is better
5. Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card or trade for needed resources
6. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

WINNING PATHS:
1. CITY-FOCUSED PATH: 3-4 cities (6-8 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 9-11 VP
2. BALANCED PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 VP card = 10 VP
3. DEVELOPMENT PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP

NEVER SAY NO TO FREE VPs:
- Always account for the 2 VP from longest road and largest army in your plans
- These special cards are EASY to lose if you're not defending them
- Invest in roads/knights to maintain your lead if these VPs are part of your strategy
- Be alert for opponents trying to steal these bonus points

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 102 | Player: BLUE | Action: MOVE_ROBBER

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Trade 4 ORE for 1 SHEEP via port
2. Buy a development card with 1 ORE, 1 WHEAT, 1 SHEEP
3. If I get a knight, use it to move the robber off my ORE-8 production
4. Continue working toward building settlements near SHEEP-5 or the BRICK port

# Game State Analysis

I need to move the robber strategically to maximize my chances of winning. Let's analyze the situation:

## Victory Points
- BLUE (me): 4/10 VP (from 2 cities)
- RED: 7/10 VP (2 cities + 1 settlement + longest road bonus)

RED is significantly ahead and just 3 points away from winning. This makes RED my primary concern.

## Key Resources for My Next Moves
Based on my plan, I need:
- ORE (for development card)
- WHEAT (for development card)
- SHEEP (for development card)

I currently have 1 SHEEP, 2 WHEAT but need more ORE.

## Robber Placement Strategy
Since RED is at 7 points and I need to slow them down, I should:
1. Target a high-value hex that RED is producing from
2. Choose a hex where I can steal a card from RED

Let's examine RED's production:
- City at node 18: 🌾6[⭐⭐⭐], 🐑9[⭐⭐], ⛏️4[⭐]
- Settlement at node 13: 🧱10[⭐], 🌲11[⭐], 🧱10[⭐]
- City at node 4: 🐑2, 🧱10[⭐], 🌾6[⭐⭐⭐]

The WHEAT-6 hex at (-1, 1, 0) is particularly valuable to RED as it produces from two cities (high probability and double production). Blocking this would significantly hamper RED's progress.

## Decision
Placing the robber on the WHEAT-6 hex will:
1. Block RED's most valuable production
2. Allow me to steal a card from RED
3. Not affect my own production

<plan>
1. Move robber to RED's WHEAT-6 hex to block their strongest production
2. Continue working toward development cards to get knights and potentially VP cards
3. Try to extend my road network to challenge RED for longest road
4. Look for opportunities to build new settlements near SHEEP-5 or the BRICK port
</plan>

Based on the available actions, option [4] targets the WHEAT-6 hex at (-1, 1, 0) and allows me to steal from RED.

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 102 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Move robber to RED's WHEAT-6 hex to block their strongest production
2. Continue working toward development cards to get knights and potentially VP cards
3. Try to extend my road network to challenge RED for longest road
4. Look for opportunities to build new settlements near SHEEP-5 or the BRICK port
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.

# Game Analysis for Turn 102

Let me carefully analyze the current game state and determine the optimal action.

## Victory Point Analysis
- BLUE (me): 4 VP (2 cities)
- RED: 7 VP (1 settlement + 2 cities + 2 VP for longest road)
- RED is 3 VP ahead and close to winning

## Resource Analysis
I currently have:
- 1 Wood
- 1 Brick
- 1 Sheep
- 2 Wheat

## Available Actions
Looking at my options:
1. Build a road (options 1-9) - costs 1 Wood, 1 Brick
2. Build a settlement (options 10-13) - costs 1 Wood, 1 Brick, 1 Wheat, 1 Sheep

I have exactly the resources needed for either option.

## Strategic Considerations
1. I'm 3 VP behind RED, who has 7 VP with the longest road bonus
2. Building a settlement would increase my VP to 5 (reducing the gap to 2 VP)
3. RED already has longest road with 9 segments vs. my longest of 4 segments
4. I need to accelerate my VP gain to have a chance at winning

## Settlement Location Analysis
Looking at the potential settlement locations:
- Node 10: Connected to Sheep-5, Wood-3, Wood-11 (mixed low probability)
- Node 29: Connected to Sheep-5, Desert, Wheat-8 (good Wheat resource)
- Node 30: Connected to Sheep-5 (only one resource)
- Node 31: Connected to Sheep-5, Wood-11 (only two resources, low probability)

Node 29 is clearly superior, as it connects to Wheat-8 (high probability) and Sheep-5.
Additionally, node 29 is adjacent to the 2:1 Sheep port (nodes 28, 29), giving me trading efficiency with Sheep.

<plan>
1. Build settlement at node 29 to gain VP and access to wheat-8 and sheep-5
2. Continue building my road network to potentially challenge RED for longest road
3. Look for opportunities to buy development cards when I get ore from my city
4. Target RED's wheat-6 with the robber when possible to slow them down
</plan>

Building a settlement is the clear priority since it gains VP directly. I need to catch up to RED quickly.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Target hexes with HIGH probability numbers (6,8,5,9) - prioritize these above all else
- Go for resource DIVERSITY: secure ALL five resources between your two settlements
- Focus on ORE and WHEAT for city upgrades (numbers 5-9 preferred)
- Evaluate each potential settlement by its TOTAL PIP COUNT (sum of probability dots)
- Place your initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Avoid placing both settlements near the same resources - diversify your income!
- Always consider 3:1 ports if your initial placement gives you limited access to certain resources
- Place roads in directions that block opponents' expansion routes

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT & CITY BUILDING PRIORITY:
- FIRST PRIORITY: Build 1-2 additional settlements early to secure critical resources you lack
- SECOND PRIORITY: Upgrade to cities as quickly as possible to double resource production
- THIRD PRIORITY: Build roads only when they lead directly to valuable settlement locations
- Early game (1-5 turns): Secure key settlements at high-value locations
- Mid-game (6-15 turns): Focus heavily on upgrading to cities (2-3 cities should be your target)
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road
- When short on a key resource, use 2:1 ports if available before using 3:1 or 4:1 ports
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat to other players unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- If you have excess of a resource, use ports rather than trading with opponents

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards primarily when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber OR to reach Largest Army (3+ knights)
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city or settlement build
- Use Monopoly cards after high-probability dice rolls to collect maximum resources
- Keep track of how many VP cards you've drawn (5 in the deck total)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn
- When development cards are your path to victory, aim for: 3 cities (6 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 victory cards (2 VP)
- Consider buying development cards when you have limited build options (blocked roads, etc.)

OPTIMAL EXPANSION PATH:
- Build roads with PURPOSE - every road should lead to a viable settlement location
- Identify and secure "bottleneck" positions that cut off opponents' expansion
- Expand toward resources you LACK from initial placement - seek balance
- When choosing between multiple settlement spots, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (total pip count)
  2. Access to resources you currently lack
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, securing future expansion)
  4. Proximity to useful ports
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Longest road (2 VP) requires strategic planning - only pursue if you already have 4+ roads built

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- When someone has 8+ points, ALWAYS target them with the robber regardless of other factors
- If you're being targeted by the robber, consider using knight cards immediately to protect production

TURN-BY-TURN PLANNING:
1. Start each turn by assessing your current VP and opponents' VPs (both visible and potential hidden points)
2. Identify your build priority for this turn: settlement, city, road, or development card?
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for your priority build
4. If you can't build your priority item, determine if trading or buying a development card is better
5. Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card or trade for needed resources
6. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

WINNING PATHS:
1. CITY-FOCUSED PATH: 3-4 cities (6-8 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 9-11 VP
2. BALANCED PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 VP card = 10 VP
3. DEVELOPMENT PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP

NEVER SAY NO TO FREE VPs:
- Always account for the 2 VP from longest road and largest army in your plans
- These special cards are EASY to lose if you're not defending them
- Invest in roads/knights to maintain your lead if these VPs are part of your strategy
- Be alert for opponents trying to steal these bonus points

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state and determine the best placement for the robber.

## Current Situation
- I'm BLUE with 5 VP: 1 settlement (1 VP), 2 cities (4 VP)
- RED has 8 VP: 2 settlements (2 VP), 2 cities (4 VP), longest road (2 VP)
- RED is just 2 points away from winning
- I need to make moves that slow RED down while advancing my own position

## Strategic Considerations for Robber Placement
1. Target RED's high-value production
2. Protect my own resources
3. Block resources that RED needs for their next build

## RED's Production
- RED has 🌾6[⭐⭐⭐] from two different buildings (a city and a settlement)
- RED has 🧱10[⭐] from multiple buildings - important for expanding road network
- RED has ⛏️5[⭐⭐] - useful for city building
- RED has 🐑9[⭐⭐] - useful for development cards

## My Resources
I only have 1 wheat, so I would benefit from getting more resources via robber placement.

## Best Robber Placement Options

The hex (2, 0, -2) is wheat-6 with three probability dots which RED's settlement at node 22 produces. This is an excellent target because:
1. It blocks RED's high-value wheat production
2. Wheat is crucial for settlements, cities, and development cards
3. It gives me a chance to steal a card from RED
4. RED already has 8 VP and is close to winning, so targeting them is crucial

Looking at action [16]: Move robber to (2, 0, -2) and steal from RED - this is the optimal choice.

<plan>
1. Block RED's access to wheat by placing the robber on (2, 0, -2) hex
2. Continue building roads to establish a settlement at a new location
3. Try to challenge RED for longest road if possible
4. Save resources for development cards when I get more ore from my city
5. Keep targeting RED's key resources to slow their progress to 10 VP
</plan>

- When short on a key resource, use 2:1 ports if available before using 3:1 or 4:1 ports
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat to other players unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- If you have excess of a resource, use ports rather than trading with opponents

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards primarily when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber OR to reach Largest Army (3+ knights)
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city or settlement build
- Use Monopoly cards after high-probability dice rolls to collect maximum resources
- Keep track of how many VP cards you've drawn (5 in the deck total)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn
- When development cards are your path to victory, aim for: 3 cities (6 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 victory cards (2 VP)
- Consider buying development cards when you have limited build options (blocked roads, etc.)

OPTIMAL EXPANSION PATH:
- Build roads with PURPOSE - every road should lead to a viable settlement location
- Identify and secure "bottleneck" positions that cut off opponents' expansion
- Expand toward resources you LACK from initial placement - seek balance
- When choosing between multiple settlement spots, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (total pip count)
  2. Access to resources you currently lack
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, securing future expansion)
  4. Proximity to useful ports
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Longest road (2 VP) requires strategic planning - only pursue if you already have 4+ roads built

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- When someone has 8+ points, ALWAYS target them with the robber regardless of other factors
- If you're being targeted by the robber, consider using knight cards immediately to protect production

TURN-BY-TURN PLANNING:
1. Start each turn by assessing your current VP and opponents' VPs (both visible and potential hidden points)
2. Identify your build priority for this turn: settlement, city, road, or development card?
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for your priority build
4. If you can't build your priority item, determine if trading or buying a development card is better
5. Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card or trade for needed resources
6. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

WINNING PATHS:
1. CITY-FOCUSED PATH: 3-4 cities (6-8 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 9-11 VP
2. BALANCED PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 VP card = 10 VP
3. DEVELOPMENT PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP

NEVER SAY NO TO FREE VPs:
- Always account for the 2 VP from longest road and largest army in your plans
- These special cards are EASY to lose if you're not defending them
- Invest in roads/knights to maintain your lead if these VPs are part of your strategy
- Be alert for opponents trying to steal these bonus points

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 110 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Block RED's access to wheat by placing the robber on (2, 0, -2) hex
2. Continue building roads to establish a settlement at a new location
3. Try to challenge RED for longest road if possible
4. Save resources for development cards when I get more ore from my city
5. Keep targeting RED's key resources to slow their progress to 10 VP
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.

# Game State Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state and available options:

## Current Victory Points
- BLUE (me): 5/10 VP (2 cities + 1 settlement)
- RED: 8/10 VP (2 cities + 2 settlements + longest road)

RED is just 2 VP away from winning, so they're a significant threat.

## My Resources
- 2 🌲 WOOD
- 2 🐑 SHEEP
- 1 🌾 WHEAT
- 2 ⛏️ ORE
- No BRICK

## Available Actions
0. End my turn
1. Buy a development card (1 SHEEP, 1 WHEAT, 1 ORE)
2-5. Various port trades that don't appear useful right now

## Strategic Considerations

1. **Development Card Option**: I have exactly the resources needed for a development card (1 SHEEP, 1 WHEAT, 1 ORE). This could yield:
   - A Knight: Would help block RED and work toward largest army
   - Victory Point: Would get me to 6 VP (hidden from opponents)
   - Year of Plenty/Monopoly/Road Building: Could accelerate my build strategy

2. **RED's Position**: They have 8 VP and are 2 away from winning. They already have longest road with 9 segments, making it difficult to challenge.

3. **My Current Plan**: My plan involves blocking RED and continuing to build. However, I don't have BRICK for roads right now.

4. **Resource Consideration**: If I end my turn, I keep resources for future builds, but risk losing them to a 7 roll or knight card.

## Decision
Given that RED is close to winning (8/10 VP), buying a development card is my best option. It could give me a hidden VP, a knight to disrupt RED, or a helpful action card. Since I have exactly the required resources and can't build anything else meaningful this turn, this is optimal.

<plan>
1. Buy a development card to potentially get a VP card or knight
2. Continue blocking RED with robber placements when possible  
3. Use my next resources to build roads toward new settlement locations
4. Work toward largest army (2 VP) since longest road seems out of reach
5. Monitor RED closely as they only need 2 more VP to win
</plan>

\boxed{1}
========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Target hexes with HIGH probability numbers (6,8,5,9) - prioritize these above all else
- Go for resource DIVERSITY: secure ALL five resources between your two settlements
- Focus on ORE and WHEAT for city upgrades (numbers 5-9 preferred)
- Evaluate each potential settlement by its TOTAL PIP COUNT (sum of probability dots)
- Place your initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Avoid placing both settlements near the same resources - diversify your income!
- Always consider 3:1 ports if your initial placement gives you limited access to certain resources
- Place roads in directions that block opponents' expansion routes

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT & CITY BUILDING PRIORITY:
- FIRST PRIORITY: Build 1-2 additional settlements early to secure critical resources you lack
- SECOND PRIORITY: Upgrade to cities as quickly as possible to double resource production
- THIRD PRIORITY: Build roads only when they lead directly to valuable settlement locations
- Early game (1-5 turns): Secure key settlements at high-value locations
- Mid-game (6-15 turns): Focus heavily on upgrading to cities (2-3 cities should be your target)
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road
- When short on a key resource, use 2:1 ports if available before using 3:1 or 4:1 ports
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat to other players unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- If you have excess of a resource, use ports rather than trading with opponents

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards primarily when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber OR to reach Largest Army (3+ knights)
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city or settlement build
- Use Monopoly cards after high-probability dice rolls to collect maximum resources
- Keep track of how many VP cards you've drawn (5 in the deck total)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn
- When development cards are your path to victory, aim for: 3 cities (6 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 victory cards (2 VP)
- Consider buying development cards when you have limited build options (blocked roads, etc.)

OPTIMAL EXPANSION PATH:
- Build roads with PURPOSE - every road should lead to a viable settlement location
- Identify and secure "bottleneck" positions that cut off opponents' expansion
- Expand toward resources you LACK from initial placement - seek balance
- When choosing between multiple settlement spots, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (total pip count)
  2. Access to resources you currently lack
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, securing future expansion)

4. If you can't build your priority item, determine if trading or buying a development card is better
5. Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card or trade for needed resources
6. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

WINNING PATHS:

3. DEVELOPMENT PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP

NEVER SAY NO TO FREE VPs:
- Always account for the 2 VP from longest road and largest army in your plans
- These special cards are EASY to lose if you're not defending them
- Invest in roads/knights to maintain your lead if these VPs are part of your strategy

# Robber Placement Analysis

Let me analyze the best move for placing the robber to slow down RED who is at 8 VP and close to winning.

## Current Game Status
- RED has 8/10 VP (including 2 VP from Longest Road)
- I (BLUE) have 5/10 VP (including 1 hidden VP from a development card)
- RED has 7 hidden resources
- I need to disrupt RED's production while maximizing my own

## Robber Options Analysis

First, I'll identify RED's buildings and their key production:
- Node 18: RED city producing wheat(6), sheep(9), ore(4) 
- Node 13: RED settlement producing brick(10), wood(11), brick(10)
- Node 4: RED city producing sheep(2), brick(10), wheat(6)
- Node 22: RED settlement producing wood(12), ore(5), wheat(6)

RED's strongest productions are:
- Wheat (6) - produced by two buildings including a city
- Brick (10) - produced by two buildings including a city
- Ore (5) - decent number on a settlement

Looking at all the options where I can steal from RED (0, 3, 4, 6, 10, 11, 13, 14, 16), I want to target a valuable hex that:
1. Blocks RED's most critical resources
2. Affects multiple RED buildings if possible
3. Doesn't block my own important production

Option 4: Move robber to (-1, 1, 0) and steal from RED
- This blocks wheat(6) - a high probability resource
- This affects RED's city at node 18 and city at node 4
- This is RED's strongest wheat production
- Wheat is critical for building settlements and development cards

Option 0: Move robber to (0, 0, 0) and steal from RED
- This blocks sheep(2) - not a high probability
- Not particularly damaging to RED

Options 3 & 11: Move robber to (-1, 0, 1) or (-2, 0, 2) and steal from RED
- These block brick(10) hexes, which RED does use
- However, RED has multiple sources of brick

Looking at RED's production and VP situation (8/10), they only need 2 more VP to win. They could:
1. Build 2 more settlements (requires brick, wood, sheep, wheat)
2. Buy 2 more development cards hoping for VP cards (requires ore, sheep, wheat)
3. Upgrade a settlement to city (requires ore, wheat)

Since wheat is critical for all these options, and wheat(6) is a high probability, option 4 seems strongest.

<plan>
1. Block RED's wheat(6) production with robber to slow their progress
2. Buy a development card with my wheat and ore to potentially get knight or VP
3. Work toward largest army (2 VP) to counter RED's longest road
4. Monitor RED's resources and continue blocking key hexes
5. Save resources for strategic building when possible
</plan>

Therefore, my optimal choice is:

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Target hexes with HIGH probability numbers (6,8,5,9) - prioritize these above all else
- Go for resource DIVERSITY: secure ALL five resources between your two settlements
- Focus on ORE and WHEAT for city upgrades (numbers 5-9 preferred)
- Evaluate each potential settlement by its TOTAL PIP COUNT (sum of probability dots)
- Place your initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Avoid placing both settlements near the same resources - diversify your income!
- Always consider 3:1 ports if your initial placement gives you limited access to certain resources
- Place roads in directions that block opponents' expansion routes

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT & CITY BUILDING PRIORITY:
- FIRST PRIORITY: Build 1-2 additional settlements early to secure critical resources you lack
- SECOND PRIORITY: Upgrade to cities as quickly as possible to double resource production
- THIRD PRIORITY: Build roads only when they lead directly to valuable settlement locations
- Early game (1-5 turns): Secure key settlements at high-value locations
- Mid-game (6-15 turns): Focus heavily on upgrading to cities (2-3 cities should be your target)
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road
- When short on a key resource, use 2:1 ports if available before using 3:1 or 4:1 ports
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat to other players unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- If you have excess of a resource, use ports rather than trading with opponents

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards primarily when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber OR to reach Largest Army (3+ knights)
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city or settlement build
- Use Monopoly cards after high-probability dice rolls to collect maximum resources
- Keep track of how many VP cards you've drawn (5 in the deck total)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn
- When development cards are your path to victory, aim for: 3 cities (6 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 victory cards (2 VP)
- Consider buying development cards when you have limited build options (blocked roads, etc.)

OPTIMAL EXPANSION PATH:
- Build roads with PURPOSE - every road should lead to a viable settlement location
- Identify and secure "bottleneck" positions that cut off opponents' expansion
- Expand toward resources you LACK from initial placement - seek balance
- When choosing between multiple settlement spots, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (total pip count)
  2. Access to resources you currently lack
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, securing future expansion)
  4. Proximity to useful ports
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Longest road (2 VP) requires strategic planning - only pursue if you already have 4+ roads built

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- When someone has 8+ points, ALWAYS target them with the robber regardless of other factors
- If you're being targeted by the robber, consider using knight cards immediately to protect production

TURN-BY-TURN PLANNING:
1. Start each turn by assessing your current VP and opponents' VPs (both visible and potential hidden points)
2. Identify your build priority for this turn: settlement, city, road, or development card?
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for your priority build
4. If you can't build your priority item, determine if trading or buying a development card is better
5. Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card or trade for needed resources
6. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

WINNING PATHS:
1. CITY-FOCUSED PATH: 3-4 cities (6-8 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 9-11 VP
2. BALANCED PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 VP card = 10 VP
3. DEVELOPMENT PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP

NEVER SAY NO TO FREE VPs:
- Always account for the 2 VP from longest road and largest army in your plans
- These special cards are EASY to lose if you're not defending them
- Invest in roads/knights to maintain your lead if these VPs are part of your strategy
- Be alert for opponents trying to steal these bonus points

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game Analysis for Blue Player

## Current Situation Assessment
- I have 5/10 victory points 
- Red has 8/10 victory points (including +2 from longest road)
- I have 2 wheat, 3 ore, and 1 victory point development card
- I can upgrade my settlement at node 29 to a city (costs 2 wheat, 3 ore)
- Red is very close to winning with 8 VP

## Decision Analysis

Let's analyze my current position:
1. Victory Points: I have 5 VP (2 cities + 1 settlement + 1 VP card)
2. Red has 8 VP (2 cities + 2 settlements + 2 VP for longest road)
3. Resources: I have exactly what I need to build a city (2 wheat, 3 ore)

If I upgrade my settlement to a city:
- I gain 1 VP, bringing me to 6/10 VP
- I increase my sheep production at node 29 (sheep on 5)
- I use all my current resources

Looking at the board, Red is very close to winning with 8 VP. They need only 2 more VP, which they could get from:
- Building 2 more settlements
- Building 1 more city
- Getting development cards with VP
- Getting largest army (if they have knights)

I need to consider my path to victory. I'm at 5 VP currently, and need 5 more to win.

<plan>
1. Upgrade settlement at node 29 to a city for +1 VP (6 total)
2. Continue building my road network to challenge Red for longest road
3. Buy development cards when possible for knights (largest army = 2 VP) and VP cards
4. Look for settlement opportunities to increase resource production
5. Block Red's key resources with robber and knights when possible
</plan>

Given the current board state, Red is dangerously close to winning at 8 VP. I need to accelerate my own victory path. Upgrading to a city is a definite step forward, giving me an immediate VP and increased production capacity. I should use my resources now rather than risk losing them to a 7 roll or robber.

## Final Decision
I will upgrade my settlement to a city at node 29, gaining 1 VP and increasing my sheep production.

# Robber Placement Analysis

I need to carefully analyze where to place the robber to optimally disrupt RED player, who is at 8 victory points and close to winning.

## Game State Assessment
- RED has 8 VP (2 cities, 2 settlements, longest road)
- I (BLUE) have 6 VP (3 cities, 1 VP card)
- RED is only 2 points from winning, making them a critical threat
- RED has 7 hidden resource cards

## Robber Placement Strategy
I should target RED's highest-value production hexes to:
1. Disrupt their resource generation
2. Steal a valuable card from them
3. Block key resources they need for their next build

Looking at RED's buildings:
- RED city at node 18 produces from 🌾6, 🐑9, ⛏️4
- RED city at node 4 produces from 🐑2, 🧱10, 🌾6
- RED settlement at node 13 produces from 🧱10, 🌲11, 🧱10
- RED settlement at node 22 produces from 🌲12, ⛏️5, 🌾6

The most productive hex for RED is 🌾6 (-1, 1, 0) as it produces for both a city and a settlement (node 4 and node 18). This is a very high-value wheat hex with pip count ⭐⭐⭐.

Let's check the corresponding action number:
- Action [4]: Move robber to (-1, 1, 0) and steal from RED

This is the optimal choice because:
1. It blocks RED's most productive wheat hex (which appears on 6/36, a high probability)
2. It disrupts production for both a city and a settlement
3. I can steal a card from RED
4. RED likely needs wheat for city upgrades or development cards

<plan>
1. Block RED's key wheat production with robber
2. Continue building my road network to challenge for longest road
3. Save resources for development cards to aim for largest army
4. Look for optimal settlement spots to increase my production
5. Work toward 10 VP through: 3 cities (6 VP) + 1 VP card + largest army (2 VP) + 1 more settlement (1 VP)
</plan>

Given RED is so close to winning at 8 VP, disrupting their critical wheat resource is the best strategic move.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Target hexes with HIGH probability numbers (6,8,5,9) - prioritize these above all else
- Go for resource DIVERSITY: secure ALL five resources between your two settlements
- Focus on ORE and WHEAT for city upgrades (numbers 5-9 preferred)
- Evaluate each potential settlement by its TOTAL PIP COUNT (sum of probability dots)
- Place your initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Avoid placing both settlements near the same resources - diversify your income!
- Always consider 3:1 ports if your initial placement gives you limited access to certain resources
- Place roads in directions that block opponents' expansion routes

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT & CITY BUILDING PRIORITY:
- FIRST PRIORITY: Build 1-2 additional settlements early to secure critical resources you lack
- SECOND PRIORITY: Upgrade to cities as quickly as possible to double resource production
- THIRD PRIORITY: Build roads only when they lead directly to valuable settlement locations
- Early game (1-5 turns): Secure key settlements at high-value locations
- Mid-game (6-15 turns): Focus heavily on upgrading to cities (2-3 cities should be your target)
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road
- When short on a key resource, use 2:1 ports if available before using 3:1 or 4:1 ports
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat to other players unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- If you have excess of a resource, use ports rather than trading with opponents

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards primarily when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber OR to reach Largest Army (3+ knights)
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city or settlement build
- Use Monopoly cards after high-probability dice rolls to collect maximum resources
- Keep track of how many VP cards you've drawn (5 in the deck total)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn
- When development cards are your path to victory, aim for: 3 cities (6 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 victory cards (2 VP)
- Consider buying development cards when you have limited build options (blocked roads, etc.)

OPTIMAL EXPANSION PATH:
- Build roads with PURPOSE - every road should lead to a viable settlement location
- Identify and secure "bottleneck" positions that cut off opponents' expansion
- Expand toward resources you LACK from initial placement - seek balance
- When choosing between multiple settlement spots, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (total pip count)
  2. Access to resources you currently lack
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, securing future expansion)
  4. Proximity to useful ports
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Longest road (2 VP) requires strategic planning - only pursue if you already have 4+ roads built

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- When someone has 8+ points, ALWAYS target them with the robber regardless of other factors
- If you're being targeted by the robber, consider using knight cards immediately to protect production

TURN-BY-TURN PLANNING:
1. Start each turn by assessing your current VP and opponents' VPs (both visible and potential hidden points)
2. Identify your build priority for this turn: settlement, city, road, or development card?
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for your priority build
4. If you can't build your priority item, determine if trading or buying a development card is better
5. Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card or trade for needed resources
6. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

WINNING PATHS:
1. CITY-FOCUSED PATH: 3-4 cities (6-8 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 9-11 VP
2. BALANCED PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 VP card = 10 VP
3. DEVELOPMENT PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP

NEVER SAY NO TO FREE VPs:
- Always account for the 2 VP from longest road and largest army in your plans
- These special cards are EASY to lose if you're not defending them
- Invest in roads/knights to maintain your lead if these VPs are part of your strategy
- Be alert for opponents trying to steal these bonus points

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game Analysis for Settlers of Catan

Let me analyze the current game state and determine the optimal move:

## Game State Assessment

**Victory Points:**
- BLUE (me): 6 VP (3 cities = 6 VP, 1 hidden VP card = 1 VP)
- RED: 8 VP (2 cities = 4 VP, 2 settlements = 2 VP, Longest Road = 2 VP)

**My Resources:**
- 2 Sheep, 2 Wheat, 1 Ore

**Key Observations:**
1. RED is at 8 VP and needs only 2 more to win
2. I'm at 6 VP (actually 7 with my hidden VP card)
3. RED has the Longest Road bonus (2 VP)
4. I have just enough resources to buy a development card

## Strategic Options Analysis

I need to look at my path to victory:
- Current: 3 cities (6 VP) + 1 VP card (1 VP) = 7 VP
- Need 3 more VP to win

Potential paths:
1. Buy a development card hoping for a VP card or knights for Largest Army
2. Save resources for settlement (need brick and wood)
3. Trade resources using ports

**Development Card Analysis:**
- Buying a development card could give me:
  - Victory Point (immediate +1 VP)
  - Knight (helps toward Largest Army = 2 VP)
  - Year of Plenty/Monopoly/Road Building (helpful utility)
- I already have 1 knight played, so 2 more knights would give me Largest Army
- With a VP card, I'd be at 8 VP, needing only 2 more to win

**End Turn Analysis:**
- Ending my turn means waiting for more resources
- Risk: RED might win on their next turn if they have hidden VP or resources for another settlement

## Decision Logic

Given that:
1. RED is dangerously close to winning (8 VP)
2. I have exactly the resources needed for a development card
3. A development card could be a VP card or a knight (both helping my victory path)
4. I cannot build anything else meaningful with my current resources
5. Port trades don't help my immediate situation

My best chance is to buy a development card. This could give me an immediate VP card (bringing me to 8 VP), or a knight to move toward Largest Army. Either way, it's my best path to victory given current resources and game state.

<plan>
1. Buy development card hoping for VP or knight
2. If knight, play it to block RED's wheat production
3. Work toward largest army (2 more knights needed)
4. Save resources for future settlement expansion (aim for 3 settlements - will need wood/brick)
5. Path to victory: 3 cities (6 VP) + 1 VP card + largest army (2 VP) + 1 more settlement (1 VP)
</plan>

# Game Analysis: Settlers of Catan Turn 122

Let me analyze the current game situation and available options:

## Current Game Status
- I (BLUE) have 6 VP: 3 cities (6 VP) + 1 hidden VP card
- RED has 8 VP: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + longest road (2 VP)
- RED is close to winning with 8/10 VP and has 8 hidden cards
- I have resources: 2 Wood, 1 Sheep, 1 Wheat
- I have 1 unplayed Knight card and 1 Victory Point card

## Available Actions
0. Play Knight card - Move robber and steal a resource
1. Roll the dice

## Strategic Considerations

RED is only 2 points away from winning and has 8 cards in hand, which means:
1. They could be close to building another settlement (+1 VP)
2. They might have development cards including VP cards
3. With 8 cards, they're vulnerable to the robber (7+ cards means losing half on a 7 roll)

My options:

**Option 0: Play Knight**
- Advantages:
  - Can move robber off wheat (currently blocking RED's wheat production)
  - Can steal one of RED's 8 cards
  - Increases my knight count to 2 (need 3 for largest army)
  - Prevents RED from losing cards if a 7 is rolled
- Disadvantages:
  - I'll still need to roll after playing the knight
  - Knight gives no immediate resource benefit beyond stealing one card

**Option 1: Roll First**
- Advantages:
  - Could get resources needed for development card or road building
  - If roll is a 7, RED loses half their cards
- Disadvantages:
  - RED might get more resources if favorable numbers roll
  - Risk of moving robber to block my own production

## Decision

Given that RED has 8 VP and 8 cards in hand, they are very close to winning. Playing the Knight now gives me an immediate advantage by:
1. Stealing one of their cards
2. Potentially blocking their key resource production
3. Moving toward largest army (need 3 knights total)

<plan>
1. Play Knight now to steal from RED and block their wheat production (place robber on hex (-1, 1, 0))
2. After rolling, focus on building roads toward a new settlement location
3. Continue buying development cards when possible to get largest army (need 1 more knight)
4. Path to victory: 3 cities (6 VP) + 1 VP card + largest army (2 VP) + 1 more settlement (1 VP)
</plan>

Playing the Knight now is the safer option since RED is close to winning, and it's better to minimize their resources immediately before they can use them.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Target hexes with HIGH probability numbers (6,8,5,9) - prioritize these above all else
- Go for resource DIVERSITY: secure ALL five resources between your two settlements
- Focus on ORE and WHEAT for city upgrades (numbers 5-9 preferred)
- Evaluate each potential settlement by its TOTAL PIP COUNT (sum of probability dots)
- Place your initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Avoid placing both settlements near the same resources - diversify your income!
- Always consider 3:1 ports if your initial placement gives you limited access to certain resources
- Place roads in directions that block opponents' expansion routes

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT & CITY BUILDING PRIORITY:
- FIRST PRIORITY: Build 1-2 additional settlements early to secure critical resources you lack
- SECOND PRIORITY: Upgrade to cities as quickly as possible to double resource production
- THIRD PRIORITY: Build roads only when they lead directly to valuable settlement locations
- Early game (1-5 turns): Secure key settlements at high-value locations
- Mid-game (6-15 turns): Focus heavily on upgrading to cities (2-3 cities should be your target)
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road
- When short on a key resource, use 2:1 ports if available before using 3:1 or 4:1 ports
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat to other players unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- If you have excess of a resource, use ports rather than trading with opponents

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards primarily when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber OR to reach Largest Army (3+ knights)
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city or settlement build
- Use Monopoly cards after high-probability dice rolls to collect maximum resources
- Keep track of how many VP cards you've drawn (5 in the deck total)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn
- When development cards are your path to victory, aim for: 3 cities (6 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 victory cards (2 VP)
- Consider buying development cards when you have limited build options (blocked roads, etc.)

OPTIMAL EXPANSION PATH:
- Build roads with PURPOSE - every road should lead to a viable settlement location
- Identify and secure "bottleneck" positions that cut off opponents' expansion
- Expand toward resources you LACK from initial placement - seek balance
- When choosing between multiple settlement spots, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (total pip count)
  2. Access to resources you currently lack
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, securing future expansion)
  4. Proximity to useful ports
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Longest road (2 VP) requires strategic planning - only pursue if you already have 4+ roads built

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- When someone has 8+ points, ALWAYS target them with the robber regardless of other factors
- If you're being targeted by the robber, consider using knight cards immediately to protect production

TURN-BY-TURN PLANNING:
1. Start each turn by assessing your current VP and opponents' VPs (both visible and potential hidden points)
2. Identify your build priority for this turn: settlement, city, road, or development card?
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for your priority build
4. If you can't build your priority item, determine if trading or buying a development card is better
5. Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card or trade for needed resources
6. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

WINNING PATHS:
1. CITY-FOCUSED PATH: 3-4 cities (6-8 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 9-11 VP
2. BALANCED PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 VP card = 10 VP
3. DEVELOPMENT PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP

NEVER SAY NO TO FREE VPs:
- Always account for the 2 VP from longest road and largest army in your plans
- These special cards are EASY to lose if you're not defending them
- Invest in roads/knights to maintain your lead if these VPs are part of your strategy
- Be alert for opponents trying to steal these bonus points

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 122 | Player: BLUE | Action: MOVE_ROBBER

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Play Knight now to steal from RED and block their wheat production (place robber on hex (-1, 1, 0))
2. After rolling, focus on building roads toward a new settlement location
3. Continue buying development cards when possible to get largest army (need 1 more knight)
4. Path to victory: 3 cities (6 VP) + 1 VP card + largest army (2 VP) + 1 more settlement (1 VP)

❓ Select action by number (0-17):


Based on this information, which action number do you choose? Think step by step about your options, then put the final action number in a box like \boxed{1}.
RESPONSE:
I'll analyze this game state carefully to decide the optimal robber placement.

First, let's assess the current situation:
- I have 6 VP (3 cities = 6 VP + 1 hidden VP card = 7 total)
- RED has 8 visible VP (2 cities = 4 VP + 2 settlements = 2 VP + longest road = 2 VP)
- RED is ahead by 1 VP and close to winning (needs just 2 more VP)
- I need to play my knight card now to move the robber

My primary goal is to disrupt RED's production and steal a valuable resource while protecting my own resources.

Looking at RED's buildings:
1. City at node 18: produces on 🌾6, 🐑9, ⛏️4
2. Settlement at node 13: produces on 🧱10, 🌲11, 🧱10
3. City at node 4: produces on 🐑2, 🧱10, 🌾6
4. Settlement at node 22: produces on 🌲12, ⛏️5, 🌾6

RED's production is strongest on wheat (🌾6) - it appears in 3 of their 4 buildings, and two of those are cities! Wheat is essential for cities and development cards, so cutting off this resource would be most impactful.

The hex (-1, 1, 0) already has the robber, so I need to move it to another location.

Looking at the wheat hexes connected to RED's buildings:
- 🌾6 (-1, 1, 0): Already has the robber
- 🌾6 (2, 0, -2): Connected to RED's settlement at node 22
- 🌾8 (2, -2, 0): Not connected to RED's buildings

The best option is to place the robber on hex (2, 0, -2) which produces wheat on a strong 6 number and is connected to RED's settlement. This corresponds to option [16].

When I place the robber there, I'll also get to steal from RED, which could give me a valuable resource I need.

<plan>
1. Move robber to wheat hex (2, 0, -2) to block RED's wheat production
2. Continue working toward largest army (need 1 more knight)
3. Use stolen resource and future rolls to build roads toward a new settlement
4. Path to victory: 3 cities (6 VP) + 1 VP card + largest army (2 VP) + 1 more settlement (1 VP)
</plan>

# Game Analysis for Settlers of Catan Turn 122

I'll analyze the current game state and determine the optimal action.

## Game State Assessment
- **My Position (BLUE):** 6/10 VP (3 cities = 6VP, 1 VP card = 1VP)
- **Opponent (RED):** 8/10 VP (2 cities = 4VP, 2 settlements = 2VP, longest road = 2VP)
- **Resources:** 2 Wood, 1 Brick, 1 Sheep, 1 Wheat
- **Development Cards:** 1 Victory Point card (already counted in my VP total)
- **Robber:** Currently on wheat hex (2, 0, -2)

## Strategic Situation
RED is at 8 points and needs only 2 more to win. They have 11 hidden resource cards, suggesting they're close to building something significant. Meanwhile, I'm at 6 points (counting my hidden VP card) and need 4 more points to win.

## Available Options Analysis

1. **Building a Settlement (Action 10)**
   - Costs 1 Wood, 1 Brick, 1 Wheat, 1 Sheep - I have exactly these resources
   - Would give me +1 VP (bringing me to 7/10)
   - Node 31 would produce Sheep (5) - not ideal but provides some diversity
   - The settlement would help block RED's expansion

2. **Building a Road (Actions 1-9)**
   - Each costs 1 Wood, 1 Brick
   - Would leave me with 1 Wood, 0 Brick, 1 Sheep, 1 Wheat
   - Not immediately advancing my VP count
   - Could work toward longest road (but RED has 9 segments vs my 4)
   - Options lead to different potential settlement locations

## Decision Logic

The most pressing fact is that RED is at 8 points and likely close to winning. I need to maximize my immediate VP gain.

Building a settlement gives me +1 VP immediately, while building a road doesn't increase my points. Although roads could potentially lead to the longest road bonus, RED has 9 segments while I only have 4 - this path is too long-term.

The settlement at node 31 isn't ideal in terms of production (only sheep on a 5), but the immediate VP is critical when facing an opponent at 8 points. 

<plan>
1. Build settlement at node 31 for immediate +1 VP
2. Continue working toward largest army (need 1 more knight)
3. Path to victory: 3 cities (6 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + 1 VP card + largest army (2 VP)
4. Keep focusing on development cards for knights and potential VP cards
</plan>

Given the urgency of the situation with RED at 8 points, I need to prioritize immediate VP gains.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Target hexes with HIGH probability numbers (6,8,5,9) - prioritize these above all else
- Go for resource DIVERSITY: secure ALL five resources between your two settlements
- Focus on ORE and WHEAT for city upgrades (numbers 5-9 preferred)
- Evaluate each potential settlement by its TOTAL PIP COUNT (sum of probability dots)
- Place your initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Avoid placing both settlements near the same resources - diversify your income!
- Always consider 3:1 ports if your initial placement gives you limited access to certain resources
- Place roads in directions that block opponents' expansion routes

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT & CITY BUILDING PRIORITY:
- FIRST PRIORITY: Build 1-2 additional settlements early to secure critical resources you lack
- SECOND PRIORITY: Upgrade to cities as quickly as possible to double resource production
- THIRD PRIORITY: Build roads only when they lead directly to valuable settlement locations
- Early game (1-5 turns): Secure key settlements at high-value locations
- Mid-game (6-15 turns): Focus heavily on upgrading to cities (2-3 cities should be your target)
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road
- When short on a key resource, use 2:1 ports if available before using 3:1 or 4:1 ports
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat to other players unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- If you have excess of a resource, use ports rather than trading with opponents

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards primarily when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber OR to reach Largest Army (3+ knights)
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city or settlement build
- Use Monopoly cards after high-probability dice rolls to collect maximum resources
- Keep track of how many VP cards you've drawn (5 in the deck total)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn
- When development cards are your path to victory, aim for: 3 cities (6 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 victory cards (2 VP)
- Consider buying development cards when you have limited build options (blocked roads, etc.)

OPTIMAL EXPANSION PATH:
- Build roads with PURPOSE - every road should lead to a viable settlement location
- Identify and secure "bottleneck" positions that cut off opponents' expansion
- Expand toward resources you LACK from initial placement - seek balance
- When choosing between multiple settlement spots, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (total pip count)
  2. Access to resources you currently lack
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, securing future expansion)
  4. Proximity to useful ports
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Longest road (2 VP) requires strategic planning - only pursue if you already have 4+ roads built

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- When someone has 8+ points, ALWAYS target them with the robber regardless of other factors
- If you're being targeted by the robber, consider using knight cards immediately to protect production

TURN-BY-TURN PLANNING:
1. Start each turn by assessing your current VP and opponents' VPs (both visible and potential hidden points)
2. Identify your build priority for this turn: settlement, city, road, or development card?
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for your priority build
4. If you can't build your priority item, determine if trading or buying a development card is better
5. Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card or trade for needed resources
6. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

WINNING PATHS:
1. CITY-FOCUSED PATH: 3-4 cities (6-8 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 9-11 VP
2. BALANCED PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 VP card = 10 VP
3. DEVELOPMENT PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP

NEVER SAY NO TO FREE VPs:
- Always account for the 2 VP from longest road and largest army in your plans
- These special cards are EASY to lose if you're not defending them
- Invest in roads/knights to maintain your lead if these VPs are part of your strategy
- Be alert for opponents trying to steal these bonus points

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 126 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Build settlement at node 31 for immediate +1 VP
2. Continue working toward largest army (need 1 more knight)
3. Path to victory: 3 cities (6 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + 1 VP card + largest army (2 VP)
4. Keep focusing on development cards for knights and potential VP cards

# Game Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state thoroughly to determine my optimal move:

## Victory Point Assessment
- **My position:** 7/10 VP (3 cities + 1 settlement + 1 VP card)
- **Opponent (RED):** 9/10 VP (2 cities + 3 settlements + longest road)
- RED is just 1 VP away from winning

## Resources & Building Options
- I have: 3 🐑SHEEP, 2 🌾WHEAT, 2 ⛏️ORE
- RED has 9 hidden cards - they are resource-rich and likely planning their winning move
- Development cards cost: 1 🐑SHEEP, 1 🌾WHEAT, 1 ⛏️ORE (which I can afford)

## Strategic Considerations
1. RED is at 9 VP and could win on their next turn
2. My path to 10 VP requires getting 3 more VP (currently at 7 VP)
3. I need to either:
   - Build more settlements (+1 VP each)
   - Get largest army (+2 VP, need 1 more knight)
   - Find another VP card

## Analysis of Available Actions

**Option 0: End Turn**
- I'd be wasting valuable resources
- RED will likely win on their next turn
- Not viable

**Option 1: Buy Development Card**
- I can afford this (3 🐑, 2 🌾, 2 ⛏️ → 2 🐑, 1 🌾, 1 ⛏️)
- Potential outcomes:
  - Knight card: Would give me largest army (2 VP) if I draw one (I already have 2 played)
  - VP card: Would give me +1 VP directly
  - Year of Plenty/Monopoly/Road Building: Could help next turn but not immediately useful
- This is my best chance to reach 10 VP quickly

**Options 2-5: Maritime Trade**
- None of these trades unlock any immediate builds
- I already have sufficient ore and wheat
- Getting brick or wood doesn't help my immediate situation

<plan>
1. Buy development card hoping for knight (for largest army +2 VP) or VP card (+1 VP)
2. If I get a knight, play it immediately to secure largest army
3. If I get another resource card, save for next turn
4. Path to victory now: 3 cities (6 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + 1 VP card + potential largest army (2 VP) OR another VP card
</plan>

With RED at 9 VP and likely to win next turn, my only viable option is to buy a development card and hope for a knight (for largest army) or a VP card. Maritime trades don't advance my position meaningfully.

1. Start each turn by assessing your current VP and opponents' VPs (both visible and potential hidden points)
2. Identify your build priority for this turn: settlement, city, road, or development card?
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for your priority build
4. If you can't build your priority item, determine if trading or buying a development card is better
5. Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card or trade for needed resources
6. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

WINNING PATHS:
1. CITY-FOCUSED PATH: 3-4 cities (6-8 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 9-11 VP
2. BALANCED PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 VP card = 10 VP
3. DEVELOPMENT PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP

NEVER SAY NO TO FREE VPs:
- Always account for the 2 VP from longest road and largest army in your plans
- These special cards are EASY to lose if you're not defending them
- Invest in roads/knights to maintain your lead if these VPs are part of your strategy
- Be alert for opponents trying to steal these bonus points

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 126 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:

# Analyzing the Game State

## Current situation:
- I have 7 VP: 3 cities (6 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + 1 VP development card
- RED has 9 VP: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP)
- RED is just 1 VP away from winning
- I have resources: 2 sheep, 1 wheat, 1 ore
- I have 1 Year of Plenty card and 1 VP card
- I have played 2 knights already

## Key considerations:
1. RED is very close to winning with 9 VP
2. I need 3 more VP to win
3. I can potentially gain 2 VP from largest army (need 1 more knight)
4. I could also get VP cards from development cards

## Options analysis:
- [0] End turn - This wastes my current resources and gives RED another turn to potentially win
- [1] Buy development card - Uses all my current resources (2 sheep, 1 wheat, 1 ore)
- [2-5] Maritime trades - These don't seem useful as I don't have enough resources after trading to build anything substantial

## Development card potential outcomes:
- Knight (most common) - Would give me largest army (2 VP)
- Victory Point - Would give me +1 VP
- Year of Plenty/Monopoly/Road Building - Could help next turn

## Strategic analysis:
RED is at 9 VP and likely to win on their next turn. My best chance is to increase my VP count immediately. Buying a development card is my only viable option to potentially get either:
1. A knight to secure largest army (2 VP)
2. A VP card for +1 VP directly

<plan>
1. Buy development card hoping for knight (for largest army +2 VP) or VP card (+1 VP)
2. If I get a knight, play it immediately to secure largest army
3. Plan next steps based on what I draw and what resources I receive next turn
4. Path to victory: 3 cities (6 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + 1 VP card I already have + either largest army (2 VP) or another VP card
</plan>

The optimal choice is to buy a development card, which gives me the best chance of increasing my VP count immediately or setting up for a win next turn.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Target hexes with HIGH probability numbers (6,8,5,9) - prioritize these above all else
- Go for resource DIVERSITY: secure ALL five resources between your two settlements
- Focus on ORE and WHEAT for city upgrades (numbers 5-9 preferred)
- Evaluate each potential settlement by its TOTAL PIP COUNT (sum of probability dots)
- Place your initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Avoid placing both settlements near the same resources - diversify your income!
- Always consider 3:1 ports if your initial placement gives you limited access to certain resources
- Place roads in directions that block opponents' expansion routes

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT & CITY BUILDING PRIORITY:
- FIRST PRIORITY: Build 1-2 additional settlements early to secure critical resources you lack
- SECOND PRIORITY: Upgrade to cities as quickly as possible to double resource production
- THIRD PRIORITY: Build roads only when they lead directly to valuable settlement locations
- Early game (1-5 turns): Secure key settlements at high-value locations
- Mid-game (6-15 turns): Focus heavily on upgrading to cities (2-3 cities should be your target)
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road
- When short on a key resource, use 2:1 ports if available before using 3:1 or 4:1 ports
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat to other players unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- If you have excess of a resource, use ports rather than trading with opponents

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards primarily when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber OR to reach Largest Army (3+ knights)
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city or settlement build
- Use Monopoly cards after high-probability dice rolls to collect maximum resources
- Keep track of how many VP cards you've drawn (5 in the deck total)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn
- When development cards are your path to victory, aim for: 3 cities (6 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 victory cards (2 VP)
- Consider buying development cards when you have limited build options (blocked roads, etc.)

OPTIMAL EXPANSION PATH:
- Build roads with PURPOSE - every road should lead to a viable settlement location
- Identify and secure "bottleneck" positions that cut off opponents' expansion
- Expand toward resources you LACK from initial placement - seek balance
- When choosing between multiple settlement spots, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (total pip count)
  2. Access to resources you currently lack
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, securing future expansion)
  4. Proximity to useful ports
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Longest road (2 VP) requires strategic planning - only pursue if you already have 4+ roads built

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- When someone has 8+ points, ALWAYS target them with the robber regardless of other factors
- If you're being targeted by the robber, consider using knight cards immediately to protect production

TURN-BY-TURN PLANNING:
1. Start each turn by assessing your current VP and opponents' VPs (both visible and potential hidden points)
2. Identify your build priority for this turn: settlement, city, road, or development card?
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for your priority build
4. If you can't build your priority item, determine if trading or buying a development card is better
5. Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card or trade for needed resources
6. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

WINNING PATHS:
1. CITY-FOCUSED PATH: 3-4 cities (6-8 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 9-11 VP
2. BALANCED PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 VP card = 10 VP
3. DEVELOPMENT PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP

NEVER SAY NO TO FREE VPs:
- Always account for the 2 VP from longest road and largest army in your plans
- These special cards are EASY to lose if you're not defending them
- Invest in roads/knights to maintain your lead if these VPs are part of your strategy
- Be alert for opponents trying to steal these bonus points

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile

# Game Analysis

First, I need to assess the current game state:

- I have 7 VP (3 cities = 6 VP + 1 settlement = 1 VP + 2 hidden VP cards)
- Red has 9 VP (2 cities = 4 VP + 3 settlements = 3 VP + Longest Road = 2 VP)
- Red is just 1 VP away from winning
- I have only 1 sheep resource
- I have a Year of Plenty card and 2 VP cards

## Strategic Considerations

Red is very close to winning with 9 VP. They likely need just one more settlement or a development card with a VP to win. Since they have 8 hidden resources, they might be able to win on their next turn.

I currently have 7 VP (5 visible + 2 hidden). With my 2 VP cards, I actually have 9 VP total, so I'm also just 1 VP away from winning.

Given my current resources (only 1 sheep), I can't build anything significant without using my Year of Plenty card.

## Action Possibilities

I need to either:
1. Use my Year of Plenty card to get resources to build something that gives me 1 more VP
2. Roll the dice and hope for good resources

My fastest path to victory would be to build a settlement (requires Brick, Wood, Sheep, Wheat). I currently have 1 Sheep, so I need Brick, Wood, and Wheat.

Option [3] - Play Year of Plenty card for Wood and Brick would give me Wood and Brick, but I'd still be missing Wheat.

Option [15] - Rolling the dice is actually better because:
- I might get additional resources from my high-probability hexes
- I still have my Year of Plenty card after rolling
- If the roll doesn't give me what I need, I can then use Year of Plenty

<plan>
1. Roll the dice to potentially gain resources from my settlements/cities
2. If I get enough resources for a settlement or can supplement with Year of Plenty to build a settlement, do that
3. Otherwise, consider buying a development card if possible (could be a VP card or Knight)
4. Use Year of Plenty strategically after seeing what the dice give me
5. Path to victory: 3 cities (6 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + 2 VP cards + potentially 1 more VP from building
</plan>

Rolling first gives me more information and options. I can always use Year of Plenty after rolling if needed.

- Evaluate each potential settlement by its TOTAL PIP COUNT (sum of probability dots)
- Place your initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Avoid placing both settlements near the same resources - diversify your income!
- Always consider 3:1 ports if your initial placement gives you limited access to certain resources
- Place roads in directions that block opponents' expansion routes

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT & CITY BUILDING PRIORITY:
- FIRST PRIORITY: Build 1-2 additional settlements early to secure critical resources you lack
- SECOND PRIORITY: Upgrade to cities as quickly as possible to double resource production
- THIRD PRIORITY: Build roads only when they lead directly to valuable settlement locations
- Early game (1-5 turns): Secure key settlements at high-value locations
- Mid-game (6-15 turns): Focus heavily on upgrading to cities (2-3 cities should be your target)
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road
- When short on a key resource, use 2:1 ports if available before using 3:1 or 4:1 ports
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat to other players unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- If you have excess of a resource, use ports rather than trading with opponents

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards primarily when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber OR to reach Largest Army (3+ knights)
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city or settlement build
- Use Monopoly cards after high-probability dice rolls to collect maximum resources
- Keep track of how many VP cards you've drawn (5 in the deck total)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn
- When development cards are your path to victory, aim for: 3 cities (6 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 victory cards (2 VP)
- Consider buying development cards when you have limited build options (blocked roads, etc.)

OPTIMAL EXPANSION PATH:
- Build roads with PURPOSE - every road should lead to a viable settlement location
- Identify and secure "bottleneck" positions that cut off opponents' expansion
- Expand toward resources you LACK from initial placement - seek balance
- When choosing between multiple settlement spots, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (total pip count)
  2. Access to resources you currently lack
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, securing future expansion)
  4. Proximity to useful ports
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Longest road (2 VP) requires strategic planning - only pursue if you already have 4+ roads built

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- When someone has 8+ points, ALWAYS target them with the robber regardless of other factors
- If you're being targeted by the robber, consider using knight cards immediately to protect production

TURN-BY-TURN PLANNING:
1. Start each turn by assessing your current VP and opponents' VPs (both visible and potential hidden points)
2. Identify your build priority for this turn: settlement, city, road, or development card?
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for your priority build
4. If you can't build your priority item, determine if trading or buying a development card is better
5. Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card or trade for needed resources
6. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

WINNING PATHS:
1. CITY-FOCUSED PATH: 3-4 cities (6-8 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 9-11 VP
2. BALANCED PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 VP card = 10 VP
3. DEVELOPMENT PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP

NEVER SAY NO TO FREE VPs:
- Always account for the 2 VP from longest road and largest army in your plans
- These special cards are EASY to lose if you're not defending them
- Invest in roads/knights to maintain your lead if these VPs are part of your strategy
- Be alert for opponents trying to steal these bonus points

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 128 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Roll the dice to potentially gain resources from my settlements/cities
2. If I get enough resources for a settlement or can supplement with Year of Plenty to build a settlement, do that
3. Otherwise, consider buying a development card if possible (could be a VP card or Knight)
4. Use Year of Plenty strategically after seeing what the dice give me
5. Path to victory: 3 cities (6 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + 2 VP cards + potentially 1 more VP from building
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.

# Game Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state and my options carefully:

## Victory Points Assessment:
- I have 7 VPs: 3 cities (6 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + 2 VP cards (hidden)
- RED has 9 VPs: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + Longest Road (2 VP)
- RED is only 1 VP away from winning

## Resource Analysis:
- I currently have only 1 sheep
- I have a Year of Plenty development card I can play
- I can't build anything with just 1 sheep

## Strategic Options:
1. I need to make progress toward 10 VPs
2. Potential paths:
   - Build a settlement (+1 VP)
   - Buy a development card (potential VP card or knight to get Largest Army)
   - Build more roads to get Longest Road (but RED has 9 segments, I'd need 10+)

## Year of Plenty Options:
For a settlement, I need: Brick + Wood + Sheep + Wheat
Since I have 1 sheep already, I'd need Brick + Wood + Wheat

<plan>
1. Use Year of Plenty to get Wood + Brick
2. Next turn, try to get a Wheat through trades or production to build a settlement
3. If I get to 8 VP with a new settlement, I'll have a strong chance since I have 2 hidden VP cards
4. Watch for opportunities to play knights and potentially get Largest Army
</plan>

Among my options for Year of Plenty, option [3] (Wood + Brick) aligns best with my immediate goal of working toward a settlement. This gives me 2 of the 4 resources needed, and with my existing sheep, I'll just need wheat to complete a settlement on my next turn.

I don't want to end my turn without making progress since RED is at 9 VP and could win on their next turn.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Target hexes with HIGH probability numbers (6,8,5,9) - prioritize these above all else
- Go for resource DIVERSITY: secure ALL five resources between your two settlements
- Focus on ORE and WHEAT for city upgrades (numbers 5-9 preferred)
- Evaluate each potential settlement by its TOTAL PIP COUNT (sum of probability dots)
- Place your initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Avoid placing both settlements near the same resources - diversify your income!
- Always consider 3:1 ports if your initial placement gives you limited access to certain resources
- Place roads in directions that block opponents' expansion routes

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT & CITY BUILDING PRIORITY:
- FIRST PRIORITY: Build 1-2 additional settlements early to secure critical resources you lack
- SECOND PRIORITY: Upgrade to cities as quickly as possible to double resource production
- THIRD PRIORITY: Build roads only when they lead directly to valuable settlement locations
- Early game (1-5 turns): Secure key settlements at high-value locations
- Mid-game (6-15 turns): Focus heavily on upgrading to cities (2-3 cities should be your target)
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road
- When short on a key resource, use 2:1 ports if available before using 3:1 or 4:1 ports
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat to other players unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- If you have excess of a resource, use ports rather than trading with opponents

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards primarily when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber OR to reach Largest Army (3+ knights)
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city or settlement build
- Use Monopoly cards after high-probability dice rolls to collect maximum resources
- Keep track of how many VP cards you've drawn (5 in the deck total)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn
- When development cards are your path to victory, aim for: 3 cities (6 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 victory cards (2 VP)
- Consider buying development cards when you have limited build options (blocked roads, etc.)

OPTIMAL EXPANSION PATH:
- Build roads with PURPOSE - every road should lead to a viable settlement location
- Identify and secure "bottleneck" positions that cut off opponents' expansion
- Expand toward resources you LACK from initial placement - seek balance
- When choosing between multiple settlement spots, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (total pip count)
  2. Access to resources you currently lack
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, securing future expansion)
  4. Proximity to useful ports
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Longest road (2 VP) requires strategic planning - only pursue if you already have 4+ roads built

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- When someone has 8+ points, ALWAYS target them with the robber regardless of other factors
- If you're being targeted by the robber, consider using knight cards immediately to protect production

2. Identify your build priority for this turn: settlement, city, road, or development card?
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for your priority build
4. If you can't build your priority item, determine if trading or buying a development card is better
5. Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card or trade for needed resources
6. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

WINNING PATHS:

2. BALANCED PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 VP card = 10 VP
3. DEVELOPMENT PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP

NEVER SAY NO TO FREE VPs:
- Always account for the 2 VP from longest road and largest army in your plans
- These special cards are EASY to lose if you're not defending them
- Invest in roads/knights to maintain your lead if these VPs are part of your strategy
- Be alert for opponents trying to steal these bonus points

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers

# Game State Analysis

Let me analyze my current position and available options:

**Current VP:** 7/10 (3 cities, 1 settlement, 2 hidden VP cards)
**Resources:** 1 Wood, 1 Brick, 1 Sheep
**Special Cards:** None (Longest Road is held by RED)
**RED's Position:** 9/10 VP (2 cities, 3 settlements, Longest Road)

## Strategy Assessment

RED is at 9 VP and only needs 1 more to win. I'm at 7 VP (including my 2 hidden VP cards), so I need 3 more points to win. My previous plan was:
1. Use Year of Plenty to get Wood + Brick
2. Get Wheat to build a settlement

It appears I've already used Year of Plenty and obtained Wood + Brick (which I currently have). I need to use these resources effectively.

## Available Options

1. **Build a Road:** I have exactly the resources needed (1 Wood, 1 Brick) to build a road. This is my only viable build option with current resources.
2. **End Turn:** Save resources for potential future builds.

## Road Building Analysis

Building a road serves two purposes:
1. Progress toward potentially claiming Longest Road (RED currently has it with 9 segments)
2. Extend toward viable settlement locations

Looking at the available road placements, I need to identify which would:
- Lead toward buildable settlement locations
- Potentially help me compete for Longest Road
- Block RED's expansion

Based on the current board state and my VP situation, I need to build roads strategically toward potential settlement spots. I'm 3 VP away from winning, and RED is just 1 VP away. I need to prioritize blocking RED where possible and positioning myself for immediate settlement building when I get more resources.

<plan>
1. Build a road with my Wood+Brick to progress toward a settlement location
2. Next turn, try to collect Wheat+Sheep+Brick through trades or production
3. Build a settlement as soon as possible to reach 8 VP
4. Watch for opportunities to play knights and potentially get Largest Army
5. Consider challenging for Longest Road only if a clear path emerges
</plan>

Since RED is at 9 VP and I'm at 7 VP, time is critical. I need to build a road that leads to a viable settlement location where I can build next turn if I get the resources. Looking at the options, the most strategic choice is to build a road that advances toward an unoccupied node where I could build a settlement soon.

Based on my analysis, I choose to:

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Target hexes with HIGH probability numbers (6,8,5,9) - prioritize these above all else
- Go for resource DIVERSITY: secure ALL five resources between your two settlements
- Focus on ORE and WHEAT for city upgrades (numbers 5-9 preferred)
- Evaluate each potential settlement by its TOTAL PIP COUNT (sum of probability dots)
- Place your initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Avoid placing both settlements near the same resources - diversify your income!
- Always consider 3:1 ports if your initial placement gives you limited access to certain resources
- Place roads in directions that block opponents' expansion routes

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT & CITY BUILDING PRIORITY:
- FIRST PRIORITY: Build 1-2 additional settlements early to secure critical resources you lack
- SECOND PRIORITY: Upgrade to cities as quickly as possible to double resource production
- THIRD PRIORITY: Build roads only when they lead directly to valuable settlement locations
- Early game (1-5 turns): Secure key settlements at high-value locations
- Mid-game (6-15 turns): Focus heavily on upgrading to cities (2-3 cities should be your target)
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road
- When short on a key resource, use 2:1 ports if available before using 3:1 or 4:1 ports
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat to other players unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- If you have excess of a resource, use ports rather than trading with opponents

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards primarily when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber OR to reach Largest Army (3+ knights)
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city or settlement build
- Use Monopoly cards after high-probability dice rolls to collect maximum resources
- Keep track of how many VP cards you've drawn (5 in the deck total)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn
- When development cards are your path to victory, aim for: 3 cities (6 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 victory cards (2 VP)
- Consider buying development cards when you have limited build options (blocked roads, etc.)

OPTIMAL EXPANSION PATH:
- Build roads with PURPOSE - every road should lead to a viable settlement location
- Identify and secure "bottleneck" positions that cut off opponents' expansion
- Expand toward resources you LACK from initial placement - seek balance
- When choosing between multiple settlement spots, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (total pip count)
  2. Access to resources you currently lack
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, securing future expansion)
  4. Proximity to useful ports
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Longest road (2 VP) requires strategic planning - only pursue if you already have 4+ roads built

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- When someone has 8+ points, ALWAYS target them with the robber regardless of other factors
- If you're being targeted by the robber, consider using knight cards immediately to protect production

TURN-BY-TURN PLANNING:
1. Start each turn by assessing your current VP and opponents' VPs (both visible and potential hidden points)
2. Identify your build priority for this turn: settlement, city, road, or development card?
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for your priority build
4. If you can't build your priority item, determine if trading or buying a development card is better
5. Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card or trade for needed resources
6. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

WINNING PATHS:
1. CITY-FOCUSED PATH: 3-4 cities (6-8 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 9-11 VP
2. BALANCED PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 VP card = 10 VP
3. DEVELOPMENT PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP

NEVER SAY NO TO FREE VPs:
- Always account for the 2 VP from longest road and largest army in your plans
- These special cards are EASY to lose if you're not defending them
- Invest in roads/knights to maintain your lead if these VPs are part of your strategy
- Be alert for opponents trying to steal these bonus points

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 0 | Player: BLUE | Action: BUILD_INITIAL_SETTLEMENT

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:

# Initial Settlement Placement Analysis

I need to choose the optimal location for my first settlement. This is a critical decision that will affect my entire game strategy.

## Analyzing High-Value Nodes

First, I'll identify the nodes connected to the high-probability numbers (6, 8, 5, 9) as these are priority targets:
- Ore 6: nodes 10, 11, 29, 30, 31, 32
- Sheep 6: nodes 2, 3, 9, 10, 11, 12
- Sheep 8: nodes 13, 14, 34, 35, 36, 37
- Brick 8: nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
- Brick 9: nodes 17, 18, 39, 40, 41, 42
- Sheep 9: nodes 1, 2, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Wood 5: nodes 6, 7, 23, 24, 52, 53 and nodes 0, 1, 6, 20, 22, 23

## Evaluating Specific High-Value Nodes

Let me examine the intersections that provide access to multiple good resources:

### Node 1:
- Access to: Brick 8, Sheep 9, Wood 5
- Resource diversity: 3 different resources
- Total pip count: 5+5+5 = 15 pips
- Strong ore/wheat access in follow-up settlements: No immediate ore/wheat

### Node 2:
- Access to: Brick 8, Sheep 6, Sheep 9
- Resource diversity: 2 different resources
- Total pip count: 5+5+5 = 15 pips
- Duplication of sheep resources is suboptimal

### Node 3:
- Access to: Brick 8, Sheep 6, Wheat 11
- Resource diversity: 3 different resources
- Total pip count: 5+5+2 = 12 pips
- Good diversity but lower probability on wheat

### Node 10:
- Access to: Ore 6, Sheep 6, Ore 3
- Resource diversity: 2 different resources
- Total pip count: 5+5+2 = 12 pips
- Duplication of ore is suboptimal

### Node 11:
- Access to: Ore 6, Sheep 6, Wood 11
- Resource diversity: 3 different resources
- Total pip count: 5+5+2 = 12 pips
- Good diversity but Wood on 11 is low probability

## Best Candidates

After analyzing all intersections, my top candidates are:

1. **Node 4** - Connects to Brick 8 (5 pips), Wheat 11 (2 pips), Wheat 10 (3 pips) = 10 pips with 2 resources
2. **Node 13** - Connects to Sheep 8 (5 pips), Wood 11 (2 pips), Wheat 11 (2 pips) = 9 pips with 3 resources
3. **Node 9** - Connects to Sheep 6 (5 pips), Sheep 9 (5 pips), Ore 3 (2 pips) = 12 pips with 2 resources

## Final Decision

For my initial settlement, I'll choose **Node 4** because:
1. It provides access to two crucial resources - Brick and Wheat
2. Wheat is essential for both settlements and cities
3. Brick is essential for early road building
4. The location has good total probability (10 pips)
5. It's positioned well for expansion toward other valuable resources
6. For my second settlement, I can target a location with Wood, Sheep and Ore to complete my resource diversity

<plan>
1. Place first settlement at Node 4 to secure Brick and Wheat
2. Plan second settlement to secure Wood, Sheep, and ideally Ore
3. Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots
4. Early game: Build 1-2 additional settlements to secure missing resources
5. Mid-game: Focus on upgrading to cities
</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Target hexes with HIGH probability numbers (6,8,5,9) - prioritize these above all else
- Go for resource DIVERSITY: secure ALL five resources between your two settlements
- Focus on ORE and WHEAT for city upgrades (numbers 5-9 preferred)
- Evaluate each potential settlement by its TOTAL PIP COUNT (sum of probability dots)
- Place your initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Avoid placing both settlements near the same resources - diversify your income!
- Always consider 3:1 ports if your initial placement gives you limited access to certain resources
- Place roads in directions that block opponents' expansion routes

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT & CITY BUILDING PRIORITY:
- FIRST PRIORITY: Build 1-2 additional settlements early to secure critical resources you lack
- SECOND PRIORITY: Upgrade to cities as quickly as possible to double resource production
- THIRD PRIORITY: Build roads only when they lead directly to valuable settlement locations
- Early game (1-5 turns): Secure key settlements at high-value locations
- Mid-game (6-15 turns): Focus heavily on upgrading to cities (2-3 cities should be your target)
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road
- When short on a key resource, use 2:1 ports if available before using 3:1 or 4:1 ports
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat to other players unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- If you have excess of a resource, use ports rather than trading with opponents

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards primarily when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber OR to reach Largest Army (3+ knights)
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city or settlement build
- Use Monopoly cards after high-probability dice rolls to collect maximum resources
- Keep track of how many VP cards you've drawn (5 in the deck total)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn
- When development cards are your path to victory, aim for: 3 cities (6 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 victory cards (2 VP)
- Consider buying development cards when you have limited build options (blocked roads, etc.)

OPTIMAL EXPANSION PATH:
- Build roads with PURPOSE - every road should lead to a viable settlement location
- Identify and secure "bottleneck" positions that cut off opponents' expansion
- Expand toward resources you LACK from initial placement - seek balance
- When choosing between multiple settlement spots, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (total pip count)
  2. Access to resources you currently lack
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, securing future expansion)
  4. Proximity to useful ports
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Longest road (2 VP) requires strategic planning - only pursue if you already have 4+ roads built

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- When someone has 8+ points, ALWAYS target them with the robber regardless of other factors
- If you're being targeted by the robber, consider using knight cards immediately to protect production

TURN-BY-TURN PLANNING:
1. Start each turn by assessing your current VP and opponents' VPs (both visible and potential hidden points)
2. Identify your build priority for this turn: settlement, city, road, or development card?
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for your priority build
4. If you can't build your priority item, determine if trading or buying a development card is better
5. Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card or trade for needed resources
6. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

WINNING PATHS:
1. CITY-FOCUSED PATH: 3-4 cities (6-8 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 9-11 VP
2. BALANCED PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 VP card = 10 VP
3. DEVELOPMENT PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP

NEVER SAY NO TO FREE VPs:
- Always account for the 2 VP from longest road and largest army in your plans
- These special cards are EASY to lose if you're not defending them
- Invest in roads/knights to maintain your lead if these VPs are part of your strategy
- Be alert for opponents trying to steal these bonus points

RESPONSE:
# Initial Road Placement Analysis

I need to decide where to place my first road during the initial setup phase. This is a critical decision as it will determine my early expansion options.

Let me analyze my current position first:
- I have my first settlement at Node 4
- This settlement produces Brick (8), Wheat (11), and Wheat (10)
- I need to place a road connecting to this settlement
- I'm still going to place my second settlement, so the road should support my expansion strategy

Let me consider each option:

## Option 0: Build road at edge (4, 15)
This road would extend eastward toward nodes 15, 17, 37, etc. Looking at the resources:
- Node 15 connects to Wheat (10) and Desert hex
- Further expansion would lead toward the Brick (9) hex and the 3:1 general port
- This is heading toward the eastern side of the board

## Option 1: Build road at edge (4, 5)
This road would extend northeast toward nodes 5, 16, etc. Looking at the resources:
- Node 5 connects to Wheat (10) and Wheat (2)
- Further expansion would lead toward the Wheat (2) and Wheat (3) hexes
- This direction offers less resource diversity

## Option 2: Build road at edge (3, 4)
This road would extend west toward nodes 3, 12, etc. Looking at the resources:
- Node 3 connects to Brick (8), Wheat (11), and Sheep (6)
- Further expansion would lead toward the Sheep (6), Sheep (9) areas
- This leads toward the center of the board where the Wood and Sheep resources are located
- Eventually could reach toward the 2:1 Wood port

For my initial road placement, I want to:
1. Move toward areas with resources I don't yet have (Wood, Sheep, Ore)
2. Support placing my second settlement in a strong position
3. Set up good future expansion options

<plan>
1. Place first settlement at Node 4 (done) securing Brick and Wheat
2. Build initial road at edge (3, 4) heading west toward Wood and Sheep resources
3. Plan second settlement at a node with Wood, Sheep, and ideally Ore
4. Early game: Build 1-2 additional settlements to secure missing resources
5. Mid-game: Focus on upgrading to cities
</plan>

Option 2 (edge 3, 4) gives the best path toward resource diversity by heading toward Wood and Sheep. This supports my primary goal of securing all five resources between my two settlements.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Target hexes with HIGH probability numbers (6,8,5,9) - prioritize these above all else
- Go for resource DIVERSITY: secure ALL five resources between your two settlements
- Focus on ORE and WHEAT for city upgrades (numbers 5-9 preferred)
- Evaluate each potential settlement by its TOTAL PIP COUNT (sum of probability dots)
- Place your initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Avoid placing both settlements near the same resources - diversify your income!
- Always consider 3:1 ports if your initial placement gives you limited access to certain resources
- Place roads in directions that block opponents' expansion routes

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT & CITY BUILDING PRIORITY:
- FIRST PRIORITY: Build 1-2 additional settlements early to secure critical resources you lack
- SECOND PRIORITY: Upgrade to cities as quickly as possible to double resource production
- THIRD PRIORITY: Build roads only when they lead directly to valuable settlement locations
- Early game (1-5 turns): Secure key settlements at high-value locations
- Mid-game (6-15 turns): Focus heavily on upgrading to cities (2-3 cities should be your target)
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road
- When short on a key resource, use 2:1 ports if available before using 3:1 or 4:1 ports
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat to other players unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- If you have excess of a resource, use ports rather than trading with opponents

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards primarily when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber OR to reach Largest Army (3+ knights)
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city or settlement build
- Use Monopoly cards after high-probability dice rolls to collect maximum resources
- Keep track of how many VP cards you've drawn (5 in the deck total)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn
- When development cards are your path to victory, aim for: 3 cities (6 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 victory cards (2 VP)
- Consider buying development cards when you have limited build options (blocked roads, etc.)

OPTIMAL EXPANSION PATH:
- Build roads with PURPOSE - every road should lead to a viable settlement location
- Identify and secure "bottleneck" positions that cut off opponents' expansion
- Expand toward resources you LACK from initial placement - seek balance
- When choosing between multiple settlement spots, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (total pip count)
  2. Access to resources you currently lack
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, securing future expansion)
  4. Proximity to useful ports
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Longest road (2 VP) requires strategic planning - only pursue if you already have 4+ roads built

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- When someone has 8+ points, ALWAYS target them with the robber regardless of other factors
- If you're being targeted by the robber, consider using knight cards immediately to protect production

TURN-BY-TURN PLANNING:
1. Start each turn by assessing your current VP and opponents' VPs (both visible and potential hidden points)
2. Identify your build priority for this turn: settlement, city, road, or development card?
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for your priority build
4. If you can't build your priority item, determine if trading or buying a development card is better
5. Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card or trade for needed resources
6. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

WINNING PATHS:
1. CITY-FOCUSED PATH: 3-4 cities (6-8 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 9-11 VP
2. BALANCED PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 VP card = 10 VP
3. DEVELOPMENT PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP

NEVER SAY NO TO FREE VPs:
- Always account for the 2 VP from longest road and largest army in your plans
- These special cards are EASY to lose if you're not defending them
- Invest in roads/knights to maintain your lead if these VPs are part of your strategy
- Be alert for opponents trying to steal these bonus points

# Analyzing Initial Settlement Placement

I need to place my second initial settlement to complete my starting position. This is a critical decision that will shape my entire game strategy.

Let me analyze the key factors:

## Resource Considerations
- My first settlement at node 4 already gives me access to Brick (8) and Wheat (11, 10)
- I need to prioritize missing resources: Wood, Sheep, and Ore
- I should aim for high probability numbers (6, 8, 5, 9)

## Settlement Quality Analysis
Let me evaluate some of the most promising nodes:

### Node 13: 
- Resources: Wood (11), Sheep (8), Ore (6)
- Probability: 11 (⭐), 8 (⭐⭐⭐), 6 (⭐⭐⭐)
- Total pips: 7
- Gives me all 3 missing resources with two high-probability numbers
- Close to Wood port (32, 33)

### Node 23:
- Resources: Wood (5, 4, 5)
- Probability: 5 (⭐⭐), 4 (⭐), 5 (⭐⭐)
- Total pips: 5
- Too many Wood hexes, doesn't provide Sheep or Ore

### Node 40:
- Resources: Brick (9, 12)
- Probability: 9 (⭐⭐), 12 (⭐)
- Total pips: 3
- Only gives Brick which I already have
- Has a Sheep port, but doesn't include critical resources I need

### Node 17:
- Resources: Desert, Wheat (10), Brick (9)  
- Probability: 0, 10 (⭐), 9 (⭐⭐)
- Total pips: 3
- Desert hex gives no resources
- Only adds Brick which I already have

## Strategic Positioning
- Node 13 is on the opposite side of the board from my first settlement
- Places me near a Wood port which could be valuable
- Gives access to all three resources I'm missing (Wood, Sheep, Ore)
- High probability numbers on Sheep (8) and Ore (6)

<plan>
1. Place second initial settlement at Node 13 to secure Wood, Sheep, and Ore
2. Early game: Build 1-2 additional settlements to strengthen resource production
3. Mid-game: Focus on upgrading to cities, especially at Node 4 and Node 13
4. Consider expanding toward useful ports, especially the 2:1 ports
5. Watch for development card opportunities when I have excess sheep/wheat/ore
</plan>

Node 13 is clearly the optimal choice as it:
1. Gives me all 5 resources between my two settlements
2. Has high probability numbers (6 and 8)
3. Positions me on opposite sides of the board for expansion options
4. Provides access to a 2:1 Wood port

PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Target hexes with HIGH probability numbers (6,8,5,9) - prioritize these above all else
- Go for resource DIVERSITY: secure ALL five resources between your two settlements
- Focus on ORE and WHEAT for city upgrades (numbers 5-9 preferred)
- Evaluate each potential settlement by its TOTAL PIP COUNT (sum of probability dots)
- Place your initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Avoid placing both settlements near the same resources - diversify your income!
- Always consider 3:1 ports if your initial placement gives you limited access to certain resources
- Place roads in directions that block opponents' expansion routes

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT & CITY BUILDING PRIORITY:
- FIRST PRIORITY: Build 1-2 additional settlements early to secure critical resources you lack
- SECOND PRIORITY: Upgrade to cities as quickly as possible to double resource production
- THIRD PRIORITY: Build roads only when they lead directly to valuable settlement locations
- Early game (1-5 turns): Secure key settlements at high-value locations
- Mid-game (6-15 turns): Focus heavily on upgrading to cities (2-3 cities should be your target)
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road
- When short on a key resource, use 2:1 ports if available before using 3:1 or 4:1 ports
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat to other players unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- If you have excess of a resource, use ports rather than trading with opponents

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards primarily when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber OR to reach Largest Army (3+ knights)
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city or settlement build
- Use Monopoly cards after high-probability dice rolls to collect maximum resources
- Keep track of how many VP cards you've drawn (5 in the deck total)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn
- When development cards are your path to victory, aim for: 3 cities (6 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 victory cards (2 VP)
- Consider buying development cards when you have limited build options (blocked roads, etc.)

OPTIMAL EXPANSION PATH:
- Build roads with PURPOSE - every road should lead to a viable settlement location
- Identify and secure "bottleneck" positions that cut off opponents' expansion
- Expand toward resources you LACK from initial placement - seek balance
- When choosing between multiple settlement spots, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (total pip count)
  2. Access to resources you currently lack
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, securing future expansion)
  4. Proximity to useful ports
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Longest road (2 VP) requires strategic planning - only pursue if you already have 4+ roads built

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- When someone has 8+ points, ALWAYS target them with the robber regardless of other factors
- If you're being targeted by the robber, consider using knight cards immediately to protect production

TURN-BY-TURN PLANNING:
1. Start each turn by assessing your current VP and opponents' VPs (both visible and potential hidden points)
2. Identify your build priority for this turn: settlement, city, road, or development card?
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for your priority build
4. If you can't build your priority item, determine if trading or buying a development card is better
5. Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card or trade for needed resources
6. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

WINNING PATHS:
1. CITY-FOCUSED PATH: 3-4 cities (6-8 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 9-11 VP
2. BALANCED PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 VP card = 10 VP
3. DEVELOPMENT PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP

NEVER SAY NO TO FREE VPs:
- Always account for the 2 VP from longest road and largest army in your plans
- These special cards are EASY to lose if you're not defending them
- Invest in roads/knights to maintain your lead if these VPs are part of your strategy
- Be alert for opponents trying to steal these bonus points

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 2 | Player: BLUE | Action: BUILD_INITIAL_ROAD

4. Consider expanding toward useful ports, especially the 2:1 ports
5. Watch for development card opportunities when I have excess sheep/wheat/ore

# Analyzing Build Road Options for Initial Settlement

I need to carefully consider where to place my initial road from my settlement at Node 13, which gives me Wood, Sheep, and Wheat production.

## Analyzing the Options

### Option [0]: Build road at edge (13, 14)
- Direction: This goes toward node 14, which connects to nodes 34, 35, 36, and 37
- Resource potential: Node 14 connects to the Sheep 8 hex and is adjacent to other nodes connecting to the Desert hex
- Expansion: This path could lead toward the 2:1 Brick port (nodes 35, 36)

### Option [1]: Build road at edge (12, 13)
- Direction: This goes toward node 12, which connects to nodes 2, 3, 9, 10, and 11
- Resource potential: Node 12 connects to Sheep 6 and Wheat 11 hexes
- Expansion: This path moves toward the center of the board where there are more high-value intersections and potentially toward the Wheat port

### Option [2]: Build road at edge (13, 34)
- Direction: This goes toward node 34, which connects to nodes 11, 32, and 33
- Resource potential: Node 34 connects to the Wood 11 hex
- Expansion: This path moves toward the 2:1 Wood port (nodes 32, 33)

## Strategic Considerations

Looking at my current resources and expansion goals:
- I need to focus on Brick and Ore - my settlements produce Wood, Wheat, and Sheep but not Brick or Ore
- Building toward a valuable future settlement location is critical
- I should avoid building in a direction that will be easily blocked by opponents

## Decision

Option [1] (edge 12, 13) offers the best strategic value because:
1. It opens expansion toward the center of the board where there are more high-value intersections
2. It provides access to multiple potential settlement spots with good resource diversity
3. It moves toward areas with both Ore and Brick hexes which I'm currently lacking
4. It allows me to potentially expand toward the 2:1 Wheat port

<plan>
1. Build initial road toward the center of the board via edge (12, 13)
2. Focus on securing a settlement with Brick and/or Ore production
3. Then prioritize upgrading my settlement at Node 4 to a city (has excellent Brick production)
4. Continue expanding toward valuable ports while maintaining resource diversity
5. Mid-game goal will be to have 2-3 cities with balanced resource production

# Game Analysis for Settlers of Catan - Turn 20

I'll analyze the current game state, my resources, and evaluate the optimal action.

## Current Situation
- I have 2 settlements (nodes 4 and 13)
- My resources: 1 Wood, 1 Brick, 1 Sheep, 3 Wheat
- Victory points: 2/10
- Red has 2 settlements, 4 roads (longest: 2), and 8 hidden cards

## Resource Analysis
My settlements produce:
- Node 4: Brick (8), Wheat (11), Wheat (10)
- Node 13: Wheat (11), Wood (11), Sheep (8)

I have good Wheat production, decent Sheep, some Brick, limited Wood, and no Ore production.

## Action Options
I can:
- End my turn (Action 0)
- Build a road in various directions (Actions 1-7)

I don't have resources for settlements, cities, or development cards.

## Road Analysis
Let me evaluate each road option:
1. Edge (13, 14): Expands toward node 14 (connects to Sheep 8, Wood 11, Desert)
2. Edge (2, 3): Expands toward center, could block Red
3. Edge (4, 15): Expands toward Wheat production and potential port access
4. Edge (4, 5): Heads toward center from node 4
5. Edge (11, 12): Not directly connected to my existing network
6. Edge (3, 12): Not directly connected to my existing network
7. Edge (13, 34): Expands toward the Wood port (nodes 32, 33)

## Strategic Considerations
1. I need to secure Ore production for city upgrades
2. I should expand toward resources I lack
3. I need to increase my road count to compete for Longest Road
4. Port access would help with resource conversion

Looking at the board, road option #1 (edge 13, 14) moves me toward node 37, which could give me access to the Desert/Sheep/Wood intersection, and eventually toward the 3:1 general port.

Road option #7 (edge 13, 34) moves me toward the Wood port which would be valuable since I have limited Wood production, and could also lead to node 36 which borders the Brick port.

## Decision
Option #7 (edge 13, 34) provides the best strategic value. It:
1. Moves me toward the Wood 2:1 port, which addresses my Wood scarcity
2. Sets up future expansion to potentially block Red
3. Could lead to the Brick port later
4. Increases my road count toward Longest Road

<plan>
1. Build road toward Wood port via edge (13, 34)
2. Continue expanding to secure the Wood port access
3. Work toward settlement at node 34 (Wood/Sheep/Wood intersection)
4. Focus on getting Ore production through new settlements
5. Once resources allow, upgrade settlements to cities
6. Consider challenging for Longest Road as roads extend
</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Target hexes with HIGH probability numbers (6,8,5,9) - prioritize these above all else
- Go for resource DIVERSITY: secure ALL five resources between your two settlements
- Focus on ORE and WHEAT for city upgrades (numbers 5-9 preferred)
- Evaluate each potential settlement by its TOTAL PIP COUNT (sum of probability dots)
- Place your initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Avoid placing both settlements near the same resources - diversify your income!
- Always consider 3:1 ports if your initial placement gives you limited access to certain resources
- Place roads in directions that block opponents' expansion routes

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT & CITY BUILDING PRIORITY:
- FIRST PRIORITY: Build 1-2 additional settlements early to secure critical resources you lack
- SECOND PRIORITY: Upgrade to cities as quickly as possible to double resource production
- THIRD PRIORITY: Build roads only when they lead directly to valuable settlement locations
- Early game (1-5 turns): Secure key settlements at high-value locations
- Mid-game (6-15 turns): Focus heavily on upgrading to cities (2-3 cities should be your target)
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road
- When short on a key resource, use 2:1 ports if available before using 3:1 or 4:1 ports
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat to other players unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- If you have excess of a resource, use ports rather than trading with opponents

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards primarily when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber OR to reach Largest Army (3+ knights)
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city or settlement build
- Use Monopoly cards after high-probability dice rolls to collect maximum resources
- Keep track of how many VP cards you've drawn (5 in the deck total)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn
- When development cards are your path to victory, aim for: 3 cities (6 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 victory cards (2 VP)
- Consider buying development cards when you have limited build options (blocked roads, etc.)

OPTIMAL EXPANSION PATH:
- Build roads with PURPOSE - every road should lead to a viable settlement location
- Identify and secure "bottleneck" positions that cut off opponents' expansion
- Expand toward resources you LACK from initial placement - seek balance
- When choosing between multiple settlement spots, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (total pip count)
  2. Access to resources you currently lack
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, securing future expansion)
  4. Proximity to useful ports
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Longest road (2 VP) requires strategic planning - only pursue if you already have 4+ roads built

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- When someone has 8+ points, ALWAYS target them with the robber regardless of other factors
- If you're being targeted by the robber, consider using knight cards immediately to protect production

TURN-BY-TURN PLANNING:
1. Start each turn by assessing your current VP and opponents' VPs (both visible and potential hidden points)
2. Identify your build priority for this turn: settlement, city, road, or development card?
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for your priority build
4. If you can't build your priority item, determine if trading or buying a development card is better
5. Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card or trade for needed resources
6. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

WINNING PATHS:
1. CITY-FOCUSED PATH: 3-4 cities (6-8 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 9-11 VP
2. BALANCED PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 VP card = 10 VP
3. DEVELOPMENT PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP

NEVER SAY NO TO FREE VPs:
- Always account for the 2 VP from longest road and largest army in your plans
- These special cards are EASY to lose if you're not defending them
- Invest in roads/knights to maintain your lead if these VPs are part of your strategy
- Be alert for opponents trying to steal these bonus points

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 22 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Build road toward Wood port via edge (13, 34)
2. Continue expanding to secure the Wood port access
3. Work toward settlement at node 34 (Wood/Sheep/Wood intersection)
4. Focus on getting Ore production through new settlements
5. Once resources allow, upgrade settlements to cities
6. Consider challenging for Longest Road as roads extend

# Game State Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state and available options:

## Current Resources
- 1 WOOD, 1 BRICK, 2 SHEEP, 5 WHEAT
- I can build a road (costs 1 WOOD, 1 BRICK)
- I have settlements at nodes 4 and 13, producing BRICK, WHEAT, and SHEEP

## Victory Point Situation
- I have 2 VP (from 2 settlements)
- Red also has 2 VP (from 2 settlements)
- No one has Longest Road or Largest Army yet

## Expansion Options
Looking at my current road network:
- From node 13, I can expand via road (13, 14) toward the sheep hex and brick port
- From node 34, I can expand via road (34, 35) toward the brick port
- Other options connect to existing settlements or move toward less valuable areas

## Current Plan Review
My current plan involves building toward the Wood port via edge (13, 34), but I see that road is already built. Next step was to continue toward the Wood port and eventually place a settlement at node 34.

## Strategic Analysis

The most critical needs right now:
1. ORE production (I have none)
2. Additional settlements to increase resource production
3. Working toward either Longest Road or upgrading to cities

Since I have exactly the resources to build a road, I should place it strategically to advance my position. My options:

- Option 2 (Road at edge 34, 35): This continues my planned expansion toward the brick port and follows my current plan
- Option 1 (Road at edge 13, 14): This moves toward the sheep hex (8) and potentially the brick port

<plan>
1. Build road at edge (34, 35) to continue expansion toward the Brick port
2. Focus on getting resources for a settlement at node 35 (Sheep hex + Brick port)
3. Continue working toward better Ore production through new settlements
4. Once I have sufficient Ore production, focus on city upgrades
5. Consider development cards to supplement my strategy if expansion is limited
</plan>

I'll place my road at edge (34, 35) to continue my expansion toward valuable resources and maintain the possibility of reaching the brick port.

# Game Analysis

Let me analyze my current game state carefully:

## Victory Points
- Currently at 2 VPs (2 settlements)
- Need to reach 10 VPs to win

## Resources
- Have: 2 sheep, 5 wheat
- Lacking: wood, brick, ore

## Board Position
- Settlements at node 4 and 13
- Roads built in a path toward the brick port (at nodes 35-36)
- Already have road at (34, 35) - meaning my plan to build that road has been completed

## Production
- Node 4: Brick (8 ⭐⭐⭐), Wheat (11 ⭐), Wheat (10 ⭐) - good brick and wheat production
- Node 13: Wheat (11 ⭐), Wood (11 ⭐), Sheep (8 ⭐⭐⭐) - decent sheep and supplemental wheat/wood

## Available Actions
- End turn
- Trade 4 wheat for other resources

## Strategic Assessment

I need to evaluate what actions would best help me work toward my victory points:

1. My current plan was to build a road at edge (34, 35) and then work toward a settlement at node 35 (which would give me access to the brick port and sheep production), but I've already completed the road.

2. To build a settlement at node 35, I would need 1 wood, 1 brick, 1 sheep, 1 wheat. I have the sheep and wheat already, but need wood and brick.

3. I currently lack both wood and brick to build the settlement. I could trade 4 wheat for either wood or brick to make progress toward my goal.

4. I have 5 wheat, so I could make one trade and still have 1 wheat left.

5. Looking at my current production, I have brick production (8) but limited wood production (11). It would make more sense to trade for wood since I'm more likely to roll for brick than wood based on my settlements.

<plan>
1. Trade 4 wheat for 1 wood to progress toward building a settlement at node 35
2. Next turn, focus on collecting the brick needed for the settlement
3. Place settlement at node 35 to gain access to the 2:1 brick port
4. After securing node 35, look to expand toward ore production
5. Begin city upgrades once I have reliable ore access
</plan>

Given my analysis, I should trade 4 wheat for 1 wood to progress toward my settlement at node 35.

PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Target hexes with HIGH probability numbers (6,8,5,9) - prioritize these above all else
- Go for resource DIVERSITY: secure ALL five resources between your two settlements
- Focus on ORE and WHEAT for city upgrades (numbers 5-9 preferred)
- Evaluate each potential settlement by its TOTAL PIP COUNT (sum of probability dots)
- Place your initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Avoid placing both settlements near the same resources - diversify your income!
- Always consider 3:1 ports if your initial placement gives you limited access to certain resources
- Place roads in directions that block opponents' expansion routes

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT & CITY BUILDING PRIORITY:
- FIRST PRIORITY: Build 1-2 additional settlements early to secure critical resources you lack
- SECOND PRIORITY: Upgrade to cities as quickly as possible to double resource production
- THIRD PRIORITY: Build roads only when they lead directly to valuable settlement locations
- Early game (1-5 turns): Secure key settlements at high-value locations
- Mid-game (6-15 turns): Focus heavily on upgrading to cities (2-3 cities should be your target)
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road
- When short on a key resource, use 2:1 ports if available before using 3:1 or 4:1 ports
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat to other players unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- If you have excess of a resource, use ports rather than trading with opponents

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards primarily when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber OR to reach Largest Army (3+ knights)
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city or settlement build
- Use Monopoly cards after high-probability dice rolls to collect maximum resources
- Keep track of how many VP cards you've drawn (5 in the deck total)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn
- When development cards are your path to victory, aim for: 3 cities (6 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 victory cards (2 VP)
- Consider buying development cards when you have limited build options (blocked roads, etc.)

OPTIMAL EXPANSION PATH:
- Build roads with PURPOSE - every road should lead to a viable settlement location
- Identify and secure "bottleneck" positions that cut off opponents' expansion
- Expand toward resources you LACK from initial placement - seek balance
- When choosing between multiple settlement spots, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (total pip count)
  2. Access to resources you currently lack
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, securing future expansion)
  4. Proximity to useful ports
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Longest road (2 VP) requires strategic planning - only pursue if you already have 4+ roads built

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- When someone has 8+ points, ALWAYS target them with the robber regardless of other factors
- If you're being targeted by the robber, consider using knight cards immediately to protect production

TURN-BY-TURN PLANNING:
1. Start each turn by assessing your current VP and opponents' VPs (both visible and potential hidden points)
2. Identify your build priority for this turn: settlement, city, road, or development card?
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for your priority build
4. If you can't build your priority item, determine if trading or buying a development card is better
5. Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card or trade for needed resources
6. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

WINNING PATHS:
1. CITY-FOCUSED PATH: 3-4 cities (6-8 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 9-11 VP
2. BALANCED PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 VP card = 10 VP
3. DEVELOPMENT PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP

NEVER SAY NO TO FREE VPs:
- Always account for the 2 VP from longest road and largest army in your plans
- These special cards are EASY to lose if you're not defending them
- Invest in roads/knights to maintain your lead if these VPs are part of your strategy
- Be alert for opponents trying to steal these bonus points

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 24 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Trade 4 wheat for 1 wood to progress toward building a settlement at node 35
2. Next turn, focus on collecting the brick needed for the settlement
3. Place settlement at node 35 to gain access to the 2:1 brick port
4. After securing node 35, look to expand toward ore production
5. Begin city upgrades once I have reliable ore access

# Game State Analysis

Let me analyze my position in this game of Settlers of Catan:

## Current Resources
- 1 Wood
- 1 Brick
- 2 Sheep
- 1 Wheat

## Victory Points
- I have 2 VP from 2 settlements
- Red also has 2 VP from 2 settlements

## Strategic Position
- I have settlements at nodes 4 and 13
- Node 4 produces brick (8), wheat (11), and wheat (10)
- Node 13 produces wheat (11), wood (11), and sheep (8) 
- I've built roads toward node 35, which is part of a 2:1 brick port

## Analyzing Available Options

**Option 0: End Turn**
- I have enough resources for some actions, so ending my turn would waste an opportunity.

**Options 1-8: Build a Road**
- I have exactly enough resources (1 wood, 1 brick) to build a road
- Road at (35, 36) would continue toward the brick port
- Other roads would expand in different directions

**Option 9: Build a Settlement at node 35**
- Costs 1 wood, 1 brick, 1 wheat, 1 sheep
- I have these resources, so I can build this settlement
- This would give me access to the 2:1 brick port and sheep (8) production
- This would increase my VP count to 3/10

## Decision Analysis

Building the settlement at node 35 is clearly the optimal choice because:
1. It immediately gives me +1 VP (from 2 to 3)
2. It gives me access to the 2:1 brick port, which will help trade excess brick for other resources
3. It gives me access to sheep (8) production, which is a high-probability number
4. It strengthens my position on that side of the board

Building a road instead would delay the settlement by at least one turn, with no guarantee I'll have the right resources next turn.

<plan>
1. Build settlement at node 35 this turn to secure the brick port and sheep (8) production
2. Focus next on collecting resources for a city upgrade at one of my high-production settlements
3. Continue expansion toward ore production since that's my main missing resource
4. Consider buying development cards if I get excess sheep, wheat, and ore
5. Aim for 3 cities (6VP) + 2 settlements (2VP) + either largest army or a VP card
</plan>

Looking at my options, the most strategic move is to build a settlement at node 35.

TURN 36 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Build settlement at node 35 this turn to secure the brick port and sheep (8) production
2. Focus next on collecting resources for a city upgrade at one of my high-production settlements
3. Continue expansion toward ore production since that's my main missing resource
4. Consider buying development cards if I get excess sheep, wheat, and ore
5. Aim for 3 cities (6VP) + 2 settlements (2VP) + either largest army or a VP card

# Game State Analysis

Let me thoroughly analyze the current game state to determine my best move:

## Current Status
- I have 3 VP from 3 settlements
- RED has 4 VP (2 settlements + longest road)
- My resources: 2 🌲WOOD, 1 🧱BRICK, 1 🐑SHEEP, 1 🌾WHEAT
- I have enough resources to build a road (1 🌲WOOD + 1 🧱BRICK needed)

## Resource Production Assessment
- I have decent wheat production (11, 10)
- I have good sheep production (8, 8) 
- I have good brick production (8)
- I have minimal wood production (11 is low probability)
- I completely lack ore production

## Strategic Options
1. Build a road to expand toward high-value locations
2. End turn and save resources for future builds

Since I have the exact resources needed for a road, and no possibility of building anything else this turn, the decision comes down to optimal road placement.

## Road Placement Options Analysis
- Option 1: Road at (13, 14) - Expands toward the desert and wheat hex
- Option 2: Road at (35, 36) - Expands from my brick port settlement toward ore possibilities
- Option 3: Road at (4, 15) - Expands from my productive settlement toward wheat
- Options 4-8: Other expansions with less strategic value

Looking at the board, road option (35, 36) seems most valuable as:
1. It expands from my newest settlement that has the brick port access
2. It moves in the direction toward potential ore production which I critically lack
3. It helps me work toward potentially building longest road in the future

<plan>
1. Build road at edge (35, 36) to begin expansion toward ore production
2. Next turn aim to continue expansion toward ore and consider city upgrades
3. Leverage the brick port to trade brick efficiently when needed
4. Long-term goal: 3 cities (6VP) + 2 settlements (2VP) + either largest army or VP cards to reach 10 VP
</plan>

Based on this analysis, I'll build a road at edge (35, 36).

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Target hexes with HIGH probability numbers (6,8,5,9) - prioritize these above all else
- Go for resource DIVERSITY: secure ALL five resources between your two settlements
- Focus on ORE and WHEAT for city upgrades (numbers 5-9 preferred)
- Evaluate each potential settlement by its TOTAL PIP COUNT (sum of probability dots)
- Place your initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Avoid placing both settlements near the same resources - diversify your income!
- Always consider 3:1 ports if your initial placement gives you limited access to certain resources
- Place roads in directions that block opponents' expansion routes

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT & CITY BUILDING PRIORITY:
- FIRST PRIORITY: Build 1-2 additional settlements early to secure critical resources you lack
- SECOND PRIORITY: Upgrade to cities as quickly as possible to double resource production
- THIRD PRIORITY: Build roads only when they lead directly to valuable settlement locations
- Early game (1-5 turns): Secure key settlements at high-value locations
- Mid-game (6-15 turns): Focus heavily on upgrading to cities (2-3 cities should be your target)
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road
- When short on a key resource, use 2:1 ports if available before using 3:1 or 4:1 ports
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat to other players unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- If you have excess of a resource, use ports rather than trading with opponents

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards primarily when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber OR to reach Largest Army (3+ knights)
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city or settlement build
- Use Monopoly cards after high-probability dice rolls to collect maximum resources
- Keep track of how many VP cards you've drawn (5 in the deck total)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn
- When development cards are your path to victory, aim for: 3 cities (6 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 victory cards (2 VP)
- Consider buying development cards when you have limited build options (blocked roads, etc.)

OPTIMAL EXPANSION PATH:
- Build roads with PURPOSE - every road should lead to a viable settlement location
- Identify and secure "bottleneck" positions that cut off opponents' expansion
- Expand toward resources you LACK from initial placement - seek balance
- When choosing between multiple settlement spots, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (total pip count)
  2. Access to resources you currently lack
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, securing future expansion)
  4. Proximity to useful ports
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Longest road (2 VP) requires strategic planning - only pursue if you already have 4+ roads built

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- When someone has 8+ points, ALWAYS target them with the robber regardless of other factors
- If you're being targeted by the robber, consider using knight cards immediately to protect production

TURN-BY-TURN PLANNING:
1. Start each turn by assessing your current VP and opponents' VPs (both visible and potential hidden points)
2. Identify your build priority for this turn: settlement, city, road, or development card?
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for your priority build
4. If you can't build your priority item, determine if trading or buying a development card is better
5. Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card or trade for needed resources
6. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

WINNING PATHS:
1. CITY-FOCUSED PATH: 3-4 cities (6-8 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 9-11 VP
2. BALANCED PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 VP card = 10 VP
3. DEVELOPMENT PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP

NEVER SAY NO TO FREE VPs:
- Always account for the 2 VP from longest road and largest army in your plans
- These special cards are EASY to lose if you're not defending them
- Invest in roads/knights to maintain your lead if these VPs are part of your strategy
- Be alert for opponents trying to steal these bonus points

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers

# Robber Placement Analysis

I need to decide where to place the robber to maximize my strategic advantage while minimizing the resources available to my opponent.

## Game State Analysis
- I (BLUE) have 3 VPs with 3 settlements
- RED has 4 VPs (2 from settlements + 2 from longest road)
- RED is ahead with 4 VP vs my 3 VP
- I have limited resources: just 1 wood and 1 sheep
- RED has 4 hidden resource cards

## Robber Strategic Priorities
1. Disrupt RED's resource production on high-value tiles
2. Block resources that RED relies on but I don't need much
3. Target hexes where RED has settlements but I don't
4. Steal a resource from RED that will be useful to me

## Evaluating Key Options

Looking at RED's settlements:
- Node 1: Produces brick(8★★★), sheep(9★★), wood(5★★)
- Node 11: Produces sheep(6★★★), ore(6★★★), wood(11★)

The most valuable target would be high probability resources that RED depends on:
- Option [0] (0,0,0): Brick 8★★★ - Very high probability brick production
- Option [1] (1,-1,0): Sheep 9★★ - Good sheep production
- Option [2] (0,-1,1): Sheep 6★★★ - Very high probability sheep production
- Option [8] (0,-2,2): Ore 6★★★ - Very high probability ore production

Among these, blocking ore production would be most strategic since:
1. Ore is critical for city upgrades
2. RED has access to ore(6) which is a high-probability tile (★★★)
3. I don't currently have access to any ore, so preventing RED from getting it widens my opportunity window

Option [8] targets the ore hex (0,-2,2) with a valuable 6 number, which would significantly hinder RED's ability to upgrade to cities while giving me a chance to catch up on ore acquisition through trades or development.

<plan>
1. Block RED's ore production to slow their city development
2. Continue with road building to edge (35,36) for expansion toward ore production
3. Work toward getting ore and wheat for city upgrades
4. Long-term goal: 3 cities (6VP) + 2 settlements (2VP) + either largest army or VP cards
</plan>

- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn
- When development cards are your path to victory, aim for: 3 cities (6 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 victory cards (2 VP)
- Consider buying development cards when you have limited build options (blocked roads, etc.)

OPTIMAL EXPANSION PATH:
- Build roads with PURPOSE - every road should lead to a viable settlement location
- Identify and secure "bottleneck" positions that cut off opponents' expansion
- Expand toward resources you LACK from initial placement - seek balance
- When choosing between multiple settlement spots, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (total pip count)
  2. Access to resources you currently lack
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, securing future expansion)
  4. Proximity to useful ports
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Longest road (2 VP) requires strategic planning - only pursue if you already have 4+ roads built

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- When someone has 8+ points, ALWAYS target them with the robber regardless of other factors
- If you're being targeted by the robber, consider using knight cards immediately to protect production

TURN-BY-TURN PLANNING:
1. Start each turn by assessing your current VP and opponents' VPs (both visible and potential hidden points)
2. Identify your build priority for this turn: settlement, city, road, or development card?
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for your priority build
4. If you can't build your priority item, determine if trading or buying a development card is better
5. Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card or trade for needed resources
6. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

WINNING PATHS:
1. CITY-FOCUSED PATH: 3-4 cities (6-8 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 9-11 VP
2. BALANCED PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 VP card = 10 VP
3. DEVELOPMENT PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP

NEVER SAY NO TO FREE VPs:
- Always account for the 2 VP from longest road and largest army in your plans
- These special cards are EASY to lose if you're not defending them
- Invest in roads/knights to maintain your lead if these VPs are part of your strategy
- Be alert for opponents trying to steal these bonus points

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Analyzing Robber Placement Options

Let me think through this step-by-step to find the optimal robber placement.

## Current Game Status
- I (BLUE) have 3 VP with 3 settlements
- RED has 4 VP (2 VP from settlements + 2 VP from longest road)
- I have limited resources: just 1 sheep and 1 wheat
- RED has 4 hidden resource cards

## Priority Analysis
Since I'm using the robber, I want to:
1. Block RED's most valuable production
2. Target resources I need but lack access to
3. Maximize the chance of stealing something useful

## Examining RED's Resource Production
RED has settlements at:
- Node 1: Produces brick(8), sheep(9), wood(5)
- Node 11: Produces sheep(6), ore(6), wood(11)

The most valuable tiles for RED are:
- Brick 8 (high probability)
- Ore 6 (high probability and critical for cities)
- Sheep 6 (high probability)
- Sheep 9 (good probability)

## My Resource Needs
Looking at my plan to build cities, I critically need ore. Looking at my current production, I have:
- Good brick production (8)
- Some wheat production (10,11)  
- Some sheep production (8)
- Some wood production (11)
- No ore production

## Best Robber Placements

Option [9] - Move to (0, -2, 2) and steal from RED:
- This is ore 6 with probability ⭐⭐⭐
- Blocks RED's ore production
- Lets me steal from RED
- This is a critical resource for both of us

Option [0] - Move to (0, 0, 0) and steal from RED:
- This is brick 8 with probability ⭐⭐⭐
- Blocks RED's brick production
- Brick is valuable for road building

Option [1] - Move to (1, -1, 0) and steal from RED:
- This is sheep 9 with probability ⭐⭐
- Blocks one of RED's sheep hexes
- Less impactful than blocking ore or brick

## Decision
Option [9] is clearly the best choice. RED's settlement at node 11 produces ore(6), which is:
1. A critical resource for city upgrades (my stated goal)
2. A high-probability hex (6 is one of the best numbers)
3. A resource I completely lack in my production
4. Essential for RED's development as well

By blocking RED's only ore production while also stealing from them, I maximize my strategic advantage. This supports my plan of slowing RED's city development while working toward my own city upgrades.

<plan>
1. Block RED's ore production to slow their city development and try to steal ore
2. Continue road building toward node 36 for expansion 
3. Work toward getting ore through trades or production to build cities
4. Long-term goal: 3 cities (6VP) + 2 settlements (2VP) + either largest army or VP cards
</plan>

\boxed{9}
========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Target hexes with HIGH probability numbers (6,8,5,9) - prioritize these above all else
- Go for resource DIVERSITY: secure ALL five resources between your two settlements
- Focus on ORE and WHEAT for city upgrades (numbers 5-9 preferred)
- Evaluate each potential settlement by its TOTAL PIP COUNT (sum of probability dots)
- Place your initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Avoid placing both settlements near the same resources - diversify your income!
- Always consider 3:1 ports if your initial placement gives you limited access to certain resources
- Place roads in directions that block opponents' expansion routes

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT & CITY BUILDING PRIORITY:
- FIRST PRIORITY: Build 1-2 additional settlements early to secure critical resources you lack
- SECOND PRIORITY: Upgrade to cities as quickly as possible to double resource production
- THIRD PRIORITY: Build roads only when they lead directly to valuable settlement locations
- Early game (1-5 turns): Secure key settlements at high-value locations
- Mid-game (6-15 turns): Focus heavily on upgrading to cities (2-3 cities should be your target)
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road
- When short on a key resource, use 2:1 ports if available before using 3:1 or 4:1 ports
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat to other players unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- If you have excess of a resource, use ports rather than trading with opponents

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards primarily when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber OR to reach Largest Army (3+ knights)
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city or settlement build
- Use Monopoly cards after high-probability dice rolls to collect maximum resources
- Keep track of how many VP cards you've drawn (5 in the deck total)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn
- When development cards are your path to victory, aim for: 3 cities (6 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 victory cards (2 VP)
- Consider buying development cards when you have limited build options (blocked roads, etc.)

OPTIMAL EXPANSION PATH:
- Build roads with PURPOSE - every road should lead to a viable settlement location
- Identify and secure "bottleneck" positions that cut off opponents' expansion
- Expand toward resources you LACK from initial placement - seek balance
- When choosing between multiple settlement spots, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (total pip count)
  2. Access to resources you currently lack
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, securing future expansion)
  4. Proximity to useful ports
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Longest road (2 VP) requires strategic planning - only pursue if you already have 4+ roads built

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- When someone has 8+ points, ALWAYS target them with the robber regardless of other factors
- If you're being targeted by the robber, consider using knight cards immediately to protect production

TURN-BY-TURN PLANNING:
1. Start each turn by assessing your current VP and opponents' VPs (both visible and potential hidden points)
2. Identify your build priority for this turn: settlement, city, road, or development card?
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for your priority build
4. If you can't build your priority item, determine if trading or buying a development card is better
5. Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card or trade for needed resources
6. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

WINNING PATHS:
1. CITY-FOCUSED PATH: 3-4 cities (6-8 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 9-11 VP
2. BALANCED PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 VP card = 10 VP
3. DEVELOPMENT PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP

NEVER SAY NO TO FREE VPs:
- Always account for the 2 VP from longest road and largest army in your plans
- These special cards are EASY to lose if you're not defending them
- Invest in roads/knights to maintain your lead if these VPs are part of your strategy
- Be alert for opponents trying to steal these bonus points

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Block RED's ore production to slow their city development and try to steal ore
2. Continue road building toward node 36 for expansion 
3. Work toward getting ore through trades or production to build cities

# Game Analysis for Turn 46

I'll carefully analyze my current situation and available options to determine the optimal play.

## Current Game State
- I have 3 VP (3 settlements)
- RED has 4 VP (2 settlements + longest road)
- I have 1 sheep, 1 wheat, and 1 ore
- Available actions: End turn or Buy a development card

## Resource Analysis
Looking at my holdings, I have exactly the resources needed to buy a development card: 1 sheep, 1 wheat, and 1 ore.

## Development Card Value Assessment
Development cards offer multiple potential benefits:
- Knight cards (14/25 cards): Allow me to move the robber and steal from opponents
- Victory Point cards (5/25 cards): Secret 1 VP each
- Year of Plenty (2/25 cards): Get any 2 resources
- Monopoly (2/25 cards): Gain all of one resource type from all players
- Road Building (2/25 cards): Place 2 roads for free

With all 25 development cards remaining, my odds of getting each type are:
- Knight: 56% chance
- Victory Point: 20% chance
- Year of Plenty: 8% chance
- Monopoly: 8% chance
- Road Building: 8% chance

## Strategic Considerations

1. **VP Progress**: A VP card would advance me to 4 VP, tying with RED.

2. **Knight Card Value**: Getting a knight would:
   - Let me move the robber from the ore hex (which doesn't affect me)
   - Potentially steal resources from RED
   - Start building toward largest army (2 VP bonus)

3. **Resource Efficiency**: I currently have the exact resources for a development card but not enough for any other builds. If I don't use these resources now, they may be vulnerable to a 7 roll or robber.

4. **Plan Alignment**: My current plan mentions working toward "either largest army or VP cards" which aligns with buying a development card.

5. **Opportunity Cost**: By ending my turn without building, I'm not advancing my position on the board and missing the opportunity to use my current resources effectively.

<plan>
1. Buy development card as a strategic investment toward victory points or knight power
2. Continue expanding toward node 36 with future road builds
3. Focus on gaining ore/wheat production for city upgrades
4. Work toward 3 cities (6VP) + 2 settlements (2VP) + largest army (2VP) or VP cards (1-2 VP)
</plan>

Considering all factors, buying a development card is clearly the optimal move. It gives me a 20% chance at an immediate VP, a 56% chance at a knight to start building toward largest army, and other cards would provide valuable utility. This aligns with my existing plan and makes effective use of my current resources.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Target hexes with HIGH probability numbers (6,8,5,9) - prioritize these above all else
- Go for resource DIVERSITY: secure ALL five resources between your two settlements
- Focus on ORE and WHEAT for city upgrades (numbers 5-9 preferred)
- Evaluate each potential settlement by its TOTAL PIP COUNT (sum of probability dots)
- Place your initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Avoid placing both settlements near the same resources - diversify your income!
- Always consider 3:1 ports if your initial placement gives you limited access to certain resources
- Place roads in directions that block opponents' expansion routes

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT & CITY BUILDING PRIORITY:
- FIRST PRIORITY: Build 1-2 additional settlements early to secure critical resources you lack
- SECOND PRIORITY: Upgrade to cities as quickly as possible to double resource production
- THIRD PRIORITY: Build roads only when they lead directly to valuable settlement locations
- Early game (1-5 turns): Secure key settlements at high-value locations
- Mid-game (6-15 turns): Focus heavily on upgrading to cities (2-3 cities should be your target)
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road
- When short on a key resource, use 2:1 ports if available before using 3:1 or 4:1 ports
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat to other players unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- If you have excess of a resource, use ports rather than trading with opponents

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards primarily when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber OR to reach Largest Army (3+ knights)
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city or settlement build
- Use Monopoly cards after high-probability dice rolls to collect maximum resources
- Keep track of how many VP cards you've drawn (5 in the deck total)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn
- When development cards are your path to victory, aim for: 3 cities (6 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 victory cards (2 VP)
- Consider buying development cards when you have limited build options (blocked roads, etc.)

OPTIMAL EXPANSION PATH:
- Build roads with PURPOSE - every road should lead to a viable settlement location
- Identify and secure "bottleneck" positions that cut off opponents' expansion
- Expand toward resources you LACK from initial placement - seek balance
- When choosing between multiple settlement spots, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (total pip count)
  2. Access to resources you currently lack
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, securing future expansion)
  4. Proximity to useful ports
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Longest road (2 VP) requires strategic planning - only pursue if you already have 4+ roads built

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- When someone has 8+ points, ALWAYS target them with the robber regardless of other factors
- If you're being targeted by the robber, consider using knight cards immediately to protect production

TURN-BY-TURN PLANNING:
1. Start each turn by assessing your current VP and opponents' VPs (both visible and potential hidden points)
2. Identify your build priority for this turn: settlement, city, road, or development card?
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for your priority build
4. If you can't build your priority item, determine if trading or buying a development card is better
5. Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card or trade for needed resources
6. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

WINNING PATHS:
1. CITY-FOCUSED PATH: 3-4 cities (6-8 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 9-11 VP
2. BALANCED PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 VP card = 10 VP
3. DEVELOPMENT PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP

NEVER SAY NO TO FREE VPs:
- Always account for the 2 VP from longest road and largest army in your plans
- These special cards are EASY to lose if you're not defending them
- Invest in roads/knights to maintain your lead if these VPs are part of your strategy
- Be alert for opponents trying to steal these bonus points

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 48 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Buy development card as a strategic investment toward victory points or knight power
2. Continue expanding toward node 36 with future road builds
3. Focus on gaining ore/wheat production for city upgrades
4. Work toward 3 cities (6VP) + 2 settlements (2VP) + largest army (2VP) or VP cards (1-2 VP)
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.
  To adjust your plan, provide a NEW PLAN in your reasoning with <plan>your new plan</plan>

# Game Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state and determine the optimal action.

## Current Game Status
- I have 3 VP (3 settlements)
- Red has 4 VP (2 settlements + longest road bonus)
- I have 1 wheat resource and 1 knight card
- It's the start of my turn - I can either play the knight card or roll the dice

## Knight Card Considerations
If I play the knight card now:
- I can move the robber from (0, -2, 2) to block a high-value resource for Red
- I can steal a card from Red (they have 3 cards)
- This helps toward getting largest army (need 3 knights)
- However, I'll still need to roll for resources this turn, and won't be able to build anything with just 1 wheat + whatever I steal

## Roll Dice Considerations
If I roll the dice:
- I can potentially get more resources based on my settlements
- My settlements produce on: 8 (brick), 11 (wheat/wood), 10 (wheat), 5 (??), and more
- With more resources, I might be able to build something this turn
- I can always play the knight card later in my turn if I choose

## Strategic Decision
The most efficient approach is to roll first to see what resources I get. If I roll a 7, I'll get to move the robber anyway. If I don't roll a 7, I'll get resources first and then can decide whether to play the knight card afterward based on my building options.

<plan>
1. Roll for resources to see what I get
2. If I get enough resources to build something important, prioritize building
3. Consider playing knight card later in my turn if it helps defensively or if I want to steal a critical resource
4. Continue working toward city upgrades (need ore and wheat)
5. Look to expand toward node 36 with future builds
6. Long-term goal: 3 cities (6VP) + 2 settlements (2VP) + largest army (2VP)
</plan>

Since I want to maximize my potential resources this turn, I should roll the dice first and then evaluate my options.

# Robber Placement Analysis

I need to carefully analyze where to move the robber to maximize my strategic advantage and hurt my opponent's production.

## Current Game State Assessment
- I (Blue) have 3 VP with 3 settlements
- Red has 4 VP (2 settlements + longest road)
- Red is ahead by 1 VP and has longer road network
- I have only 1 wheat resource and 1 knight development card
- My 3 settlements produce: brick, wheat, wood, sheep (but no ore)

## Analyzing Robber Placement Options

I need to target hexes that:
1. Disrupt Red's key production
2. Target high-probability numbers (especially 6 and 8)
3. Give me a chance to steal useful resources

Let me analyze Red's settlements:
- Settlement at node 1: produces brick(8), sheep(9), wood(5)
- Settlement at node 11: produces sheep(6), ore(6), wood(11)

Red's best production comes from the 8 (brick) and 6 (sheep and ore) hexes. The ore(6) hex is particularly valuable since I don't have ore production myself.

The most strategic options are:
- [0] Move robber to (0, 0, 0) and steal from RED - This is the 8 brick hex, disrupting a high-probability resource
- [2] Move robber to (0, -1, 1) and steal from RED - This is the 6 sheep hex, disrupting good production
- [9] Move robber to (-1, -1, 2) and steal from RED - This is the 11 wood hex, less optimal as it's lower probability

Option [1] Move robber to (1, -1, 0) and steal from RED - This is the 9 sheep hex, good probability

But most importantly, I should target:
- [0] Move robber to (0, 0, 0) - Blocks the 8 brick hex which has the highest probability among Red's resources
- OR
- [2] Move robber to (0, -1, 1) - Blocks the 6 sheep hex, which is tied for highest probability with the ore hex

Since I need to get ore for city upgrades and Red may have collected some, blocking the 6 sheep hex gives me a good chance to steal ore while disrupting Red's high-probability production.

<plan>
1. Disrupt Red's sheep production by placing the robber on the 6 sheep hex
2. Focus on getting ore and wheat for city upgrades
3. Build toward node 36 to access the brick port
4. Work toward largest army by playing knights strategically
5. Long-term goal: 3 cities (6VP) + 2 settlements (2VP) + largest army (2VP)
</plan>

I choose to move the robber to the 6 sheep hex and steal from Red.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Target hexes with HIGH probability numbers (6,8,5,9) - prioritize these above all else
- Go for resource DIVERSITY: secure ALL five resources between your two settlements
- Focus on ORE and WHEAT for city upgrades (numbers 5-9 preferred)
- Evaluate each potential settlement by its TOTAL PIP COUNT (sum of probability dots)
- Place your initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Avoid placing both settlements near the same resources - diversify your income!
- Always consider 3:1 ports if your initial placement gives you limited access to certain resources
- Place roads in directions that block opponents' expansion routes

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT & CITY BUILDING PRIORITY:
- FIRST PRIORITY: Build 1-2 additional settlements early to secure critical resources you lack
- SECOND PRIORITY: Upgrade to cities as quickly as possible to double resource production
- THIRD PRIORITY: Build roads only when they lead directly to valuable settlement locations
- Early game (1-5 turns): Secure key settlements at high-value locations
- Mid-game (6-15 turns): Focus heavily on upgrading to cities (2-3 cities should be your target)
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road
- When short on a key resource, use 2:1 ports if available before using 3:1 or 4:1 ports
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat to other players unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- If you have excess of a resource, use ports rather than trading with opponents

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards primarily when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber OR to reach Largest Army (3+ knights)
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city or settlement build
- Use Monopoly cards after high-probability dice rolls to collect maximum resources
- Keep track of how many VP cards you've drawn (5 in the deck total)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn
- When development cards are your path to victory, aim for: 3 cities (6 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 victory cards (2 VP)
- Consider buying development cards when you have limited build options (blocked roads, etc.)

OPTIMAL EXPANSION PATH:
- Build roads with PURPOSE - every road should lead to a viable settlement location
- Identify and secure "bottleneck" positions that cut off opponents' expansion
- Expand toward resources you LACK from initial placement - seek balance
- When choosing between multiple settlement spots, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (total pip count)
  2. Access to resources you currently lack
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, securing future expansion)
  4. Proximity to useful ports
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Longest road (2 VP) requires strategic planning - only pursue if you already have 4+ roads built

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- When someone has 8+ points, ALWAYS target them with the robber regardless of other factors
- If you're being targeted by the robber, consider using knight cards immediately to protect production

TURN-BY-TURN PLANNING:
1. Start each turn by assessing your current VP and opponents' VPs (both visible and potential hidden points)
2. Identify your build priority for this turn: settlement, city, road, or development card?
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for your priority build
4. If you can't build your priority item, determine if trading or buying a development card is better
5. Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card or trade for needed resources
6. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

WINNING PATHS:
1. CITY-FOCUSED PATH: 3-4 cities (6-8 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 9-11 VP
2. BALANCED PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 VP card = 10 VP
3. DEVELOPMENT PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP

NEVER SAY NO TO FREE VPs:
- Always account for the 2 VP from longest road and largest army in your plans
- These special cards are EASY to lose if you're not defending them
- Invest in roads/knights to maintain your lead if these VPs are part of your strategy
- Be alert for opponents trying to steal these bonus points

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

RESPONSE:
# Analyzing My Current Game State

I need to carefully evaluate my position and options to determine the optimal action.

## My Current Status:
- 3 Victory Points (3 settlements)
- Resources: 1 wood, 1 wheat
- 1 Knight development card
- Red is ahead at 4 VP (2 settlements + Longest Road)

## Strategic Assessment:
1. **Resources**: I have very limited resources (just 1 wood, 1 wheat)
2. **VP Gap**: Red is ahead by 1 VP and has Longest Road
3. **Development Cards**: I have 1 Knight card which could be valuable
4. **Robber**: Currently on the 6-sheep hex which is connected to Red's settlement

## Option Analysis:

**Option 0: Play Knight Card**
- Advantages:
  - I can move the robber to a more strategic hex
  - I can steal a resource from Red
  - This would be my first played Knight toward Largest Army (need 3)
  - Playing now protects this card from being lost if a 7 is rolled
  - Given my lack of resources, this is a way to make progress this turn
  
- Strategic targets for robber:
  - Hex (0, 0, 0) - Brick-8: This high-value hex produces for both Red and me, but blocking it hurts Red more as I have the brick port
  - Hex (2, -1, -1) - Wood-5: This produces for Red and I'm short on wood

**Option 1: End Turn**
- Advantages:
  - Save Knight card for a potentially more impactful moment
  
- Disadvantages:
  - With only 2 resources, I'm unlikely to build anything meaningful soon
  - I'd be making no progress this turn
  - Knight could be lost if a 7 is rolled on next turn

## Decision Logic:
Given my limited resources and Red's lead, playing the Knight card is clearly the better option. It allows me to:
1. Make progress toward Largest Army (2 VP)
2. Potentially disrupt Red's production
3. Gain an additional resource through stealing
4. Make meaningful progress in a turn where I otherwise couldn't build

<plan>
1. Play Knight card to move robber to brick-8 hex to disrupt both Red and my production, but Red loses more
2. Steal a resource from Red
3. Work toward Largest Army (need 2 more Knights)
4. Next priorities: Get resources for another Knight card or settlement
5. Long-term: City upgrades + Largest Army for victory
</plan>

I choose to play my Knight card rather than end my turn with no progress.

# Analyzing Robber Move Options

I need to analyze where to place the robber to maximize disruption to my opponent while minimizing impact on myself.

## Game State Analysis
- I'm at 3 VPs with 3 settlements
- Red is at 4 VPs (2 from settlements + 2 from Longest Road)
- Red has the advantage with Longest Road (5 segments vs my 4)
- I've played 1 knight and should work toward Largest Army (need 2 more)

## Resource Evaluation
My main settlements produce:
- Node 4: 🧱8, 🌾11, 🌾10
- Node 13: 🌾11, 🌲11, 🐑8
- Node 35: 🐑8

Red's settlements produce:
- Node 1: 🧱8, 🐑9, 🌲5
- Node 11: 🐑6, ⛏️6, 🌲11

## Optimal Robber Placement

Let me evaluate the best options by considering:
1. Disruption to Red's resource production
2. Minimal impact on my own production
3. High probability numbers (better targeting)

Key options:
- [0] Move robber to 🧱8 (brick-8): Blocks a critical 8 (high probability) that Red uses but I also need
- [8] Move robber to ⛏️6 (ore-6): Blocks a high-value 6 that only Red has access to
- [9] Move robber to 🌲11 (wood-11): Blocks a resource we both use, but not optimal
- [1] Move robber to 🐑9 (sheep-9): Blocks Red's sheep but moderate priority

Looking at these options, option [8] targeting ⛏️6 is optimal because:
1. It blocks a high probability number (6 = 5 dots)
2. It targets ore which is critical for city upgrades (Red could be saving for this)
3. I don't currently have ore access, so it doesn't hurt my production
4. I can steal a resource from Red

<plan>
1. Move robber to ore-6 hex to block Red's ore production
2. Steal a resource from Red (hoping for ore or brick)
3. Work toward Largest Army (need 2 more Knights)
4. Save resources for development cards or settlements
5. Long-term: City upgrades + Largest Army for victory
</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Target hexes with HIGH probability numbers (6,8,5,9) - prioritize these above all else
- Go for resource DIVERSITY: secure ALL five resources between your two settlements
- Focus on ORE and WHEAT for city upgrades (numbers 5-9 preferred)
- Evaluate each potential settlement by its TOTAL PIP COUNT (sum of probability dots)
- Place your initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Avoid placing both settlements near the same resources - diversify your income!
- Always consider 3:1 ports if your initial placement gives you limited access to certain resources
- Place roads in directions that block opponents' expansion routes

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT & CITY BUILDING PRIORITY:
- FIRST PRIORITY: Build 1-2 additional settlements early to secure critical resources you lack
- SECOND PRIORITY: Upgrade to cities as quickly as possible to double resource production
- THIRD PRIORITY: Build roads only when they lead directly to valuable settlement locations
- Early game (1-5 turns): Secure key settlements at high-value locations
- Mid-game (6-15 turns): Focus heavily on upgrading to cities (2-3 cities should be your target)
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road
- When short on a key resource, use 2:1 ports if available before using 3:1 or 4:1 ports
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat to other players unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- If you have excess of a resource, use ports rather than trading with opponents

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards primarily when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber OR to reach Largest Army (3+ knights)
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city or settlement build
- Use Monopoly cards after high-probability dice rolls to collect maximum resources
- Keep track of how many VP cards you've drawn (5 in the deck total)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn
- When development cards are your path to victory, aim for: 3 cities (6 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 victory cards (2 VP)
- Consider buying development cards when you have limited build options (blocked roads, etc.)

OPTIMAL EXPANSION PATH:
- Build roads with PURPOSE - every road should lead to a viable settlement location
- Identify and secure "bottleneck" positions that cut off opponents' expansion
- Expand toward resources you LACK from initial placement - seek balance
- When choosing between multiple settlement spots, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (total pip count)
  2. Access to resources you currently lack
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, securing future expansion)
  4. Proximity to useful ports
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Longest road (2 VP) requires strategic planning - only pursue if you already have 4+ roads built

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- When someone has 8+ points, ALWAYS target them with the robber regardless of other factors
- If you're being targeted by the robber, consider using knight cards immediately to protect production

TURN-BY-TURN PLANNING:
1. Start each turn by assessing your current VP and opponents' VPs (both visible and potential hidden points)
2. Identify your build priority for this turn: settlement, city, road, or development card?
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for your priority build
4. If you can't build your priority item, determine if trading or buying a development card is better
5. Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card or trade for needed resources
6. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

WINNING PATHS:
1. CITY-FOCUSED PATH: 3-4 cities (6-8 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 9-11 VP
2. BALANCED PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 VP card = 10 VP
3. DEVELOPMENT PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP

NEVER SAY NO TO FREE VPs:
- Always account for the 2 VP from longest road and largest army in your plans
- These special cards are EASY to lose if you're not defending them
- Invest in roads/knights to maintain your lead if these VPs are part of your strategy
- Be alert for opponents trying to steal these bonus points

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Analyzing Game State and Options

Let me analyze the current game state to determine the best action.

## Current Status
- I have 3 VP (3 settlements)
- Red has 4 VP (2 settlements + longest road)
- My Resources: 3 Wood, 1 Brick, 2 Sheep, 3 Wheat
- I have access to the 2:1 Brick port
- Current plan focuses on Largest Army + city upgrades

## Analysis of Available Options

The main option I have is to build a road since I have 3 Wood and 1 Brick, which is exactly what's needed. I need to consider which road placement best serves my strategic goals.

Let me evaluate each road option:
1. Edge (13, 14) - Extends toward the Sheep-8 hex, potentially blocking Red
2. Edge (4, 15) - Extends toward the Desert and Wheat-10 areas
3. Edge (2, 3) - Connects near my settlement at node 4, toward Sheep-6 area
4. Edge (4, 5) - Extends toward Wheat-10 and the edge of the board
5. Edge (11, 12) - Connects between my settlements at nodes 4 and 13
6. Edge (33, 34) - Extends from my settlement at node 35
7. Edge (36, 37) - Extends from the 2:1 Brick port area
8. Edge (3, 12) - Connects near my settlement at node 4

## Road Strategy Assessment

Looking at my current positions, I need to consider:
- Which road gives me the best expansion opportunities
- Which road helps me work toward longest road (currently Red has 5 segments)
- Which road blocks Red's expansion

I notice that I currently have 5 roads built with my longest continuous path at 4 roads. If I can strategically build more roads, I could potentially challenge Red for longest road in the future.

Option #6 (edge 33, 34) would extend from my settlement at node 35, potentially working toward creating a longer road network. This could help me set up for a potential longest road challenge while also creating expansion opportunities.

Option #5 (edge 11, 12) would connect my settlements at node 4 and node 13, which could be strategically valuable for creating a more connected road network.

## Reevaluating My Plan

My current plan focuses on Largest Army, but I don't currently have the resources to buy development cards (need Ore+Wheat+Sheep). Additionally, Red is ahead by 1 VP, and I need to consider whether to pivot and challenge the Longest Road bonus.

<plan>
1. Build a road strategically to set up for potential longest road challenge
2. Continue saving resources for development cards when possible
3. Aim for settlement expansion to gain more resources
4. Long-term: Consider either Largest Army OR Longest Road path depending on resources
</plan>

## Decision

Since I can't build a development card right now, and considering my road network, I'll build a road that helps me create a more connected network with potential for expansion.

Option #5 (edge 11, 12) connects my two settlements and helps create a stronger road network that could eventually challenge for longest road. This strengthens my position without committing fully to a longest road strategy yet.

# Game Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state thoroughly to determine the optimal action.

## Current Game Status
- I have 3 VP (3 settlements)
- Red has 4 VP (2 settlements + longest road)
- My resources: 3 🌲WOOD, 2 🐑SHEEP, 5 🌾WHEAT
- I have insufficient resources for any direct builds (city, settlement, or development card)

## Resource Analysis
I have excess wheat (5) but no brick or ore, which limits my building options. I need to determine if trading will help my position or if I should end my turn and collect more resources.

## Strategic Options

1. **End Turn**: Save resources for future turns
   - Pro: Keep all current resources for future builds
   - Con: No immediate progress this turn

2. **Trade Wheat for Resources**:
   - I could trade 4 wheat for 1 brick or 1 ore
   - With brick: Could build a road (need 1 wood + 1 brick)
   - With ore: Cannot complete any build this turn

## Road Network Analysis
I currently have 6 roads with my longest being 4 segments. Red has longest road with 6 segments. To challenge for longest road, I would need to extend my network significantly.

## Victory Path Evaluation
My current path to victory likely requires:
- Building more settlements (+1 VP each)
- Upgrading to cities (+1 VP each)
- Potentially challenging for longest road (+2 VP)
- Development cards for largest army or VP cards

<plan>
1. End turn to preserve resources
2. Focus on gathering brick and ore on next turn
3. With brick: extend road network toward promising settlement locations
4. With ore: work toward city upgrades or development cards
5. Long-term goal: Challenge for longest road OR pursue largest army depending on resource availability
</plan>

Given my current resource situation, none of the available trades would allow me to make meaningful progress this turn. Trading wheat for brick would let me build just one road, but with no clear strategic advantage. I should preserve my resources for more impactful builds on future turns.

The optimal action is to end my turn:

\boxed{0}
========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Target hexes with HIGH probability numbers (6,8,5,9) - prioritize these above all else
- Go for resource DIVERSITY: secure ALL five resources between your two settlements
- Focus on ORE and WHEAT for city upgrades (numbers 5-9 preferred)
- Evaluate each potential settlement by its TOTAL PIP COUNT (sum of probability dots)
- Place your initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Avoid placing both settlements near the same resources - diversify your income!
- Always consider 3:1 ports if your initial placement gives you limited access to certain resources
- Place roads in directions that block opponents' expansion routes

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT & CITY BUILDING PRIORITY:
- FIRST PRIORITY: Build 1-2 additional settlements early to secure critical resources you lack
- SECOND PRIORITY: Upgrade to cities as quickly as possible to double resource production
- THIRD PRIORITY: Build roads only when they lead directly to valuable settlement locations
- Early game (1-5 turns): Secure key settlements at high-value locations
- Mid-game (6-15 turns): Focus heavily on upgrading to cities (2-3 cities should be your target)
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road
- When short on a key resource, use 2:1 ports if available before using 3:1 or 4:1 ports
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat to other players unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- If you have excess of a resource, use ports rather than trading with opponents

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards primarily when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber OR to reach Largest Army (3+ knights)
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city or settlement build
- Use Monopoly cards after high-probability dice rolls to collect maximum resources
- Keep track of how many VP cards you've drawn (5 in the deck total)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn
- When development cards are your path to victory, aim for: 3 cities (6 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 victory cards (2 VP)
- Consider buying development cards when you have limited build options (blocked roads, etc.)

OPTIMAL EXPANSION PATH:
- Build roads with PURPOSE - every road should lead to a viable settlement location
- Identify and secure "bottleneck" positions that cut off opponents' expansion
- Expand toward resources you LACK from initial placement - seek balance
- When choosing between multiple settlement spots, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (total pip count)
  2. Access to resources you currently lack
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, securing future expansion)
  4. Proximity to useful ports
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Longest road (2 VP) requires strategic planning - only pursue if you already have 4+ roads built

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- When someone has 8+ points, ALWAYS target them with the robber regardless of other factors
- If you're being targeted by the robber, consider using knight cards immediately to protect production

TURN-BY-TURN PLANNING:
1. Start each turn by assessing your current VP and opponents' VPs (both visible and potential hidden points)
2. Identify your build priority for this turn: settlement, city, road, or development card?
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for your priority build
4. If you can't build your priority item, determine if trading or buying a development card is better
5. Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card or trade for needed resources
6. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

WINNING PATHS:
1. CITY-FOCUSED PATH: 3-4 cities (6-8 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 9-11 VP
2. BALANCED PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 VP card = 10 VP
3. DEVELOPMENT PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP

NEVER SAY NO TO FREE VPs:
- Always account for the 2 VP from longest road and largest army in your plans
- These special cards are EASY to lose if you're not defending them
- Invest in roads/knights to maintain your lead if these VPs are part of your strategy
- Be alert for opponents trying to steal these bonus points

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game Analysis for Robber Placement

I need to carefully consider where to place the robber to maximize my strategic advantage while hindering my opponent who's currently ahead.

## Current Game State Assessment
- I (BLUE) have 3 VP with 3 settlements
- RED has 4 VP including 2 VP from longest road (with 7 road segments)
- RED is ahead by 1 VP, so they are my primary target
- I should focus on disrupting RED's key resources and potentially stealing something valuable

## Robber Placement Considerations

Looking at RED's settlements:
- RED settlement at node 1: produces brick(8★★★), sheep(9★★), wood(5★★)
- RED settlement at node 11: produces sheep(6★★★), ore(6★★★), wood(11★)

RED's high-value hexes are:
- Brick 8 (high probability)
- Sheep 6 and 9 (good probabilities)
- Ore 6 (high probability)

Since I have the opportunity to steal from RED, I should target their most valuable resources or resources I currently need.

## Action Analysis

Looking at the options that allow me to steal from RED:
- [0] Move robber to (0, 0, 0) = brick 8 hex - blocks RED's brick production from their node 1 settlement
- [1] Move robber to (1, -1, 0) = sheep 9 hex - blocks RED's sheep production from their node 1 settlement
- [2] Move robber to (0, -1, 1) = sheep 6 hex - blocks RED's sheep production from their node 11 settlement
- [5] Move robber to (1, 0, -1) = wood 5 hex - blocks RED's wood production from their node 1 settlement
- [8] Move robber to (0, -2, 2) = ore 6 hex - blocks RED's ore production from their node 11 settlement
- [9] Move robber to (-1, -1, 2) = wood 11 hex - blocks RED's wood production from their node 11 settlement

Based on probability and resource values:
- Blocking brick 8 (option 0) or ore 6 (option 8) would be most impactful as they're high-probability numbers
- RED likely needs brick to extend their road network further (they already have longest road)
- Ore is crucial for city upgrades which RED might be targeting next

I don't currently have any ore or brick in my hand, and both would be valuable for my future expansion and city upgrades.

<plan>
1. Block RED's access to high-probability ore or brick
2. Focus on building roads toward good settlement locations on my next turn
3. Work toward city upgrades when I gather enough resources
4. Continue monitoring RED's progress toward longest road and consider challenging it
</plan>

Since RED already has longest road (7 segments), they might be focusing on other strategies like city upgrades which require ore. Blocking ore 6 (highest probability ore on the board) would significantly hinder their ability to upgrade settlements to cities.

Therefore, my optimal choice is:

\boxed{8}

This places the robber on the ore 6 hex (0, -2, 2), blocking RED's ore production from their settlement at node 11 and allowing me to steal one of their resources.

# Game Analysis

Let me analyze my current position and options:

## Victory Point Status
- I have 3 VP (3 settlements)
- RED has 4 VP (2 settlements + longest road)

## Resource Assessment
- I have: 1 Wood, 1 Brick, 4 Sheep, 2 Wheat, 0 Ore
- Need more Ore for city upgrades
- I can build exactly one road with my Wood and Brick

## Available Actions
1. Build a road 
2. Maritime trade (4:1) sheep for another resource
3. End turn

## Strategic Considerations

### Road Building Options
Let me assess each road option to determine which best advances my position:
- Edge (13, 14): Extends from my settlement at node 13
- Edge (4, 15): Extends from my settlement at node 4
- Edge (2, 3): Connects toward settlement at node 4
- Edge (4, 5): Extends from my settlement at node 4
- Edge (33, 34): Near my settlement at node 13
- Edge (36, 37): Near my settlement at node 35
- Edge (3, 12): Connects toward my settlement at node 4

### RED's Position
- RED has longest road (7 segments) giving them +2 VP
- RED has 7 hidden cards
- RED holds 4 VP currently, meaning they're ahead

### My Path to Victory
I need to develop my position to catch up with RED:
- Need more settlements (1 VP each)
- Need to upgrade to cities (1 additional VP per city)
- Need resources to do both (especially Ore for cities)

<plan>
1. Build a road that creates path to new settlement locations with good resource potential
2. Focus on gaining ore in future turns for city upgrades
3. Monitor RED's progress and potentially challenge longest road if viable
4. Trade excess sheep via ports when advantageous
</plan>

## Decision Making

Looking at the road options, I should choose the one that:
1. Opens up potential new settlement locations
2. Potentially accesses resources I'm lacking (especially ore)
3. Blocks RED's expansion if possible

Examining the board connectivity, edge (4, 15) appears most promising as it:
- Extends from my settlement at node 4
- Moves me toward potentially valuable settlement spots
- Could eventually challenge RED's longest road

This road would help me develop my position while using my current resources efficiently.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Target hexes with HIGH probability numbers (6,8,5,9) - prioritize these above all else
- Go for resource DIVERSITY: secure ALL five resources between your two settlements
- Focus on ORE and WHEAT for city upgrades (numbers 5-9 preferred)
- Evaluate each potential settlement by its TOTAL PIP COUNT (sum of probability dots)
- Place your initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Avoid placing both settlements near the same resources - diversify your income!
- Always consider 3:1 ports if your initial placement gives you limited access to certain resources
- Place roads in directions that block opponents' expansion routes

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT & CITY BUILDING PRIORITY:
- FIRST PRIORITY: Build 1-2 additional settlements early to secure critical resources you lack
- SECOND PRIORITY: Upgrade to cities as quickly as possible to double resource production
- THIRD PRIORITY: Build roads only when they lead directly to valuable settlement locations
- Early game (1-5 turns): Secure key settlements at high-value locations
- Mid-game (6-15 turns): Focus heavily on upgrading to cities (2-3 cities should be your target)
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road
- When short on a key resource, use 2:1 ports if available before using 3:1 or 4:1 ports
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat to other players unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- If you have excess of a resource, use ports rather than trading with opponents

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards primarily when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber OR to reach Largest Army (3+ knights)
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city or settlement build
- Use Monopoly cards after high-probability dice rolls to collect maximum resources
- Keep track of how many VP cards you've drawn (5 in the deck total)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn
- When development cards are your path to victory, aim for: 3 cities (6 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 victory cards (2 VP)
- Consider buying development cards when you have limited build options (blocked roads, etc.)

OPTIMAL EXPANSION PATH:
- Build roads with PURPOSE - every road should lead to a viable settlement location
- Identify and secure "bottleneck" positions that cut off opponents' expansion
- Expand toward resources you LACK from initial placement - seek balance
- When choosing between multiple settlement spots, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (total pip count)
  2. Access to resources you currently lack
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, securing future expansion)
  4. Proximity to useful ports
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Longest road (2 VP) requires strategic planning - only pursue if you already have 4+ roads built

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- When someone has 8+ points, ALWAYS target them with the robber regardless of other factors
- If you're being targeted by the robber, consider using knight cards immediately to protect production

TURN-BY-TURN PLANNING:
1. Start each turn by assessing your current VP and opponents' VPs (both visible and potential hidden points)
2. Identify your build priority for this turn: settlement, city, road, or development card?
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for your priority build
4. If you can't build your priority item, determine if trading or buying a development card is better
5. Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card or trade for needed resources
6. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

WINNING PATHS:
1. CITY-FOCUSED PATH: 3-4 cities (6-8 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 9-11 VP
2. BALANCED PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 VP card = 10 VP
3. DEVELOPMENT PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP

NEVER SAY NO TO FREE VPs:
- Always account for the 2 VP from longest road and largest army in your plans
- These special cards are EASY to lose if you're not defending them
- Invest in roads/knights to maintain your lead if these VPs are part of your strategy
- Be alert for opponents trying to steal these bonus points

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game Analysis and Action Selection

Let me analyze the current game state and available options:

## Current Game State
- I have 3 VP (3 settlements)
- RED has 4 VP (2 settlements + longest road)
- My resources: 4 sheep and 2 wheat
- I have 7 roads built (longest continuous segment is 4)
- RED has the longest road with 7 segments
- The robber is on a wheat hex (-1, 0, 1) which is connected to one of my settlements

## Available Options
0. End my turn
1-4. Maritime trades - trading 4 sheep for another resource (wood, wheat, ore, or brick)

## Strategic Analysis
Looking at my current situation:
- I need to build toward 10 VP
- I can't build anything meaningful this turn with just sheep and wheat
- Trading 4 sheep for 1 of another resource is inefficient (4:1 ratio)
- According to building information, I have access to the 2:1 brick port at nodes 35-36, which would allow a 2:1 trade ratio for brick

However, I notice I can't use my 2:1 brick port in the available actions, which suggests I might not have enough sheep (need 2 for the port).

<plan>
1. Trade excess sheep for a critical resource (brick or ore)
2. In future turns, build roads toward valuable settlement locations
3. Focus on securing ore to upgrade settlements to cities
4. Continue monitoring RED's progress (currently at 4 VP with longest road)
</plan>

Since I can't build anything this turn and the 4:1 trades are inefficient, the best option is to end my turn and wait for better resource opportunities on the next roll.

# Analyzing Game State

First, let's understand my position and resources:
- I have 3/10 VP (3 settlements)
- Resources: 4 🐑 SHEEP, 2 🌾 WHEAT
- Red has 5/10 VP (3 settlements + longest road bonus)

## Resource Analysis
What I have: 4 sheep, 2 wheat
What I lack: wood, brick, ore

## Current Production
- I produce brick, wheat, sheep well
- I lack ore and wood production

## Strategic Position Assessment
- Red is 2 VP ahead with 5/10 points
- I need to increase my VP quickly
- I have the brick port (2:1) which is valuable

## Available Actions
My options are:
0. End turn
1-4. Trade 4 sheep for 1 wood/wheat/ore/brick

<plan>
1. Use maritime trade to get ore (critical for city upgrades)
2. Focus on city upgrades (2 wheat + 3 ore) to double resource production
3. Continue building settlements in strategic locations
4. Consider development cards to compete for largest army
</plan>

## Decision Analysis
Since I already have 2 wheat and need 3 ore for a city, trading for ore makes the most sense. Cities are my fastest path to victory, as they give +1 VP and double resource production. Given my current resources:

- Trading for ore gets me closer to a city upgrade (need 3 ore + 2 wheat)
- I already have 2 wheat, so I only need ore
- Cities provide the biggest benefit by doubling production and giving VP

While wood or brick could help with roads/settlements, my priority should be upgrading to cities since I already have 3 settlements producing resources.

Therefore, the optimal action is to trade 4 sheep for 1 ore:

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Target hexes with HIGH probability numbers (6,8,5,9) - prioritize these above all else
- Go for resource DIVERSITY: secure ALL five resources between your two settlements
- Focus on ORE and WHEAT for city upgrades (numbers 5-9 preferred)
- Evaluate each potential settlement by its TOTAL PIP COUNT (sum of probability dots)
- Place your initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Avoid placing both settlements near the same resources - diversify your income!
- Always consider 3:1 ports if your initial placement gives you limited access to certain resources
- Place roads in directions that block opponents' expansion routes

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT & CITY BUILDING PRIORITY:
- FIRST PRIORITY: Build 1-2 additional settlements early to secure critical resources you lack
- SECOND PRIORITY: Upgrade to cities as quickly as possible to double resource production
- THIRD PRIORITY: Build roads only when they lead directly to valuable settlement locations
- Early game (1-5 turns): Secure key settlements at high-value locations
- Mid-game (6-15 turns): Focus heavily on upgrading to cities (2-3 cities should be your target)
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road
- When short on a key resource, use 2:1 ports if available before using 3:1 or 4:1 ports
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat to other players unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- If you have excess of a resource, use ports rather than trading with opponents

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards primarily when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber OR to reach Largest Army (3+ knights)
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city or settlement build
- Use Monopoly cards after high-probability dice rolls to collect maximum resources
- Keep track of how many VP cards you've drawn (5 in the deck total)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn
- When development cards are your path to victory, aim for: 3 cities (6 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 victory cards (2 VP)
- Consider buying development cards when you have limited build options (blocked roads, etc.)

OPTIMAL EXPANSION PATH:
- Build roads with PURPOSE - every road should lead to a viable settlement location
- Identify and secure "bottleneck" positions that cut off opponents' expansion
- Expand toward resources you LACK from initial placement - seek balance
- When choosing between multiple settlement spots, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (total pip count)
  2. Access to resources you currently lack
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, securing future expansion)
  4. Proximity to useful ports
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Longest road (2 VP) requires strategic planning - only pursue if you already have 4+ roads built

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- When someone has 8+ points, ALWAYS target them with the robber regardless of other factors
- If you're being targeted by the robber, consider using knight cards immediately to protect production

TURN-BY-TURN PLANNING:
1. Start each turn by assessing your current VP and opponents' VPs (both visible and potential hidden points)
2. Identify your build priority for this turn: settlement, city, road, or development card?
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for your priority build
4. If you can't build your priority item, determine if trading or buying a development card is better
5. Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card or trade for needed resources
6. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

WINNING PATHS:
1. CITY-FOCUSED PATH: 3-4 cities (6-8 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 9-11 VP
2. BALANCED PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 VP card = 10 VP
3. DEVELOPMENT PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP

NEVER SAY NO TO FREE VPs:
- Always account for the 2 VP from longest road and largest army in your plans
- These special cards are EASY to lose if you're not defending them
- Invest in roads/knights to maintain your lead if these VPs are part of your strategy
- Be alert for opponents trying to steal these bonus points

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game State Analysis

Let me analyze my current situation and available options:

## Current Status:
- I have 3 VP (3 settlements)
- Resources: 1 🌲WOOD, 4 🌾WHEAT, 1 ⛏️ORE
- Opponent has 5 VP (3 settlements + 2 VP for longest road)

## Resource Analysis:
- For city upgrade: Need 2 wheat + 3 ore (I have 4 wheat and 1 ore, so I need 2 more ore)
- Currently no way to build a new settlement (would need brick + wood + wheat + sheep)
- My planned priority has been city upgrades

## Available Actions:
- [0] End turn
- [1-4] Trade 4 wheat for various resources

## Strategic Assessment:

My current plan focuses on city upgrades to double resource production. I have 4 wheat and 1 ore, meaning I'm just 2 ore short of building a city. Building a city is a high-priority move since:
1. It gives me +1 VP (moving to 4 VP)
2. It doubles production at one of my settlements
3. It's aligned with my mid-game strategy

Since I can't build anything this turn with my current resources, and I have excess wheat (4), the optimal play is to trade wheat for ore through maritime trade. This gets me closer to building a city, which is my current strategic priority.

<plan>
1. Trade wheat for ore this turn to move closer to city upgrade
2. Build a city at node 4 (my best producing settlement) when I obtain enough ore
3. Continue expanding roads toward potential settlement spots
4. Build additional settlements when I secure the necessary resources
5. Consider development cards if I accumulate excess sheep/wheat/ore
</plan>

Among my options, [3] Trade port: Give 4 🌾WHEAT for 1 ⛏️ORE is clearly the best choice as it directly advances my city-building strategy.

# Game Analysis: Settlers of Catan (Turn 82)

Let me analyze the current game state and my options carefully:

## Game State Summary
- I (BLUE) have 3 VP (3 settlements)
- RED has 5 VP (3 settlements + longest road)
- I have 1 🧱BRICK, 2 🐑SHEEP, 1 🌾WHEAT, 2 ⛏️ORE
- My next planned move was to trade wheat for ore and build a city at node 4
- Robber is on (-1, 0, 1), blocking a wheat hex with an 11 value
- I have a 2:1 brick port

## Available Actions Analysis
1. Buy a development card (1 🐑SHEEP, 1 🌾WHEAT, 1 ⛏️ORE)
   - Would leave me with 1 🧱BRICK, 1 🐑SHEEP, 0 🌾WHEAT, 1 ⛏️ORE
   - Could potentially get a victory point card, knight, road building, year of plenty, or monopoly
   - A knight would put me closer to largest army (currently have 1)
   - A victory point would be hidden from opponents

2. End turn (option 0)
   - Save resources for next turn
   - With current resources, I'm only 1 ore away from building a city at node 4

## Decision Process
My current plan was to focus on getting a city upgrade at node 4. I have 2 ore now, so I'm only 1 ore short. Getting a development card would deplete my resources significantly and delay the city upgrade.

Looking at RED, they have 5 VP already, so they're halfway to winning. I need to accelerate my progress.

If I buy a development card:
- Best case: I get a victory point card (+1 VP)
- Worst case: I get another card type that I can't immediately use
- Either way, I deplete my ore and wheat which delays city building

If I end my turn:
- I maintain my resources
- I might get the ore I need on the next dice roll to build a city
- My city would give me +1 VP and double production at node 4

<plan>
1. End turn to preserve resources for city building
2. Build a city at node 4 as soon as I get 1 more ore (will give me 4 VP total)
3. Then focus on building a settlement at a new location to access resources I lack
4. Consider development cards later if I accumulate extra resources
5. Work on improving my road network to challenge the longest road bonus
</plan>

Given the game state and my resources, ending my turn to continue saving for a city is the optimal strategic choice.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Target hexes with HIGH probability numbers (6,8,5,9) - prioritize these above all else
- Go for resource DIVERSITY: secure ALL five resources between your two settlements
- Focus on ORE and WHEAT for city upgrades (numbers 5-9 preferred)
- Evaluate each potential settlement by its TOTAL PIP COUNT (sum of probability dots)
- Place your initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Avoid placing both settlements near the same resources - diversify your income!
- Always consider 3:1 ports if your initial placement gives you limited access to certain resources
- Place roads in directions that block opponents' expansion routes

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT & CITY BUILDING PRIORITY:
- FIRST PRIORITY: Build 1-2 additional settlements early to secure critical resources you lack
- SECOND PRIORITY: Upgrade to cities as quickly as possible to double resource production
- THIRD PRIORITY: Build roads only when they lead directly to valuable settlement locations
- Early game (1-5 turns): Secure key settlements at high-value locations
- Mid-game (6-15 turns): Focus heavily on upgrading to cities (2-3 cities should be your target)
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road
- When short on a key resource, use 2:1 ports if available before using 3:1 or 4:1 ports
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat to other players unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- If you have excess of a resource, use ports rather than trading with opponents

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards primarily when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber OR to reach Largest Army (3+ knights)
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city or settlement build
- Use Monopoly cards after high-probability dice rolls to collect maximum resources
- Keep track of how many VP cards you've drawn (5 in the deck total)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn
- When development cards are your path to victory, aim for: 3 cities (6 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 victory cards (2 VP)
- Consider buying development cards when you have limited build options (blocked roads, etc.)

OPTIMAL EXPANSION PATH:
- Build roads with PURPOSE - every road should lead to a viable settlement location
- Identify and secure "bottleneck" positions that cut off opponents' expansion
- Expand toward resources you LACK from initial placement - seek balance
- When choosing between multiple settlement spots, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (total pip count)
  2. Access to resources you currently lack
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, securing future expansion)
  4. Proximity to useful ports
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Longest road (2 VP) requires strategic planning - only pursue if you already have 4+ roads built

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- When someone has 8+ points, ALWAYS target them with the robber regardless of other factors
- If you're being targeted by the robber, consider using knight cards immediately to protect production

TURN-BY-TURN PLANNING:
1. Start each turn by assessing your current VP and opponents' VPs (both visible and potential hidden points)
2. Identify your build priority for this turn: settlement, city, road, or development card?
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for your priority build
4. If you can't build your priority item, determine if trading or buying a development card is better
5. Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card or trade for needed resources
6. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

WINNING PATHS:
1. CITY-FOCUSED PATH: 3-4 cities (6-8 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 9-11 VP
2. BALANCED PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 VP card = 10 VP
3. DEVELOPMENT PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP

NEVER SAY NO TO FREE VPs:
- Always account for the 2 VP from longest road and largest army in your plans
- These special cards are EASY to lose if you're not defending them
- Invest in roads/knights to maintain your lead if these VPs are part of your strategy
- Be alert for opponents trying to steal these bonus points

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 84 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. End turn to preserve resources for city building
2. Build a city at node 4 as soon as I get 1 more ore (will give me 4 VP total)
3. Then focus on building a settlement at a new location to access resources I lack
4. Consider development cards later if I accumulate extra resources
5. Work on improving my road network to challenge the longest road bonus

# Analysis of Current Game State

Let me analyze the current game state carefully:

**Current Victory Points**:
- Blue (me): 3 VP (3 settlements)
- Red: 5 VP (3 settlements + longest road bonus)

**My Resources**:
- 2 Sheep, 1 Wheat, 2 Ore

**Available Actions**:
- [0] End turn
- [1] Buy development card (costs 1 Sheep, 1 Wheat, 1 Ore)

**Current Plan Analysis**:
My current plan focuses on upgrading to a city at node 4, but I need 1 more ore for that (cities cost 3 ore + 2 wheat). I currently have 2 ore and 1 wheat, so I'm still missing 1 ore and 1 wheat.

**Development Card Consideration**:
A development card could be:
- Knight: Would help toward largest army (I already have 1 knight)
- Victory Point: Hidden VP helps me win without alerting opponents
- Year of Plenty: Could get me the exact resources I need for city
- Monopoly: Could help me collect resources from Red
- Road Building: Could help challenge Red's longest road

**Strategic Analysis**:
- Red is 2 VP ahead (5 vs 3) with longest road bonus
- I need to both catch up and prevent Red from reaching 10 VP
- Red has 6 hidden resources, which is concerning

Since I'm still 1 ore short for a city, the development card option is appealing. It could potentially give me a knight (for largest army), a victory point, or one of the resource cards to help me complete my city faster.

<plan>
1. Buy a development card now to potentially get immediate VP or helpful resources
2. Continue working toward a city at node 4 once I collect 1 more ore and 1 more wheat
3. Use the development card strategically depending on what I receive
4. Focus on challenging Red's longest road or building toward largest army
5. Next expansion target should be a settlement that gives me access to resources I lack
</plan>

I've carefully considered the options, and buying a development card is the optimal move since:
1. It could provide immediate value (VP card or resource card)
2. I can't build a city yet (need more resources)
3. It's better to invest resources now than risk losing them to a 7 roll
4. Development cards provide strategic flexibility

2. Continue working toward a city at node 4 once I collect 1 more ore and 1 more wheat
3. Use the development card strategically depending on what I receive
4. Focus on challenging Red's longest road or building toward largest army
5. Next expansion target should be a settlement that gives me access to resources I lack

# Game Analysis for Settlers of Catan

Let me analyze my current situation and determine the best action:

## Current Status
- I have 3/10 victory points
- Resources: 1 Brick, 1 Sheep, 1 Ore
- I have a Monopoly development card
- Red has 5 VP (3 settlements + Longest Road)

## Action Options
I need to choose between playing my Monopoly card (on one of 5 resources) or rolling the dice.

### Option: Play Monopoly
Monopoly allows me to take all of one resource type from other players. This is most effective when:
1. I know opponents have collected a lot of a specific resource
2. I urgently need a specific resource to complete a critical build

Looking at Red's position:
- Red has 5 hidden resource cards
- Without knowing exactly what Red has, playing Monopoly is a gamble
- Red's settlements produce Wood (3 spots), Sheep (2 spots), Brick (2 spots), Ore (1 spot), and Wheat (2 spots)

### Option: Roll Dice
If I roll, I might gain more resources naturally. My settlements produce:
- On 8: Brick (settlement at node 4) and Sheep (settlement at node 13, but robber is there)
- On 10: Wheat (settlement at node 4) 
- On 11: Wheat (settlements at node 4 and 13) and Wood (settlement at node 13)

## Strategic Assessment
1. My current plan involves buying a development card or working toward a city at node 4
2. For a development card: I need 1 Ore + 1 Wheat + 1 Sheep (I have 1 Ore, 1 Sheep, need 1 Wheat)
3. For a city at node 4: I need 3 Ore + 2 Wheat (I have 1 Ore, need 2 more Ore and 2 Wheat)

The Monopoly card would be most valuable for Wheat or Ore, but it's better to save it for when:
- I know Red has collected many of these resources
- After a high-probability roll for that resource just occurred
- When I'm one resource away from a critical build

<plan>
1. Roll the dice to collect more resources naturally
2. Save the Monopoly card for a more strategic moment when I know Red has a lot of a specific resource
3. Continue working toward a development card (need 1 more Wheat) or city at node 4
4. Focus on breaking Red's longest road or building toward largest army
5. Consider expanding to gain access to more diverse resources
</plan>

Given the limited information about Red's resources and no immediate critical build that a Monopoly would complete, rolling is the safer option to build my resource base first.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Target hexes with HIGH probability numbers (6,8,5,9) - prioritize these above all else
- Go for resource DIVERSITY: secure ALL five resources between your two settlements
- Focus on ORE and WHEAT for city upgrades (numbers 5-9 preferred)
- Evaluate each potential settlement by its TOTAL PIP COUNT (sum of probability dots)
- Place your initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Avoid placing both settlements near the same resources - diversify your income!
- Always consider 3:1 ports if your initial placement gives you limited access to certain resources
- Place roads in directions that block opponents' expansion routes

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT & CITY BUILDING PRIORITY:
- FIRST PRIORITY: Build 1-2 additional settlements early to secure critical resources you lack
- SECOND PRIORITY: Upgrade to cities as quickly as possible to double resource production
- THIRD PRIORITY: Build roads only when they lead directly to valuable settlement locations
- Early game (1-5 turns): Secure key settlements at high-value locations
- Mid-game (6-15 turns): Focus heavily on upgrading to cities (2-3 cities should be your target)
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road
- When short on a key resource, use 2:1 ports if available before using 3:1 or 4:1 ports
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat to other players unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- If you have excess of a resource, use ports rather than trading with opponents

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards primarily when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber OR to reach Largest Army (3+ knights)
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city or settlement build
- Use Monopoly cards after high-probability dice rolls to collect maximum resources
- Keep track of how many VP cards you've drawn (5 in the deck total)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn
- When development cards are your path to victory, aim for: 3 cities (6 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 victory cards (2 VP)
- Consider buying development cards when you have limited build options (blocked roads, etc.)

OPTIMAL EXPANSION PATH:
- Build roads with PURPOSE - every road should lead to a viable settlement location
- Identify and secure "bottleneck" positions that cut off opponents' expansion
- Expand toward resources you LACK from initial placement - seek balance
- When choosing between multiple settlement spots, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (total pip count)
  2. Access to resources you currently lack
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, securing future expansion)
  4. Proximity to useful ports
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Longest road (2 VP) requires strategic planning - only pursue if you already have 4+ roads built

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- When someone has 8+ points, ALWAYS target them with the robber regardless of other factors
- If you're being targeted by the robber, consider using knight cards immediately to protect production

TURN-BY-TURN PLANNING:
1. Start each turn by assessing your current VP and opponents' VPs (both visible and potential hidden points)
2. Identify your build priority for this turn: settlement, city, road, or development card?
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for your priority build
4. If you can't build your priority item, determine if trading or buying a development card is better
5. Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card or trade for needed resources
6. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

WINNING PATHS:
1. CITY-FOCUSED PATH: 3-4 cities (6-8 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 9-11 VP
2. BALANCED PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 VP card = 10 VP
3. DEVELOPMENT PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP

NEVER SAY NO TO FREE VPs:
- Always account for the 2 VP from longest road and largest army in your plans
- These special cards are EASY to lose if you're not defending them
- Invest in roads/knights to maintain your lead if these VPs are part of your strategy
- Be alert for opponents trying to steal these bonus points

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game Analysis: Robber Placement Decision

I need to carefully analyze where to place the robber to maximize my advantage while hampering RED player, who is leading with 5 points and the longest road bonus.

## Current Game State
- RED leads with 5 VP (including 2 VP from longest road)
- I have 3 VP (3 settlements)
- RED has 15 roads (longest: 10) vs my 7 roads (longest: 4)
- I have limited resources: 1 brick, 1 sheep, 1 ore

## Strategic Considerations
1. RED is clearly ahead and is my primary competition
2. I should target RED's most productive hexes
3. I should prioritize resources that RED needs but I don't need as much
4. I need to consider which resources would help me build my next target (city or development card)

## Key Resource Hexes for RED
- 🧱8 (0,0,0) - High value brick (RED has settlement at node 1)
- ⛏️6 (0,-2,2) - High value ore (RED has settlement at node 11)
- 🐑6 (0,-1,1) - High value sheep (RED has settlement at node 11)
- 🐑9 (1,-1,0) - Good value sheep (RED has settlement at node 1)
- 🌲5 (2,-1,-1) - Decent wood (RED has settlement at node 22)

## My Resource Strategy
Per my plan, I need wheat for development cards. I already have ore, so targeting RED's ore access could be beneficial.

## Robber Location Options
Looking at the highest value hexes for RED:
- Option [0]: 🧱8 (0,0,0) - This blocks a critical brick hex where RED has a settlement. Brick is essential for roads, which RED uses for longest road advantage.
- Option [9]: ⛏️6 (0,-2,2) - This blocks RED's access to high-value ore, which they need for cities.
- Option [2]: 🐑6 (0,-1,1) - This blocks RED's sheep production, important for development cards.

## Decision
Option [0] (Move robber to 🧱8 and steal from RED) is optimal because:
1. It blocks a critical 8-value brick hex that RED relies on for road building
2. RED's longest road is their key advantage - disrupting brick supply directly attacks this
3. I also get to steal a card from RED, potentially getting a resource I need
4. This is RED's only brick source, making it particularly impactful

<plan>
1. Block RED's brick production to slow down their longest road expansion
2. Continue saving for my next development card or city at node 4
3. Work on expanding my road network to challenge RED's longest road
4. Use my Monopoly card strategically when RED accumulates specific resources
5. Look for settlement opportunities to diversify my resource production

- Expand toward resources you LACK from initial placement - seek balance
- When choosing between multiple settlement spots, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (total pip count)
  2. Access to resources you currently lack
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, securing future expansion)
  4. Proximity to useful ports
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Longest road (2 VP) requires strategic planning - only pursue if you already have 4+ roads built

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- When someone has 8+ points, ALWAYS target them with the robber regardless of other factors
- If you're being targeted by the robber, consider using knight cards immediately to protect production

TURN-BY-TURN PLANNING:
1. Start each turn by assessing your current VP and opponents' VPs (both visible and potential hidden points)
2. Identify your build priority for this turn: settlement, city, road, or development card?
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for your priority build
4. If you can't build your priority item, determine if trading or buying a development card is better
5. Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card or trade for needed resources
6. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

WINNING PATHS:
1. CITY-FOCUSED PATH: 3-4 cities (6-8 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 9-11 VP
2. BALANCED PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 VP card = 10 VP
3. DEVELOPMENT PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP

NEVER SAY NO TO FREE VPs:
- Always account for the 2 VP from longest road and largest army in your plans
- These special cards are EASY to lose if you're not defending them
- Invest in roads/knights to maintain your lead if these VPs are part of your strategy
- Be alert for opponents trying to steal these bonus points

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 86 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Block RED's brick production to slow down their longest road expansion
2. Continue saving for my next development card or city at node 4
3. Work on expanding my road network to challenge RED's longest road
4. Use my Monopoly card strategically when RED accumulates specific resources
5. Look for settlement opportunities to diversify my resource production

❓ Select action by number (0-13):


Based on this information, which action number do you choose? Think step by step about your options, then put the final action number in a box like \boxed{1}.
RESPONSE:
I'll analyze the current game state and evaluate our optimal action.

## Step 1: Assess the game state
- We have 3 VP (from 3 settlements), RED has 5 VP (3 settlements + 2 from longest road)
- Our resources: 1 Wood, 1 Brick, 1 Sheep, 1 Ore
- We have a Monopoly development card
- RED has 4 hidden resources
- Robber is on the Brick hex (0,0,0) which produces on 8 (high probability)

## Step 2: Evaluate available options
1. Play Monopoly (options 0-4) to take all of one resource from RED
2. Build a road (options 6-13) using our Wood and Brick
3. End our turn (option 5)

## Step 3: Consider Monopoly options
RED has 4 hidden cards. Playing Monopoly now could potentially gain us resources, but we don't know what RED has. RED likely needs Wood and Brick for roads, so those are good candidates.

## Step 4: Consider Road building
We can build one road with our Wood and Brick. We currently have 7 roads with a longest road of 4, while RED has 15 roads with longest road of 10. It's a significant gap to overcome.

Let's examine where our potential roads could lead:
- Edge (13, 14): Extends from our settlement at node 13
- Edge (15, 17): Extends our network toward the 3:1 port
- Edge (2, 3): Extends toward potential expansion areas
- Edge (4, 5): Extends from our settlement at node 4
- Edge (33, 34): Connects toward one of our roads
- Edge (14, 15): Connects nodes 14 and 15
- Edge (36, 37): Extends from our road network
- Edge (3, 12): Connects nodes 3 and 12

## Step 5: Strategic consideration
1. We're significantly behind RED (3 VP vs 5 VP)
2. Our resource position is weak with only 4 total resources
3. We need to either disrupt RED's progress or accelerate our own

## Step 6: Decision
The Monopoly card is a powerful tool, but its effectiveness depends on RED having the resource we target. Given that RED has the longest road and is likely expanding further, they probably have Wood or Brick. Using Monopoly on either could:
1. Gain us needed resources
2. Disrupt RED's expansion plans

Since RED has 4 cards and the robber is on the Brick hex, there's a decent chance RED has been collecting Wood to pair with any Brick they get. Brick is also valuable because it's more scarce than Wood generally.

<plan>
1. Use Monopoly on Brick to potentially disrupt RED's expansion
2. If successful, use acquired resources to build roads toward promising settlement locations
3. Focus on expanding north from node 13 toward ports
4. Continue working toward development cards to challenge RED's lead
</plan>

Given our limited information about RED's hand, playing Monopoly for Brick gives us the best chance to both gain resources and disrupt RED's strategy.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Target hexes with HIGH probability numbers (6,8,5,9) - prioritize these above all else
- Go for resource DIVERSITY: secure ALL five resources between your two settlements
- Focus on ORE and WHEAT for city upgrades (numbers 5-9 preferred)
- Evaluate each potential settlement by its TOTAL PIP COUNT (sum of probability dots)
- Place your initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Avoid placing both settlements near the same resources - diversify your income!
- Always consider 3:1 ports if your initial placement gives you limited access to certain resources
- Place roads in directions that block opponents' expansion routes

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT & CITY BUILDING PRIORITY:
- FIRST PRIORITY: Build 1-2 additional settlements early to secure critical resources you lack
- SECOND PRIORITY: Upgrade to cities as quickly as possible to double resource production
- THIRD PRIORITY: Build roads only when they lead directly to valuable settlement locations
- Early game (1-5 turns): Secure key settlements at high-value locations
- Mid-game (6-15 turns): Focus heavily on upgrading to cities (2-3 cities should be your target)
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road
- When short on a key resource, use 2:1 ports if available before using 3:1 or 4:1 ports
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat to other players unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- If you have excess of a resource, use ports rather than trading with opponents

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards primarily when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber OR to reach Largest Army (3+ knights)
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city or settlement build
- Use Monopoly cards after high-probability dice rolls to collect maximum resources
- Keep track of how many VP cards you've drawn (5 in the deck total)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn
- When development cards are your path to victory, aim for: 3 cities (6 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 victory cards (2 VP)
- Consider buying development cards when you have limited build options (blocked roads, etc.)

OPTIMAL EXPANSION PATH:
- Build roads with PURPOSE - every road should lead to a viable settlement location
- Identify and secure "bottleneck" positions that cut off opponents' expansion
- Expand toward resources you LACK from initial placement - seek balance
- When choosing between multiple settlement spots, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (total pip count)
  2. Access to resources you currently lack
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, securing future expansion)
  4. Proximity to useful ports
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Longest road (2 VP) requires strategic planning - only pursue if you already have 4+ roads built

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- When someone has 8+ points, ALWAYS target them with the robber regardless of other factors
- If you're being targeted by the robber, consider using knight cards immediately to protect production

TURN-BY-TURN PLANNING:
1. Start each turn by assessing your current VP and opponents' VPs (both visible and potential hidden points)
2. Identify your build priority for this turn: settlement, city, road, or development card?
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for your priority build
4. If you can't build your priority item, determine if trading or buying a development card is better
5. Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card or trade for needed resources
6. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

WINNING PATHS:
1. CITY-FOCUSED PATH: 3-4 cities (6-8 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 9-11 VP
2. BALANCED PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 VP card = 10 VP
3. DEVELOPMENT PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP

NEVER SAY NO TO FREE VPs:
- Always account for the 2 VP from longest road and largest army in your plans
- These special cards are EASY to lose if you're not defending them
- Invest in roads/knights to maintain your lead if these VPs are part of your strategy
- Be alert for opponents trying to steal these bonus points

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game Analysis for Blue Player

## Current Game State Assessment
- I'm at 3 VP with 3 settlements
- RED is at 5 VP with 3 settlements and longest road (+2 VP)
- I have 1 wood, 1 brick, 1 sheep, 1 ore - exact resources needed for a road
- The robber is on the brick hex at (0,0,0), limiting production

## Resource Analysis
My settlements produce:
- Node 4: Brick(8), Wheat(11), Wheat(10) - good wheat production but brick is blocked
- Node 13: Wheat(11), Wood(11), Sheep(8) - balanced production
- Node 35: Sheep(8) - single resource but high probability

## Available Options
I can either build a road or end my turn. I have exactly 1 wood and 1 brick needed for road building.

## Road Building Options Analysis
Let's analyze each road option:
1. Edge (13, 14) - extends from my settlement at node 13 toward sheep(8) production
2. Edge (15, 17) - connects toward desert and brick(9)
3. Edge (2, 3) - extends from wheat/brick area
4. Edge (4, 5) - extends from my settlement at node 4
5. Edge (33, 34) - connects toward wood/ore areas
6. Edge (14, 15) - connects central areas with wheat production
7. Edge (36, 37) - extends from brick port area
8. Edge (3, 12) - connects central areas

## Strategic Priorities
1. I need to catch up to RED who has a 2 VP lead
2. I should aim for either longest road (challenging as RED has 10 segments) or largest army
3. I need to expand my resource production, particularly ore which I'm lacking

## Decision Process
- Building a new settlement is my priority for VP and resource diversity
- I should build roads that lead toward valuable settlement locations
- I should focus on reaching ore-producing hexes as I'm lacking ore production
- I notice I have access to the brick port at nodes 35, 36

Looking at the map and connectivity:
- Option 7 (36, 37) extends from my brick port access toward sheep(8) area
- Option 1 (13, 14) extends from my settlement at node 13 with good production
- Option 5 (33, 34) could help me secure wood/ore areas which would be valuable

<plan>
1. Build road at (13, 14) to expand toward promising settlement locations
2. Focus on securing an ore-producing hex for future city upgrades
3. Consider development card strategy as an alternative to longest road (RED has strong lead)
4. Try to establish another settlement near high-value hexes
</plan>

Based on careful analysis, I believe road option 1 - building at edge (13, 14) - is most strategic as it:
- Extends from my productive settlement at node 13
- Moves me toward potential high-value settlement locations
- Could eventually help secure ore resources I'm lacking

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Target hexes with HIGH probability numbers (6,8,5,9) - prioritize these above all else
- Go for resource DIVERSITY: secure ALL five resources between your two settlements
- Focus on ORE and WHEAT for city upgrades (numbers 5-9 preferred)
- Evaluate each potential settlement by its TOTAL PIP COUNT (sum of probability dots)
- Place your initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Avoid placing both settlements near the same resources - diversify your income!
- Always consider 3:1 ports if your initial placement gives you limited access to certain resources
- Place roads in directions that block opponents' expansion routes

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT & CITY BUILDING PRIORITY:
- FIRST PRIORITY: Build 1-2 additional settlements early to secure critical resources you lack
- SECOND PRIORITY: Upgrade to cities as quickly as possible to double resource production
- THIRD PRIORITY: Build roads only when they lead directly to valuable settlement locations
- Early game (1-5 turns): Secure key settlements at high-value locations
- Mid-game (6-15 turns): Focus heavily on upgrading to cities (2-3 cities should be your target)
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road
- When short on a key resource, use 2:1 ports if available before using 3:1 or 4:1 ports
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat to other players unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- If you have excess of a resource, use ports rather than trading with opponents

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards primarily when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber OR to reach Largest Army (3+ knights)
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city or settlement build
- Use Monopoly cards after high-probability dice rolls to collect maximum resources
- Keep track of how many VP cards you've drawn (5 in the deck total)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn
- When development cards are your path to victory, aim for: 3 cities (6 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 victory cards (2 VP)
- Consider buying development cards when you have limited build options (blocked roads, etc.)

OPTIMAL EXPANSION PATH:
- Build roads with PURPOSE - every road should lead to a viable settlement location
- Identify and secure "bottleneck" positions that cut off opponents' expansion
- Expand toward resources you LACK from initial placement - seek balance
- When choosing between multiple settlement spots, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (total pip count)
  2. Access to resources you currently lack
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, securing future expansion)
  4. Proximity to useful ports
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Longest road (2 VP) requires strategic planning - only pursue if you already have 4+ roads built

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- When someone has 8+ points, ALWAYS target them with the robber regardless of other factors
- If you're being targeted by the robber, consider using knight cards immediately to protect production

TURN-BY-TURN PLANNING:
1. Start each turn by assessing your current VP and opponents' VPs (both visible and potential hidden points)
2. Identify your build priority for this turn: settlement, city, road, or development card?
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for your priority build
4. If you can't build your priority item, determine if trading or buying a development card is better
5. Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card or trade for needed resources
6. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

WINNING PATHS:
1. CITY-FOCUSED PATH: 3-4 cities (6-8 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 9-11 VP
2. BALANCED PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 VP card = 10 VP
3. DEVELOPMENT PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP

NEVER SAY NO TO FREE VPs:
- Always account for the 2 VP from longest road and largest army in your plans
- These special cards are EASY to lose if you're not defending them
- Invest in roads/knights to maintain your lead if these VPs are part of your strategy
- Be alert for opponents trying to steal these bonus points

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game Analysis

Let me analyze our current game state carefully:

## Victory Points
- BLUE (us): 3 VP (3 settlements)
- RED: 5 VP (3 settlements + Longest Road bonus)

## Resources
We have: 1 WOOD, 1 SHEEP, 2 WHEAT, 1 ORE

## Position Analysis
- RED has a strong lead with 5 VP and Longest Road (10 segments vs our 4)
- We have 3 settlements but no cities
- Our settlement at node 4 produces brick, wheat
- Our settlement at node 13 produces wheat, wood, sheep
- Our settlement at node 35 produces sheep
- We lack strong ore production, which will limit city upgrades
- The robber is on the brick hex at (0,0,0), blocking brick production

## Available Actions
1. Buy a development card (1 SHEEP, 1 WHEAT, 1 ORE)
2. End turn

## Strategic Considerations

Our current position is challenging - we're behind by 2 VP and RED has the longest road bonus. Looking at our resource production, we're missing strong ore production which will make city upgrades difficult.

Given our limited options this turn, buying a development card seems worthwhile for several reasons:
1. Potential for a Victory Point card (immediate hidden point)
2. Potential for a Knight card (moves toward Largest Army)
3. Utility cards (Year of Plenty, Monopoly, Road Building) would help us catch up
4. Spending resources prevents loss if a 7 is rolled
5. RED has 6 hidden cards - they may be close to building

<plan>
1. Buy a development card this turn
2. Save any Knight cards to build toward Largest Army (2 VP)
3. Focus on getting resources for another settlement to improve production
4. Long-term, aim for city upgrades once we secure better ore production
5. Consider development card strategy (knights + VP cards) as our primary path to victory
</plan>

The development card is our only build option this turn and has strategic value. Even if we don't draw an immediate VP card, any other card will help us catch up.

# Game State Analysis

Let me carefully analyze my position and available options:

## Current Game State
- I have 3 Victory Points (3 settlements)
- RED has 5 Victory Points (3 settlements + Longest Road bonus)
- Resources: 1 wood, 1 brick, 2 sheep
- I have 1 hidden Victory Point card

## Resource Analysis
- I have the exact resources needed to build a road (1 wood, 1 brick)
- I don't have resources for a settlement (wood, brick, sheep, wheat) or a city (ore, ore, ore, wheat, wheat)
- I don't have resources for a development card (sheep, ore, wheat)

## Strategic Position
- RED has Longest Road with 10 segments - very difficult for me to overcome
- No player has Largest Army yet - opportunity for me
- I have 8 roads built with longest chain of 4 - far from challenging Longest Road

## Available Options

1. **Build a Road** (Options 1-8)
   - I have exactly the resources needed for one road
   - Building a road could potentially lead to new settlement spots
   - Would improve my position for future expansion

2. **End Turn** (Option 0)
   - Save resources for more meaningful builds next turn

Let me evaluate the road placement options to see which provides the best strategic value:

- Option 1: edge (15, 17) - Extends toward eastern part of the board
- Option 2: edge (2, 3) - Extends from my settlement at node 4
- Option 3: edge (14, 37) - Connects to my settlement at node 35
- Option 4: edge (4, 5) - Extends from my settlement at node 4
- Option 5: edge (33, 34) - Near my settlement at node 13
- Option 6: edge (14, 15) - Connects to my settlement at node 13
- Option 7: edge (36, 37) - Near my settlement at node 35
- Option 8: edge (3, 12) - Connects nodes 3 and 12

Looking at the board structure and my current settlements, I need to prioritize roads that lead to valuable settlement locations. I currently lack ore in my production, which is crucial for city upgrades.

<plan>
1. Build roads strategically toward potential settlement locations with ore production
2. Focus on securing a settlement spot with good ore production
3. Then work toward Largest Army (2 VP) through development cards
4. Long-term aim for city upgrades once we improve ore production
5. Complete victory through settlements, cities, Largest Army, and my VP card
</plan>

Option 3 (edge 14, 37) connects to my settlement at node 35 and appears to extend toward potential ore production areas. This would help me secure better positions for future settlements.

Based on this analysis, I choose:

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Target hexes with HIGH probability numbers (6,8,5,9) - prioritize these above all else
- Go for resource DIVERSITY: secure ALL five resources between your two settlements
- Focus on ORE and WHEAT for city upgrades (numbers 5-9 preferred)
- Evaluate each potential settlement by its TOTAL PIP COUNT (sum of probability dots)
- Place your initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Avoid placing both settlements near the same resources - diversify your income!
- Always consider 3:1 ports if your initial placement gives you limited access to certain resources
- Place roads in directions that block opponents' expansion routes

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT & CITY BUILDING PRIORITY:
- FIRST PRIORITY: Build 1-2 additional settlements early to secure critical resources you lack
- SECOND PRIORITY: Upgrade to cities as quickly as possible to double resource production
- THIRD PRIORITY: Build roads only when they lead directly to valuable settlement locations
- Early game (1-5 turns): Secure key settlements at high-value locations
- Mid-game (6-15 turns): Focus heavily on upgrading to cities (2-3 cities should be your target)
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road
- When short on a key resource, use 2:1 ports if available before using 3:1 or 4:1 ports
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat to other players unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- If you have excess of a resource, use ports rather than trading with opponents

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards primarily when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber OR to reach Largest Army (3+ knights)
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city or settlement build
- Use Monopoly cards after high-probability dice rolls to collect maximum resources
- Keep track of how many VP cards you've drawn (5 in the deck total)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn
- When development cards are your path to victory, aim for: 3 cities (6 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 victory cards (2 VP)
- Consider buying development cards when you have limited build options (blocked roads, etc.)

OPTIMAL EXPANSION PATH:
- Build roads with PURPOSE - every road should lead to a viable settlement location
- Identify and secure "bottleneck" positions that cut off opponents' expansion
- Expand toward resources you LACK from initial placement - seek balance
- When choosing between multiple settlement spots, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (total pip count)
  2. Access to resources you currently lack
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, securing future expansion)
  4. Proximity to useful ports
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Longest road (2 VP) requires strategic planning - only pursue if you already have 4+ roads built

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- When someone has 8+ points, ALWAYS target them with the robber regardless of other factors
- If you're being targeted by the robber, consider using knight cards immediately to protect production

TURN-BY-TURN PLANNING:
1. Start each turn by assessing your current VP and opponents' VPs (both visible and potential hidden points)
2. Identify your build priority for this turn: settlement, city, road, or development card?
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for your priority build
4. If you can't build your priority item, determine if trading or buying a development card is better
5. Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card or trade for needed resources
6. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

WINNING PATHS:
1. CITY-FOCUSED PATH: 3-4 cities (6-8 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 9-11 VP
2. BALANCED PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 VP card = 10 VP
3. DEVELOPMENT PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP

NEVER SAY NO TO FREE VPs:
- Always account for the 2 VP from longest road and largest army in your plans
- These special cards are EASY to lose if you're not defending them
- Invest in roads/knights to maintain your lead if these VPs are part of your strategy
- Be alert for opponents trying to steal these bonus points

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game State Analysis

Let me think through this move carefully, as this is a critical robber placement decision.

## Current Game State
- I'm BLUE with 3 VP (+ 1 hidden VP card = 4 VP total)
- RED has 7 VP and Longest Road bonus (+2 VP)
- RED is 3 points ahead (7 vs 4) and close to winning
- I have 1 🧱BRICK and 1 🐑SHEEP
- RED has 4 hidden cards
- RED has strong production with 1 city and 3 settlements

## Robber Placement Strategy
The most strategic move is to place the robber on a high-value hex that:
1. Blocks RED's most crucial production
2. Allows me to steal a resource
3. Disrupts RED's ability to reach 10 points quickly

Looking at RED's buildings:
- 🏙️ at node 1: produces 🧱8[⭐⭐⭐], 🐑9[⭐⭐], 🌲5[⭐⭐]
- 🏠 at node 11: produces 🐑6[⭐⭐⭐], ⛏️6[⭐⭐⭐], 🌲11[⭐]
- 🏠 at node 22: produces 🌲5[⭐⭐], 🌾3[⭐], 🌲4[⭐]
- 🏠 at node 7: produces 🐑9[⭐⭐], 🐑10[⭐], 🌲5[⭐⭐]

The most valuable hexes for RED are:
- 🧱8: High probability brick (city production)
- ⛏️6: High probability ore (important for cities)
- 🐑6 & 🐑9: High probability sheep
- 🌲5: Multiple settlements on this hex

## Optimal Robber Placement
Looking at the options:
- [0] Move robber to (0, 0, 0) and steal from RED - This is the 🧱8 hex that powers RED's city
- [8] Move robber to (0, -2, 2) and steal from RED - This is the ⛏️6 hex 
- [2] Move robber to (0, -1, 1) and steal from RED - This is the 🐑6 hex

The most strategic option is [0] to block the 🧱8 hex:
1. It blocks highest probability resource from RED's city (double production)
2. Brick is critical for road building (RED has longest road)
3. It allows me to steal a resource from RED
4. It impacts RED's most powerful settlement/city

<plan>
1. Disrupt RED's resource production by targeting their high-production hexes
2. Focus on building roads toward potential settlement locations with ore production
3. Work toward Largest Army (2 VP) through development cards
4. Upgrade to cities once ore production improves
5. Complete victory through settlements, cities, Largest Army, and my VP card
</plan>

# Game Analysis for Settlers of Catan

Let me carefully analyze the current game state to make the optimal decision.

## Current Game Status Assessment
- **My position (BLUE)**: 3 VP (3 settlements)
- **Opponent (RED)**: 7 VP (3 settlements, 1 city, longest road bonus)
- **Resources I have**: 1 🧱Brick, 1 🐑Sheep, 1 🌾Wheat, 1 ⛏️Ore
- **Development cards**: 1 Victory Point card (hidden)
- **Available actions**: Buy development card or end turn

## Strategic Analysis

RED is at 7 VP and clearly in the lead with:
- 3 settlements (3 VP)
- 1 city (2 VP)
- Longest road (2 VP)

I'm at 3 VP from settlements plus a hidden VP card, so effectively at 4 VP. I need 6 more points to win.

Looking at my resources, I can buy a development card with 1 sheep, 1 wheat, and 1 ore. This is a strategic opportunity because:

1. I could draw a Victory Point card, bringing me to 5 VP total
2. I could draw a Knight card, which would help me work toward Largest Army (2 VP)
3. I could draw a Road Building, Monopoly, or Year of Plenty, which would help me advance my position

The robber is currently on the brick hex (0,0,0), which is affecting RED's brick production at node 1. Since brick isn't critical for my city-focused strategy (ore and wheat are more important), this placement is acceptable.

## Decision

Since I have exactly the resources needed to buy a development card, and RED is 3 points ahead of me, I should take the risk for the potential reward. Development cards offer a path to victory through either VP cards or knights for Largest Army.

<plan>
1. Buy a development card now to potentially get Knight or VP
2. Focus on building knights to get Largest Army (2 VP)
3. Work toward upgrading settlements to cities (need ore and wheat)
4. Use the robber strategically to block RED's resource production
5. Complete victory through settlements, cities, Largest Army, and VP cards
</plan>

Based on this analysis, I should:

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Target hexes with HIGH probability numbers (6,8,5,9) - prioritize these above all else
- Go for resource DIVERSITY: secure ALL five resources between your two settlements
- Focus on ORE and WHEAT for city upgrades (numbers 5-9 preferred)
- Evaluate each potential settlement by its TOTAL PIP COUNT (sum of probability dots)
- Place your initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Avoid placing both settlements near the same resources - diversify your income!
- Always consider 3:1 ports if your initial placement gives you limited access to certain resources
- Place roads in directions that block opponents' expansion routes

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT & CITY BUILDING PRIORITY:
- FIRST PRIORITY: Build 1-2 additional settlements early to secure critical resources you lack
- SECOND PRIORITY: Upgrade to cities as quickly as possible to double resource production
- THIRD PRIORITY: Build roads only when they lead directly to valuable settlement locations
- Early game (1-5 turns): Secure key settlements at high-value locations
- Mid-game (6-15 turns): Focus heavily on upgrading to cities (2-3 cities should be your target)
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road
- When short on a key resource, use 2:1 ports if available before using 3:1 or 4:1 ports
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat to other players unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- If you have excess of a resource, use ports rather than trading with opponents

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards primarily when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber OR to reach Largest Army (3+ knights)
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city or settlement build
- Use Monopoly cards after high-probability dice rolls to collect maximum resources
- Keep track of how many VP cards you've drawn (5 in the deck total)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn
- When development cards are your path to victory, aim for: 3 cities (6 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 victory cards (2 VP)
- Consider buying development cards when you have limited build options (blocked roads, etc.)

OPTIMAL EXPANSION PATH:
- Build roads with PURPOSE - every road should lead to a viable settlement location
- Identify and secure "bottleneck" positions that cut off opponents' expansion
- Expand toward resources you LACK from initial placement - seek balance
- When choosing between multiple settlement spots, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (total pip count)
  2. Access to resources you currently lack
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, securing future expansion)
  4. Proximity to useful ports
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Longest road (2 VP) requires strategic planning - only pursue if you already have 4+ roads built

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- When someone has 8+ points, ALWAYS target them with the robber regardless of other factors
- If you're being targeted by the robber, consider using knight cards immediately to protect production

TURN-BY-TURN PLANNING:
1. Start each turn by assessing your current VP and opponents' VPs (both visible and potential hidden points)
2. Identify your build priority for this turn: settlement, city, road, or development card?
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for your priority build
4. If you can't build your priority item, determine if trading or buying a development card is better
5. Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card or trade for needed resources
6. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

WINNING PATHS:
1. CITY-FOCUSED PATH: 3-4 cities (6-8 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 9-11 VP
2. BALANCED PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 VP card = 10 VP
3. DEVELOPMENT PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP

NEVER SAY NO TO FREE VPs:
- Always account for the 2 VP from longest road and largest army in your plans
- These special cards are EASY to lose if you're not defending them
- Invest in roads/knights to maintain your lead if these VPs are part of your strategy
- Be alert for opponents trying to steal these bonus points

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Buy a development card now to potentially get Knight or VP
2. Focus on building knights to get Largest Army (2 VP)

5. Complete victory through settlements, cities, Largest Army, and VP cards

# Analyzing the Game State

Let me carefully analyze the current game state to make the best strategic decision.

## Current Position Assessment:
- I (BLUE) have 3 visible VP (3 settlements)
- I have 1 hidden VP from a development card
- RED has 7 visible VP (3 settlements, 1 city, and Longest Road bonus)
- RED is dangerously close to winning with 7/10 VP
- I have limited resources (1 brick, 1 wheat)
- I have a Knight card available to play
- The robber is currently on the brick hex (0,0,0)

## Options Analysis:

**Option 0: Play Knight card**
- Advantages:
  - I can move the robber from the brick hex to a valuable RED production hex
  - I can steal a resource from RED
  - Playing the Knight advances me toward Largest Army (2 VP)
  - Disrupts RED's production when they're close to winning

**Option 1: Roll the dice**
- Advantages:
  - Could potentially get more resources for building
- Disadvantages:
  - Risk of 7 (which forces discard if RED has >7 cards, but also moves the robber)
  - RED is at 7 VP and likely close to winning, so giving them more resources is risky
  - With only 1 brick and 1 wheat, I can't build anything significant right now

## Strategic Considerations:
1. RED is 3 VP ahead and has Longest Road
2. I need to slow RED down while accelerating my own path to victory
3. I already have 2 Knights played, so I'm on track for Largest Army (needs 3+)
4. Moving the robber will disrupt RED's resource production

<plan>
1. Play Knight to move robber to RED's high-value resource production hex
2. Target RED's ore or wheat production to slow down their city building
3. Continue building knights to secure Largest Army (2 VP)
4. Look to upgrade settlements to cities as my next priority
5. Win through settlements, cities, Largest Army, and my hidden VP card
</plan>

Given RED is at 7 VP and the urgency to slow them down while advancing my own position, playing the Knight card is clearly the optimal move. It disrupts RED's production, advances me toward Largest Army, and gives me an additional resource.

# Analysis of Game State and Robber Placement

First, let me assess the current game state:
- I have 3 VP (3 settlements + 1 hidden VP card)
- RED has 7 VP (3 settlements, 1 city, and longest road)
- RED is only 3 points away from winning
- I've just played a Knight card, allowing me to move the robber

## Strategic Priority
RED is clearly ahead with 7 VP to my 4 VP (including my hidden VP card). They have longest road and are likely working toward more settlements or cities. I need to slow them down as much as possible.

## Robber Placement Analysis

I need to target RED's most valuable production to slow their progress. Let's examine RED's buildings and their production:

1. RED has a city at node 1: produces 🧱8[⭐⭐⭐], 🐑9[⭐⭐], 🌲5[⭐⭐]
2. RED has a settlement at node 11: produces 🐑6[⭐⭐⭐], ⛏️6[⭐⭐⭐], 🌲11[⭐] 
3. RED has a settlement at node 22: produces 🌲5[⭐⭐], 🌾3[⭐], 🌲4[⭐]
4. RED has a settlement at node 7: produces 🐑9[⭐⭐], 🐑10[⭐], 🌲5[⭐⭐]

Looking at these, I notice:
- RED's city at node 1 produces brick (8), sheep (9), and wood (5)
- RED gets ore from hex ⛏️6 at node 11 (highly valuable)
- RED has strong production of sheep from multiple nodes

Since RED has 7 VP already and likely needs ore and wheat to build more cities, I should target their ore production. Looking at my robber options:

Option [8] allows me to move the robber to (0, -2, 2) which is the ore 6 hex, blocking RED's only ore production while also stealing from them.

This is the optimal play because:
1. It blocks a high-probability number (6 = ⭐⭐⭐)
2. It blocks ore, which RED needs for cities and development cards
3. It lets me steal a card from RED
4. It doesn't hurt my own production

<plan>
1. Move robber to RED's ore 6 hex to block their city-building capability
2. Continue building knights to secure Largest Army (2 VP)
3. Work toward upgrading my settlements to cities
4. Consider road-building to challenge RED's longest road
5. Win through settlements, cities, largest army and my hidden VP card
</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Target hexes with HIGH probability numbers (6,8,5,9) - prioritize these above all else
- Go for resource DIVERSITY: secure ALL five resources between your two settlements
- Focus on ORE and WHEAT for city upgrades (numbers 5-9 preferred)
- Evaluate each potential settlement by its TOTAL PIP COUNT (sum of probability dots)
- Place your initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Avoid placing both settlements near the same resources - diversify your income!
- Always consider 3:1 ports if your initial placement gives you limited access to certain resources
- Place roads in directions that block opponents' expansion routes

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT & CITY BUILDING PRIORITY:
- FIRST PRIORITY: Build 1-2 additional settlements early to secure critical resources you lack
- SECOND PRIORITY: Upgrade to cities as quickly as possible to double resource production
- THIRD PRIORITY: Build roads only when they lead directly to valuable settlement locations
- Early game (1-5 turns): Secure key settlements at high-value locations
- Mid-game (6-15 turns): Focus heavily on upgrading to cities (2-3 cities should be your target)
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road
- When short on a key resource, use 2:1 ports if available before using 3:1 or 4:1 ports
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat to other players unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- If you have excess of a resource, use ports rather than trading with opponents

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards primarily when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber OR to reach Largest Army (3+ knights)
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city or settlement build
- Use Monopoly cards after high-probability dice rolls to collect maximum resources
- Keep track of how many VP cards you've drawn (5 in the deck total)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn
- When development cards are your path to victory, aim for: 3 cities (6 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 victory cards (2 VP)
- Consider buying development cards when you have limited build options (blocked roads, etc.)

OPTIMAL EXPANSION PATH:
- Build roads with PURPOSE - every road should lead to a viable settlement location
- Identify and secure "bottleneck" positions that cut off opponents' expansion
- Expand toward resources you LACK from initial placement - seek balance
- When choosing between multiple settlement spots, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (total pip count)
  2. Access to resources you currently lack
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, securing future expansion)
  4. Proximity to useful ports
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Longest road (2 VP) requires strategic planning - only pursue if you already have 4+ roads built

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- When someone has 8+ points, ALWAYS target them with the robber regardless of other factors
- If you're being targeted by the robber, consider using knight cards immediately to protect production

TURN-BY-TURN PLANNING:
1. Start each turn by assessing your current VP and opponents' VPs (both visible and potential hidden points)
2. Identify your build priority for this turn: settlement, city, road, or development card?
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for your priority build
4. If you can't build your priority item, determine if trading or buying a development card is better
5. Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card or trade for needed resources
6. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

WINNING PATHS:
1. CITY-FOCUSED PATH: 3-4 cities (6-8 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 9-11 VP
2. BALANCED PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 VP card = 10 VP
3. DEVELOPMENT PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP

NEVER SAY NO TO FREE VPs:
- Always account for the 2 VP from longest road and largest army in your plans
- These special cards are EASY to lose if you're not defending them
- Invest in roads/knights to maintain your lead if these VPs are part of your strategy
- Be alert for opponents trying to steal these bonus points

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game State Analysis

I need to carefully analyze my position and the available options:

## Current Victory Points Breakdown:
- Me (BLUE): 3 VP (3 settlements) + 1 hidden VP card = 4 VP
- RED: 7 VP (3 settlements + 1 city + Longest Road bonus)

## Resource Analysis:
- I have: 1 🌲WOOD, 1 🧱BRICK, 1 🌾WHEAT
- This allows me to build exactly one road

## Strategic Options:

### 1. Road Building Options
I can build one road with my current resources. Let me evaluate each possible road location:

- Option [1] edge (37, 38): Extends toward a 3:1 port
- Option [2] edge (15, 17): Connects toward potential settlement locations
- Option [3] edge (2, 3): Connects toward my settlement at node 4
- Option [4] edge (4, 5): Extends from my settlement at node 4
- Option [5] edge (33, 34): Extends from my existing road network
- Option [6] edge (14, 15): Connects toward center of board
- Option [7] edge (36, 37): Extends toward 3:1 port from my settlement at node 35
- Option [8] edge (3, 12): Connects settlements

### 2. End Turn
If I don't build a road, I'd be saving resources for potentially better options next turn.

## Strategic Considerations:

1. **Challenging Longest Road**: RED has 10 road segments and Longest Road bonus (2 VP). I only have 5 connected segments currently. Building more roads could eventually challenge this, but would require significant investment.

2. **Resource Production**: I need to focus on getting more resources, particularly ore for upgrading to cities.

3. **Blocking RED**: RED is at 7 VP and getting close to winning. I should consider blocking their expansion if possible.

<plan>
1. Focus on upgrading settlements to cities to increase production
2. Build roads strategically to potentially contest Longest Road
3. Continue building knights to secure Largest Army (2 VP)
4. Win through city upgrades, largest army and my hidden VP card
</plan>

My best option is to build a road that will help me expand my network and potentially open up new settlement locations or work toward challenging RED's longest road. Looking at the options, road option [1] at edge (37, 38) seems most strategic as it extends from my settlement at node 35 toward a 3:1 port, which could help with resource conversion in the future and continues building my road network.

RESPONSE:
I'll analyze this game state carefully to determine the optimal robber placement.

First, let's understand the situation:
- I (BLUE) have 3 visible VP + 1 hidden VP = 4 VP total
- RED has 9 VP and is one point away from winning
- RED has 7 hidden resource cards
- I need to place the robber in a way that most disrupts RED's path to victory

Strategic considerations:
1. Target RED's most valuable production
2. Block a resource RED likely needs for their final move
3. Maximize my chances of stealing a useful resource

Let me analyze RED's settlements and cities to see which hexes produce the most for them:
- RED has 🏙️ at node 1: produces 🧱8[⭐⭐⭐], 🐑9[⭐⭐], 🌲5[⭐⭐]
- RED has access to multiple high-value hexes (8, 9, 6)

Looking at RED's buildings and the board state, RED could win by:
- Building another settlement (needs 🧱 + 🌲 + 🐑 + 🌾)
- Upgrading a settlement to a city (needs 2 🌾 + 3 ⛏️)
- Buying a development card that could be a victory point (needs 🐑 + 🌾 + ⛏️)

The highest value production hexes for RED are:
- 🧱8 (0,0,0): Most productive brick for RED's city at node 1
- ⛏️6 (0,-2,2): High-value ore production at node 29
- 🐑6 (0,-1,1): High-value sheep production at node 11

Given that RED needs just 1 more point to win and has 7 cards, they may be just 1-2 cards away from their winning move. Blocking their highest production is critical.

Option [0] targets the 🧱8 hex at (0,0,0) which:
1. Blocks a high-probability (8) brick hex
2. Affects RED's city at node 1 (their most valuable building)
3. Allows me to steal from RED
4. Brick could be a crucial resource for RED to build their final settlement/road

Option [1] targets 🐑9 at (1,-1,0) which produces for two of RED's settlements.

Looking at all options, option [0] appears optimal as it blocks the highest probability resource (8) that feeds directly into RED's city, maximizing disruption to their production while giving me a chance to steal a needed resource.

<plan>
1. Disrupt RED's production by targeting key resources
2. Focus on building settlements at strategic locations to increase production
3. Build knights to defend against the robber and work toward largest army
4. Win through city upgrades, largest army and my hidden VP card
</plan>
