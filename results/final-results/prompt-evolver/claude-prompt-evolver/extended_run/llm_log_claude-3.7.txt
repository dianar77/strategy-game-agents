You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist with expert development card planning. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Focus heavily on ore and wheat hexes for your initial settlements
- Place settlements on intersections of complementary resources (ore/wheat or wood/brick)
- Between your two settlements, secure at least one good source of each critical resource: ore, wheat, and sheep
- If you must sacrifice a resource, make it brick (unless a brick-port is available)
- Place initial roads toward valuable future expansion areas or resource-rich areas
- Consider ports that match resources you expect to produce in abundance (especially sheep)
- Avoid placing settlements that will be trapped with no expansion opportunities

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY (PRIMARY PATH TO VICTORY):
- Buy development cards whenever you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Development cards provide hidden victory points and tactical advantages
- Use knights strategically to protect your high-producing hexes from the robber
- Save knight cards for when your high-production hexes are blocked by the robber
- Time monopoly cards for when opponents likely have accumulated resources you need
- Use Year of Plenty cards to complete crucial builds when you're short specific resources
- Aggressively pursue largest army (2 VP) if you've already played 2 or more knights
- Aim to secure 3-4 victory point cards throughout the game for a surprise win
- Keep your victory points hidden until you can win in a single turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Early-game: Secure minimal expansion to reach critical resource spots or ports
- Mid-game: Focus heavily on ore and wheat to upgrade settlements to cities
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each potential build (cities give best return)
- Target 2-3 cities before extensive road building, unless going for longest road
- Avoid accumulating 7+ resources before dice rolls
- Never make trades that directly help opponents score immediate points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Avoid placing the robber where it equally hurts all players - be strategic
- Don't place the robber on resources you're deficient in - this reduces trading options
- Consider the timing of knight cards - save them for critical moments

PATH TO VICTORY PLANNING:
- Primary Win Path: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 10 VP
- Alternative Win Path: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + victory point cards (4 VP) = 10 VP
- Always track your potential hidden victory points vs. visible points
- If you have development cards giving you hidden points, focus on resource gathering
- When you're close to 10 points, calculate whether to reveal victory points immediately
- Keep track of your opponent's visible points AND potential hidden points
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads only when they lead to valuable settlement locations
- Prioritize settlements that increase your resource diversity or production probability
- Secure key ports that complement your resource production
- Block opponents' critical expansion paths
- Calculate whether longest road (2 VP) is worth the resource investment
- For each settlement expansion, evaluate whether the resources gained justify the cost

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Is there a faster path to 10 victory points?
2. Are development cards a more efficient way to get victory points right now?
3. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
4. Will this action help or hinder your opponent's strategy?
5. Do you have enough resources to execute your plan for the next few turns?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)================================== Ai Message ==================================

Sharpen your Catan strategy by making strategic trades. Avoid making deals that primarily benefit your opponents, as each resource you give them brings them closer to winning. Instead, wait for fair trades that can benefit both parties (especially you). Trading is key to conquering Catan, but be patient.

Strike a 4:1 deal at the bank.

Position yourself near 2:1 or 3:1 ports.

Upgrade settlements into cities.

Get lucky with Victory Points.

Rather than attempting to collect every resource, it’s generally more effective to focus on only a few resources. The two main ways to do this are the “Wood / Brick” strategy, and the “Ore / Wheat” strategy. [...] Let’s start by talking about some of the overall strategies you can take in Catan. The first strategy is the “Balanced Approach”. In this strategy you are simply trying to diversify your resources as much as possible by placing your settlements on a wide variety of resources, with a variety of different numbers. The goal of this strategy is to ensure that you have access to every material in the game, without relying on trading with other players or the bank. This is a very basic strategy that [...] The second resource-based strategy is the “Ore / Wheat” Strategy. This strategy focuses on building cities and buying development cards, and lends itself towards getting the largest army card. By building cities as early as possible you can increase your resource gathering, with the added bonus that your first cities will probably be on your original settlements which should be in prime locations on the board. While you can technically win with only your first two cities, the largest army, and

As a rule of thumb, during your first settlement placement, it’s usually best not to point your road toward the middle of the board. You will likely have no expansion spots since everyone will start toward the middle, rather than the coast.
Anytime your road is in a contestable direction, make sure you’re the one cutting someone off or are more likely to win the race — not the other way around. [...] It is often best to sacrifice a superior spot in exchange for being able to expand toward a good location that is likely to be open. It is much better to have two decent spots than one that’s amazing.

What may be a poor starting placement (i.e. next to a 2 or 12) will often get left open which could be great for a 3rd or 4th settlement placement.
Keep in mind, the fewer people placing their second settlement after you, the more assurance you will have that you won’t get cut off. [...] Think of a Catan map as having 3 areas — the center, inner, and coastal rings. The “center” is all the spots around the middle hex, “inner” is the next one outward, and so on.
For starters, the coast never makes sense for your first placement as it will only have 2 hexes of production (3 for you to build more central) and it will inhibit your optionality to expand.

Do:- keep your options open. This strategy and the Commander are only subtly different, and if you have 3 ore, 2 wheat and 2 sheep early, you might just want to build that city instead of buying two development cards.- secure about same amount of ore as wheat, and 2/3 of this amount of sheep. You really don’t need any brick or wood to speak of when playing this strategy - you'll get all you need from development cards and robbing other players.

Step 9: Producer [...] This strategy focuses on development cards, building other things only as an aside when development and resource cards dictate it. They'll usually end up with the Largest Army card and the lion's share of the victory point cards, and generally make a fabulous nuisance of themselves. This is a great strategy if you have good ore/wheat/sheep balance, but is always fun to play, especially because you'll be dropping the robber all over the place but your board position will appear sufficiently weak [...] - try to avoid trading down to just a few cards with the bank and being stuck unable to build. Chances are, you're doing so for a resource you're finding hard to get and therefore other players will know they can disproportionately hurt you with the robber if they steal it.

Your opponents might actually fall for it occasionally (especially if you've done a good job of monopolizing sheep), and when they don't, grumble loudly about how unreasonable they are and trade away quietly at 2:1 with your port. Obviously, you will never have to trade unfavorably, because you can always use your port.- go for Commander as your secondary strategy. You want more sheep so cities are a good [...] - go for a port. The 3:1 ports are more valuable than they may appear, because with one you can always build something with any hand of 8 cards or more.

The other situational strategy is the “port” strategy, in which you monopolize an advantageous  2-for-1 port and focusing on trading with the bank. This strategy has the disadvantage of giving you fewer resources on your initial settlements (if you place one of them at a port), but can be advantageous if you are able to produce large amounts of the resource you need to trade. Much like the previous strategy, this is only possible for certain configurations of the board – you need access to good [...] production of your tradeable resource near the desired port. In rare instances this strategy can be combined with the monopoly strategy to completely deprive other players of a particular resource by controlling the production of that resource, and trading it through the port rather than with other players. [...] Next is Year of Plenty. Year of Plenty may seem like a bad deal, since it costs 3 resources but only gets you 2. However, I prefer to think of it as the best port deal in the game. Normally you are trading resources with the bank 4-to-1, 3-to-1, or at best 2-to-1, but this card lets you get a 3-for-2 trade for any pair of resources you need!

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Aim for resource diversity: Between your two settlements, secure ALL five resources if possible
- Prioritize ore and wheat for city upgrades, then wood/brick for expansion
- Place settlements at intersections of three hexes, maximizing resource production potential
- Place your two initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to prevent being cut off
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, not toward the center
- Evaluate each potential settlement location by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placing initial settlements near edges that would limit your expansion options

BALANCED GROWTH STRATEGY:
- Early-game: Build 1-2 additional settlements BEFORE upgrading to cities
- Mid-game: Focus on upgrading settlements to cities and strategic development cards
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road depending on game state
- Calculate resource efficiency for each build (VP gained per resources spent)
- Monitor opponents' strategies and adjust accordingly - counter their paths to victory!
- Don't over-commit to one strategy - remain flexible based on resource availability

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads with purpose - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Create "road blocks" to cut off opponents' expansion when strategic
- Connect to valuable ports that complement your resource production - a good port can change your strategy
- Secure at least one 3:1 port early if specific 2:1 ports aren't available
- Don't waste resources on roads that don't lead to immediate settlement spots
- Focus expansion toward resource types you lack in your initial placements

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards strategically, not excessively
- Early development cards: Use only if you lack immediate expansion opportunities
- Mid-game development cards: Use to break resource monopolies or protect key hexes
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to secure critical missing resources for immediate builds
- Monopoly is most effective when played immediately after a high roll for that resource
- Largest army (2 VP) requires 3+ knights - only pursue if you can maintain the lead
- Victory point cards are most valuable when kept hidden until your winning turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible to avoid robber losses
- Don't trade resources that directly enable opponents to build settlements or cities
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for more valuable builds
- If resource-starved, focus on securing that resource through expansion or trades
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-producing hex of the player closest to winning
- Prioritize hexes that produce resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, target players with the resources you need most
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes when possible
- Target hexes with multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact
- Consider robber placement that creates favorable trade scenarios

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY):
1. Build 3-4 total settlements in strong positions 
2. Upgrade 2-3 settlements to cities (4-6 VP total)
3. Secure longest road (2 VP) OR largest army (2 VP)
4. Reach 10 VP through a combination of settlements, cities, and special cards

PATH TO VICTORY (ALTERNATIVE):
1. Focus heavily on ore/wheat production
2. Build 2 cities (4 VP) and maintain 2 settlements (2 VP)
3. Buy strategic development cards for hidden VPs and knights
4. Win with combination of cities, settlements, and largest army

Based on my analysis of the game logs and strategic research, I've made the following key improvements to the prompt:

### 1. Initial Placement Strategy
- Added emphasis on placing settlements on **opposite sides of the board** to prevent being cut off
- Added guidance to avoid placement near board edges and the center which was limiting expansion
- Enhanced focus on evaluating both current value AND future expansion potential

### 2. Balanced Growth Strategy (New Section)
- Added a clear recommendation to build 1-2 additional settlements BEFORE upgrading to cities
- Incorporated a more balanced approach across early, mid, and late game phases
- Added adaptive strategy elements to counter opponents' paths to victory

### 3. Expansion & Road Strategy
- Provided clearer guidance on purposeful road building (our player was building roads without clear settlement targets)
- Added specific advice on creating "road blocks" to cut off opponents
- Emphasized the importance of securing at least one 3:1 port early

### 4. Development Card Strategy
- Reduced emphasis on development cards as the primary path to victory
- Added phase-specific guidance on when to buy and use development cards
- Made the requirements for largest army (3+ knights) more explicit

### 5. Resource Management
- Added more specific guidance on port usage efficiency
- Emphasized the importance of making progress each turn rather than saving resources indefinitely

### Path to Victory
- Added a clearer primary path focusing on balance between expansion and upgrading

Name: read_prompt

You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist with expert development card planning. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Focus heavily on ore and wheat hexes for your initial settlements
- Place settlements on intersections of complementary resources (ore/wheat or wood/brick)
- Between your two settlements, secure at least one good source of each critical resource: ore, wheat, and sheep
- If you must sacrifice a resource, make it brick (unless a brick-port is available)
- Place initial roads toward valuable future expansion areas or resource-rich areas
- Consider ports that match resources you expect to produce in abundance (especially sheep)
- Avoid placing settlements that will be trapped with no expansion opportunities

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY (PRIMARY PATH TO VICTORY):
- Buy development cards whenever you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Development cards provide hidden victory points and tactical advantages
- Use knights strategically to protect your high-producing hexes from the robber
- Save knight cards for when your high-production hexes are blocked by the robber
- Time monopoly cards for when opponents likely have accumulated resources you need
- Use Year of Plenty cards to complete crucial builds when you're short specific resources
- Aggressively pursue largest army (2 VP) if you've already played 2 or more knights
- Aim to secure 3-4 victory point cards throughout the game for a surprise win
- Keep your victory points hidden until you can win in a single turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Early-game: Secure minimal expansion to reach critical resource spots or ports
- Mid-game: Focus heavily on ore and wheat to upgrade settlements to cities
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each potential build (cities give best return)
- Target 2-3 cities before extensive road building, unless going for longest road
- Avoid accumulating 7+ resources before dice rolls
- Never make trades that directly help opponents score immediate points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Avoid placing the robber where it equally hurts all players - be strategic
- Don't place the robber on resources you're deficient in - this reduces trading options
- Consider the timing of knight cards - save them for critical moments

PATH TO VICTORY PLANNING:
- Primary Win Path: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 10 VP
- Alternative Win Path: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + victory point cards (4 VP) = 10 VP
- Always track your potential hidden victory points vs. visible points
- If you have development cards giving you hidden points, focus on resource gathering
- When you're close to 10 points, calculate whether to reveal victory points immediately
- Keep track of your opponent's visible points AND potential hidden points
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads only when they lead to valuable settlement locations
- Prioritize settlements that increase your resource diversity or production probability
- Secure key ports that complement your resource production
- Block opponents' critical expansion paths
- Calculate whether longest road (2 VP) is worth the resource investment
- For each settlement expansion, evaluate whether the resources gained justify the cost

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Is there a faster path to 10 victory points?
2. Are development cards a more efficient way to get victory points right now?
3. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
4. Will this action help or hinder your opponent's strategy?
5. Do you have enough resources to execute your plan for the next few turns?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)================================== Ai Message ==================================

Build 3-4 total settlements in strong positions \n2. Upgrade 2-3 settlements to cities (4-6 VP total)\n3. Secure longest road (2 VP) OR largest army (2 VP)\n4. Reach 10 VP through a combination of settlements, cities, and special cards\n\nPATH TO VICTORY (ALTERNATIVE):\n1. Focus heavily on ore/wheat production\n2. Build 2 cities (4 VP) and maintain 2 settlements (2 VP)\n3. Buy strategic development cards for hidden VPs and knights\n4. Win with combination of cities, settlements, and largest army\n\nBEFORE MAKING A DECISION:\n1. Analyze the board state, including all players' visible points and potential hidden points\n2. Consider whether your move helps your victory path or hinders opponents\n3. Calculate the most resource-efficient build that advances your position\n4.

- try to avoid trading down to just a few cards with the bank and being stuck unable to build. Chances are, you're doing so for a resource you're finding hard to get and therefore other players will know they can disproportionately hurt you with the robber if they steal it.

- preserve juicy settlement locations with judicious road placement. Lock up that port that's critical to your strategy early. Nothing more infuriating than having an opponent beat you to it. [...] Do:- everything you can to get your first city. Liberally trade away sheep/brick/wood to do so. - encourage other players to compete for longest road.- make sure you leave at least one spot open for building a settlement. It is possible to win with 2 cities, largest army and 4 victory point cards, but you'd have to play well and get very lucky.- not get distracted by all that road- and settlement-building. Get those cities out.- hog the ore. Your strategy relies on you having the cities, and [...] This strategy focuses on sprawling across the board, building a long road and settlements along it. Players who like this strategy look for lots of wood and brick in their initial placements. A typical winning combination will involve 2 cities, 4 settlements and longest road.

As a rule of thumb, during your first settlement placement, it’s usually best not to point your road toward the middle of the board. You will likely have no expansion spots since everyone will start toward the middle, rather than the coast.
Anytime your road is in a contestable direction, make sure you’re the one cutting someone off or are more likely to win the race — not the other way around.

Overall, placing your starting settlements wisely will give you a huge advantage in Settlers of Catan. But this is just one of the many strategies that can be employed in the game.

It is very hard to employ all these tactics in every game though, as the board is arranged randomly by the system and your neighbors choices restrict yours.

However, having a good grasp of starting positions and initial placements will help greatly in winning you your next Colonist game. [...] Colonist Strategies: What are the Best Catan Starting Strategies?

Today we will be giving you pointers on the best starting placement strategies for Settlers of Catan that you can use in Colonist.

Colonist.io

1. Identify Your Goals

The first and most important Catan Strategy is knowing what you want to build. This will dictate which resources you should go after when you place your starting settlements. [...] Of course, this is highly contextual and will depend on each game session.

However, looking at your opponents’ spots might just open up opportunities that were not visible to you before.

For example, if all the Bricks on the board are on low-yield numbers like 2-3-4, then that’s a rare resource. Work on acquiring them early on.

5. Work on Expansion as Your Main Focus

Settlers of Catan is a game of conquest. Gaining as much territory as possible is one of the essentials in winning the game.

The concept for the Development Card Strategy is to ignore wood and brick completely when you are placing your initial settlements. Instead, you want, in order, Ore, Wheat, and Sheep. Cities and Development Cards are your friends.  
To achieve 10 victory points, most of the time you'll want to: [...] 3rd Player. Initial placement 5 ore, 4 wheat, 8 wheat, 11 wood, 6 brick. Won. Despite my best efforts to play a Development Card strategy, the best placements for ore and wheat gave me brick and wood, so this one played more like an expansion strategy. I finished with longest road, largest army, 2 cities, 2 settlements, and 1 bonus point.
4th Player. Initial placement 4 ore, 3 wheat, 8 sheep, 5 sheep, 11 sheep. Lost. This strategy is not viable with such low quantities of ore and wheat. [...] 1st Player. Initial placement 6 ore, 11 ore, 4 wheat, 10 wheat, 3 sheep, 9 brick. Lost. I had 9 points and couldn't draw one last point from the development card deck; I had tons of soldiers.
1st Player. Initial placement 4 ore, 9 ore, 11 wheat, 6 sheep, 12 brick. Won. This one was close due to the fact that my total initial resources were only 15. I finished with largest army, 6 points from cities, and 2 bonus.

In a small sample size deviations like these are typical. Your job is to mitigate luck as much as possible, and you can do this by playing the odds (maximizing pips and getting a good distribution of numbers) as best you can when you're placing your settlements.

Step 5: Development Cards

The development card (25) distribution is as follows:

- 14 Knights (56%)- 5 Victory Points (20%)- 2 Monopoly (8%)- 2 Road Building (8%)- 2 Year of Plenty (8%) [...] This strategy focuses on development cards, building other things only as an aside when development and resource cards dictate it. They'll usually end up with the Largest Army card and the lion's share of the victory point cards, and generally make a fabulous nuisance of themselves. This is a great strategy if you have good ore/wheat/sheep balance, but is always fun to play, especially because you'll be dropping the robber all over the place but your board position will appear sufficiently weak [...] Commander: buys 6 development cards to get Largest Army and a victory point, builds 2 roads, 2 settlements and 3 cities. Developer: buys 12 development cards to get Largest Army and 2 victory points, builds 1 settlement and 3 cities.Producer: builds 6 roads, 4 settlements and 4 cities.Explorer: builds 10 roads to get Longest Road, 4 settlements, and 2 cities.Queen of Sheep: replaces all ore needs with sheep, plays Commander, buys 6 development cards to get Largest Army and a victory point,

in this video we're going to go through the development card strategy for Catan so that you can win your next game first part in this strategy is placement now this is the development card strategy so you're going to need wheat sheep and or and these three resources are what you're going to use throughout the game to get development cards so we're going to when you're looking at your first placement try and find a location that is good for that so for example we've got four wheat sheep or sheep [...] to start off with because you want to be wrapping up ranking up your resources but let's say that I was able to trade this to one of my teammates for sheep I'm just gonna place then you'd get another resource card and you've got the start of your army which remember army is only two victory points now a pro of this strategy of focusing on getting development cards is as you're getting development cards there are five victory points in this deck plus you've got the largest army so you have the

    new_text: You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Target hexes with HIGH probability numbers (6,8,5,9) - prioritize these above all else
- Go for resource DIVERSITY: secure ALL five resources between your two settlements
- Focus on ORE and WHEAT for city upgrades (numbers 5-9 preferred)
- Evaluate each potential settlement by its TOTAL PIP COUNT (sum of probability dots)
- Place your initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Avoid placing both settlements near the same resources - diversify your income!
- Always consider 3:1 ports if your initial placement gives you limited access to certain resources
- Place roads in directions that block opponents' expansion routes

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT & CITY BUILDING PRIORITY:
- FIRST PRIORITY: Build 1-2 additional settlements early to secure critical resources you lack
- SECOND PRIORITY: Upgrade to cities as quickly as possible to double resource production
- THIRD PRIORITY: Build roads only when they lead directly to valuable settlement locations
- Early game (1-5 turns): Secure key settlements at high-value locations
- Mid-game (6-15 turns): Focus heavily on upgrading to cities (2-3 cities should be your target)
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road
- When short on a key resource, use 2:1 ports if available before using 3:1 or 4:1 ports
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat to other players unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- If you have excess of a resource, use ports rather than trading with opponents

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards primarily when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber OR to reach Largest Army (3+ knights)
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city or settlement build
- Use Monopoly cards after high-probability dice rolls to collect maximum resources
- Keep track of how many VP cards you've drawn (5 in the deck total)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn
- When development cards are your path to victory, aim for: 3 cities (6 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 victory cards (2 VP)
- Consider buying development cards when you have limited build options (blocked roads, etc.)

OPTIMAL EXPANSION PATH:
- Build roads with PURPOSE - every road should lead to a viable settlement location
- Identify and secure "bottleneck" positions that cut off opponents' expansion
- Expand toward resources you LACK from initial placement - seek balance
- When choosing between multiple settlement spots, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (total pip count)
  2. Access to resources you currently lack
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, securing future expansion)
  4. Proximity to useful ports
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Longest road (2 VP) requires strategic planning - only pursue if you already have 4+ roads built

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- When someone has 8+ points, ALWAYS target them with the robber regardless of other factors
- If you're being targeted by the robber, consider using knight cards immediately to protect production

TURN-BY-TURN PLANNING:
1. Start each turn by assessing your current VP and opponents' VPs (both visible and potential hidden points)
2. Identify your build priority for this turn: settlement, city, road, or development card?
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for your priority build
4. If you can't build your priority item, determine if trading or buying a development card is better
5. Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card or trade for needed resources
6. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

WINNING PATHS:
1. CITY-FOCUSED PATH: 3-4 cities (6-8 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 9-11 VP
2. BALANCED PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 VP card = 10 VP
3. DEVELOPMENT PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP

NEVER SAY NO TO FREE VPs:
- Always account for the 2 VP from longest road and largest army in your plans
- These special cards are EASY to lose if you're not defending them
- Invest in roads/knights to maintain your lead if these VPs are part of your strategy
- Be alert for opponents trying to steal these bonus points

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)================================= Tool Message =================================

current_prompt.txt updated successfully================================== Ai Message ==================================

Based on my analysis of the game logs and research, I've made significant improvements to the prompt for our PromptRefiningLLM_player_C. Here are the key changes:

1. **Enhanced Initial Placement Strategy**
   - Added emphasis on high-probability numbers (6,8,5,9) as the top priority
   - Stressed the importance of total pip count (probability dots) in evaluating settlement locations
   - Recommended placing initial settlements on opposite sides of the board to maximize expansion potential
   - Emphasized the need for resource diversity in initial placements
   - Added strategic advice to avoid placing roads toward the center of the board

2. **Resource Management & City Building Priority**
   - Created a clear 3-step priority system:
     1. Build 1-2 additional settlements early to secure critical resources
     2. Focus on upgrading to cities quickly to double resource production
     3. Only build roads when they lead to valuable settlement locations
   - Added specific guidance for early, mid, and late game resource management
   - Improved port trading strategy with clearer guidance on when to use 2:1, 3:1, and 4:1 trades

3. **Development Card Strategy Refinement**
   - Clarified when to buy development cards (excess resources, limited build options)
   - Added specific advice on using Year of Plenty and Monopoly cards effectively
   - Emphasized knight card strategy for both robber protection and achieving largest army
   - Added a clear path to victory using development cards: 3 cities (6 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 victory cards (2 VP)

4. **Optimal Expansion Path**
   - Added concrete criteria for evaluating settlement locations (probability, resource access, strategic value, ports)
   - Emphasized building roads with purpose - every road should lead to a viable settlement
   - Added strategy for identifying and securing "bottleneck" positions to block opponents

5. **Turn-by-Turn Planning**
   - Created a structured 6-step process for each turn to ensure the player is always making progress
   - Added emphasis on anticipating the next 2-3 turns for better resource planning

6. **Winning Paths**
   - Outlined three clear paths to victory with specific VP calculations:
     - City-focused path
     - Balanced path
     - Development-focused path
   - Added a special section highlighting the importance of the 2 VP from longest road and largest army

These changes should address the weaknesses we identified in the current player's performance, particularly the lack of cities (0.6 vs 2.6), limited strategic road building, and inefficient resource conversion. The prompt now provides clearer guidance on initial placement strategy (which is critical), a stronger focus on city building, and more strategic approaches to expansion and resource management.Evolve Counter: 1

You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist with expert development card planning. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Focus heavily on ore and wheat hexes for your initial settlements
- Place settlements on intersections of complementary resources (ore/wheat or wood/brick)
- Between your two settlements, secure at least one good source of each critical resource: ore, wheat, and sheep
- If you must sacrifice a resource, make it brick (unless a brick-port is available)
- Place initial roads toward valuable future expansion areas or resource-rich areas
- Consider ports that match resources you expect to produce in abundance (especially sheep)
- Avoid placing settlements that will be trapped with no expansion opportunities

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY (PRIMARY PATH TO VICTORY):
- Buy development cards whenever you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Development cards provide hidden victory points and tactical advantages
- Use knights strategically to protect your high-producing hexes from the robber
- Save knight cards for when your high-production hexes are blocked by the robber
- Time monopoly cards for when opponents likely have accumulated resources you need
- Use Year of Plenty cards to complete crucial builds when you're short specific resources
- Aggressively pursue largest army (2 VP) if you've already played 2 or more knights
- Aim to secure 3-4 victory point cards throughout the game for a surprise win
- Keep your victory points hidden until you can win in a single turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Early-game: Secure minimal expansion to reach critical resource spots or ports
- Mid-game: Focus heavily on ore and wheat to upgrade settlements to cities
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each potential build (cities give best return)
- Target 2-3 cities before extensive road building, unless going for longest road
- Avoid accumulating 7+ resources before dice rolls
- Never make trades that directly help opponents score immediate points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Avoid placing the robber where it equally hurts all players - be strategic
- Don't place the robber on resources you're deficient in - this reduces trading options
- Consider the timing of knight cards - save them for critical moments

PATH TO VICTORY PLANNING:
- Primary Win Path: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 10 VP
- Alternative Win Path: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + victory point cards (4 VP) = 10 VP
- Always track your potential hidden victory points vs. visible points
- If you have development cards giving you hidden points, focus on resource gathering
- When you're close to 10 points, calculate whether to reveal victory points immediately
- Keep track of your opponent's visible points AND potential hidden points
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads only when they lead to valuable settlement locations
- Prioritize settlements that increase your resource diversity or production probability
- Secure key ports that complement your resource production
- Block opponents' critical expansion paths
- Calculate whether longest road (2 VP) is worth the resource investment
- For each settlement expansion, evaluate whether the resources gained justify the cost

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Is there a faster path to 10 victory points?
2. Are development cards a more efficient way to get victory points right now?
3. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
4. Will this action help or hinder your opponent's strategy?
5. Do you have enough resources to execute your plan for the next few turns?

Board Understanding Guide:

If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:\n   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>\n\nINITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:\n- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources\n- Aim for resource diversity: Between your two settlements, secure ALL five resources if possible\n- Prioritize ore and wheat for city upgrades, then wood/brick for expansion\n- Place settlements at intersections of three hexes, maximizing resource production potential\n- Place your two initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to prevent being cut off\n- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, not toward the center\n- Evaluate each potential settlement location by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential\n- Avoid placing initial settlements near edges that would limit your expansion options\n\nBALANCED GROWTH STRATEGY:\n- Early-game: Build 1-2 additional settlements BEFORE upgrading to cities\n- Mid-game: Focus on upgrading settlements to cities and strategic development cards\n- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road depending on game state\n- Calculate resource efficiency for each build (VP gained per resources spent)\n- Monitor opponents' strategies and adjust accordingly - counter their paths to victory!\n- Don't over-commit to one strategy - remain flexible based on resource availability\n\nEXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:\n- Build roads with purpose - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location\n- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing\n- Create \"road blocks\" to cut off opponents' expansion when strategic\n- Connect to valuable ports that complement your resource production - a good port can change your strategy\n- Secure at least one 3:1 port early if specific 2:1 ports aren't available\n- Don't waste resources on roads that don't lead to immediate settlement spots\n- Focus expansion toward resource types you lack in your initial placements\n\nDEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:\n- Buy development cards strategically, not excessively\n- Early development cards: Use only if you lack immediate expansion opportunities\n- Mid-game development cards: Use to break resource monopolies or protect key hexes\n- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber\n- Use Year of Plenty to secure critical missing resources for immediate builds\n- Monopoly is most effective when played immediately after a high roll for that resource\n- Largest army (2 VP) requires 3+ knights - only pursue if you can maintain the lead\n- Victory point cards are most valuable when kept hidden until your winning turn\n\nRESOURCE MANAGEMENT:\n- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible to avoid robber losses\n- Don't trade resources that directly enable opponents to build settlements or cities\n- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency\n- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for more valuable builds\n- If resource-starved, focus on securing that resource through expansion or trades\n- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card\n\nROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:\n- Place the robber on the highest-producing hex of the player closest to winning\n- Prioritize hexes that produce resources you need but can't easily access\n- When stealing, target players with the resources you need most\n- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes when possible\n- Target hexes with multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact\n- Consider robber placement that creates favorable trade scenarios\n\nPATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY):\n1. Build 3-4 total settlements in strong positions \n2. Upgrade 2-3 settlements to cities (4-6 VP total)\n3. Secure longest road (2 VP) OR largest army (2 VP)\n4. Reach 10 VP through a combination of settlements, cities, and special cards\n\nPATH TO VICTORY (ALTERNATIVE):\n1. Focus heavily on ore/wheat production\n2. Build 2 cities (4 VP) and maintain 2 settlements (2 VP)\n3. Buy strategic development cards for hidden VPs and knights\n4. Win with combination of cities, settlements, and largest army\n\nBEFORE MAKING A DECISION:\n1. Analyze the board state, including all players' visible points and potential hidden points\n2. Consider whether your move helps your victory path or hinders opponents\n3. Calculate the most resource-efficient build that advances your position\n4. Check if you need to protect resources from the robber or other players\n5. Balance immediate gains against long-term strategic position\n\nBoard Understanding Guide:\n- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers\n- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile\n- \ud83d\udd0d marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex\n- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section\n- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy\n- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)",

    "prompt_used": "You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.\n\nRules:\n1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions\n2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points\n3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \\boxed{5}\n4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number\n5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:\n   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>\n\nINITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:\n- Target hexes with HIGH probability numbers (6,8,5,9) - prioritize these above all else\n- Go for resource DIVERSITY: secure ALL five resources between your two settlements\n- Focus on ORE and WHEAT for city upgrades (numbers 5-9 preferred)\n- Evaluate each potential settlement by its TOTAL PIP COUNT (sum of probability dots)\n- Place your initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options\n- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center\n- Avoid placing both settlements near the same resources - diversify your income!\n- Always consider 3:1 ports if your initial placement gives you limited access to certain resources\n- Place roads in directions that block opponents' expansion routes\n\nRESOURCE MANAGEMENT & CITY BUILDING PRIORITY:\n- FIRST PRIORITY: Build 1-2 additional settlements early to secure critical resources you lack\n- SECOND PRIORITY: Upgrade to cities as quickly as possible to double resource production\n- THIRD PRIORITY: Build roads only when they lead directly to valuable settlement locations\n- Early game (1-5 turns): Secure key settlements at high-value locations\n- Mid-game (6-15 turns): Focus heavily on upgrading to cities (2-3 cities should be your target)\n- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road\n- When short on a key resource, use 2:1 ports if available before using 3:1 or 4:1 ports\n- NEVER trade away ore or wheat to other players unless you're getting ore or wheat in return\n- If you have excess of a resource, use ports rather than trading with opponents\n\nDEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:\n- Buy development cards primarily when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore\n- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber OR to reach Largest Army (3+ knights)\n- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city or settlement build\n- Use Monopoly cards after high-probability dice rolls to collect maximum resources\n- Keep track of how many VP cards you've drawn (5 in the deck total)\n- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn\n- When development cards are your path to victory, aim for: 3 cities (6 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 victory cards (2 VP)\n- Consider buying development cards when you have limited build options (blocked roads, etc.)\n\nOPTIMAL EXPANSION PATH:\n- Build roads with PURPOSE - every road should lead to a viable settlement location\n- Identify and secure \"bottleneck\" positions that cut off opponents' expansion\n- Expand toward resources you LACK from initial placement - seek balance\n- When choosing between multiple settlement spots, prioritize:\n  1. High-probability production (total pip count)\n  2. Access to resources you currently lack\n  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, securing future expansion)\n  4. Proximity to useful ports\n- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing\n- Longest road (2 VP) requires strategic planning - only pursue if you already have 4+ roads built\n\nROBBER STRATEGY:\n- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning\n- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily\n- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build\n- When someone has 8+ points, ALWAYS target them with the robber regardless of other factors\n- If you're being targeted by the robber, consider using knight cards immediately to protect production\n\nTURN-BY-TURN PLANNING:\n1. Start each turn by assessing your current VP and opponents' VPs (both visible and potential hidden points)\n2. Identify your build priority for this turn: settlement, city, road, or development card?\n3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for your priority build\n4. If you can't build your priority item, determine if trading or buying a development card is better\n5. Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card or trade for needed resources\n6. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly\n\nWINNING PATHS:\n1. CITY-FOCUSED PATH: 3-4 cities (6-8 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 9-11 VP\n2. BALANCED PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 VP card = 10 VP\n3. DEVELOPMENT PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP\n\nNEVER SAY NO TO FREE VPs:\n- Always account for the 2 VP from longest road and largest army in your plans\n- These special cards are EASY to lose if you're not defending them\n- Invest in roads/knights to maintain your lead if these VPs are part of your strategy\n- Be alert for opponents trying to steal these bonus points\n\nBoard Understanding Guide:\n- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers\n- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile\n- \ud83d\udd0d marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex\n- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section\n- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy\n- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)",

What is the most efficient starting strategy for Settlers of Catan?
There are a number of strategies to pursue. I'm going to outline a few ideas to consider when forming your starting strategy (not taking into account which placement order you get):
Number diversity strategy [...] Given there is a limit of 7 cards before you are at risk of losing half your cards, it can be advantageous to have a steady stream of resources coming into your hand throughout the game. The best way to do this is to place your two first settlements on intersections with six different numbers total with ideally, the highest probability. If you can manage it, the best numbers to be on from the beginning would be 4,5,6,8,9,10 or some combination as close to that as possible. Ideally you would

Colonist Strategies: What are the Best Catan Starting Strategies?

Today we will be giving you pointers on the best starting placement strategies for Settlers of Catan that you can use in Colonist.

Colonist.io

1. Identify Your Goals

The first and most important Catan Strategy is knowing what you want to build. This will dictate which resources you should go after when you place your starting settlements. [...] Overall, placing your starting settlements wisely will give you a huge advantage in Settlers of Catan. But this is just one of the many strategies that can be employed in the game.

It is very hard to employ all these tactics in every game though, as the board is arranged randomly by the system and your neighbors choices restrict yours.

However, having a good grasp of starting positions and initial placements will help greatly in winning you your next Colonist game. [...] Also you don’t want to overproduce resources which can’t be used and then lose them to a 7 roll.

A much more ideal setup would be an 8-5-10 placement, with a secondary placement of 6-9-4.

These are all good numbers, and you’ve got a variety, meaning that you’re more likely to collect on any given roll.

It’s not always possible to get good number variety, and you will more often than not have a duplicate number, but it’s important to be as diverse as possible.

As a rule of thumb, during your first settlement placement, it’s usually best not to point your road toward the middle of the board. You will likely have no expansion spots since everyone will start toward the middle, rather than the coast.
Anytime your road is in a contestable direction, make sure you’re the one cutting someone off or are more likely to win the race — not the other way around. [...] Think of a Catan map as having 3 areas — the center, inner, and coastal rings. The “center” is all the spots around the middle hex, “inner” is the next one outward, and so on.
For starters, the coast never makes sense for your first placement as it will only have 2 hexes of production (3 for you to build more central) and it will inhibit your optionality to expand.

It's not at all unusual for the Developer to pick up 3 or 4 victory point cards and Largest Army, so they often only need to build a couple of settlements/cities to go out.

When you upgrade a settlement to a city, put the settlement (house) piece back in your supply and replace it with a city piece (church).
Cities produce twice as many resources as settlements. You acquire 2 resource cards for an adjacent terrain hex that produces resources.
Each city is worth 2 victory points. [...] You begin the game with 2 settlements and 2 roads. Each settlement is worth 1 victory point. You therefore start the game with 2 victory points! The first player to acquire 10 victory points on their turn wins the game.
To gain more victory points, you must build new roads and settlements and upgrade your settlements to cities. Each city is worth 2 victory points. To build or upgrade, you need to acquire resources. [...] C Cities You cannot build a city directly. You can only upgrade an existing settlement to a city. You pay the required resources, return the settlement to your supply, and replace the settlement with a city on the same intersection Y. Each city is worth 2 victory points. You receive double resource production (2 resource cards) from the adjacent terrain hexes whenever those numbers are rolled.

For an analysis of the possible reasons for the human supremacy over Smart-Settlers, we examined diﬀerent strategies for Settlers of Catan. There are two major “pure” winning strategies (in practice, human players often follow a com-bination of these two): the “ore-and-wheat” strategy and the “wood-and-clay” strategy. The former focuses on building cities and buying development cards, Knight cards (receiving +2 points for the largest army), and 1-point cards. The latter strategy focuses on [...] building settlements and an extensive road network (which may lead to receiving +2 points for the longest road). Our SmartSet-tlers agent seems to prefer the “ore-and-wheat” strategy, together with building as many roads as possible, but not building as many settlements as an expert human player would.

2. Maximize pips. Each number has pips on it indicating its probability (out of 36) of being rolled on a given throw of the dice. Place your settlements looking to maximize your probability of getting resource cards (if you're placing numbers according to the recommended spiral convention, the best you can do is 13 pips, e.g. 5/6/9). To maximize pips, you should generally avoid the desert and the coast. See the second photo, above.

You are still going to have to build some new settlements or you will have to collect 4 victory point cards which sounds pretty hard.

That's my typical strategy. City as fast as you can then dev, dev, and dev some more. The win is easy if you build one more settlement and make it a city, draw two victory points, and get largest army.
1 [...] Long story short, I believe you have to play the board. If I have equal opportunity to pursue a City+Dev strategy or an expansion (roads+settlements) strategy, I would likely go for the former. However, there often isn't a viable way to successfully pursue both strategies. For example, if your only ore option available to you is on an 11, you're most likely better off focusing your attention on new settlements (and getting a city/dev as available). I think it's important to read the board as [...] In the specific game you linked, ore/wheat/sheep are all bountiful, which brick and wood are more difficult to come by. Flip those probabilities and I think an expansion strategy is more powerful.

I always thought City+Development cards was the way to go. Expand just enough to make it viable. Getting into the longest road arms race is too risky and ends up not being worth the expense to the winner anyways.

Placement Strategy: Easily the most important part of the game
1] Ore-Wheat-Sheep game (City/ Development Card)
Often beginners value brick as the most valuable resource which is just not true. If you can, always take the best ore/food spot along with decent sheep.
Ideally you should target 7–8 points of ore, 6–7 points of food and 4–5 points of sheep with maybe a 2–3 points of wood/brick (you’ll need it just once:P). [...] This strategy heavily relies on doubling your production quickly by converting your initial settlements into cities.
Development card is the cheapest thing to buy in terms of resources used. This is the most superior strategy because - [...] City Machine/Production: Your initial settlements are arguably the best spots (that you could get) and multiplying production on these is always superior than moving to a new settlement. And remember once your high producing ore tile is doubled, making more cities would be a lot simpler.

    new_text: You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist determined to WIN through the optimal "ore-wheat strategy". Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the MOST EFFECTIVE action to defeat the AlphaBetaPlayer opponent.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRUCIAL):
- HIGHEST PRIORITY: Target the BEST ORE and WHEAT hexes with high probability numbers (6, 8, 5, 9)
- Place settlements on intersections with MAXIMUM "PIP COUNT" (probability dots on the number tokens)
- Initial settlements should be on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Aim for RESOURCE DIVERSITY between your two settlements (try to cover all 5 resources)
- Place on at least ONE good ORE hex and ONE good WHEAT hex between your two settlements
- Never place both settlements on the SAME RESOURCE - diversify your income!
- Initial roads should point toward valuable expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Evaluate settlements by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placements that will be blocked or trapped by opponents
- Plan ahead to maximize the value of your FIRST TWO cities (initial settlements)

DOMINANT CITY-FOCUSED STRATEGY:
- EARLY GAME (1-5 turns): Build ONE additional settlement to secure critical resources you lack
- MID GAME (6-15 turns): UPGRADE TO CITIES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE - this is your primary goal!
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- Aim for 2+ CITIES by mid-game (doubles resource production at key locations)
- ONE CITY PRODUCING DOUBLES YOUR INCOME - prioritize upgrading over new settlements
- Buy development cards when excess sheep/wheat/ore are available
- Only build roads to reach essential new settlement spots
- Be willing to trade away brick/wood/sheep to get ore/wheat for cities
- Calculate city ROI - upgrading early yields more resources over the game's duration

WINNING PATH:
1. Primary Goal: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army/longest road (2 VP) = 10 VP
2. Alternative: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP
3. Track potential hidden VP (development cards) - hide your true score until you can win
4. Focus on quality over quantity - cities > settlements for resource production

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore (especially sheep)
- Save knights to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city build
- Use Monopoly after high-probability rolls (target ore or wheat)
- Knights also help secure Largest Army (2 VP) - need 3+ knights played
- Keep track of VP cards drawn (max 5 in the deck)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn

EXPANSION PRIORITIES:
- Build settlements ONLY when they provide critical missing resources
- When choosing between multiple settlement locations, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (maximum pip count)
  2. Access to resources you lack (especially ore/wheat)
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, access to ports)
- Build roads WITH PURPOSE - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win before committing resources
- Consider port access if you're lacking specific resources

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for cities
- If resource-starved, expand to secure that resource rather than trading at poor rates
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, consider a development card

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with resources you need for your next city build
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes
- Target hexes that affect multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact

TURN-BY-TURN THINKING:
1. Assess your current VP and opponents' VP (both visible and hidden)
2. Identify your build priority: CITIES FIRST, then settlements only for critical resources
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for city upgrades
4. If you can't build your priority item, trading or buying a development card may be better than roads
5. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)================================= Tool Message =================================

current_prompt.txt updated successfully================================== Ai Message ==================================

I've significantly redesigned the prompt to create a more effective Catan player, focusing on addressing the key weaknesses I identified. Here are the major improvements I've made:

1. **Clear Strategic Focus**: I've made the "ore-wheat strategy" (city development) the central approach, which research shows is more effective against algorithmic players like AlphaBetaPlayer.

2. **Improved Initial Placement Strategy**:
   - Added emphasis on maximum "pip count" (probability dots) for settlements
   - Specified the need to place settlements on opposite sides of the board
   - Emphasized securing at least one good ore hex and one good wheat hex
   - Added warning against placing both settlements on the same resource

3. **Prioritized City Development**:
   - Created a clear early-mid game timeline (1-5 turns vs 6-15 turns)
   - Explicitly prioritized city upgrades over new settlements
   - Added reasoning about ROI of early city development
   - Emphasized that "ONE CITY PRODUCING DOUBLES YOUR INCOME"

4. **Smarter Resource Management**:
   - Added a firm rule to never trade away ore or wheat except for other ore or wheat
   - Encouraged trading away brick/wood/sheep to get the critical ore/wheat
   - Prioritized development cards when excess sheep/wheat/ore are available

5. **More Focused Expansion Strategy**:
   - Limited settlement building to only when they provide critical missing resources
   - Created a clear priority list for evaluating settlement locations
   - Emphasized that roads should be built with purpose, not just for expansion

6. **Clearer Path to Victory**:
   - Specified two concrete paths to 10 victory points
   - Added tracking of hidden VPs (development cards)
   - Emphasized quality (cities) over quantity (settlements)

This revised prompt should help our player make better early-game decisions, focus on the critical city-development strategy, and more effectively compete against the AlphaBetaPlayer's approach. The player should now be more focused on securing and utilizing ore and wheat resources to quickly build cities and gain a production advantage.Evolve Counter: 0

If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:\n   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>\n\nINITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:\n- Target hexes with HIGH probability numbers (6,8,5,9) - prioritize these above all else\n- Go for resource DIVERSITY: secure ALL five resources between your two settlements\n- Focus on ORE and WHEAT for city upgrades (numbers 5-9 preferred)\n- Evaluate each potential settlement by its TOTAL PIP COUNT (sum of probability dots)\n- Place your initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options\n- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center\n- Avoid placing both settlements near the same resources - diversify your income!\n- Always consider 3:1 ports if your initial placement gives you limited access to certain resources\n- Place roads in directions that block opponents' expansion routes\n\nRESOURCE MANAGEMENT & CITY BUILDING PRIORITY:\n- FIRST PRIORITY: Build 1-2 additional settlements early to secure critical resources you lack\n- SECOND PRIORITY: Upgrade to cities as quickly as possible to double resource production\n- THIRD PRIORITY: Build roads only when they lead directly to valuable settlement locations\n- Early game (1-5 turns): Secure key settlements at high-value locations\n- Mid-game (6-15 turns): Focus heavily on upgrading to cities (2-3 cities should be your target)\n- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road\n- When short on a key resource, use 2:1 ports if available before using 3:1 or 4:1 ports\n- NEVER trade away ore or wheat to other players unless you're getting ore or wheat in return\n- If you have excess of a resource, use ports rather than trading with opponents\n\nDEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:\n- Buy development cards primarily when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore\n- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber OR to reach Largest Army (3+ knights)\n- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city or settlement build\n- Use Monopoly cards after high-probability dice rolls to collect maximum resources\n- Keep track of how many VP cards you've drawn (5 in the deck total)\n- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn\n- When development cards are your path to victory, aim for: 3 cities (6 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 victory cards (2 VP)\n- Consider buying development cards when you have limited build options (blocked roads, etc.)\n\nOPTIMAL EXPANSION PATH:\n- Build roads with PURPOSE - every road should lead to a viable settlement location\n- Identify and secure \"bottleneck\" positions that cut off opponents' expansion\n- Expand toward resources you LACK from initial placement - seek balance\n- When choosing between multiple settlement spots, prioritize:\n  1. High-probability production (total pip count)\n  2. Access to resources you currently lack\n  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, securing future expansion)\n  4. Proximity to useful ports\n- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing\n- Longest road (2 VP) requires strategic planning - only pursue if you already have 4+ roads built\n\nROBBER STRATEGY:\n- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning\n- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily\n- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build\n- When someone has 8+ points, ALWAYS target them with the robber regardless of other factors\n- If you're being targeted by the robber, consider using knight cards immediately to protect production\n\nTURN-BY-TURN PLANNING:\n1. Start each turn by assessing your current VP and opponents' VPs (both visible and potential hidden points)\n2. Identify your build priority for this turn: settlement, city, road, or development card?\n3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for your priority build\n4. If you can't build your priority item, determine if trading or buying a development card is better\n5. Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card or trade for needed resources\n6. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly\n\nWINNING PATHS:\n1. CITY-FOCUSED PATH: 3-4 cities (6-8 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 9-11 VP\n2. BALANCED PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) + 1 VP card = 10 VP\n3. DEVELOPMENT PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP\n\nNEVER SAY NO TO FREE VPs:\n- Always account for the 2 VP from longest road and largest army in your plans\n- These special cards are EASY to lose if you're not defending them\n- Invest in roads/knights to maintain your lead if these VPs are part of your strategy\n- Be alert for opponents trying to steal these bonus points\n\nBoard Understanding Guide:\n- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers\n- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile\n- \ud83d\udd0d marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex\n- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section\n- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy\n- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)",

Primary Goal: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army/longest road (2 VP) = 10 VP\n2. Alternative: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP\n3.

High-probability production (maximum pip count)\n  2. Access to resources you lack (especially ore/wheat)\n  3.

You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist with expert development card planning. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Focus heavily on ore and wheat hexes for your initial settlements
- Place settlements on intersections of complementary resources (ore/wheat or wood/brick)
- Between your two settlements, secure at least one good source of each critical resource: ore, wheat, and sheep
- If you must sacrifice a resource, make it brick (unless a brick-port is available)
- Place initial roads toward valuable future expansion areas or resource-rich areas
- Consider ports that match resources you expect to produce in abundance (especially sheep)
- Avoid placing settlements that will be trapped with no expansion opportunities

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY (PRIMARY PATH TO VICTORY):
- Buy development cards whenever you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Development cards provide hidden victory points and tactical advantages
- Use knights strategically to protect your high-producing hexes from the robber
- Save knight cards for when your high-production hexes are blocked by the robber
- Time monopoly cards for when opponents likely have accumulated resources you need
- Use Year of Plenty cards to complete crucial builds when you're short specific resources
- Aggressively pursue largest army (2 VP) if you've already played 2 or more knights
- Aim to secure 3-4 victory point cards throughout the game for a surprise win
- Keep your victory points hidden until you can win in a single turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Early-game: Secure minimal expansion to reach critical resource spots or ports
- Mid-game: Focus heavily on ore and wheat to upgrade settlements to cities
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each potential build (cities give best return)
- Target 2-3 cities before extensive road building, unless going for longest road
- Avoid accumulating 7+ resources before dice rolls
- Never make trades that directly help opponents score immediate points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Avoid placing the robber where it equally hurts all players - be strategic
- Don't place the robber on resources you're deficient in - this reduces trading options
- Consider the timing of knight cards - save them for critical moments

PATH TO VICTORY PLANNING:
- Primary Win Path: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 10 VP
- Alternative Win Path: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + victory point cards (4 VP) = 10 VP
- Always track your potential hidden victory points vs. visible points
- If you have development cards giving you hidden points, focus on resource gathering
- When you're close to 10 points, calculate whether to reveal victory points immediately
- Keep track of your opponent's visible points AND potential hidden points
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads only when they lead to valuable settlement locations
- Prioritize settlements that increase your resource diversity or production probability
- Secure key ports that complement your resource production
- Block opponents' critical expansion paths
- Calculate whether longest road (2 VP) is worth the resource investment
- For each settlement expansion, evaluate whether the resources gained justify the cost

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Is there a faster path to 10 victory points?
2. Are development cards a more efficient way to get victory points right now?
3. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
4. Will this action help or hinder your opponent's strategy?
5. Do you have enough resources to execute your plan for the next few turns?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)================================== Ai Message ==================================

If you play against the Catan AI (I only have experience with the iOS app, but I suspect it is similar on other platforms) on the hardest level, games often finish with the development cards sold out. If this never happens in your games, you're probably playing a relatively friendly style of game and no one is playing Developer. Try it!

Step 13: Midgame

Your overall strategy will dictate what your goals are, but there are some more general things you can be looking to do: [...] - try to avoid trading down to just a few cards with the bank and being stuck unable to build. Chances are, you're doing so for a resource you're finding hard to get and therefore other players will know they can disproportionately hurt you with the robber if they steal it.

- preserve juicy settlement locations with judicious road placement. Lock up that port that's critical to your strategy early. Nothing more infuriating than having an opponent beat you to it. [...] - the Commander is an ore whore and the best way to stop them is denying them early cities by blocking those tiles and refusing to trade them what they crave.

- encroach on the Developer and strangle their productivity. Try not to trade them ore/wheat/sheep - if you let them buy a card every turn, they're going to win.

Additionally, since some of these tactics are a bit cold-blooded (doing whatever it takes to win), don’t expect everything included herein to keep your competition happy — user discretion is advised. Even though Catan is just a game and you should be able to do what’s best to win, people do take moves personally. Sometimes keeping people happy at the expense of short-term wins builds goodwill that could pay off down the line.

Anyways, let’s get started…

1. Know your competition

2. Bluffing [...] Here are some examples:

3. Cut people off, but don’t let it happen to you

Cut people off

Don’t get cut off

4. Avoid being the clear leader

5. Diversify your resources and number production

6. How to play your development cards

7. Robbers can decide games

Here are some pointers:

8. Always speak up

9. Think about win-scenarios

10. The person with the most points isn’t always winning

11. Yes, 11’s and 3’s roll

12. Table presence

13. Card tracking

The second resource-based strategy is the “Ore / Wheat” Strategy. This strategy focuses on building cities and buying development cards, and lends itself towards getting the largest army card. By building cities as early as possible you can increase your resource gathering, with the added bonus that your first cities will probably be on your original settlements which should be in prime locations on the board. While you can technically win with only your first two cities, the largest army, and [...] Rather than attempting to collect every resource, it’s generally more effective to focus on only a few resources. The two main ways to do this are the “Wood / Brick” strategy, and the “Ore / Wheat” strategy. [...] To really drive this point home, suppose you want to collect ore. You can actually get 25% more ore by building on a wheat tile with a “6” and trading 4-to-1 with the bank than you could by building directly on an ore tile with a 2! If you had a port, or were trading with other players, then you could do even better.

Unsurprisingly, placing your initial two settlements on tiles with many dots (high probabilities) increases your chance of winning. The average number of starting dots was 20. I don’t have the data to support this opinion but I believe that diversifying your resources at the expense of one or two dots is worth it. This is especially true for a resource like wheat which is needed to buy settlements, cities and development cards.
Here’s another way to visualize the data. [...] Placing second in the four-player game sample resulted in the most wins.
The average game had 64 rolls (sd = 13). That’s 16 turns each. Balance patience and making each turn count.
Starting the game with settlements on tiles with more dots increases your chance of winning. Duh.
You need 4 or five distinct resources to start the game. Wheat is king. Sheep probably help. Ditch lumber or clay if needed. [...] Starting Position

In this relatively small dataset of 50 four-player games, placing second resulted in the best chance of winning. It would be interesting to see if this result holds up with a larger sample size or for three-player games.

The best way to do this is to place your two first settlements on intersections with six different numbers total with ideally, the highest probability.

Thing Two: Catan is won by having ten points.  Those first two Settlements you placed before the game really started?  They’re worth one point each. That means Catan is really only about scoring eight Victory Points. Eight.  Make each point you score — and each point you prevent your opponents from scoring — count.
Be adaptable in your game plan and smart about each one of those points and, like me, you should find your chances of winning improving with each game.
TagsBoard Game Strategy Guides [...] When looking for intersections to place your first Settlements, pay less attention to the type of resource and more attention to the number of dots on the hex tiles that make up the intersections.  The type of resource matters less than the frequency of obtaining them. After all, resources can be traded to the bank at 4:1 or at Ports for an even better return (see below). [...] While the introductory game comes with a recommended board layout, later games are played on a randomized hex tile layout.  Take a close look at these random layouts at the start of the game. Are there two of the same resource next to one another?  Is at least one of the numbered chits on those tiles reasonably high? Consider placing a Settlement in the most advantageous intersection of those tiles, then build roads and additional Settlements around them to block your opponents from doing the

[{'type': 'text', 'text': "Based on my analysis of the game results, performance history, and research on winning Catan strategies, I can see several key issues with our current player:\n\n1. **Initial placement**: The player isn't optimizing for high-probability numbers and resource diversity\n2. **City development**: Despite focusing on the development card strategy, the player is not building enough cities (only averaging 1.6)\n3. **Road building**: The player is almost never building settlements beyond the initial ones (only 0.8 avg additional settlements)\n4. **Resource management**: Too many 4:1 trades happening, wasting resources\n5. **Expansion strategy**: Not effectively prioritizing settlement locations for resource diversity\n\nNow I'll create an improved prompt that addresses these issues:"}, {'type': 'tool_use', 'name': 'write_prompt', 'input': {'new_text': 'You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist with a SUPERIOR "Ore-Wheat-Cities" fast victory strategy.

    new_text: You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist with a SUPERIOR "Ore-Wheat-Cities" fast victory strategy. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to CONSISTENTLY DEFEAT the AlphaBetaPlayer opponent.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (MOST CRITICAL DECISION):
- TARGET NUMBERS: Prioritize settlements on 6, 8, 5, and 9 - HIGHEST PIP COUNT WINS
- RESOURCE DIVERSITY: Secure ALL five resources across your two settlements
- ORE-WHEAT FOCUS: Place at least one settlement on a strong ore hex and one on a strong wheat hex
- MAXIMIZE PROBABILITY: Place on intersections of THREE hexes to maximize resource production
- AVOID SAME RESOURCES: Never place both settlements on the same resource type
- PORTS MATTER: Consider 2:1 ports (ore/wheat) or 3:1 ports as second settlement placement
- EXPANSION PLANNING: Place settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board for future growth
- ROADS DIRECTION: Point initial roads toward valuable future expansion spots, NEVER toward center
- NUMBER DIVERSITY: Try to have 5-6 DIFFERENT numbers across your two settlements 
- CRITICAL ANALYSIS: Before confirming placement, verify access to all resources and expansion paths

EARLY-GAME STRATEGY (FIRST 8 TURNS):
- BUILD 1 ADDITIONAL SETTLEMENT ASAP to secure a missing critical resource
- Target this third settlement at a location with ore or wheat that you lack
- After third settlement, FOCUS EXCLUSIVELY ON UPGRADING TO CITIES
- Calculate the resource ROI - cities provide DOUBLE resources for the rest of the game!
- Only build roads that lead DIRECTLY to valuable settlement locations
- Use development cards strategically when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat unless you're receiving ore or wheat in return

MID-GAME STRATEGY (TURNS 9-15):
- CITY-FOCUSED PATH: Upgrade ALL settlements to cities as quickly as possible
- MAXIMUM PRODUCTION: Each city produces DOUBLE resources - prioritize over new settlements
- DEVELOPMENT CARDS: Buy when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore, especially after cities
- LARGEST ARMY FOCUS: Play knights strategically to reach 3+ for largest army (2 VP)
- PORTS UTILIZATION: Use 2:1 ports when available, prefer 3:1 over 4:1 trading
- BLOCKING: Consider roads that cut off opponent's expansion if minimal resource cost
- RESOURCE CALCULATION: Always calculate exact resources needed for next 1-2 builds

LATE-GAME STRATEGY (TURN 16+):
- WIN CONDITION CALCULATION: Constantly track your path to 10 VP
- HIDDEN POINTS: Purchase development cards to secure hidden VP cards
- VICTORY TIMING: Plan to reveal VP cards only when they secure your win
- OPPONENT MONITORING: Block opponent approaching 8+ visible points
- ROBBER TARGETING: Always place robber on highest-value hex of player closest to winning
- CRITICAL BUILDS: Focus only on builds that directly contribute to reaching 10 VP

DEVELOPMENT CARD MASTERY:
- BUY DEVELOPMENT CARDS when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- KNIGHT TIMING: Use knights to protect your high-value hexes from robber
- LARGEST ARMY: Aggressively pursue if you've already played 2+ knights (worth 2 VP)
- MONOPOLY STRATEGY: Play after a high probability roll for that resource (target ore/wheat)
- YEAR OF PLENTY: Use to get exact resources needed for a city upgrade
- ROAD BUILDING: Save for securing critical settlement locations or longest road
- VP CARD SECRECY: Keep your victory point cards hidden until winning turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- CITIES FIRST: Target 2-3 cities as early as possible (ore-wheat strategy)
- RESOURCE RATIO: Focus on 70% ore-wheat, 30% other resources
- HAND MANAGEMENT: Keep your hand below 7 cards to avoid robber losses
- PORT PRIORITY: Use 2:1 ports first, then 3:1, and 4:1 as last resort
- AVOID BAD TRADES: Never trade resources that directly help opponents build
- EVERY ACTION COUNTS: Always do something productive each turn

WINNING PATH (10 VP):
1. PRIMARY STRATEGY: 3 cities (6 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 1 VP card = 10 VP
2. ALTERNATIVE PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP
3. TRACK ALL POINTS: Visible points (settlements/cities) + potential hidden points (development cards)

TURN-BY-TURN PLANNING:
1. Assess your current VP and opponents' VP (both visible and potential hidden)
2. Identify your build priority: CITIES FIRST, then strategic settlements or development cards
3. Calculate the most efficient path to required resources for your next build
4. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly
5. Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy development cards or trade strategically

CRITICAL DECISION FRAMEWORK:
1. Will this move get me closer to 10 VP faster than other options?
2. Is upgrading to a city better than building a new settlement right now?
3. Should I save resources for a more valuable build next turn?
4. Will this move block my opponent's path to victory?
5. Is this the most efficient use of my limited resources?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)================================= Tool Message =================================

Based on my analysis of the game results, performance history, and strategic research, I've made significant improvements to the prompt for the PromptRefiningLLMPlayer_C.

Here are the key improvements I've implemented:

1. **Enhanced Initial Placement Strategy**:
   - Added specific emphasis on targeting high-probability numbers (6, 8, 5, 9)
   - Stressed the importance of placing on intersections with three hexes
   - Required resource diversity but with ore-wheat focus
   - Added directive to place settlements on opposite sides of the board
   - Incorporated the concept of number diversity across settlements

2. **Structured Phase-Based Strategy**:
   - Clearly defined early, mid, and late game strategies
   - Emphasized building ONE additional settlement early before focusing on cities
   - Prioritized city upgrades over additional settlements after early game

3. **Improved Resource Management**:
   - Highlighted ore-wheat strategy as the primary path to victory
   - Specified ideal resource ratio (70% ore-wheat, 30% other resources)
   - Added more specific port trading guidance to avoid wasteful 4:1 trades
   - Emphasized hand size management to avoid robber losses

4. **Development Card Mastery**:
   - Added more specific guidance on when and how to use development cards
   - Emphasized largest army as a key victory point source
   - Provided clearer direction on knight card timing
   - Better guidance on VP card secrecy

5. **Clear Victory Path**:
   - Provided concrete paths to 10 VP with specific builds
   - Emphasized the ore-wheat-city strategy as the primary path
   - Added better tracking of visible vs. hidden points

The revised prompt is more focused on winning against the AlphaBetaPlayer through:
- Better initial placement (the most critical decision)
- Focus on cities over settlements (better resource production)
- Strategic development card usage (especially for largest army)
- Clear decision framework for evaluating moves

These changes should help our player make better decisions at each stage of the game, particularly in the critical early game placements and the transition to cities, which our analysis showed were major weaknesses in the current performance.Evolve Counter: -1
